<sentence id="s0">
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">INTRODUCTION 
 The "Paramount Centre" is a complex situated at 108 Bourke Street, Melbourne which opened in 1997 (the "Paramount Centre").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It comprises a number of levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At the Bourke Street level, there are retail shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">At the lower ground level, there is a supermarket and a food court (the "Food Court").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Above street level, are office suites and some 200 apartments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There is also a carpark under the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Paramount Centre is owned by Dukemaster Pty Ltd (ACN 050 275 226) ("Dukemaster"), the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Second Respondent, Patricia Suk-King Wong ("Ms Wong"), commenced employment with Dukemaster in 1997 as an accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In 2000, she was appointed Finance and Operations Manager of Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In 2003, she was appointed General Manager of the Paramount Centre, a position she still retains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") alleges contraventions of ss 51AC , 52 and 53 (e) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA") by Dukemaster in relation to certain tenancies in the Food Court of the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In general terms, the ACCC contends that Dukemaster (through Ms Wong) engaged in false, misleading, deceptive and unconscionable conduct in fixing or seeking to fix increases in rent payable by four tenants on the extension of the terms of their leases in the Food Court in circumstances where, inter alia, the rental increases sought by Dukemaster were excessive and significantly greater than the market rental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The ACCC also seeks relief against Ms Wong under s 75B of the TPA in relation to her involvement in the alleged contraventions by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">There are four tenancies in issue: Shop 3 leased by Keum Mi Shin ("Mrs Shin") trading as "Korean Lunch Box", Shops 1 and 2 leased by Australian Gomax Group Pty Ltd ("Gomax") trading as "Boxcar Caf&eacute;", Shop 4 leased by Ricky Hee Hua Tan ("Mr Tan") and Deolinda Lai ("Mrs Lai") trading as "East on Paramount" and Shop 8 leased by Hong Mei ("Mr Mei") trading as "Baiso Japanese Caf&eacute;".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To the extent that the leasing history of the each tenancy was not in dispute, it is summarised in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The proceedings are, in fact, four separate claims by the ACCC that the Respondents contravened the TPA in respect of each of the tenancies in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Each case requires separate analysis of conduct undertaken over the better part of a decade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The evidence was heavily contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Unfortunately, in many areas the evidence of both the ACCC and the Respondents was lacking, and the manner in which each party sought to rely upon the evidence they adduced was often not made clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">As a result, a far more extensive analysis of the evidence has been necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 There are two principal allegations --- contraventions of ss 52 (and 53 (e)) and 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The relevant principles were not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I will summarise each in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">(1) SECTION 52 OF THE TPA
 In relation to each tenancy in dispute, the conduct concerns statements (both oral and in writing) by the landlord (Dukemaster) to a tenant concerning lease terms including statements to the effect that a proposed rent for a shop (1) was "very reasonable" and (2) was below the "market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The parties' submissions approached the various issues of alleged contravention of s 52 of the TPA by Dukemaster by seeking to categorise the conduct as "statements of opinion" and, then, asking whether that "statement of opinion or belief" contained a representation that the opinion or belief was held by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In my view, resolution of each issue is not achieved by "categorising" the conduct or by reference to slogans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is necessary to identify the conduct complained of and then identify the proper approach to the conduct which is sought to be impugned: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87-90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The following principles are worth restating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A contravention of s 52(1) of the TPA is established by "conduct" which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The "conduct", in the circumstances, must lead, or be capable of leading, a person into error ( Hannaford (trading as Torrens Valley Orchards) v Australian Farmlink Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1591 at [252] citing Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 at 200; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 198) and the error or misconception must result from "conduct" of the corporation and not from other circumstances for which the corporation is not responsible: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">"Conduct" is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a "real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent": Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Section 52(1) is concerned with the effect or likely effect of "conduct" upon the minds of that person or those persons in relation to whom the question of whether the "conduct" is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive falls to be tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The test is objective and the Court must determine the question for itself: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 52 is not designed for the benefit of persons who fail, in the circumstances of the case, to take reasonable care of their own interests: Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd v E G Reeves Pty Ltd [1987] FCA 332 ; (1987) 78 ALR 193 at 241.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Moreover, it would be wrong to select particular words or acts which although misleading in isolation do not have that character when viewed in context: Elders Trustee [1987] FCA 332 ; 78 ALR 193 at 241 citing Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">"Conduct" can, of course, include making a statement which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">By making a statement of past or present fact , a corporation's state of mind is irrelevant unless the statement involved the state of the corporation's mind: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Contravention of s 52(1) does not depend upon the corporation's intention or its belief concerning the accuracy of the statement of fact but upon whether the statement conveys a meaning which is false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">A false meaning will be conveyed if what is stated concerning the past or present fact is inaccurate but also if, although literally true, the statement conveys a meaning which is false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Precisely the same principles control the operation of s 52(1) to statements involving the state of mind of the maker when the statement was made (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">promises, predictions and opinions).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">A statement which involves the state of mind of the maker ordinarily conveys the meaning (expressly or impliedly) that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when the statement was made and, commonly, that there was a basis for that state of mind: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd 2 FCR 82, 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A statement of opinion will not be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive merely because it turns out to be incorrect, misinforms or is likely to do so: Elders Trustee [1987] FCA 332 ; 78 ALR 193 , 242 and Bateman v Slatyer (1987) 71 ALR 553, 559.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">An incorrect opinion does not of itself establish that the opinion was not held by the person who expressed it or that it lacked any or any adequate foundation: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">An expression of an opinion which is identifiable as an expression of opinion conveys no more than that the opinion is held and perhaps that there is a basis for the opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">If that is so, an expression of opinion however erroneous misrepresents nothing: Global Sportsman Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 , 88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">However, an opinion may convey that there is a basis for it, that it is honestly held and when it is expressed as the opinion of an expert, that it is honestly held upon rational grounds involving an application of the relevant expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">If the evidence shows that the opinion was not held or that it lacked any or any adequate foundation, particularly if the opinion was expressed as an expert, a statement of opinion may contravene s 52 of the TPA: Elders Trustee [1987] FCA 332 ; 78 ALR 193 , 242, proposition (4): see also Hannaford [2008] FCA 1591 at [253] and RAIA Insurance Brokers Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 ; Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 ; NC Seddon and MP Ellinghaus, Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th Australian Edition, 2008), [11.116].</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(2) SECTION 53(E) OF THE TPA
 Section 53(e) and its application to the facts in these proceedings was not separately addressed by the ACCC or the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Relevantly, s 53(e) headed "False or misleading representations" provides: 
A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, in connexion with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in connexion with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services:
 
 
...
 
 
(e) make a false or misleading representation with respect to the price of goods or services;
 
 In ACCC v Gary Peer and Associates Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 404 ; (2005) 142 FCR 506 at [57] and [58], Sundberg J described the two elements in s 53(e) as follows: 
[57] A representation may be false within the meaning of s 53(e) if it is contrary to fact, irrespective of the knowledge of the representor: Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 29 FLR 212 at 217.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">[58] A "price" of goods or services in s 53(e) does not have to be a precise figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There can be a "price" even though it is stated to be within a range of a particular figure or that otherwise an element of approximation is involved: Trade Practices Commission v Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 631 ; (1991) 104 ALR 601 at 612.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It was submitted that the relevant issue is whether the advertisements falsely or misleadingly represented the price, namely the monetary consideration for the sale of the Property: Australian and Consumer Commission v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1996) 36 IPR 75 at 82-83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In relation to the second element of s 53(e) in its application to the present matters --- price --- it requires no further explanation than that the proposed rental was a "price" of goods or services: see ACCC v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1996) 36 IPR 75 ; Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Video Retailers Association Ltd (2005) 214 ALR 554.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In relation to the first element, s 53(e) requires the representation to be "false or misleading" as opposed to "misleading or deceptive" (in s 52).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I was not taken to, and I have not found, any authority which attributes a meaningful difference to this dichotomy for the purposes of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">(For a discussion of the phrase "false and misleading" under a different Act, see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Hadkiss (2007) 160 FCR 151).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Indeed, the vast majority of cases that discuss an alleged breach of s 53(e) couple it with a breach of s 52 and deal with the "false or misleading" and "misleading or deceptive" aspect of the conduct mutatis mutandis: see Foxtel Management Pty Ltd (2005) 214 ALR 554 at [94]; ACCC v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 ; (2001) ATPR 41-840 ; ACCC v Harbin Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1792 ; ACCC v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 199 at [42] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">That is not altogether surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The purpose of s 53 has been described as being to "[support] s 52 by enumerating specific types of conduct which, if engaged in by a corporation in trade or commerce in connection with the promotion or supply of goods or services, [would] give rise to a breach of the Act": see R Miller, Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act (30 th ed, 2009), [1.53.5].</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Accordingly, and in the absence of any submission to the contrary, I see no reason why the application of s 53(e) should not fall to be determined upon the conclusions I reach in relation to s 52 --- namely that the representations were misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">(3) SECTION 51AC OF THE TPA
 Section 51AC of the TPA entitled "Unconscionable conduct in business transactions", so far as is relevant, is in the following terms: 
(1) A corporation must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:
 
 
(a) the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (other than a listed public company); or 
 
 
...
 
 
engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">...
 
 
(3) Without in any way limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a corporation ... (the supplier ) has contravened subsection (1) ... in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person or a corporation (the business consumer ), the court may have regard to: 
 
 
(a) the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the business consumer; and 
 
 
...
 
 
(c) whether the business consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services; and 
 
 
(d) whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer or a person acting on behalf of the business consumer by the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier in relation to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services; and 
 
 
...
 
 
(j) the extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of any contract for supply of the goods or services with the business consumer; and 
 
 
(k) the extent to which the supplier and the business consumer acted in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Section 51AC has been the subject of limited judicial consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Most recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 Foster J summarised the relevant propositions in the following terms: Section 51AC was introduced into Part IV of the TPA by the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Act 1998 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It came into effect on 1 July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Sections 51AA and 51AB were already in the TPA as at 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) set out statutory guidance as to the factors to which the Court can and cannot have regard for the purposes of determining whether a corporation has contravened either subsection (1) or (2) of s 51AC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The list of factors set out in those sub-paragraphs to which the Court is permitted to have regard is not exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
...
 
 There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions:
 
(a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">(b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable, which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable , is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment : per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Limited (2000) 22 ATPR 41-474 (p 40,578) at [22] (p 40,585).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] - [185] (pp 487-488) and by Sundberg J in ACCC v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [30] (p 264); and
 
 
(c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved .</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent .</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act : per Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [185] (p 488).</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The above statements of principle provide useful guidance as to the content of the concept of unconscionability or unconscionable when used in s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Of necessity, the authorities to which I have referred do not prescribe a precise definition which would be able to be applied to every set of circumstances presented to the Court for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The application of the meaning accorded to the concept will always be a matter of judgment in every case and will depend upon a careful consideration of the circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It must also be remembered that, as is the case with other sections of the TPA contained in Parts IVA , IVB and V, s 51AC establishes a norm of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Failure to observe that norm has consequences provided elsewhere in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">(See the judgment of the High Court in Master Education Services Pty Ltd v Ketchell [2008] HCA 38 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1322 at [28] to [32] (pp 1329-1330) and the cases cited in those paragraphs).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
(Emphasis in bold added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">(4) SECTION 75B OF THE TPA AND MS WONG
 Mention must also be made of s 75B of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It provides that if a person is "in any way ... knowingly concerned in, or party to" (inter alia) a contravention of s 52 of the TPA by another, that person will be liable for that contravention under ss 82 and 87 of the TPA: Hannaford [2008] FCA 1591 at [256] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The ACCC contends that the Second Respondent, Ms Wong, was a person who was knowingly concerned in, or party to the contraventions of ss 52, 53(e) and 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I accept this contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Ms Wong commenced employment with Dukemaster in 1997 as an accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In 2000, she was appointed Finance and Operations Manager of Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In 2003, she was appointed General Manager of the Paramount Centre, a position she still retains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">She was the face of, and point of contact for, Dukemaster with the tenants the subject of the present matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">As the following analysis will demonstrate, Ms Wong was a person who was directly and indirectly knowingly concerned in, and party to, the contraventions by Dukemaster of ss 52, 53(e) and 51AC of the TPA referred to below by reason of her: 
(1) conducting on behalf of Dukemaster all of the dealings with each of Mrs Shin, Mr Tan, Mrs Lai, Mr Mei and Gomax (the tenants); 
 
(2) being aware of the oral and written statements from which the representations referred to below arose; 
 
(3) being aware of the facts and circumstances by reason of which the representations were misleading and deceptive and/or false; and
 
(4) knowing the facts and circumstances which constitute the conduct which was, in the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">C. SHOP 3 --- KOREAN LUNCH BOX
(1) FACTS 
 (A) 1997- EARLY 2003
 Mrs Shin was born in Korea.</sentence>

<sentence id="s103">Mrs Shin had a solicitor acting for her in relation to this lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">(B) MARCH 2003 --- PURCHASE OF BUSINESS CONDUCTED AT SHOP 3 
 In March 2003, Mrs Shin engaged in negotiations to purchase a business known as "Bann Thai", a Thai take away food outlet, operated at Shop 3 in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Shop 3 occupied an area of 48m 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Mr Yao, a solicitor, acted for Mrs Shin in relation to the purchase of "Bann Thai".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Mrs Shin also had a solicitor, Mr George Bourozikas, acting for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">(Mrs Shin's evidence was that Mr Bourozikas last acted for her in 2007).</sentence>

<sentence id="s110">Mrs Shin and her daughter converse in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">At that time, Ms Zu was approximately 18 years of age, having been born in January 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">On 13 March 2003, Mrs Shin signed a conditional purchase agreement to purchase "Bann Thai" for $70,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The price paid was the asking price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mrs Shin did not recall who translated the contract for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The contract provided that settlement was to take place on 28 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">A formal contract of sale of business was executed by the vendor on 2 April 2003 with settlement on 4 April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The purchaser was named as Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The contract did not contain a restraint of trade clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">At the time of purchase, the lease for Shop 3 (which commenced on 1 February 2001) was to expire on 31 January 2004 (the "First Shop 3 Lease").</sentence>

<sentence id="s122">There was no annual rental review during the first term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Clause 5.16(A) provided for Mrs Shin to proceed to rental determination at the end of the first term ("the Rental Determination") as follows: 
(a) The Lessor may by notice in writing to the Lessee fix the rent (subject as herein provided) at an amount which in the opinion of the Lessor would be the current market rent for the premises as at the commencement of the Review Period ("the Review Date").</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(b) If the Lessee considers the rent fixed by the Lessor pursuant to Clause 5.16(A)(a) hereof not to be the current market rent for the premises the Lessee may by notice in writing to the Lessor within twenty-one (21) days after being notified in writing of such rent require the rent to be determined by a valuer and upon receipt of such written notice the Lessor shall request the President for the time being of the Australian Institute of Valuers Incorporated (or its successor) to appoint a valuer who shall be a practising Estate Agent and a member of the Australian Institute of Valuers Incorporated (or its successor) and shall have not less than five (5) years experience in the determination of rentals in the locality of the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The fees of the valuer shall be borne equally between the Lessor and Lessee.</sentence>

<sentence id="s129">(C) APRIL 2003-NOVEMBER 2003 INCLUDING 27 NOVEMBER 2003 LETTER
 On 22 April 2003, Dukemaster's solicitors (Lim Whalen &amp; Co) sent a letter to Mrs Shin advising her that they acted for Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The letter stated that: 
[Dukemaster] under the Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 is required to notify you that your option to renew the Lease cannot be exercised after 31/10/03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Please find enclosed such a Notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Could you please acknowledge receipt by signing where indicated and return the Notice to us as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">An extra copy of the Notice is enclosed for your retention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The letter and the notice were in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Mrs Shin acknowledged receipt of the letter by signing the enclosed notice in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Her acknowledgement is dated 1 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">On 16 September 2003, Mrs Shin notified Dukemaster of her intention to exercise the option to renew the lease for the further three years provided in the First Shop 3 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Ms Zu typed the letter for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Mrs Shin did not seek legal advice before sending the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">On 30 September 2003, a letter was hand delivered to Mrs Shin (from Dukemaster's solicitors) acknowledging receipt of the notice exercising the option and advising Mrs Shin that the "Renewed Lease documents" would be forwarded to her in due course .</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">That in fact did not occur: see [31] and [32] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Two months later, on 27 November 2003, Dukemaster delivered a letter to Mrs Shin in the following terms ("the 27 November 2003 letter"): 
Thank you for your notification through our solicitors, Lim Whalen &amp; Co, in relation to the above shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">We refer to your exercise of option for a further term of 3 years and advise the rent for the above shop will be $48,000.00 plus GST commencing 01/02/2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">
 
 
Please advise by 5.00pm on 8 th December, 2003 whether you accept this offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">We believe the new rent is very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">If you object to our proposed rent, the matter will proceed to valuation in accordance with clause 5.16 of the lease contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">If you have any queries in relation to this matter, please contact this office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Mrs Shin's daughter, Ms Zu, translated the 27 November 2003 letter for her mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mrs Shin did not consider objecting to the proposed rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Not long after receiving the letter, Mrs Shin instructed her daughter to accept the offer in the 27 November 2003 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Her daughter wrote on the letter "accepted on behalf of Mrs Shin" and then signed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mrs Shin did not sign it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Mrs Shin did not think to compare the rent proposed in the letter with other rents in similar buildings in the city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Ms Wong, who does not speak Korean, gave evidence that after the 27 November 2003 letter was delivered to Mrs Shin she spoke in English to Mrs Shin, that Mrs Shin asked her for a further term of three years and that Ms Wong responded saying that "it should be okay".</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I reject Ms Wong's evidence in this respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">None of this conversation was put to Mrs Shin in cross examination and it does not explain how the other lease terms came to be included in the subsequent lease documents or on what basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">(D) FEBRUARY 2004 --- SECOND SHOP LEASE EXECUTED
 In early February 2004, Dukemaster delivered lease documents to Mrs Shin at her shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The documents were not a renewal of the First Shop 3 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The lease documents provided for a new and different lease ("the Second Shop 3 Lease").</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In particular, the lease terms differed from the First Shop 3 Lease in critical respects --- annual rental reviews by reference to CPI increases (cl 5.16(B)) and a different time period in which the tenant was able to exercise the option to renew the lease (cl 5.8): see also Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Mrs Shin's daughter explained the rent and the lease period to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">On about 9 February 2004, Mrs Shin signed the Second Shop 3 Lease to commence on 1 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Mrs Shin's evidence was that she understood the lease to be for three years and that she did not know that it included a further term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">She further stated that she did not know how the rent increased or how it should have been calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Neither Mrs Shin nor her daughter was cross examined on these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">(E) OCTOBER 2006 - JANUARY 2007 INCLUDING 3 JANUARY 2007 LETTER AND JANUARY 2007 CONVERSATION
 The Second Shop 3 Lease was due to expire on 31 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The option to renew had to be exercised no earlier than 12 months and no later than six months prior to the expiration of the lease: cl 5.8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Just before 27 October 2006 (and not in accordance with cl 5.8), Mrs Shin's daughter drafted a letter for her mother to send to "Dukesmaster" (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The letter dated 27 October 2006 read: 
Dear whom it may concern (sic)
 
 
 RE: Option to Renew LEASE: Korean Lunch Box Shop 3, 108 Bourke Street, Melbourne 
 
 
I, Keum mi Shin of above mentioned premise, would like to renew my lease for a further period of 3 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Please kindly let me know if you require anything regarding the renew of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Yours faithfully,
 
Keum mi SHIN
 
 
The letter was signed by Mrs Shin in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">3 January 2007 Letter
 Mrs Shin heard nothing further from Dukemaster until 3 January 2007 when Mr Robert Sant ("Mr Sant"), a Dukemaster employee, hand delivered to Shop 3 a letter addressed to Mrs Shin ("the 3 January 2007 letter").</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The 3 January 2007 letter was in English in the following terms:

(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The form and content of this letter (subject to different particulars) was the same as a letter Dukemaster sent to East on Paramount on 5 March 2007 (see [160] below) and to Gomax in relation to Boxcar Caf&eacute; on 3 January 2007 (see [247] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Ms Zu (Mrs Shin's daughter) read the 3 January 2007 letter to her mother in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">By this time, Ms Zu was about 22 years of age and was completing a Bachelor of Accounting and Banking and Finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Mrs Shin started to cry and asked her daughter to read the letter to her again to make sure that the rent was $90,000 and that she had to respond by 10 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Her daughter read the letter to her mother again at least two more times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Mrs Shin said to her daughter that the rent was nearly double what she was currently paying and the increase would mean that she could not afford to pay the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Mrs Shin told her daughter that she was scared that if she did not accept the offer in the letter by 10 January, she would be kicked out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Mrs Shin asked her daughter to telephone Ms Wong and try to lower the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Ms Zu gave evidence that she read that part of the 3 January 2007 letter which mentioned objecting to the increased rent and a "valuation in accordance with clause 5.16(A)" (see [35] above) but she did not understand it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">She said that she was not aware of the option to go to a rental valuation or that her mother could object and had difficulty explaining this to her mother as she did not understand what it meant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">January 2007 Conversation
 Ms Zu's evidence was that she telephoned Dukemaster's offices from her mother's shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Her mother was also at the shop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Ms Zu's evidence was that she said to Ms Wong that they had received the letter (the 3 January 2007 letter), the rent increase was "too high" or "too expensive" and that they "[could] not really afford [the rent]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Ms Zu's evidence was that she asked "can you please lower the rent" and then said "we understand you increase a little bit but this is too high".</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">According to Ms Zu, Ms Wong's response was that "The rent is reasonable", "I can't give you a lower rent because you are asking me to be unfair to the other tenants" and the rent was "cheap against what other tenants are paying".</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The ACCC complains about the content of this conversation ("the January 2007 conversation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Mrs Shin's evidence was that Ms Zu told her Ms Wong had said that the rent that had been set for her was not any more expensive than other tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Although Ms Wong denied that there was any expression of concern about the rent, she ultimately admitted that Ms Zu asked her if the rent could be lower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">However, Ms Wong said that this did not amount to expressing any concern about the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">On any view, the request to lower the rent was an expression of concern on Mrs Shin's behalf that the rent was too high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">I accept that Ms Zu told Ms Wong that "they [could] not really afford [the] rent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Counsel for the Respondents did not seek to cross examine Ms Zu about the contents of the January 2007 conversation except to ascertain that it took place somewhere between 3 and 9 January 2007 and that during the conversation she stopped from time to time to translate for her mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The Respondents' position on this issue was not consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The Respondents' amended points of defence alleged the January 2007 conversation took place on or about 9 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Ms Wong's sworn evidence was that the conversation took place close to 3 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Ms Zu could not recall precisely when she telephoned Ms Wong but thought it might have been a day or two after receipt of the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">In any event, the January 2007 conversation took place between receipt of the 3 January 2007 letter and 9 January 2007, at most a period of six days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Counsel for the Respondents put to Ms Zu that it was during the January 2007 conversation that Ms Zu asked for a further term of three years and, in response to that request, Ms Wong said "yes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">However, both Ms Zu and her mother denied that Mrs Shin told her daughter to make sure in her discussions with Ms Wong to get an additional term on the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The thrust of the Respondent's cross examination of Mrs Shin was that because Mrs Shin was seeking to sell the business, it was her that had sought the additional term on the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">I address this issue below: see [48] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">In relation to the January 2007 conversation, Ms Zu's oral evidence did not correspond precisely with the summary given in the ACCC's case summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The Respondents sought to make much of the discrepancies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Ms Zu's oral evidence, in substance, was consistent with the ACCC summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Moreover, it would not be consistent with human nature if Ms Zu's evidence had been entirely consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Such variation as there was is of no account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">It is the variation that was to be expected in giving an account of events that occurred some years earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Mrs Shin gave evidence that before signing the 3 January 2007 letter she and her husband tried unsuccessfully to contact their solicitor (but found that his office was closed for the Christmas holidays and did not reopen until 12 or 13 January, after the deadline in the 3 January letter) and then asked some of the other shop owners to recommend a solicitor but they told her that all solicitors' offices would be closed over the holidays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">By that time, Mrs Shin had only a few days to respond to the 3 January letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Her uncontroverted evidence was that she was extremely panicky because she knew she would have to make her decision without advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Mrs Shin signed the 3 January letter and dated it 9 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Her signature was in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I accept Mrs Shin's evidence that she did so because she feared that Dukemaster would take over her business if she did not answer the 3 January 2007 letter by the due date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Ms Zu delivered the letter to Dukemaster's office after her mother signed it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Mrs Shin was asked in cross examination why she did not go back to her solicitors after he returned from holidays to discuss whether she should sign the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Her response was that she had already signed the document --- the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Third Shop 3 Lease
 On 16 January 2007, Lim Whalen &amp; Co arranged for a letter to be hand delivered to Mrs Shin at the shop enclosing a copy of a lease in duplicate, a disclosure statement and a retail leases information brochure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The last paragraph of the letter read: 
If you have a solicitor acting for you in this matter we suggest that you take the enclosed documents to your solicitor as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">If you execute and return the Lease to us without advice from a solicitor our client will treat your execution and return of the Lease as acknowledgement by you that you are satisfied with all the terms and conditions of the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Contrary to the contents of the 3 January 2007 letter, the lease that was sent was not a renewal of the Second Shop 3 Lease but a new lease ("the Third Shop 3 Lease").</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Ms Zu gave evidence that she translated the letter for her mother, checked the rent and noticed it was $90,000 plus GST per year with CPI increases each year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Again Mrs Shin was asked in cross examination why she did not contact her solicitor after she received the 16 January letter and before she signed the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Her response, consistent with her actions from 3 January, was: 
I already signed --- I already signed my signature in that letter and I thought it --- everything was included in that and the rest I thought it was just a formality on the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">On 25 January 2007, the Third Shop 3 Lease was executed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The lease was for a term of three years with a further term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">During January 2007, Mrs Shin wished to sell the Korean Lunch Box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It was put to Mrs Shin in cross examination that the additional term of three years was far more important to her than the amount of rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Mrs Shin did not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Her evidence was that the rent would have been far more important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Counsel for Dukemaster also put to Mrs Shin that the additional term was sought by or on her behalf because a prospective purchaser wanted a lease that had the additional term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Mrs Shin's response was that she did not understand the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Correspondence in late February between the potential purchaser's solicitors and Dukemaster was tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">One of the letters was addressed to Mr Bourozikas and was intended to facilitate Dukemaster's consent to the transfer of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The proposed purchase did not proceed and negotiations ceased in February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">I accept that an additional term on the lease was an issue more likely than not raised by Ms Zu during her January 2007 conversation with Ms Wong and explains why Dukemaster provided the Third Shop 3 Lease and not a renewal of the Second Shop 3 Lease as had been initially requested by Mrs Shin: see [41] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">However, the manner in which Dukemaster behaved in this context is an issue to which I will need to return to later in these reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">(F) MARCH 2007-FEBRUARY 2008 
 By 19 March 2007, Mrs Shin had retained Jholl Lawyers &amp; Consultants to act for her in relation to the Korean Lunch Box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">At that time, her daughter was overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">On 19 March 2007, Jholl Lawyers &amp; Consultants sent a letter to Ms Wong entitled "Re: Shop 3, Food Court Little Bourke Street Level, 108 Bourke Street, Melbourne, 3000" which read, in part, that: 
I act for [Mrs Shin] in relation to the above lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">My client instructs that she executed a new lease in relation to the above premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">My client disputes the new rental on grounds that such a huge increase is not reasonable and by any measure rather excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">My client signed the lease and documents forwarded to her under pressure of being evacuated (sic) from the lease premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">As you are aware she has limited knowledge of English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">She has referred the matter or dispute to the Small Business Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">I am instructed to act for her and am instructed to resolve this dispute amicably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The Lessee considers the rental fixed by the Landlord not to be the current rental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">I therefore recommend that the issue of rent be referred to a valuer within 21 days of receipt of this advise in accordance with clause 5.16(A) of the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In the interim pending determination of the rent, my client will pay the old rent of $4,622.70.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">I enclose my client's cheque for the said sum of $4,622.70 herewith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Kindly acknowledge receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">My client is happy to discuss this matter in conference with you at any time and should you so desire kindly contact me to arrange the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Should you wish to discuss any matter arising herein, please do not hesitate to contact Mr Gobind Jholl ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">It is in everybody's interest to settle this dispute as quickly as possible and seek your cooperation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">In fact, by then, Mrs Shin had completed an application to refer the dispute to the Small Business Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The application to the Small Business Commissioner is dated 7 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">It was signed by Mrs Shin in Korean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The application was completed in English by her son in her presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The application was supported by a statutory declaration made by Mrs Shin in the following terms: 
Dear to whom may I concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">At the start of this of year our shop received a letter from our landlord informing us about a rise in our annual rent fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">This figure was very extreme and unexpected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The reason for this was because of the rent fee from $50,429 going up to 90,000 and had to make a clear decision between 3/1/07 to 9/1/07.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">We clearly didn't have time to think it over with ourselves and our lawyer because our lawyer was away on a holiday because of the time of year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">I signed the form that the landlord gave because I was afraid of being eliminated from the shop if I didn't agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">We were clearly not given a decent amount of time to think about this matter which felt very rushed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The rent rise is too much of an increase to handle, it was unexpected and mostly unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">With this new rent fee figures, making profits at Paramount Centre is very hard and slim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Lastly this price is unreasonable for a shop which only sells to lunchtime customers and too expensive for a place where not a lot of customers come to eat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">I very much hope that you understand this complaint and I truthfully believe these reasons I am saying is right and fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Making application to the Small Business Commissioner was not Mrs Shin's idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">It was first raised at a meeting of the tenants of the Food Court at the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">This issue is further addressed below in the context of the allegation that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable: see Section C(3) below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Some time after 21 March 2007, Mrs Shin's lawyers provided her with a copy of the letter in reply from Dukemaster's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">One of Mrs Shin's regular customers translated the letter for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The letter stated that Dukemaster denied putting any pressure on her to sign the lease and that the 19 March 2007 letter was the first time that Mrs Shin had complained that the rent was excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">That was inaccurate: see [38] and [39] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The letter also rejected the proposal that Mrs Shin continue to pay the old rent and said that if the balance of the rent for March was not paid within seven days, Dukemaster could re-enter the premises and terminate the lease without further notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The next day, Mrs Shin paid the balance of the March rent because she was afraid that Dukemaster would terminate her lease as it had threatened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Tough times continued for Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">She was having trouble paying the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Eventually she sold the Korean Lunch Box to Imexinda Amite Pty Ltd on 30 November 2007 for $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The purchaser took over on 1 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Before turning to consider the application of the relevant legal principles to these facts, I should say something about two matters --- the tenants' committee and the evidence given by Mrs Shin and Ms Zu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">On 7 May 2007, Mrs Shin signed a statement that had been typed for her by a son of one of the other tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">That statement made a number of allegations, some of which have been addressed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Other allegations appear to be incorrect, were not the subject of evidence or are, on their face, exaggerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The document was typed by the son of Irene Watts (but it is otherwise unclear who assisted Mrs Shin in drafting the letter), was never sent to anyone and was created sometime after March 2007 and most likely closer to the date it was apparently signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">What the Respondents sought to achieve by tendering this document was far from clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Two possibilities exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">First, although this does not seem to be the primary basis upon which the document was tendered by the Respondents, it may be said that it goes to demonstrate that Mrs Shin had access to assistance when required in the form of the Paramount Centre Tenant's Committee (the "Committee").</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The nature and relevance of this Committee is worth some explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">The Committee was an undefined group of tenants who, from some time in late 2006 or early 2007 onwards, attempted in various ways to alter their perceived hardships in the Paramount Centre and "to make it better for tenants".</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">One of the most active members of the Committee was a Mr Sandro Vasta ("Mr Vasta") who was called by the Respondents to give evidence at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The various mechanisms used by the Committee to improve the lot of the tenants included seeking legal advice, writing to the Paramount Centre management about particular problems and agitating for publicity in the media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The Respondents submitted that the presence of this Committee was a factor to be weighed against the claim of unconscionable conduct due to the bargaining power provided by the Committee to the tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">That general contention is rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">The position of each tenant needs to be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Dealing with Mrs Shin, there was no evidence that the Committee played any, let alone a significant role, in the exchanges between the tenants of Shop 3 and the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Mrs Shin, at one point during re-examination, stated that it was possible that she showed the 3 January 2007 letter to Mr Vasta before it was signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">What was said in this conversation or its relevance was never explored by the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">By way of submission, Counsel for the Respondents alleged that by having access to the Committee, Mrs Shin had a greater capacity to access legal advice during the 7 day period following the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">I do not accept that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">First, the evidence of Mrs Shin stands on its own --- she did not gain access to legal advice and further, it would have been difficult to obtain access to legal advice during this period: see [43], [44] and [46] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Secondly, even assuming for a moment that the Committee provided some alternate ability for tenants to gain legal assistance (and the evidence did not demonstrate that such advice was ever 'on-call', freely accessible or of such a nature that it would have ameliorated the plight of Mrs Shin in that period), the Committee in early 2007 was in its nascent stages and it was never demonstrated that it could have provided at that point in time the sort of assistance alleged by the Respondents to be available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">As a result, the role of the Committee (and the 7 May 2007 statement, if used for the first purpose identified) may be put to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The second possibility in relation to the 7 May 2007 statement is that, given its alleged flaws, it goes to credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">This seemed to be the primary purpose of the document being tendered by the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The thrust of the Respondents' cross examination and the written submissions focused upon what the Respondents alleged were apparent falsehoods in the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Practically, there are evident difficulties in challenging Mrs Shin's credit on the basis of a document that was apparently drafted by another person, never sent to anyone, in a language Mrs Shin did not speak or read well and in circumstances where her understanding of its contents was only briefly explored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Secondly, and turning now more generally to the issue of credit of Mrs Shin and Ms Zu, during the course of final submissions (and contrary to the position adopted during the hearing of the evidence), the Respondents' Counsel did not submit that I should find that they were not telling the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Although the Respondents submitted that I should have real doubts about the reliability of what was said in the witness box by all of the ACCC's lay witnesses, the Respondents stated in closing address that it was not their "purpose to attack the credit of these people in relation to everything that they've said, but it's quite clear that there's been a lot of reconstruction of these events, and that their actual memories ... are very dubious".</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Yet, as the description of the facts records, much of the conduct said to contravene the TPA was of two kinds --- documentary (about which there was no dispute) and oral conversations (the content of which the Respondents did not seek to challenge in cross examination).</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">It is that conduct to which I now turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">(2) CONDUCT MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE OR LIKELY TO MISLEAD OR DECEIVE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">
 The ACCC had three complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Each complaint dealt with separate representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Although some of the representations contain common elements, each must be considered separately because each is said to constitute a separate contravention of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">(A) 27 NOVEMBER 2003 LETTER
 First, the ACCC contended that the contents of the 27 November 2003 letter (see [28] above) were misleading and deceptive because, by the 27 November 2003 letter, Dukemaster represented to Mrs Shin that: it believed that the proposed rent for the renewal of Shop 3 of $48,000 from 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2005 ("the $48,000 Rent") was very reasonable and below the market value ("the First Shin Representation"); it had a reasonable basis for believing that the $48,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Second Shin Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $48,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 from 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2005 and that if it had done so, the market value was approximately $43,000 plus GST per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">In its terms, the 27 November 2003 letter made the First and Second Shin Representations: see [28] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">From Mrs Shin's perspective, it was apparent that Dukemaster and Ms Wong (as Dukemaster's representative) knew what other tenants in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre were paying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Mrs Shin did not know what other tenants were paying and Mrs Shin was not in a position to know whether or not Dukemaster had sought valuation advice or information about comparable rents and Mrs Shin was not in a position to obtain information about comparable rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">That was a process which she neither had the means or ability to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The 27 November 2003 letter was inaccurate when it said that notification by Mrs Shin was to Lim Whalen &amp; Co.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">It was not - it was direct to Dukemaster: see [27] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, that is not the subject of complaint by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The ACCC's complaint concerns the balance of the 27 November 2003 letter - the representations that the $48,000 Rent was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" and that Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for believing that the $48,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Those issues are interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Ms Wong did not explain, except in the most general terms, how the figure of $48,000 plus GST for Shop 3 referred to in the 27 November 2003 letter was selected as the rent to be sought for Shop 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">At its highest, her evidence was that the figure was based on what she knew "from the rent paid by tenants in the area surrounding the ... Centre" and "on the rents paid by other tenants in the ... Centre and in particular by Shop 4, which was of a similar size to Shop 3 and was paying a rent of $55,000".</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Ms Wong's explanation why, in this case, she fixed upon a rental of $48,000, should not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">She did not identify "the area surrounding the ... Centre", she did not identify the information she had about the rent paid by tenants in that area or give any explanation of any process of comparison with such other premises that she undertook.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">So, for example, she did not explain which premises she treated as comparable, why they were comparable or what rent the supposedly comparable premises were commanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">No documentary evidence was tendered recording any of these enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Having regard to the unsatisfactory nature of so much of Ms Wong's evidence, I can only conclude that her assertion that she had regard to rents paid by tenants in "the area surrounding the ... Centre" was an assertion that should not be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">As for her suggestion that she compared the rent she asked for Shop 3 with the rent payable for Shop 4, it will later be shown that the rent of $55,000 fixed for Shop 4 did not provide any basis for the general assertion about the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Of particular note (and this is discussed in detail below) is the fact that by the 16 March 2004 letter (see [151] below) the Respondents provided for an increase in the rent of Shop 4 to $72,000 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">If the reasoning of the Respondents was to be adopted, and it is assumed that Shop 3 and Shop 4 should be the subject of roughly equivalent rents, then either (a) the rent for Shop 3 as provided in the 27 November 2003 letter should, in fact, have been a great deal higher or (b) the rent in the 16 March 2004 letter should have been much lower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The fact that the two shops were the subject of rent proposals within the space of 4 months that differed by $24,000 per annum would indicate that they were not, in fact, of particular comparable value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">In their written submissions, the Respondents submitted that Dukemaster represented that the "proposed rents were consistent with market rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">" The statements made by Dukemaster were not that the various rentals imposed by it (including in relation to Shop 3) were "current" market rentals or "consistent with market rents".</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">What Dukemaster said in the 27 November 2003 letter was that the rent sought for Shop 3 was "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">It is unsurprising that an assertion not made by Dukemaster (and therefore not relied upon by the ACCC) was not put to any of the witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Taken as a whole, the evidence reveals no basis for Ms Wong or Dukemaster stating on 27 November 2003 that it held a belief that the rent for Shop 3 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 for the period 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2005 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 3 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In making the finding that Dukemaster did not demonstrate any basis for holding a belief that the rental for, in this case Shop 3, was "below the market value" or, for that matter, "consistent with market rents", I reject the evidence relied upon by the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Does such a finding however provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that each representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">If, as here, the evidence shows that the opinion expressed by Dukemaster lacked any or any adequate basis, the conduct contravenes s 52 of the TPA only if that conduct induces or is capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">If the rent referred to in the 27 November 2003 letter was in fact "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value", then it would not be shown that the conduct complained of by the ACCC could induce or would be capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">In relation to Shop 3 however, I consider that the conduct complained of is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because it is much more probable than not that the $48,000 Rent was not "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">That last finding requires further explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Market Rent Evidence
 The Respondents filed no expert evidence in relation to the market rent for any of the shops in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Instead, they ultimately sought to rely upon the rent paid by other tenants in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre and the expert evidence called by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">A schedule summarising the rents paid by the tenants of the shops in the Food Court for each of the years ended 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2007 (inclusive) is attached as Annexure C. Mr Sheehan, the valuer nominated by the Small Business Commissioner in June 2007, was called by the ACCC to provide expert evidence of the current market rent of the shops in issue in each of the relevant years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Mr Sheehan has been a qualified valuer since 1974.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">After describing each of the shops, summarising certain details of the leases for those shops and identifying particular features of both, Mr Sheehan expressed his opinion of the current market rent for each of the shops in the Food Court in issue in these proceedings for identified periods commencing on particular days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">A chart summarising his assessment of the current market rent of each of the shops is attached as Annexure C. The Respondents did not seek to challenge Mr Sheehan's expertise or experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Instead, the Respondents took the contents of Mr Sheehan's report and submitted that, based on his information (which they criticised in various ways), the rents for the shops in issue in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre were in fact market rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The Respondents' position appeared to be based on a series of charts handed to the Court during final submissions: see Annexure B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Not all of these charts were put to a witness and all were incomplete and inaccurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The charts appeared to be based on the premise that because Mr Sheehan had referred to rents charged in other centres which he described as commanding much larger rents than the rents charged in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre, that those other premises were somehow "comparable" with the shops in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">(That is not what Mr Sheehan said and it was a proposition not put to him).</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The charts produced by the Respondents' Counsel during final submissions (which included the charts at Annexure B), even to the extent they are accurate and complete, do not assist the resolution of the issues faced in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The question is not, as the charts were intended to demonstrate, whether rents in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre were on average lower than the rents commanded in other named foods courts (Target, Telstra etc).</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">The question is whether the market rent for the shops in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre was less than the rent asked by Dukemaster, being an amount that Dukemaster represented to be "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">What then was the evidence in relation to the market rent for the Korean Lunch Box?</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Mr Sheehan was asked to express an opinion on the current market rent of Shop 3 trading as Korean Lunch Box for the annual period commencing on 1 February 2004 ("the 2004 Report").</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Mr Sheehan's 2004 Report of the "current market rent" for Shop 3 for that period was "made pursuant to the provisions of the Lease and in particular cl 5.16(A) which relates to a market rental review".</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Mr Sheehan's 2004 Report was, in fact, prepared after his other report in relation to the market rent for Shop 3 in 2007 and the market rent for the other tenancies in issue in these proceedings (being "the 2008 Report").</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">After setting out his appointment, Mr Sheehan's 2004 Report dealt with cl 5.16(A) (see [18] above) and the phrase "current market rental value" in the following terms: 
[T]he assessment of the Current Market Rent as at the relevant date is made pursuant to the provisions of the Lease and in particular Clause 5.16(A) which relates to a market rental review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">As applicable in definition terms, the Australian Property Institute defines "Current Market Rental Value" as follows:
 
 
The current market rental value is defined as the estimated amount for which the premises should rent, as at the relevant date, between a willing Lessor and a willing Lessee in an arm's length transaction, wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion, and having regard to the usual market terms and conditions for leases of similar premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">In this matter, the Lease was created under the provisions of the prevailing Retail Tenancies Legislation being the Retail Leases Act 2003 ("the Act"), which came into effect on the 1 st May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Accordingly, the Act in section 37(2) makes the following provision for rent reviews based on current market rent:
 
 
 The current market rent is taken to be the rent obtainable at the time of the review in a free and open market between a willing landlord and willing tenant in an arm's length transaction having regard to these matters --- 
 
 
(a) the provisions of the lease;
 
 
(b) the rent that would reasonably be expected to be paid for the premises if they were unoccupied and offered for lease for the same, or a substantially similar, use to which the premises may be put under the lease;
 
 
(c) the landlord's outgoings to the extent to which the tenant is liable to contribute to those outgoings;
 
 
(d) rent concessions and other benefits offered to prospective tenants of unoccupied retail premises;
 
 
but the current market rent is not to take into account the value of goodwill created by the tenant's occupation or the value of the tenant's fixtures and fittings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Before leaving this aspect of the expert evidence of Mr Sheehan, it is necessary to address the Respondents' criticisms of Mr Sheehan on the basis that s 37(2) of the Retail Leases Act 2003 (Vic) ("the Retail Leases Act ") had no application because the leases in issue were not of a kind to which s 37(2) ordinarily applied and secondly, the purpose of Mr Sheehan's report was not consistent with the purpose of s 37(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">In the end, whether s 37(2) applied to the leases in issue may be put to one side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">First, Mr Sheehan gave uncontroverted evidence that the definition of current market rental in s 37(2) of the Retail Leases Act is complimentary to the Australian Property Institute ("API") definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">That is not surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The language of the two provisions is substantively identical --- rent payable between a willing landlord and a willing tenant in an arm's length transaction - the "arms' length" test in Australia since at least 1907: see Spencer v The Commonwealth (1907) 5 CLR 418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Secondly, even in the absence of that evidence, it is apparent having regard to the two definitions that any assessment of "current market rental value" under the API definition would require consideration of the matters specified in s 37(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Put another way, any valuation of "current market rental value" is likely to be defective if the matters listed in s 37(2) were not considered: see Explanatory Memorandum to Retail Leases Bill 2003 (Vic) ("current market rent refers to the rent that would be paid between a landlord and tenant having regard to factors that are set out in this section").</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">One additional aspect of Mr Sheehan's evidence was criticised by the Respondents in their closing submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The Respondents submitted that Mr Sheehan's evidence should be rejected because he referred to s 37(2) of the Retail Leases Act which "does not include goodwill, fixtures and fittings".</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Section 37(2) does exclude those items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">However, I cannot find and I was not taken to any authority or principle which supports the proposition that they should be taken into account in assessing current market rent under the API definition or when applying the test in Spencer's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Significantly, goodwill was an issue which the Respondents never put to Mr Sheehan, is contrary to the decision in WJ Barton Ltd v Long Acre Securities Ltd [1982] 1 All ER 465 at 467, 469 and 470 (affirmed by SA Service Stations Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd (1989) ATPR 40-949) and, as the ACCC submitted, contrary to the Respondents' contention that each of the shops in issue were "closely substitutable" or "completely substitutable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">It is necessary then to return to consider the balance of Mr Sheehan's 2004 Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It referred to his 2008 Report which described, in detail, the physical layout, location and amenities of the Paramount Centre and, in particular, the Food Court in that Centre (albeit as of 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Consistent with usual practice, photographs of the Food Court and plans of the Paramount Centre together with locality / zoning maps were included as annexures to the 2008 Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">After describing Shop 3 and the pertinent details of the lease for that shop in the 2004 Report, Mr Sheehan addressed the issue of outgoings and other rental and lease information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">In relation to outgoings, no actual figures were provided to Mr Sheehan for any year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">He had access only to the outgoings budget for the whole of the retail centre for the 2005/2006 financial year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Based on the budgeted figures, Mr Sheehan concluded that outgoings equated to approximately $194 per m 2 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Sheehan then referred again to his 2008 Report where he had summarised the other rental and lease information he was able to obtain, although not the body of rental information, its analysis or the recording of the physical data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Such an approach was consistent with the market rent tests outlined earlier: see [76] and [77] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">That summary recorded the name of the building, the number and areas of outlets in the food court in each building, whether the rent was gross or net of outgoings and the rental range per m 2 per annum for a stated period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">In seeking that rental information, Mr Sheehan stated there had been a "focus on dedicated food court premises" but identified a number of factors which distinguished some buildings from others including, but not limited to: whether the food court formed part of a retail centre with dedicated common area seating, an arcade with limited seating during trading hours or within the confines of each outlet or a food shop with street frontage; the emergence of "inside-outside" service outlets and the emergence of "laneway" style eateries; some precincts in the central business district ("CBD") support after hours and weekend trading while others do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Against that background, Mr Sheehan assessed the market rent for Shop 3 in the 2004 Report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The analysis incorporated, by direct reference, the matters detailed by Mr Sheehan in the 2008 Report which were, in his view, of general application to each of the tenancies in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">After referring to s 37(2) of the Retail Leases Act , Mr Sheehan proceeded to assess the market rental for Shop 3 for the period commencing on 1 February 2004 on a basis which included the following considerations: the tenant was committed to a gross rental (inclusive of Dukemaster's outgoings); Shop 3 comprised a "reasonably standard style food outlet" within a food court with a service counter and "back of house" area; the lease prescribed and restricted the composition of the tenant's menu, which was not unusual; the shop was available for lease on a vacant possession basis; no goodwill attributed to the tenant's use was applied; annual rental was assessed taking into account a range of food court premises within the CBD by way of comparative analysis and considered that that body of information could be applied "with adjustment noting such comparative elements as the extent of common area, nature of thoroughfare traffic, supporting retail complement, the level of services provided and the extent of peak period trading".</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Consistent with the approach described in [81(6)] above, Mr Sheehan described the CBD, in part, in the 2008 Report in the following terms: 
...</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">It is generally recognised that the CBD supports a good demand for quality retail space and has an abundance of food related outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">There has been a supply of new retail space in the prime retail precincts as a result of newer development projects or the redevelopment of former space.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">The outcome of the take-up of new space is that higher vacancy rates appear in less prominent locations and dated developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">In addition, there has been a continual growth of convenience type shopping along the public transport commuter pathways of the CBD, much of which caters for the 'take-away' food trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Referring specifically to food outlets, the diversity includes kiosk, food court, shop, hotel and restaurant configurations which draw custom from commuters, daily shoppers, office workers, students, service contractors, accommodation house and permanent residents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">It is well established that strong retail centres enhance the trading viability of food court outlets where in some situations major franchise operators have sought to expose their product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The QV Centre is an example which capitalises on a number of factors including its situation on Swanston Street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Other food court situations exist to capitalise on custom from the offices within the associated building and immediate surrounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">In terms of overall competition, newer food courts reflect current design elements that afford the customer comfort and ambience over other facilities which reflect a degree of obsolescence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Within the various CBD food courts, there is a variance as to the size of premises and whether customer seating is specific to the outlet, common to all outlets or just sited within an existing mall thoroughfare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">In the analysis and consideration of market data, the food courts as situated in the Telstra Building, the Midtown Plaza connecting to the Target Arcade and the Mid City Arcade were compared directly to the data pertaining to The Paramount Centre given their related location within the north eastern precinct of the CBD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">With the exception of the Telstra Building, these food courts were more of a mall or arcade type thoroughfare in a location closer to Swanston Street and its high pedestrian complement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The Telstra Building food court, like the Paramount food court, is a dedicated eatery with a differing component of supporting retail but relatively situated on one level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">To a degree, this is similar with the Collins Place food court and retail centre which has two highly visible levels and easy connecting access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">It is also similar to the Australia-on-Collins Centre with its retail shops that circle the lower level food court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Against that background, Mr Sheehan assessed the Paramount Centre in the 2008 Report in the following terms: 
As a market commentary, [1] the situation of The Paramount Centre is not known as a retail precinct with substantial so called 'ant trail' custom .</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Rather the Centre has endeavoured to create a retail precinct on a major scale as an integral part of the overall Paramount development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The level of overall occupancy, the variety of the trading mix and the strength of the respective traders has a direct bearing on the vibrancy of the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">[2] As an outcome of the Paramount Centre's occupancy complement in 2007 ... there are apparent limitations on the trading period available to the ... [Food Court].</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">By observation, lunch time appears to be the predominant trading period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">
 
 
...
 
 
From a dedicated food court perspective, the Paramount Centre is located in a precinct which includes three main hotels, a number of boutique hotels, managed serviced apartments and three live theatres, which have the potential to generate custom during periods when shows are running.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">In addition, The Paramount Centre has a number of substantial office buildings that surround including the newly developed building which forms part of the redevelopment of the former Southern Cross Hotel site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Further, the food court has the potential to draw benefit from its Chinatown situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">In creating The Paramount food court, there was an obvious intent to create a destination facility with its high density of food outlets, its supermarket, its street side restaurant and the basement entertainment venue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Whilst there has been some reconfiguration and the creation of additional food court outlets over time, it is apparent that the individual proprietors are unable to trade to the extent of the available hours of the Centre's operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">[3] The Paramount Centre differs to the contemporary design of the QV Centre which has a complement of some 37 food court and restaurant outlets supported by numerous retail shops, four superstores and multi access, multi level basement carpark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">
 
 
 [4] It is recognised that the Paramount Centre has had a degree of publicity regarding tenancy issues ... 
 
 
The subject premises range in lettable area from 33.53m 2 to 84.3m 2 , which is within an average range for food outlet space, comparable to a number of other outlets in buildings such as the Telstra food court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">It is recognised that a higher rental rate per square metre generally applies to smaller outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The balance in the situation of The Paramount food court is that [Dukemaster] is not only supplying a modern and attractive food court environment, but in some premises is also supplying chattels and fixtures ... 
 
 
(Emphasis and enumeration added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">In dealing with Shop 3 in his 2004 Report, Mr Sheehan's noted the previous rent for the shop for the period from 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2004 was $41,600 per annum excluding GST being the rent that had applied for the whole of the term of the previous three year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Shop 3 he described as "situated within the western section of the Little Bourke Street level" and, "[i]n comparison to other food service outlets within the food court ... [had] a smaller than average frontage of about 7.5m".</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">As the summary of his evidence records (see Annexure C), Mr Sheehan expressed the view that the market rent for Shop 3 for the annual period from 1 February 2004 was $43,000 (excluding GST), not $48,000 (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The rent charged by Dukemaster ($48,000 excluding GST) is more than 10% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($43,000 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the rent for Shop 3 for the annual period from 1 February 2004 of $48,000 (excluding GST) was "very reasonable" or "below the market value" (as the 27 November 2003 letter stated it to be), or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 3 for that period was greater than $48,000 Rent (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the First and Second Shin Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The $48,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "very reasonable" nor "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">(B) 3 JANUARY 2007 LETTER
 Secondly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 3 January 2007 letter (see [35] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by the 3 January 2007 letter, Dukemaster represented to Mrs Shin that: it believed that the proposed rent for the renewal of the Second Shop 3 Lease of $90,000 from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 ("the $90,000 Rent") was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Third Shin Representation"); and it had a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Fourth Shin Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was significantly less than $90,000 and was approximately $50,500 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Third and Fourth Shin Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">In its terms, the 3 January 2007 letter made the Third and Fourth Shin Representations: see [35] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">As was the position in 2003 and 2004, from Mrs Shin's perspective, it is apparent that unlike her, Dukemaster and Ms Wong (as Dukemaster's representative), certainly knew what other tenants in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre were paying, Mrs Shin was not in a position to know whether or not Dukemaster had sought valuation advice or information about comparable rents and Mrs Shin was not in a position to obtain information about comparable rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Third and Fourth Shin Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Taken as a whole, the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster stating in January 2007 that it held a belief that the rent for Shop 3 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" as at 3 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 3 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Ms Wong's evidence was unsatisfactory and I do not accept that on 3 January 2007 she had made any enquiries of the rents paid in comparable premises and, therefore, had not made any assessment of why premises were comparable or what rents comparable premises were commanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Those findings require further explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The evidence sought to be relied upon by Dukemaster concerned events which were said to have commenced in July / August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">On 22 August 2006, Ms Wong met with Mr Hii Eii Sing ("Mr Hii"), the Managing Director of Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">At that meeting, Ms Wong presented information about overall 'achievable' rental return of the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Ms Wong and Mr Hii discussed a range of possible rental figures for certain shops in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The next day, 23 August 2006, or some time shortly thereafter, the annual general meeting of Dukemaster was held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">The rents Ms Wong and Mr Hii had discussed the previous day were approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Dukemaster took no step to inform the tenants of the proposed increases in rents for months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">What took place before, during and after that 22 August 2006 meeting is important and requires further consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">As I have already indicated, I find that Ms Wong was less than a satisfactory witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">I reject critical aspects of Ms Wong's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">In important respects her evidence was inconsistent, contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses and highly improbable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The starting point is her first affidavit sworn on 26 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">I accept, as Ms Wong states in her first affidavit, that as early as July 2006 she knew that a number of leases in the Paramount Centre were due to expire in the next five to ten months and that Mr Hii was planning to fly to Australia to meet with her in August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Ms Wong then stated that she asked Mr Sant, a Dukemaster employee, to make enquiries as to what rent was being paid by tenants in the QV Shopping Centre in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, the Target Centre in Bourke Street, Melbourne and the Telstra Centre at 222 Exhibition Street, Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">According to Ms Wong, Mr Sant reported back to her several days later and provided her with the following information which she wrote down on scraps of paper she later threw out: in the QV Centre, shop 28-32 which was 65m 2 and sold bagels, paid an annual rental of $97,000 and shop 23-25 which was 96m 2 and occupied by Kentucky Fried Chicken, paid an annual rental of $170,000; in the Target Centre, Donut King paid an annual rental of $52,000 for a shop of 23m 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">It was this information that Ms Wong said she took with her to the meeting with Mr Hii on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">In the week following the meeting with Mr Hii, Ms Wong's evidence was that she made a handwritten note of the meeting which she dated 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">The file note, together with a transcript of the note, was tendered in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Ms Wong's evidence was that the transcript was accurate except that the second last line of the note omitted the reference to the shop number 71.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">The transcript was in the following form: 
Present: Mr. Hii and Pat Wong 22/8/06
 
 
(1) Presented tenancy schedule for p/e 31/7/06 for discussion
 
(2) Noted the following shops up for renewed (sic) of further terms or new lease in the next 5-10 months.</sentence>

<sentence id="s500">Ms Wong's stated in evidence she updated the file note "with the information provided to [her] by [Mr] Sant to ensure that a permanent record was kept" and that the marginal notes (being the notes which appear in the transcript under the heading "Notes on left hand corner") were added up to a year after the 22 August 2006 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">I accept that the marginal notes were a much later addition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">In my view, in addition to the marginal notes, the phrase "appears to be comparable to other enquiries at QV / Target" which I have italicised in the extract (see [92] above) was also a later addition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">I reject Ms Wong's evidence that at the meeting on 22 August 2006 she had the information recorded in the marginal notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">In fact, at one point in her evidence, Ms Wong conceded she did not obtain the shop numbers that appear in the marginal notes until some time in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Ms Wong's evidence in relation to where and when she obtained the information recorded in the marginal notes was not corroborated by the evidence from Mr Hii or Mr Sant and was inconsistent with a report Ms Wong prepared in June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Moreover, the form and substance of the note itself is not consistent with Ms Wong having the information in the marginal notes at the meeting on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Mr Hii's viva voce evidence on this issue was inconsistent with his sworn affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The paragraph of his affidavit concerning the information recorded in the marginal notes was identical in form and substance to the contents of Ms Wong's affidavit on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">It was as if the paragraph had been cut and pasted from one affidavit to the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">That conclusion is supported by the fact that during the course of his viva voce evidence, Mr Hii said he had no recollection of Ms Wong informing him of the details set out in the marginal notes (in particular the dimensions or shop number of the shops listed) at the meeting on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">That is not surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Although Ms Wong repeatedly said she believed she obtained the shop numbers from Mr Sant prior to the meeting in August 2006, his evidence was not only that he did not give the shop numbers to her at that time but that he did not know any of the numbers and that the shops did not have numbers on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">In relation to the size or areas of the shops referred to in the marginal notes, Mr Sant's evidence again contradicted Ms Wong's affidavit evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Mr Sant's evidence was that he did not give Ms Wong any information about the areas of the shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Finally, again contradicting Ms Wong's affidavit evidence, Mr Sant said that he did not provide Ms Wong with any information in 2006 about a bagel shop or Kentucky Fried Chicken at QV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Taken at its highest, Mr Sant's evidence was that in 2006 he had obtained the following information: in relation to the Zest Wraps food outlet in QV, that tenant was paying between $55,000 and $60,000 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">He had no information about area or the shop number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">in relation to Donut King food outlet in the Target Centre, that tenant was paying around $70,000 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Again, he had no other information about that tenancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Ms Wong also stated in her evidence that Mr Sant provided her with further information in 2007 which "reconfirmed" the information she had at the meeting on 22 August 2006 and which she included in the marginal notes on the file note one year later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">This evidence was also contradicted by Mr Sant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">His evidence was that Ms Wong did not ask him in 2007 to make enquiries at QV or at the Target Centre and that he did not give Ms Wong any information in 2007 about those centres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">The conclusion that in August 2006, or even June 2007, Ms Wong did not have the information in the marginal notes is also supported by emails between Ms Wong and Mr Tony Tai ("Mr Tai") of TT Global in late June 2007 and the contents of a submission Ms Wong prepared in June 2007 concerning the rent for a number of shops in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">On 20 June 2007, Ms Wong sent an email to Mr Tai entitled "Re Shop rent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The email stated: 
Just a quick email re shop Star Walk and another one at The Walk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">I would still like to include them on my submission as a back up --- to show that foodcourt outlets are more expensive than stand alone shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">Eg QV foodcourt --- Zest Wraps $50,000 pa for 25 sqm (No outgoings).</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Target Centre --- Donut King $52,000 pa for 23 sqm (No outgoings).</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Galleria Foodcourt up to $2200 per sqm plus $11/sq m outgoings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Can you advise re name of shop, sq m and annual rental and outgoings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Thanks for your help, Tony.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Mr Tai responded the next day in the following terms: 
Pat
 
 
Details for Star Walk Caf&eacute; is as follows:
 
 
SIZE = 91 M2
 
RENT = $100,000 (+GST) per annum gross
 
MARKETING LEVY = $2,000 (+GST) per annum gross
 
LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE = 2/1/2006
 
LEASE TERM = 5 + 5 Years
 
RENT REVIEWS = CPI annually, Market @ Option
 
 The information provided to Mr Tai did not include the details set out in the marginal notes --- details that Ms Wong apparently regarded as critical to the submission she was then drafting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Moreover, it is apparent that the response from Mr Tai did not appear to support her contention that "foodcourt outlets are more expensive than stand alone shops".</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">In fact, the information in Mr Tai's email of 21 June 2007 (see [99]) was included, in almost exactly the same terms, in Ms Wong's note allegedly dated 12 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">The '12 July 2006' note was the subject of cross examination and re-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">It seems highly unlikely that Ms Wong had the information on 12 July 2006 and her explanation of why she needed to reconfirm the information in 2007 should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">If, as Ms Wong asserted she had the precise information in 2006, why would she need to request that information again in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">None of the lease details would have changed --- the lease for the Star Walk Caf&eacute; commenced in January 2006, was for a term of 5 years with annual rent increases fixed at CPI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">During the course of re-examination, in an apparent attempt to explain away the fact that she did not need to reconfirm the information, Ms Wong said that she sought details of an "another tenancy" that was unspecified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">I reject that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The submission drafted by Ms Wong for Dukemaster is dated 21 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">It was provided by Ms Wong to Mr Sheehan who had been nominated in June 2007 by the Victorian Small Business Commissioner to determine the current market rent of shops 1, 2, 4, 9 and 10 in the Food Court at the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">It will be necessary to return to consider the submission and the determinations in further detail later in these reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Ms Wong's submission did not include the information in the marginal notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Under the heading "Market Rental Indications", the submission stated: 
 From our associations with some of the estate agents and takeaway stores in other food courts, we have been advised the following rental indications .</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">We believe these food court outlets are very comparable to those at The Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Galleria Food Court --- Jones Lang LaSalle (leasing agent)

<sentence id="s575">We would like to point out that these tenants had obviously checked out the market situation in relation to the rental value of takeaway outlets in the CBD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Therefore they had offered to take up the leases at the negotiated rental per annum after performing their due diligent work at the Food court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">STAND ALONE CAFE/TAKEAWAYS
 
 
We also have the honour of knowing some operators with stand alone caf&eacute;/takeaways i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">not in food court environment and for the benefit of comparisons to stress the point that a food court outlet is more valuable than stand alone caf&eacute; in terms of rent due to common area environment as well as provision of amenities and facilities by centre management.</sentence>

(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">During the course of her evidence, Ms Wong admitted that it was "a certainty" she would have included the information in the marginal notes in the submission if she had had the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">That admission was inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">The information in the marginal notes was not only relevant to the submission but, if available at the time Ms Wong drafted the submission, was central to Dukemaster's position given the way in which Dukemaster responded to Mr Sheehan and ultimately conducted its defence of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">It was the only evidence about comparable market rents in other food courts said by Dukemaster to exist in the period prior to June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">The difficulty is that the evidence did not exist prior to June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">If the information in the marginal notes did not exist in June 2006 (as I have found), then there was also no basis or reason for the inclusion of the phrase "appears to be comparable to other enquiries at QV / Target" in the 22 August 2006 note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The form of the 22 August 2006 note itself provides further evidence that that phrase was a later addition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">A spare line exists between each numbered paragraph except between paragraphs (2) and (3) where the italicised phrase appears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">I find that the phrase was added after 22 August 2006 and more likely "up to a year after" that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Finally, the form and substance of the balance of the 22 August 2006 note itself (and the form and content of Ms Wong's submission to Mr Sheehan in June 2007) is not consistent with Ms Wong having the information in the marginal notes at the meeting on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">In relation to the Bourke Street Rental and the Upper Bourke Street Rental, the 22 August 2006 note records not only that Ms Wong made enquiries of a Tony Tai, a real estate agent, but what his advice was and that she passed that advice on to Mr Hii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">If Ms Wong had the information in the marginal notes at the time of the 22 August 2006 meeting, you would have expected her not only to inform Mr Hii of that advice (which she did not) but also the source of it and to record those matters in the note at or soon after the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">That is consistent with what Ms Wong did in the June 2007 submission to Mr Sheehan as seen by the italised sections of the extract of the submission at [101] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Not only is the information then in her possession clearly identified in a methodical and systematic manner but also the source of each piece of information is dealt with in the same manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Before leaving the information said to have been held by Dukemaster relating to comparable rents in 2006 and 2007, it is necessary to deal with two further handwritten notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">The first note, also prepared by Ms Wong, bears the date "18/7/06" in the top left hand corner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The opening words of the note are "Robert Sant reported the following findings from his survey".</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">The note goes on to record an alleged survey by Mr Sant of "Donut King" trading at the Target Centre in Bourke Street and "Zest Wraps" trading at QV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">Ms Wong gave evidence that the note was in a file she had with her at the 22 August 2006 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">I reject that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">The contents of the note are not consistent with the information in the marginal notes (see [92] above) or with Mr Sant's evidence (see [96] and [97] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">In my view, the note was prepared in July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">The details recorded in the handwritten note were reproduced in Dukemaster's submission to Mr Sheehan (see [101] above) in June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">The year in the date on the original note appears to have been written over --- as if the "6" was later imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Whether that is so, however, is not determinative because I find that Ms Wong did not have all of the information recorded in these notes available to her in June 2006 and that the note records at least enquiries made in June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">One other handwritten note (dated 31 July 2006) was also prepared by Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">Again, but for the handwritten date, there is nothing to suggest that Ms Wong had this information in August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The first time the information is reproduced by Ms Wong to any other person or party is its inclusion in her submission to Mr Sheehan (see [101] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">I find that note also records enquiries made in 2007, not 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Where, and when, then did Ms Wong get the information set out in the marginal notes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">In relation to Donut King at Target, I found that the information was obtained in 2007 (see [98] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">In relation to QV, I find that Ms Wong obtained the information in September 2007 from Charter Keck Cramer in the following circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">In August 2007, Ms Wong of Dukemaster engaged Charter Keck Cramer, valuers, to "compare the [shops in the Food Court and other parts of the Paramount Centre] with the evidence of other similar quality and generally comparable holdings for the purpose of establishing the current market rent, in accordance with the existing lease terms and conditions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">On 12 September 2007, Charter Keck Cramer provided advice by letter to Ms Wong at Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">Part of the advice was tendered in evidence and included a chart of "Comparative Rental Evidence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">Part of that chart dealt separately with the "Food Court QV" and was in the following form: Rental Schedule --- "Food Court QV" 172-254 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne Unit No.</sentence>

<sentence id="s632">Outgoings: Lessor responsibility 
 As is self evident, the Rental Schedule sets out many of the details contained in the marginal notes (see [92] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">There are some minor discrepancies --- the gross rental has in each relevant case in relation to QV been rounded down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">How, when and why that occurred is unnecessary for me to resolve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Those discrepancies do not, however, affect or alter my finding that Ms Wong obtained the information about QV recorded in the marginal notes from this chart provided by Charter Keck Cramer in September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">Finally, Ms Wong's assertion, in the witness box, that Dukemaster believed that a particular range of rents was a " range reasonable to propose at that time" (in the context of a different shop but, by analogy, applicable to each of the premises listed in the 22 August 2006 file note) is an assertion that I do not accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">The rental range proposed to the tenants by Dukemaster in 2007 was frequently referred to by the Respondents' witnesses as the "achievable rent" for the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">The ACCC submitted that this notion of "achievable rent" seemed to focus on what was obtainable rather than what was reasonable or reflected the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">The notion of "achievable rent" was discussed by Ms Wong at various times throughout her evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">At first, Ms Wong described this notion as "the range [she] thought the tenants would agree to".</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">In other words, the range of figures that were established in the August meeting between Mr Hii and Ms Wong, that eventually formed the basis for the figures proposed to the tenants, were the "range[s] that [Ms Wong] thought was achievable with those tenants" and were "achievable in the sense that [Ms Wong] thought that the tenant would agree to something within that range".</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">In response to a question from Counsel for the ACCC as to whether Dukemaster were hoping to achieve the highest figure within the range she had identified, she responded by saying that "[Dukemaster was] trying to achieve the best rental that [it could] achieve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Achievable rental".</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">At other points in the evidence, both Mr Hii and Ms Wong appeared to contend that the notion of "achievable rental" was in some way coupled with the idea of reasonableness and was then tied, in some ill-defined fashion, to having a market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">I reject those contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">There was no basis or no proper basis for Dukemaster to believe that the proposed rental figures reflected a market value and that they were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">The Respondents' description of the rents as "achievable rents" establishes no more than the tenants might (and then ultimately did) agree to pay the rent specified by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">The circumstances which led each of them to agree to pay the "achievable rent" specified by Dukemaster vary from tenant to tenant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">For each tenant, those circumstances which led each of them to agree to pay the "achievable rent" specified by Dukemaster is an issue which raises the operation and application of s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that the mere fact that the rents were "achievable rents" in the sense that the tenants agreed to pay them, does not of itself establish that they were reasonable, very reasonable, market value or below market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Again, however, a finding that the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster stating in January 2007 that it held a belief that the rent for Shop 3 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" as at 3 January 2007 does not provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that each representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">In this context, Mr Sheehan's evidence was that the market rent for the annual period commencing on 1 February 2007 was $50,500 (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">The rent charged by Dukemaster ($90,000 excluding GST) is about 80% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($50,500 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">The form and content of Mr Sheehan's 2008 Report has been described earlier: see [71] to [83] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">As the 2008 Report reveals, not only does the Food Court lack certain characteristics, it has a number of issues identified by Mr Sheehan as affecting the market rent (see [83] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">In addition, in the context of Shop 3 in 2007, the figure of $90,000 (or $1,875m 2 ) 'selected' by Ms Wong, for example, was higher per m 2 per annum than the upper limit of the rents for the same period for the seven food outlets in the food court in the Telstra Building of areas between 37.6m 2 and 89.5m 2 (which ranged from $835m 2 to $1,524m 2 ) and which were within a retail amenity of some 18 shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">Moreover, taking the so called "mid" point of a range of rents for particular premises as the Respondents sought to do to support a contention that the rents are "within range" is contrary to the evidence of Mr Sheehan that a higher rental rate per square metre generally applies to smaller outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">Again, in the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 of $90,000 (excluding GST) was "very reasonable" or "below the market rent" (as the 3 January 2007 letter stated), or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 3 for that period was greater than $90,000 (excluding GST) (for which there was no evidence), I can only conclude that the Third and Fourth Shin Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">The $90,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "very reasonable" nor "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">(C) JANUARY 2007 CONVERSATION
 Thirdly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the January 2007 conversation were misleading and deceptive because, by the January 2007 conversation, Dukemaster represented to Mrs Shin and Ms Zu that: the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable ("the Fifth Shin Representation"); it had a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable ("the Sixth Shin Representation"); the $90,000 Rent was lower than the rental paid by other [similar] tenants in the Food Court at that time ("the Seventh Shin Representation"), 
when, in fact, the $90,000 rent was not very reasonable, Dukemaster did not have a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and further or alternatively, the $90,000 Rent was not lower than the rental paid by other tenants in the Food Court at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was significantly less than $90,000 and was approximately $50,500 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Shin Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">It must be recalled that the Respondents' Counsel did not seek to cross examine Ms Zu about the contents of the January 2007 conversation: see [40] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The Fifth Shin Representation was conveyed by the January 2007 conversation except that the representation was that the $90,000 Rent was "reasonable" rather than "very reasonable" and the Seventh Shin Representation was also conveyed by the January 2007 conversation: see [38]-[42] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Was the Sixth Shin Representation conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">Unlike the 27 November 2003 letter (see [28] above) and the 3 January 2007 letter (see [35] above), Ms Wong did not state that she believed the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market rent: see [38] --- [42] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">However, that is not the end of the enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">As stated in the summary of principles set out above (see [10]), there will be circumstances where an opinion may convey there is a basis for it and that it is honestly held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Moreover, it is wrong to select particular words and acts in isolation without viewing them in context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">In my view, the Sixth Shin Representation was conveyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">It was conveyed by the express words of the January 2007 conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">A conclusion which is fortified by (although not dependent upon) the context in which it was made - the fact and contents of each the 27 November 2003 letter (see [28] above), the 3 January 2007 letter (see [35] above) and the Fifth and Seventh Shin Representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Shin Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive
 Taken as a whole, the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster holding a belief that the rent for Shop 3 was "reasonable", "very reasonable" and "lower than the rental paid by other tenants in the Food Court at that time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">That conclusion applies with equal force in relation to the Sixth Shin Representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 3 was "reasonable", "very reasonable" and "lower than the rental paid by other tenants in the Food Court at that time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">Does such a finding however provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that each representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive: see [10(1)] above?</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">For the reasons set out above at [88] to [111], the conduct comprising the Fifth and Sixth Shin Representations was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008 of $90,000 (excluding GST) was "reasonable", I can only conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Shin Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">The $90,000 Rent (excluding GST) was not "reasonable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">The Seventh Shin Representation requires separate consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Was the representation that "the $90,000 rent was lower than the rental paid by other [similar] tenants in the Food Court at that time" misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">The Respondents did not seek to identify who were the "other [similar] tenants in the Food Court at that time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">Annexure B (prepared by the Respondents) indicates that as at 30 June 2007, the rate per m 2 varied not only between shops of different areas but between shops of the same or similar area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">For example, Shops 3 and 4 were of similar size and the rate per m 2 sought by Dukemaster was the same - $1,875.00 per m 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Shops 8 and 11 were of similar size but smaller than Shops 3 and 4 and the rate per m 2 sought by Dukemaster varied between $2,385 per m 2 and $1,615 per m 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">Again, in the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that "the $90,000 rent was lower than the rental paid by other [similar] tenants in the Food Court at that time", I can only conclude that the Seventh Shin Representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Moreover, for the reasons earlier identified, in contravention of s 53(e) of the TPA, by the Seventh Shin Representation, Dukemaster made a false or misleading representation with respect to the price of goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">(3) UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">
 The ACCC also alleged that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Those allegations fall to be considered under the following headings: 
(a) Renewal of First Shop 3 Lease / "negotiation" of Second Shop 3 Lease;
 
(b) Renewal of Second Shop 3 Lease / "negotiation" of Third Shop 3 Lease;
 
(c) March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">A summary of the relevant legal principles is set out in Section B above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">Given my earlier findings in relation to s 52 of the TPA, and subject to the question of the appropriateness of any declarations and injunctions, a contravention of s 51AC would not otherwise add to or alter the other relief available: see generally Part VI of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">(A) RENEWAL OF FIRST SHOP 3 LEASE / "NEGOTIATION" OF SECOND SHOP 3 LEASE
 The ACCC's first complaint was that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 3 Lease / the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 3 Lease (see Annexure A) was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA by reason of one or more of the following facts: 
(1) Dukemaster was, or should have been, aware of the lack of bargaining power of Mrs Shin because:
 
 
(a) at the time of the renewal, Mrs Shin had only been operating the Korean Lunch Box for nine months;
 
 
(b) Mrs Shin was unable to understand the process or the documents associated with the Second Shop 3 Lease given her very limited ability to speak and read English;
 
 
(c) Mrs Shin had no knowledge of her legal rights as a tenant under the Retail Tenancies Reform Act and did not understand that Rental Determination was an option available to her;
 
 
(d) the Korean Lunch Box was a very small business with limited scope of growth in revenue; and
 
 
(e) Mrs Shin needed to renew the First Shop 3 Lease for the remaining term of three years to recoup the investment she had made in the Korean Lunch Box;
 
 
(2) Dukemaster acknowledged Mrs Shin's exercise of her option to renew the First Shop 3 Lease and then offered Mrs Shin a new lease when it knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin did not understand that she was entering into a new lease and by entering into that new lease (Second Shop 3 Lease), she would lose her right to Rental Determination in respect of the $48,000 Rent and that the $48,000 Rent would become subject to annual CPI adjustments;
 
 
(3) Dukemaster denied Mrs Shin adequate time to consider the $48,000 Rent including whether she should proceed to Rental Determination by not advising Mrs Shin of the $48,000 Rent until 27 November 2003, being less than three months before the First Shop 3 Lease would expire and requesting a response within 11 days, when:
 
 
(a) Mrs Shin wrote to Dukemaster about exercising the option to renew the First Shop 3 Lease on 16 September 2003;
 
 
(b) Dukemaster knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin would need assistance in the relevant negotiations and completing the necessary documents; and
 
 
(c) Dukemaster knew (or reasonably should have known) that a rental increase of approximately 15% would be likely to decrease the profitability of the Korean Lunch Box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">(4) Dukemaster made the First and Second Shin Representations to Mrs Shin when the time made available to Mrs Shin to make her own enquiries about market value for the rent was limited particularly when Dukemaster:
 
 
(a) knew (or reasonably should have known) that the rental it was seeking was not the current market rent;
 
 
(b) had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2005;
 
 
(c) had denied Mrs Shin adequate time to consider the $48,000 Rent;
 
 
(d) knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin's ability to make her own enquiries about the market value for the rental was limited; and
 
 
(e) knew (or reasonably should have known) that the First and Second Shin representations were likely to influence Mrs Shin not to proceed to Rental Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">(5) Dukemaster required payment of the $48,000 Rent which was significantly higher than:
 
 
(a) the then current market rental for Shop 3 which if it had been applied would have required an increase of approximately 3%, not 15%;
 
 
(b) the rental being paid by Mrs Shin immediately prior to the commencement of the Second Shop 3 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">(6) Dukemaster not obtaining appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rent for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2005 and particularly before making the First and Second Shin representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">As is self evident, the list of factors is long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">There was much dispute between the parties whether or not the ACCC had formally proved the matters alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">I do not consider that it is necessary for the Court to seek to resolve whether or not the ACCC should and if so, has, formally proved each fact or matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">That is not what s 51AC requires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">In the end, Dukemaster supplied goods or services (in the form of lease premises) to a business consumer, Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">The question is whether that supply was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">In assessing that question, s 51AC(3) identifies some matters to which the Court may, but need not have regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">In the present case, the ACCC contends that the matters listed in s 51AC(3)(a), (c), (d), (j) and (k) are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">In all the circumstances, I consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 3 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 3 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">The First and Second Shin Representations were conveyed in a letter from Dukemaster to Mrs Shin and were not only misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin (see Section C(2)(a) above) but: were conveyed to Mrs Shin who Dukemaster knew had little or no ability to speak or read English; were intended by Dukemaster to secure a renewal of the lease at a rental for which there was no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; required a response within a period of 11 days when there was no explanation provided by Dukemaster to justify the limited time in which Mrs Shin could respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">(The Respondents contended that Mrs Shin should have taken steps to enquire about the market rent for the shop prior to being told by Dukemaster of the amount of increased rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">I reject that contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Why would she?</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">She had spent considerable time and capital in buying the business (with all of the fixtures and fittings), trading the business to seek to develop it and had no intention or need to shift premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">It is not surprising that a person in her position would not take steps to enquire about the market rent for the shop prior to being told by Dukemaster what rent it intended to seek from her).</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">
Dukemaster's conduct was irreconcilable with what was right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">If that was not enough, in February 2004 Dukemaster delivered lease documents to Mrs Shin that, contrary to the 27 November 2003 letter, were not a renewal of lease but a new and different lease where the terms of the new lease were different in critical respects: see [31] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">In the covering letter, Dukemaster failed to draw any of these issues to the attention of Mrs Shin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">That conduct, in the context of the earlier conduct (see [128] above) was clearly unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">(B) RENEWAL OF SECOND SHOP 3 LEASE / "NEGOTIATION" OF THIRD SHOP 3 LEASE
 With respect to the Third Shop 3 Lease, the ACCC contends that the circumstances said to give rise to a finding of unconscionability mirrored those set out in [126] in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 3 Lease / the negotiation of the Second Shop 3 Lease subject to the following modifications and exceptions: 
(1) in relation to circumstance (1) in [126], the ACCC relied upon contentions 1(b) --- 1(d), (though the Rental Leases Act was now in force) and further the ACCC contended that Dukemaster was, or should have been, aware of the lack of bargaining power of Mrs Shin because Mrs Shin needed a reasonable rent to enable her to continue to run the Korean Lunch Box Business and Mrs Shin needed a longer lease for Shop 3 to maximise the value of the Korean Lunch Box business;
 
 
(2) circumstance (2) in [126] was not relevant;
 
 
(3) in relation to circumstance (3) in [126], the ACCC relied upon the contentions except that the rent, of course, was not $48,000 but $90,000 and the ACCC contended that Dukemaster did not advise Mrs Shin until 3 January 2007, less than one month before the Second Shop 3 Lease would expire when:
 
 
(a) Mrs Shin wrote to Dukemaster about the lease over two months before 3 January 2007 (see [35]);
 
 
(b) Dukemaster knew the relevant rental range more than 4 months before 3 January 2007;
 
 
(c) Dukemaster knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin would need assistance in the relevant negotiations and completing the necessary documents;
 
 
(d) Dukemaster knew (or reasonably should have known) that a rental increase of approximately 78% would be likely to significantly decrease the profitability and saleability of the Korean Lunch Box business;
 
 
(e) Dukemaster knew (or reasonably should have known) that as a result of it not giving Mrs Shin the written notice as required by s 28(1) of the Retail Leases Act , the time for Mrs Shin to exercise her option to renew the Second Shop 3 Lease was to continue until at least 6 months after the requisite notice was eventually given, which information it did not disclose to Mrs Shin;
 
 
(4) in addition to circumstance (3), the ACCC contended that Dukemaster required a response to the 3 January 2007 letter within 7 days over the New Year holiday period during which time: 
 
 
(a) Mrs Shin was unable to obtain legal advice in relation to the renewal of the Second Shop 3 Lease; and
 
 
(b) Dukemaster knew (or reasonable should have known) that Mrs Shin would have difficulty contacting her own lawyer or any lawyer;
 
 
(c) when Dukemaster failed to comply with its relevant obligations under s 28(1) of the Retail Leases Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">(5) in relation to circumstance (4), the ACCC contended that Dukemaster made the Third to Seventh Shin representations (see [86]-[122]) to Mrs Shin when the time made available to Mrs Shin to make her own enquiries about the market value of the rental was limited particularly when Dukemaster:
 
 
(a) knew (or reasonably should have known) that the rental it was seeking was not the current market rental;
 
 
(b) had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 2008;
 
 
(c) knew that many tenants in the food court were paying significantly less than the $90,000 Rent at that time for premises comparable or similar in size to Shop 3;
 
 
(d) had denied Mrs Shin adequate time to consider the $90,000 Rent;
 
 
(e) knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin's ability to make her own enquiries about the market value for the rental was limited; and
 
 
(f) knew (or reasonably should have known) that the Third to Seventh Shin representations were likely to influence Mrs Shin not to proceed to Rental Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">(6) in relation to circumstance (5), the ACCC contended that Dukemaster required payment of the $90,000 Rent which was significantly higher than:
 
 
(a) the then current market rental for Shop 3 which if it had been applied would have required an increase of approximately 0.1%, not 78%;
 
 
(b) the rental being paid by Mrs Shin immediately prior to the commencement of the Third Shop 3 Lease;
 
 
(c) the rental agreed to by Dukemaster at that time for Shop 6, Shop 11 and Shop 12 in the food court which were comparable / similar in size to Shop 3;
 
 
(7) by reason of the circumstances alleged by the ACCC above, the ACCC also contended that Dukemaster did not inform Ms Zu during the 3 January 2007 conversation that Rental Determination was an option if Mrs Shin still thought the $90,000 Rent was too high;
 
 
(8) the ACCC also contended that by Dukemaster offering Mrs Shin a new lease when it knew (or reasonably should have known) that Mrs Shin did not understand that by entering into the Third Shop 3 Lease (a new lease) she would lose her right to Rental Determination in respect of the $90,000 Rent;
 
 
(9) in relation to circumstance (6), the ACCC contended Dukemaster did not obtain appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rent for Shop 3 for the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 January 3008 and particularly before making the Third to Seventh Shin representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">(10) in addition, the ACCC contended that:
 
 
(a) Dukemaster refused to negotiate or to agree to reduce at all the rent payable under the Third Shop 3 Lease in the circumstances set out above;
 
 
(b) Dukemaster expressed its opinion as to the amount that would be the current market rental for Shop 3 as contemplated by cl 5.16A(a) of the Second Shop 3 Lease ($90,000 Rent) when Dukemaster did not genuinely believe that amount would be the current market rent and did not have a reasonable basis for its opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">Again, in all the circumstances, I consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the Third Shop 3 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">The Third to Seventh Shin Representations were conveyed and were not only misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mrs Shin (see Sections C(2)(b) and (c) above) but: were conveyed to Mrs Shin who Dukemaster knew had little or no ability to speak or read English; were intended by Dukemaster to secure a renewal of the lease at a rental for which there was no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; required a response within a period of 7 days, at a time when independent advice was not readily available and when there was no explanation provided by Dukemaster to justify the limited time in which Mrs Shin could respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">
Dukemaster's conduct was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">The Respondents contended that what transpired after receipt of the 3 January 2007 letter was "in fact a process of negotiation which was undertaken by and on behalf of Mrs Shin", negotiations which Mrs Shin "decided to conclude on 9 January 2007 by signing the renewal letter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">I reject the Respondents' description of what transpired after receipt of the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">On no view, was there a "negotiation" or for that matter a "negotiation" which Mrs Shin "decided to conclude": see Insight Oceania Pty Ltd v Philips Electronics Australia Ltd [2008] NSWSC 710 at [166] ; Strickland v Minister for Lands for Western Australia (1998) 85 FCR 319; Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed, Thomson Reuters, 2004) "Negotiation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">A rent was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">At no point was it indicated that it would be reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Although an additional term was granted, it was never in any way established that Mrs Wong sought this additional term as some sort of trade-off --- in fact, the evidence established that Mrs Shin simply had no choice but to accept the $90,000 Rent per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">It was not a negotiation --- it was an ultimatum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">(C) DUKEMASTER'S CONDUCT IN MARCH 2007
 Finally, with respect to the conduct of Dukemaster that occurred after the entry into the Third Shop 3 Lease, particularly after receipt of the 19 March 2007 letter from Jholl Lawyers &amp; Consultants (see [49] above), the ACCC contends that the circumstances said to give rise to a finding of unconscionability were that: 
Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the continuing operation of the Third Shop 3 Lease was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable because Dukemaster refused to properly address Mrs Shin's complaint about the rent payable under the Third Shop 3 Lease particularly given Dukemaster's conduct in [130(1)-(10)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">The Respondents contended that the rent was duly considered and addressed as an aspect of the negotiations referred to in [132] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">As I have already explained, that requires an assumption which cannot be justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Although Mrs Shin obviously had access to legal advice at the time of this March 2007 conduct, I consider Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable because Dukemaster: refused to address Mrs Shin's complaint regarding the excessive rent for the Third Shop 3 Lease, including rejecting a proposal to proceed to rental determination, when that rent had no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; denied that Mrs Shin had ever objected to the rental for the Third Shop 3 Lease, which clearly was not accurate; and threatened to evict Mrs Shin should she not pay the balance of the March rent at the new rate within 7 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">This conduct is not reconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Dukemaster persisted in following a course of conduct that deliberately attempted to deny Mrs Shin any opportunity to challenge the proposed rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">Before leaving this issue of unconscionability, it is necessary to address a number of other contentions of the Respondents concerning the ACCC's claim under s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Broadly, they can be divided into two groups: (a) resources to which the tenant (in this case, Mrs Shin) could have regard that would mitigate against a finding of unconscionable conduct and (b) common aspects of the commercial leasing industry that were present in this case and would tend against a finding of unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">It appeared that many of these factors were directed at establishing parity of bargaining positions, being a consideration relevant to s 51AC(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">Although I acknowledge that this was one of the pleaded matters to which I could have regard, ultimately I am bound to determine whether the conduct was, "in all the circumstances, unconscionable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">In all the circumstances I find that the actions of Dukemaster were deliberate (or at least reckless), showed no regard for conscience and were irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable: see discussion of relevant principles at [17] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I will address the various matters raised by the Respondents in their many submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">First, the Respondents' submissions about the resources available to Mrs Shin in conducting the Korean Lunch Box business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">The Respondents submitted that Mrs Shin, (1) through Ms Zu, had access to a well-educated translator, (2) could readily gain access to legal advice, (3) could seek assistance from other tenants when required, (4) had the advantage of the Tenants' Committee and (5) was a well-experienced business woman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">The significance and substance of (1) is dubious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">Ms Zu did an admirable job assisting her mother, but there was nothing in the sworn or viva voce evidence to suggest that the assistance she provided as a 22 year old undergraduate significantly improved her mother's business decisions or her ability to address the serious issues raised by Dukemaster in the limited time provided by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">In relation to (2), although it was, in a vague sense, established that Mrs Shin had used legal assistance in the past, the fact remains that the conduct of the Respondents required decisions to be made in such a limited period of time that legal advice would have been difficult to obtain, in circumstances where it seems clear that the Respondents would have maintained their position and undertaken their conduct in any case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">The relevance of (3) and (4) is also problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">No evidence was adduced to demonstrate any benefit was provided to Mrs Shin by (3) or (4) when interacting with Dukemaster that would alter my finding that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Finally, (5) is an interesting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">It is true that Mrs Shin had the better part of a decade's worth of experience in the take-away food industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">However, the evidence established that Mrs Shin had only a limited grasp of the various business documents supplied to her and, at the very least, did not have any grasp of the commercial and legal circumstances beyond the limited aspects I have outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">The Respondents' second broad series of submissions was that there were a number of endemic aspects of the commercial leasing industry that were the subject of complaint in this matter that should not be found to be aspects of unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">In other words, by finding that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable, I risked damning large segments of the industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">These matters were that (1) there were other conditions in the lease and that it would be wrong to focus only on the rent payable, (2) the fact that the tenants' businesses were or were not operating at a profit should not be a relevant consideration in negotiating with those tenants, (3) the market was flexible --- there were other locations and the goodwill or reputation of their tenants was at least to some extent transferable, (4) the relevant lease documents were straightforward and easily understood and (5) Mrs Shin (and the other tenants) were advised of the right to go to rental determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Many aspects of the Respondents' submission on this second category may be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">With respect to (1), it is obvious, perhaps so much so that it becomes trite to say that there will be many reasons a tenant ultimately agrees to a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">Rent will be one factor, but there may be others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">However, in this case, I was taken to and I cannot find any other provision of the relevant lease documents that would dissuade me from finding that in all the circumstances Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">With respect to (2) --- I agree that in the absence of direct evidence about profitability having been raised by a tenant with a landlord as a reason for seeking a particular outcome whether directly, by a lease term requiring a tenant to disclose profitability to a landlord on a regular basis or some other basis, it would be inappropriate to require a landlord to enquire of the financial state of parties with which they are negotiating in an arm's length transaction lest they be found to be behaving unconscionably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">The situation with respect to the matters listed in (3)-(5) above is less clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">Mr Sheehan's evidence does not support (3): see for example [82] and [83] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Even in the absence of that evidence, it is undeniable that a tenant relying upon foot trade and repeat custom would prefer to stay in a location where it has already invested time and money to establish a presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">In relation to (4), determining the legal consequences of the many and various lease documents and the correspondence relating to them was and remains a difficult task for someone trained in the law, let alone someone who speaks and reads English poorly with no legal training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Finally, the fact that Mrs Shin was advised of her right to go to rental determination in the 27 November 2003 and 3 January 2007 letters largely ignores the subject matter of this entire dispute --- the fact is that it was not shown that Mrs Shin understood other than in the most general nature what this meant, and moreover, the conduct of the Respondents in the period surrounding these letters largely destroyed any comfort such advice would have provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">(4) RELIEF 
 In relation to these contraventions of the TPA, it is appropriate that there be declarations and injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">In addition, pursuant to s 87(1A) (read with s 87(1AA)) of the TPA, the Respondents should refund to Mrs Shin the amount of rent she was overcharged totalling $55,082.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">The sum of $55,082 is calculated by subtracting the market rent from the rent in fact paid by Mrs Shin as follows: 
01/01/04 --- 31/01/07 $15,144
 
02/02/07 --- 31/01/08 $39,938
 
 That leaves the question of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">The ACCC sought interest on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">First, under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA"), the ACCC sought interest on the amounts overpaid from the date of overpayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">It selected an interest rate of 9%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">The Respondents did not seek to challenge the entitlement to interest or the rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">In my view, Mrs Shin was entitled to interest on those amounts from the date of payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">That amount of interest for the period up to and including 28 February 2009 is $10,679.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">The ACCC also sought interest on the total amount ($65,761) from 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">The date reflects the fact that the ACCC's calculation of interest on the overpayments was up to and including 28 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">The form of the order sought by the ACCC is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">It seeks interest on interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Instead, the Respondents should pay Mrs Shin interest on the amounts overpaid (see [141] above) from and including 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">If the parties are unable to quantify that amount, they may have the matter re-listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">D. SHOP 4 --- EAST ON PARAMOUNT
(1) FACTS 
 (A) EARLY APRIL 2004 INCLUDING 16 MARCH 2004 LETTER AND 16 MARCH 2004 CONVERSATION
 East on Paramount, a Chinese take away business, located in Shop 4 in the Food Court is operated by a married couple --- Mrs Lai and Mr Tan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Mrs Lai did not give viva voce evidence and was not cross examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">All but one paragraph of her affidavit evidence was tendered without objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">That affidavit disclosed that Mrs Lai was born in East Timor and speaks Hakka and that her English, Cantonese and Mandarin are limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">The balance of her affidavit describes the difficulties she and her husband have had paying the rent for Shop 4 and that any complaints by them to Mr Sant about the poor business and the rent were met with a response along the lines that they "had to take [their] complaints upstairs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Mr Tan was born in Malaysia and came to Australia in 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">He speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, Hakka and a little English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">Since his arrival in Australia, Mr Tan has worked as a cook.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">Mr Tan provided both affidavit and oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">He was cross examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">He gave evidence with the assistance of a Cantonese interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">In 1998, Mr Tan worked part time as a cook for the previous owners of East on Paramount - Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">On his first day, Mr Tan met Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">In early 1999, Ms Wong told Mr Tan that Dukemaster were selling East on Paramount and asked him if he was interested in buying the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">Mr Tan discussed the idea with his wife and after negotiations with Ms Wong and Mr Peter Cook (then the Centre Manager), Mr Tan and his wife agreed to purchase the business for $47,500 on the basis of a five year lease with two options to renew for three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">The initial rent was $55,000 per annum with the first two months rent free and rent increases of 3% each year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">The lease was signed on 4 May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">It commenced on 12 April 1999 ("the First Shop 4 Lease").</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">It was not a standard lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">To the extent that the leasing history was not in dispute, it is summarised in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">The first year of trading went well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">By the second year, takings had fallen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">Customer numbers had reduced and there was less advertising or promotion of the Paramount Centre by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">At some time during the first term, East on Paramount ceased weekend trading because there was insufficient traffic in the Food Court to justify the costs incurred in opening for trade on the weekends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">Mr Tan also gave sworn evidence, not the subject of cross examination by the Respondents' Counsel, that during the first term he complained to Ms Wong and Mr Sant about the rent being too high and the lack of customers coming to the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">Sometime in early March 2004, Mr Tan telephoned Ms Wong and told her that they wanted to renew the lease that was due to expire in April of that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Ms Wong responded saying that it would be okay to renew the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">At that time, she did not say anything about the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">On 16 March 2004, Ms Wong came to Shop 4 and gave Mr Tan a letter from Dukemaster in the following terms ("the 16 March 2004 letter"): 
We note the lease for the above shop will expire on 11/04/2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Please advise by 5:00pm 23/03/2004 whether you will exercise the option for a further term of 3 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Should you wish to exercise the option for a further term, we advise the rent for the above shop will be $72,000.00pa plus GST commencing 12/04/2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">We believe the new rent is very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">If you object to our proposed rent, the matter will proceed to valuation in accordance with clause RC3.2 of the lease contract .</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">...
 
 
(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">When Ms Wong gave Mr Tan the 16 March 2004 letter, Mr Tan told her that the rental was "very expensive" and that if he accepted the $72,000 rent, he did not think he could continue with his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">Ms Wong replied saying that she had got a "specialist" for this rental determination, that the amount was $80,000 and the $72,000 rent was already discounted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">Mr Tan said that he did not think he had the ability to run his business because the rent was so expensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">Ms Wong replied saying that the rent determination was correct and that Mr Tan could get another person to do the rental determination (at a cost to him of $4,000), but the rental determination would be $80,000 and she would not then give Mr Tan any discount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">Mr Tan was cross examined about the conversation ("the 16 March 2004 conversation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">During his cross examination, Mr Tan restated his evidence in chief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">He also stated that he understood the last sentence of the 16 March 2004 letter entitled him to proceed to an independent valuation but that he did not adopt that course because of the statements made to him by Ms Wong that: she had got a "specialist" for the rental determination; the amount of that determination was $80,000; the $72,000 rent was already a discount; and although Mr Tan could get another person to do the rental determination, the rental determination would be $80,000 and she would not then give Mr Tan any discount and he would have to pay $4,000 for the rental determination fee (according to Ms Wong, this would be half of the total fee, the other half to be paid by Dukemaster).</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">
Ms Wong's denial of the contents of the 16 March 2004 conversation was not put to Mr Tan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">During examination-in-chief, Ms Wong gave evidence that she told Mr Tan that Dukemaster had checked and done comparisons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">As noted earlier, that statement was false: see [66] to [68] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">Moreover, the statement is contradicted by the rents Dukemaster asked of the other tenants - the Korean Lunch Box rent was $48,000 plus GST (which was exactly the same size as Shop 4) and the rent for Boxcar caf&eacute; (just under twice the size of Shop 4) was $72,000 plus GST: see Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">Mr Tan discussed the rent increase with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">They decided that the $72,000 rent was too expensive and they would approach Ms Wong again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">At that time, Mr Tan did not sign the 16 March 2004 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">Mr Tan's evidence was that subsequently he telephoned Ms Wong and spoke to her in Cantonese and told her that he would like to see her manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">Mr Tan's evidence was that Ms Wong told him the manager was overseas in Malaysia and was very busy and had "no time to see [him]" and "there's no negotiation over the rental".</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">Ms Wong's evidence was that she did not recall this conversation and she denied telling Mr Tan that her manager was overseas and too busy to talk to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Significantly, Ms Wong's denial of the contents of the conversation was not put to Mr Tan by the Respondents' Counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">On balance, I accept Mr Tan's evidence that he spoke to Ms Wong in the terms he stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">There is a hand written annotation on the 16 March 2004 letter which reads "Tenant notified re acceptance of proposed rent on 31/3/04".</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">This appears to be consistent with the evidence of Ms Wong who recalled that Mr Tan orally assented to the proposed rent sometime in late March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">(B) APRIL 2004 --- 2007 INCLUDING 5 MARCH 2007 LETTER AND 5 MARCH 2007 CONVERSATION
 On 5 April 2004, Mr Tan and Mrs Lai received a letter from Dukemaster's lawyers enclosing a copy of a draft lease for Shop 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">The lease was for three years with one further term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">The rent was $72,000 plus GST for the first year, $74,160 plus GST for the second year and $76,384.80 plus GST for the third year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">The 5 April 2004 letter stated: 
We enclose:
 
 Lease, in duplicate for your perusal and execution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">We have forwarded the Lease to you subject to approval by the Lessor of all terms and conditions contained in the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">Retail Leases information brochure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">
We look forward to the return of all Lease documents together with a copy of the Disclosure Statement previously handed to you by the Lessor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">If you have a solicitor acting for you in this matter we suggest that you take the enclosed documents to your solicitor as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">If you execute and return the Lease to us without advice from a solicitor our client will treat your execution and return of the Lease as acknowledgement by you that you are satisfied with all the terms and conditions in the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">The enclosed lease documents were standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Mr Tan delayed signing the documents because he was worried about the high rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">The lease commenced on 12 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">It was not until about 17 May 2004 that Mr Tan and Mrs Lai signed the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">Mr Tan's evidence was that although the business was not good in 2004, he still signed the lease because he and his wife had put a lot of money and effort into the shop and did not want to risk losing the business ("the Second Shop 4 Lease").</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Sometime in December 2006, Mr Tan told Ms Wong that he and his wife wished to renew the lease for a further term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">Ms Wong told Mr Tan that they were able to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">Nothing further transpired until 5 March 2007 when Ms Wong came to the shop and handed Mr Tan a letter ("the 5 March 2007 letter").</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">That letter stated: 
Thank you for your exercise of option for further term of 3 years in relation to the above lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">We note the current lease expires on 11 th April 2007 and we advise the following:
 
 
Commencement Date: 12 th April 2007
 
Rent per annum: 1 st year $90000.00 (plus GST)
 
 2 nd year $92700.00 (plus GST)
 
 3 rd year $95481.00 (plus GST)
 
 
Please advise by 5.00pm on 9 th March 2007 whether you accept this offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">We believe that the new rent is very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">If you object to our proposed rent, the matter will proceed to valuation in accordance with clause 5-16(A) of the lease contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">
 
 
If the above proposals are acceptable to you please advise us by signing below and return a copy to us by 5pm on 9 th March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">We will instruct our solicitors to prepare the lease and forward it to you for your perusal and execution.</sentence>

 GENERAL MANAGER 
 
 
(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">The form and content of this letter (subject to different particulars) was the same as the letter Dukemaster sent to the Korean Lunch Box on 3 January 2007 (see [35] above) and to Gomax in relation to Boxcar Caf&eacute; on 3 January 2007 (see [247] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">Ms Wong told Mr Tan that the rent would now be $90,000 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">In response to Mr Tan saying that it was too expensive, Ms Wong said that it was the correct amount and that the rental in "the Centre in the future would be $90,000" ("the 5 March 2007 conversation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Ms Wong's evidence was that she told Mr Tan that the rent was reasonable and nothing more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">Despite being cross examined about the contents of this conversation, Mr Tan steadfastly maintained his position that Ms Wong had referred to "the Centre".</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">Moreover, the substance of the allegations is consistent with other statements Ms Wong made to other tenants which were not the subject of direct challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">Mr Tan showed the 5 March 2007 letter to Mr Vasta, another shop owner in the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">Mr Vasta pointed out to Mr Tan that the 5 March 2007 letter required a response by 9 March, just four days away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">Mr Vasta told Mr Tan that that was not enough time for him to consider the 5 March 2007 letter, that he should not sign it and that Mr Tan should get his own market valuation under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">Mr Tan then spoke with two other tenants in the Food Court and they told him that Dukemaster had also put their rent up a lot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">The three tenants (Mr Tan, Irene Watts from "Chine on Paramount" and Mr Ho from "Boxcar Caf&eacute;") agreed to use the same rent valuer and to share the cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">On 22 March 2007, a further letter was delivered to Mr Tan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">This letter was from Dukemaster's lawyers and was in part in the following terms: 
We act for the above-named Landlord.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">We are instructed that you have exercised your option for a further term of three (3) years starting on 12 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">We now enclose herewith the following:-
 
 Disclosure Statement in duplicate for your attention ; and
 
Please sign both copies of the Disclosure Statement where indicated and return one (1) copy to our office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Retail Leases information brochure for your retention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">
We will prepare the lease and forward to you or your Solicitor when the first year rent for the Renewed Lease is agreed to by you and our client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">Our client in a letter to you of the 5 March 2007 has proposed the rent of $90,000 per annum plus GST for the first year of the Renewed Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">Our client is of the opinion that the rent of $90,000 per annum plus GST is the market rent for the premises.</sentence>

<sentence id="s939">(2) CONDUCT MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE OR LIKELY TO MISLEAD OR DECEIVE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">
 The ACCC had four complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">Each complaint dealt with separate representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">Although some of the representations contain common elements, each must be considered separately because each is said to constitute a separate contravention of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">(A) 16 MARCH 2004 LETTER
 First, the ACCC contended that the contents of the 16 March 2004 letter (see [151] above) were misleading and deceptive because, by the 16 March 2004 letter, Dukemaster represented to Mr Tan and Mrs Lai that: it believed that the proposed rent for the renewal of Shop 4 of $72,000 plus GST from 12 April 2004 to 11 April 2005 ("the $72,000 Rent") was very reasonable and below the market value ("the First Tan and Lai Representation"); it had a reasonable basis for believing that the $72,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Second Tan and Lai Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $72,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 from 12 April 2004 to 11 April 2005 and that if it had done so, the market value was approximately $43,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">As with Shop 3 (see [61]), two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">In its terms, the 16 March 2004 letter made the First and Second Tan and Lai Representations: see [151] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">From Mr Tan and Mrs Lai's perspective, it is apparent that Dukemaster and Ms Wong (as Dukemaster's representative) knew what other tenants in the Food Court in the Paramount Centre were paying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">Mr Tan and Mrs Lai did not know what other tenants were paying and they were not in a position to know whether or not Dukemaster had sought valuation advice or information about comparable rents and they were not in a position to obtain information about comparable rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">That was a process which they neither had the means or ability to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">The ACCC's complaint concerns the representations that the $72,000 Rent was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" and that Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for believing that the $72,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">Those issues are interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">As with Shop 3 (see [66] above), Ms Wong did not explain, except in the most general terms, how the figure of $72,000 plus GST for Shop 4 referred to in the 16 March 2004 letter was selected as the rent to be sought for Shop 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">At its highest, her evidence was that the figure was based on what she knew "about the rents being paid by tenants in the area surrounding the ... Paramount Centre" and "on the rents paid by other tenants in the [F]ood [C]ourt of the ... Paramount Centre".</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">Moreover, contrary to Ms Wong's affidavit, the statement in the letter was not that the rent was "reasonable" but that it was "very reasonable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Ms Wong's explanation why, in this case, she fixed upon a rental of $72,000, should not be accepted for the same reasons as I rejected her explanation in relation to Shop 3 (see [66] --- [68] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">Taken as a whole (see also [66] --- [68] above), the evidence reveals no basis for Ms Wong or Dukemaster stating in 16 March 2004 letter that it held a belief that the rent for Shop 4 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 for the period 12 April 2004 to 11 April 2005 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 4 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">As explained earlier (see [10(1)] above), if the evidence shows that the opinion expressed by Dukemaster lacked any or any adequate basis, the conduct contravenes s 52 of the TPA only if that conduct induces or is capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">If the rent referred to in the 16 March 2004 letter was in fact "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value", then it would not be shown that the conduct complained of by the ACCC could induce or would be capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">In relation to Shop 4, I consider that the conduct complained of is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because it is much more probable than not that the $72,000 Rent was not "very reasonable" and it was not "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">I have earlier analysed the market rent evidence: see [71] to [85] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">In relation to Shop 4, Mr Sheehan was asked to express an opinion on the current market rent of Shop 4 for the annual period commencing on 12 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Against the background set out in that earlier analysis (see [71] to [85] above) in dealing with Shop 4, Mr Sheehan noted that the previous rent for the shop for the period from 12 April 2003 to 11 April 2004 was $61,902.98 per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Shop 4 he described as "situated within the [w]estern section of the Little Bourke Street level" and, "[i]n comparison to other food service outlets within the [F]ood [C]ourt ...[had] a fairly average frontage for the Food Court of about 7.5m".</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">As the summary of his evidence records (see Annexure C), Mr Sheehan expressed the view that the market rent for Shop 4 for the annual period from 12 April 2004 was $43,000 (excluding GST), not $72,000 (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">The rent charged by Dukemaster ($72,000 excluding GST) is more than 66% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($43,000 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for the period 12 April 2004 to 11 April 2005 of $72,000 (excluding GST) was "very reasonable" or "below the market value" (as the 16 March 2004 letter stated it to be), or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for that period was greater than $72,000 (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the First and Second Tan and Lai Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Tan and Mrs Lai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">The $72,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "very reasonable" nor "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">(B) 16 MARCH 2004 CONVERSATION 
 Secondly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 16 March 2004 conversation (see [152] --- [154] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by that conversation, Dukemaster represented to Mr Tan that: it had obtained a specialist to determine the market rental for Shop 4 and that specialist had determined that the market rental for Shop 4 was $80,000 per annum ("the Third Tan and Lai Representation"); and the $72,000 Rent was a discount on the market rental of $80,000 per annum for Shop 4 ("the Fourth Tan and Lai Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster had not, at the relevant time, asked a specialist to determine the market rental for Shop 4 from 12 April 2004 to 11 April 2005 and the $72,000 Rent was not a discount on the market rental for Shop 4 at that time and that if it had done so, the market value was significantly less than $72,000 and was approximately $43,000 GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">Despite vigorous cross examination, Mr Tan's account of the 16 March 2004 conversation was not shaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">Moreover, Ms Wong's denial of the conversation was not put to Mr Tan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">The Third and Fourth Tan and Lai Representations were conveyed by the 16 March 2004 conversation: see [152] to [154] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">The evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster making the Third Tan and Lai Representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Dukemaster did not lead any evidence that it had retained a "specialist", that it had retained a "specialist" to determine the market rental for Shop 4, that any such specialist had determined that the market rental for Shop 4 was $80,000 per annum or that the market rent was in fact $80,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Conduct induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">Again, however, that finding ([187] above) does not provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that the representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">For the reasons set out above at [71] to [85] and [177] to [183], the conduct comprising the Third Tan and Lai Representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that it had retained a "specialist", that it had retained a "specialist" to determine the market rental for Shop 4, that any such specialist had determined that the market rental for Shop 4 was $80,000 per annum or that the market rent was in fact $80,000, I can only conclude that the Third Tan and Lai Representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Tan and Mrs Lai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">That conclusion necessarily applies with equal force to the Fourth Tan and Lai Representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">In the absence of any evidence that the market rent was in fact $80,000, no other conclusion is open other than the Fourth Tan and Lai Representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Tan and Mrs Lai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">Moreover, for the reasons earlier identified, in contravention of s 53(e) of the TPA, by the Third and Fourth Tan and Lai Representations Dukemaster made a false or misleading representation with respect to the price of goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">(C) 5 MARCH 2007 LETTER
 Thirdly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 5 March 2007 letter (see [160] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by that letter, Dukemaster represented to Mr Tan that: it believed that the proposed rent for the renewal of the Second Shop 4 Lease of $90,000 plus GST from 12 April 2007 to 11 April 2008 ("the $90,000 Rent") was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Fifth Tan and Lai Representation"); it had a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Sixth Tan and Lai Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 from 12 April 2007 to 11 April 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was approximately $40,500 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">The ACCC's complaint concerns the representations that the $90,000 Rent was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" and that Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">Again, those issues are interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">In its terms, the 5 March 2007 letter made the Third and Fourth Tan and Lai Representations: see [160] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">As was the position in 2004, Mr Tan and Mrs Lai were not in a position to know whether or not Dukemaster had sought valuation advice or information about comparable rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">Mr Tan did however ascertain from discussions with other tenants that Dukemaster had put up the rents of other tenants in the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">I have earlier analysed the market rent evidence in 2006 and 2007: see [88] to [111] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 in March 2007 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 4 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">Conduct induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">As explained earlier (see [10(1)] above), if the evidence shows that the opinion expressed by Dukemaster lacked any or any adequate basis, the conduct contravenes s 52 of the TPA only if that conduct induces or is capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">In this context, we are only concerned with the latter because as the summary of facts records (see [162] to [171] above), Mr Tan and Mrs Lai were not induced into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">If the rent referred to in the 5 March 2007 letter was in fact "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value", then it would not be shown that the conduct complained of by the ACCC could induce or would be capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">In relation to Shop 4, I consider that the conduct complained of is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because it is much more probable than not that the $90,000 Rent was not "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Mr Sheehan had earlier expressed an opinion on the current market rent of Shop 4 for the annual period commencing on 12 April 2007: see [162], [165] and [171] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">In preparation of his 2008 Report, Mr Sheehan was asked the following question in relation to Shops 1 and 2, Shop 4 and Shops 9 and 10: 
Do you remain of the view of Current Market Rent you expressed in each of the rental determination reports dated 26 July 2007 (for Shops 1 &amp; 2, Shop 4 and Shops 9 &amp; 10)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">In his 2008 Report, Mr Sheehan stated: 
Since concluding my assessments of current market rent applicable to each of the Determinations in July 2007, I have not become aware of any information which would affect my assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">It is noted that since these Determinations were made, the Lebanese Caf&eacute; (FJ Caf&eacute;), French Patisserie (Duchess Anne French Patisserie) and a Supermarket / Liquor Store have closed, the Soup &amp; Sandwich (Soupfrenzzy) appears to have been rebranded and that the retail complement appears not to have increased in vibrancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">The Respondents challenged Mr Sheehan's finding outlined in [199] above on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">First, that Mr Sheehan's valuation of rent for Shop 4 for the annual period commencing 12 April 2004 was $43,000 per annum, whereas the valuation at the time of the 26 July 2007 determination and at the time of writing the 2008 Report, (being 6 August 2008), was $40,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">Secondly, the decrease in rent between 2004 and 2007/2008 was unusual for businesses in the Melbourne CBD based upon the comparative information given to Mr Sheehan at the time of writing his various reports and, further, that they were not satisfied with Mr Sheehan's explanation for such a decrease, particularly noting that the closure of the Supermarket mentioned in [199] above did not occur until late 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">I agree with the Respondents' contentions that Mr Sheehan's evidence on his findings outlined in [199] requires close examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">However, on balance, Mr Sheehan was simply asked whether his assessment in the 2008 Report had changed since making his determination on 26 July 2007 (see [198] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">His determination on 26 July 2007 was the result of a detailed analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">There is nothing to suggest to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">In responding to questions in cross examination about the reduction in his valuation of the rent between 2004 and 2007/2008, Mr Sheehan stated that he was "very conscious" that his assessment for the rent in 2004 was higher than the rent in July of 2007 and August 2008, that this had "absolutely" caused him to reflect on his findings but ultimately, he believed his valuations to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">Further, as Mr Sheehan's cross examination emphasised, the closures mentioned in [199] had most certainly occurred by August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">The confusion that arose during the course of Mr Sheehan's viva voce evidence was that at one point it seemed to be suggested that these were considerations relevant to his 26 July 2007 determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">Having read that determination, this is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">As a result, Mr Sheehan's evidence on this point is that on 26 July 2007, when Mr Sheehan made his valuation for Shop 4 for the annual period commencing 12 April 2007, he believed that it was correct on the information provided and that in August 2008 nothing had occurred to increase his valuation (and in fact there were circumstances that could have reduced the value of the tenancy).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">The rent proposed to be charged by Dukemaster ($90,000 excluding GST) is more than 120% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($40,500 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for the period commencing on 12 April 2007 of $90,000 (excluding GST) was "very reasonable" or "below the market value" (as the 5 March 2007 letter stated it to be), or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for that period was greater than $90,000 (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Tan and Lai Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Tan and Mrs Lai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">The $90,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "very reasonable" nor "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">(D) 5 MARCH 2007 CONVERSATION
 Fourthly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 5 March 2007 conversation (see [161] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by that conversation, Dukemaster represented to Mr Tan that: $90,000 was the market rent ("the Seventh Tan and Lai Representation"); and Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $90,000 Rent was the market rental for Shop 4 ("the Eighth Tan and Lai Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $90,000 Rent was the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 from 12 April 2007 to 11 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">The Seventh and Eighth Tan and Lai Representations were conveyed by the 5 March 2007 conversation: see [161] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">In fact, the Respondents' amended statement of case admitted that Ms Wong stated that this was the 'correct' amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">Again, consistent with the legal principles in [10(2)] concerning context, Ms Wong had just delivered the 5 March 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">The reference to a 'correct' amount can only mean a reference to the market rental --- therefore the Seventh Tan and Lai Representation was conveyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">The Eighth Tan and Lai Representation is more straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">It was the evidence of both Mr Tan and Ms Wong that Ms Wong asserted that the $90,000 figure was "reasonable": see [161] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">Although Mr Tan questioned this figure in the 5 March 2007 conversation, Ms Wong maintained her position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">By so doing, Ms Wong conveyed the Eighth Tan and Lai Representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">As discussed earlier (see [88] to [111] above), the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster making the Seventh and Eighth Tan and Lai Representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation evidence or advice in relation to the market rental for Shop 4 for the period from 12 April 2007 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 4 was "the market rent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">Conduct induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">Again, that finding ([209]) does not provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that each representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">I have addressed the evidence of Mr Sheehan at [196] --- [204] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">In light of the market evidence considered earlier and in the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for the period commencing on 12 April 2007 of $90,000 (excluding GST) was "the correct amount" or "the market rent" or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 4 for that period was $90,000 (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the Seventh and Eighth Tan and Lai Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Tan and Mrs Lai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">(3) UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">
 The ACCC also alleged that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">Those allegations fall to be considered under the following headings: 
(a) Renewal of First Shop 4 Lease / "negotiation" of Second Shop 4 Lease;
 
(b) Renewal of Second Shop 4 Lease / "negotiation" of Third Shop 4 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">A summary of the relevant legal principles is set out in Section B above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">As with Shop 3, given my earlier findings in relation to s 52 of the TPA, and subject to the question of the appropriateness of any declarations and injunctions, a contravention of s 51AC would not otherwise add to or alter the other relief available: see generally Part VI of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">(A) RENEWAL OF FIRST SHOP 4 LEASE / "NEGOTIATION" OF SECOND SHOP 4 LEASE
 The ACCC's first complaint was that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 4 Lease / the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 4 Lease (see Annexure A) was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA by reason of a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">As I said earlier (see [127]), s 51AC of the TPA does not require resolution of whether the factors listed by the ACCC are proved or not proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">The question is whether the supply by Dukemaster of lease premises to Mr Tan and Mrs Lai was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">In assessing that question, the ACCC contends that the matters listed in s 51AC(3)(a), (c), (d), (j) and (k) are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">In all the circumstances, I consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 4 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 4 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">The First and Second Tan and Lai Representations were conveyed in a letter from Dukemaster and were not only misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive them (see Section D(2)(a) above) but: were conveyed to Mr Tan and Mrs Lai who Dukemaster knew had little ability to speak or read English; were intended by Dukemaster to secure a renewal of the lease at a rental for which there was no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; required a response within a period of seven days, when there was no explanation provided by Dukemaster to justify the limited time in which Mr Tan and Mrs Lai could respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">
Dukemaster's conduct was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">If that was not enough, two subsequent events support the conclusion that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the First Shop 4 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 4 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">First, when Ms Wong gave Mr Tan the 16 March 2004 letter and after Mr Tan having told her that the rent was very expensive and that if he accepted the $72,000 Rent he did not think he could continue with his business, the Third and Fourth Tan and Lai representations were conveyed to Mr Tan by Ms Wong and were not only misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive he and his wife (see Section D(2)(b) above) but resulted in them not exercising their legal rights to go to an independent rental determination because they feared that what had been told to them by Ms Wong would in fact occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">As the facts demonstrate (see Section D(2)(b) above), the Third and Fourth Tan and Lai Representations were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">Secondly, on Mr Tan's second attempt to negotiate a reduction in the rent by seeking a meeting with Ms Wong's manager (see [155] above), he was told by Ms Wong that the manager was overseas in Malaysia and was very busy and had "no time to see [him]" and "there's no negotiation over the rental".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">That conduct, in the context of the earlier conduct (see [217]-[218] above) was unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">(B) RENEWAL OF SECOND SHOP 4 LEASE / "NEGOTIATION" OF THIRD SHOP 4 LEASE
 In all the circumstances, I consider Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the Second Shop 4 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Third Shop 4 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">The Fifth to Eighth Tan and Lai Representations were conveyed in letters from Dukemaster or its lawyers or in conversations between Ms Wong and Mr Tan and were not only misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive them (see Section D2(c) and (d) above) but: the letters were conveyed to Mr Tan and Mrs Lai who Dukemaster knew had limited ability to speak or read English; the representations were intended by Dukemaster to secure a renewal of the lease at a rental for which there was no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; both letters required a response within a period of just four days, when there was no explanation provided by Dukemaster to justify the limited time in which Mr Tan could respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">
Dukemaster's conduct was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">Subsequent events support the conclusion that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the Second Shop 4 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Third Shop 4 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">First, after Mr Tan gave notice to Dukemaster that he intended to seek an independent determination of the market rent for Shop 4 and contrary to the practice which had previously existed, Dukemaster's lawyers sent Mr Tan and Mrs Lai a letter of demand on 17 April 2007 for unpaid rent due on 1 April 2007 and threatened that Dukemaster would re-enter and take possession of the shop if the rent remained unpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">Secondly, on obtaining the independent market rent determination in late July 2007, Ms Wong refused to give Mr Tan and Mrs Lai a further term on the lease despite having made previous offers (including one in June 2007 --- see [169]) of a further term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">That conduct, in the context of the earlier conduct (see [194] above) was unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">(4) RELIEF 
 In relation to these contraventions of the TPA, it is appropriate that there be declarations and injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">In addition, pursuant to s 87(1A) (read with s 87(1AA)) of the TPA, the Respondents should refund to Mr Tan and Mrs Lai the amount of rent they were overcharged totalling $91,889.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">The sum of $91,889 is calculated by subtracting the market rent from the rent in fact they paid from 21 May 2004 up to and including 24 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">For the reasons given earlier (see [142] above), on the question of interest, under s 51A of the FCA, Mr Tan and Mrs Lai were entitled to interest on those amounts from the date of payment up to and including 28 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">That amount of interest is $27,191.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">The ACCC also sought interest on the total amount from 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">For the reasons given earlier (see [143] above), the form of the order sought by the ACCC is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">Instead, the Respondents should pay Mr Tan and Mrs Lai interest on the amounts overpaid (see [223] above) from and including 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">If the parties are unable to quantify that amount, they may have the matter re-listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">That leaves one final amount --- the ACCC sought an order that the Respondents pay a further $1,650 for the valuation for the rental for the Third Shop 4 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">I do not consider that this it is an amount that Mr Tan and Mrs Lai should recover from the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">Mr Tan and Mrs Lai exercised a legal right available to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">Contrary to the ACCC's submissions that was necessary and, moreover, it achieved its objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">E. SHOPS 1 AND 2 --- BOXCAR CAF&Eacute; 
(1) FACTS 
 (A) 2000 --- EARLY 2004
 Boxcar Caf&eacute; stands apart from many of the Food Court shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">The business is owned by Gomax, a company registered in Victoria on 11 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">Gomax has six (6) directors: Reaky Mi Yee Ho ("Mrs Ho") and her husband Roddy Fu Wa Ho, Ronald Yue Lung Ma ("Mr Ma") and his wife Kam Ping Lau, Yoon Choong Lai and Maryanne Shin Quan Lau.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">The directors had previously operated successful portable food stalls at various markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">Boxcar Caf&eacute; is the company's sole business activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">Mrs Ho was born in Hong Kong in 1960 where she worked as a tailor for over 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">In 2000, she came to Australia with her husband and daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">She speaks fluent Cantonese and good Mandarin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">Her ability to read and write English is limited and she relies upon her husband to interpret and write documents relating to the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">She gave evidence through a Cantonese Interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">One of the other directors, Mr Ma was also born in Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">In July 2000, he came to Australia with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">He is fluent in Cantonese and can speak and read English well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">He holds a Bachelor of Applied Science and is employed as the Team Leader of the advisor remuneration team at a large insurance company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">In early to middle 2002, the directors met and decided to contribute to buy a caf&eacute; and to register Gomax as a company to own the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">In early October 2002, Mrs Ho and Mr Ma discovered the Boxcar Caf&eacute; in the Food Court was for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">Mrs Ho went to the Paramount Centre and sat in the Food Court for one week from 7:00am until 3:00pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">The other Gomax directors also visited the Paramount Centre to observe the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">From late October to early December 2002, Mr Ma and Mrs Ho negotiated with the then owner of Boxcar Caf&eacute;, Meng, to purchase the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">On 27 October 2002, Mrs Ho signed a contract of sale on behalf of Gomax to purchase the business subject to a successful trial period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">The trial period was from 25 November 2002 until 7 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">At the end of the trial period, Mrs Ho, Mr Lai and Mr Ma met with Ms Wong to obtain Dukemaster's approval to take over the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">At that time, the lease still had two years to run with an option for a further term of four years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">To the extent that the leasing history was not in dispute, it is summarised in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">The transfer of the lease was signed by Mr Ma and Mrs Ho on about 20 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">Gomax purchased the Boxcar business for about $340,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">Mrs Ho paid one third of the purchase price (secured by a mortgage against her home) with Mr Ma (also secured against his family home) and Mr Lai each paying one third.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">Gomax took over Boxcar on 20 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">Boxcar Caf&eacute; sells sandwiches, hot and cold drinks, hot and cold breakfasts and has a hot and cold food bar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">For the first seven months of trading (until around July 2003), Mrs Ho and Mr Ma worked in the business with the assistance of nine part time staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">After that time, Mrs Ho managed the day to day operations of Boxcar Caf&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">The directors of Gomax met and continue to meet about every three months to make the key decisions about the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">Events then shift towards the end of 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">There is a dispute about the circumstances in which Gomax gave notice to Dukemaster at the end of 2003 that it wished to renew the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">According to Mrs Ho, it was during a conversation in late 2003 that Ms Wong reminded Mrs Ho that Gomax's lease was due to expire in January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">Mrs Ho says that the conversation was in Cantonese and that Ms Wong told her that the end of the lease was coming up in January, Gomax should have told her half a year ago in writing that they wanted to renew the lease, she had the right to not renew the lease but was prepared to renew it if Gomax wanted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">According to Mrs Ho, when she told Ms Wong that Gomax did want to renew the lease, Ms Wong asked that Mrs Ho write a letter to her confirming that fact and, although Mrs Ho could not produce the letter, her evidence was that Mr Ma drafted a letter for her which she sent to Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">The Respondents' position in relation to this series of events was not consistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">Initially, the Respondents' amended points of defence contended that Mrs Ho telephoned Ms Wong and, in Cantonese, asked for a renewal of the lease which request Ms Wong acceded to but asked Mrs Ho to make the request in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">The Respondents' amended points of defence contended that it was during this conversation that Ms Wong offered to renew the lease for a rental of $72,000 plus GST, that the offer was accepted by Mrs Ho and that subsequently Dukemaster received a letter from Mr Ma, on behalf of Gomax, indicating Gomax's desire to renew the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">Ms Wong's later evidence was that first, on 27 November 2003, Dukemaster sent a letter to Gomax in the following terms ("27 November 2003 letter"): 
We note the lease for the above shops will expire on 22/01/2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">Please advise by 5.00pm 8 th December, 2003 whether you will exercise the option for a further term of 4 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">Should you wish to exercise the option for a further term, we advise the rent for the above shops will be $72,000 pa plus GST commencing 23/01/2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">We believe the new rent is very reasonable and below the market value .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">If you object to our proposed rent, the matter will proceed to valuation in accordance with clause RC3.2 of the lease contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">(Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">Mrs Ho does not recall this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">Ms Wong's handwritten note on Dukemaster's copy of the letter reads: 
Tenant requested new lease of 1 term of 3 years &amp; further term of 3 years with commencing rent $72,000 pa + GST for 1 st year of 1 st term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">12/12/03
 
 
Ms Wong's evidence was that note recorded a later conversation she had with Mrs Ho.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">I do not accept the Respondents' first version of events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">It is highly improbable that Mrs Ho would have contacted Ms Wong and then asked for a rent increase and to a specified sum as large as $72,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">Not only did Ms Wong confirm Mrs Ho's evidence that Mrs Ho did not know at the time of the conversation that she had to renew the lease but the contents of the subsequent letter sent by Gomax did not refer to the amount of the rent at all, let alone agreement that the rent would be $72,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">In relation to the second version of events, there are two issues in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">First, what was the first event - the 27 November 2003 letter or a conversation between Ms Wong and Mrs Ho - and secondly, was a second term of three years raised during the conversation whenever it occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">I find that it is more likely than not the 27 November 2003 letter was the first step and that it was the receipt of that letter that prompted an enquiry by Mrs Ho about whether Dukemaster was prepared to grant a new lease of one term for three years and a further term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">It was then during the subsequent conversation that they discussed a commencing rent of $72,000 per annum plus GST for 1 st year of 1 st term in place of a renewal for a further term of four years as then existed (as is recorded on Dukemaster's copy of that letter: see [237] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">In late December 2003 or early January 2004, Dukemaster instructed its lawyers to prepare lease documents for the new lease of one term for three years and a further term of three years with commencing rent $72,000 per annum plus GST for 1 st year of 1 st term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">On 15 January 2004, the lease documents were handed to Mrs Ho.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">The covering letter stated, in part: 
...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">If you have a solicitor acting for you in this matter we suggest that you take the enclosed documents to your solicitor as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">If you execute and return the Lease to us without advice from a solicitor our client will treat your execution and return of the Lease as acknowledgement by you that you are satisfied with all the terms and conditions in the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">Having made the findings in [238] above about what transpired in late 2003, it follows that I reject Mrs Ho's evidence that she was surprised to find in January 2004 that the lease contained a further term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">I do however accept that Mrs Ho did not understand the difference between renewal of the old lease and the granting of a new lease but that she and the other directors of Gomax signed the lease on the basis that the $72,000 Rent was acceptable to them in light of the additional lease term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">On 20 February 2004, Mr Ma and Mrs Ho signed the new lease on behalf of Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">The commencement date was 23 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">On 12 March 2004, Gomax received written confirmation from Dukemaster that it had signed the new lease and received a copy of the signed lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">Again, to the extent that the history was not in dispute, it is summarised in Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">(B) 2004 --- 2007 INCLUDING 3 JANUARY 2007 LETTER AND JANUARY 2007 CONVERSATION
 By late 2004, Gomax's takings had fallen by about 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">The position continued to decline during 2005 and 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">Initially, some blame for this decline was attributed to the opening of two new shops that competed with Gomax for customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">Such blame seems misdirected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">In cross examination it became apparent that one of these stores had opened in 2003, and the other opened in late 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">However, regardless of the reasons for decline in profits, it is clear that such a decline occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">In order to reduce Boxcar's costs, Mrs Ho reduced both the number of part time staff working in the caf&eacute; and the hours of trading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">The Gomax directors decided to try and sell the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">All the Gomax directors agreed that they would stop receiving any money from the business to fund the loans they had taken out to purchase the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">In August 2006, Mrs Ho asked Mr Ma to write a letter to Dukemaster confirming that Gomax wanted to exercise the option to renew the lease for another term of three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">On or about 21 August 2006, Mrs Ho hand delivered the following letter to Mr Sant: 
I am writing on behalf of all directors of ... [Gomax], to confirm that we would like to exercise the option for another term of 3 years, as stated in the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">Thank you kindly for your attention!</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">Mrs Ho's evidence was that she wanted to renew the lease because she knew that it would be easier to sell the business if there was a longer lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">The date is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">It is the date immediately preceding the 22 August 2006 meeting between Ms Wong and Mr Hii: see [89] to [100] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">Gomax received no immediate response to its letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">What then happened was in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">Mrs Ho's evidence was that in October 2006 she telephoned Ms Wong and asked her why she had not responded to her 21 August 2006 letter and that Ms Wong responded saying that she did not have any idea how much rent they should charge Boxcar and that she would get someone to tell her how much to charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">Mrs Ho's further evidence was that she responded by asking Ms Wong to let her know as soon as she could.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">Ms Wong did not recall that this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">Significantly, Mrs Ho was not cross examined about the fact or contents of the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">I accept Mrs Ho's evidence in relation to this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">Despite the letter of 21 August and the October 2006 conversation, Dukemaster did not address the issue of the rent for the exercised option for Shops 1 and 2 until 3 January 2007 when Mr Sant hand delivered the following letter to Mrs Ho: 
Thank you for your exercise of option for further term of 3 years in relation to the above lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">We note the current lease expires on 22 nd January 2007 and we advise the following:
 
 
Commencement Date: 23 rd January 2007
 
 
Rent per annum 1 st year $96000.00 (plus GST)
 
 2 nd year: To CPI
 
 3 rd year: To CPI
 
 
Please advise by 5.00pm 10 th January 2007 whether you accept this offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">We believe the new rent is very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">If you object to our proposed rent, the matter will proceed to valuation in accordance with clause 5-16(A) of the lease contract.</sentence>

<sentence id="s1183">The form and content of this letter (subject to different particulars) was the same as the letter Dukemaster sent to the Korean Lunch Box on the same date (see [35] above) and to East on Paramount on 5 March 2007 (see [160] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">Mrs Ho read the letter and understood the substance of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">This was the first time that Dukemaster had told Gomax about the fact and size of the rent increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">Mrs Ho was shocked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">She had expected an increase but not an increase of that size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">At that time, Gomax was paying $83,000 rent per annum plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">Mrs Ho telephoned Mr Ma and told him about the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">Shortly after that telephone conversation, the Gomax directors met to discuss the letter and decided that Mrs Ho should try and talk to Ms Wong about not raising the rent so high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">On 9 January 2007, Mrs Ho telephoned Ms Wong to make an appointment to meet with her to discuss the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">Ms Wong agreed to meet her the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">Before Mrs Ho met with Ms Wong she learned that she could ask for a 21 day cooling off period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">Ultimately, there was no dispute that Mrs Ho met with Ms Wong on 10 January 2007, being the last day for Gomax to respond to the 3 January 2007 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">I say ultimately because the Respondents' amended points of defence in fact denied "that any meeting was requested by Mrs Ho or [was] held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">" By the time of trial, the Respondents' position had changed - there was no dispute that Mrs Ho met with Ms Wong on or about 10 January 2007 but they disputed Mrs Ho's evidence of the contents of that conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">Mrs Ho's oral evidence was she asked Ms Wong if she could reduce the rent and Ms Wong replied saying that she would not reduce the rental and that the rent was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">Mrs Ho's evidence was that she told Ms Wong that "the business at the time was very bad, not many customer, so it's impossible that the rental was that expensive" to which Ms Wong again said that the rent was correct, that the Paramount Centre was a good centre and that when you compared the Paramount Centre to QV, the Paramount Centre was as good a centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">Mrs Ho said she responded saying that it was impossible to compare the Paramount Centre with QV and that there was a lot more traffic at QV because they had a lot more shops there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">Mrs Ho said that Ms Wong again said that the rent was correct and that there was no other way that she could help her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">Mrs Ho's evidence was that she told Ms Wong that she would go home to consider and that she was entitled to a 21 day cooling off period to which Ms Wong responded that it was "okay for [her] to go home to have a think".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">Mrs Ho was not cross examined about the contents of this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">Ms Wong's evidence was that the conversation at the meeting with Mrs Ho was very brief and that Mrs Ho said that the rent was a bit high, asked whether Dukemaster could lower the rent and then asked for more time to consider the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">Ms Wong agreed that she said that they should have 21 days to review the lease and gave evidence that she told Mrs Ho to take her time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">I accept Mrs Ho's version of what transpired at the meeting on 10 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">At that time, the principal issue was the size of the rent increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">On 30 January 2007, a further meeting was held between Ms Wong and Mrs Ho.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">There is no dispute that the meeting took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">The dispute concerned what transpired at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">Mrs Ho's evidence was that at this meeting she asked Ms Wong again to see whether she could lower the rent and Ms Wong responded by saying, "There's nothing I can do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">I can't help you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">The only thing I could help you that I would give you a few more years' lease, so that it would be easier for you to sell the business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">Mrs Ho says she replied that "If you give me longer lease, but the rent was so expensive, I still have to sell the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">There's no potential buyer would like to buy a business, which does not generate profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">" At the end of this exchange, Mrs Ho said that Ms Wong wrote on the 3 January 2007 letter saying that the lease would be five by five, showed the letter with the handwritten annotation to her and said, "That's the only thing I could help you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">" Ms Wong then explained to Mrs Ho that there would be a five by five lease with a market rent review in the fourth year and another market review two years later so that within these years, the scale of the rental increase would not be that big.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">After that, Mrs Ho said Ms Wong signed the letter, she said to Ms Wong that she was not willing to sign the letter but she had no option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">Mrs Ho said that she then signed the letter after she said to Ms Wong that if she signs, she dies and if she does not sign, she also dies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">Ms Wong then copied the letter and gave her a copy of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">Ms Wong's version of the meeting was that Mrs Ho called to make an appointment to see her again towards the end of January and that when she came she asked whether Dukemaster could lower the rent to which Ms Wong replied that they thought the rent was right and that Dukemaster could not lower the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">The dispute commences at this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">Ms Wong's version was that Mrs Ho spoke about selling her business and asked whether she could have a further term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">Ms Wong's version was that Mrs Ho asked for a new long lease to which Ms Wong agreed and then Mrs Ho pressed for that offer to be put in writing straight away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">It was the last part, the request for it to be put in writing straight away, that was said to explain why Ms Wong wrote the offer on the 3 January 2007 letter there and then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">Ms Wong's evidence was that Mrs Ho pressed for the letter so that it could be shown to her shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">This suggestion was never put to Mrs Ho and should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">Finally, it was common ground that Ms Wong explained the rent reviews for the first year, second year and fourth year of the lease term and that the review for the fourth year of each term and the first year of the second term would be a market review as distinct from CPI increases in the other years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">In any event, on 5 February 2007, Dukemaster's lawyers sent a letter to Gomax enclosing the lease in duplicate, the disclosure statement and the retail leases information brochure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">The letter contained the usual closing paragraph: 
If you have a solicitor acting for you in this matter we suggest that you take the enclosed documents to your solicitor as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">If you execute and return the Lease to us without advice from a solicitor our client will treat your execution and return of the Lease as acknowledgement by you that you are satisfied with all the terms and conditions in the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">On receiving the letter and the documents, Mrs Ho decided to hold off signing the new lease for as long as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">Mrs Ho continued to pay the rent payable under the old lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">No one from Dukemaster spoke to her about paying the old rent although Mr Sant did ask her on one occasion when she would return the new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">On 22 March 2007, Gomax received a letter from Dukemaster's lawyers in the following terms: 
...
 
 
We are instructed that despite several requests from our client, you have not signed and returned the Lease documents forwarded to you on the 5 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">By your conduct, you have repudiated our client's offer to you of the new Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">You have further confirmed your repudiation by failing to pay our client the rent of $8,000.00 per calendar month plus GST (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">$96,000.00 per annum plus GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">You have instead chosen to pay the rent of $6,943.10 per calendar month (inclusive of GST) which we note is the rent payable by you during the third and final year of the Lease which expired on the 22 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">Our client has now instructed us to inform you that due to your above-mentioned conduct, it is withdrawing its said offer of a new Lease to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">Your repudiation of our client's said offer made it unnecessary for our client to withdraw its offer but we have been instructed to clearly put it to you that our client's offer of the new Lease has been withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">Our client further instructs us that you have exercised your option for the further term of three (3) years under the Lease dated the 20 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">Pursuant to the option exercised by you, we now enclose herewith the following: - 
 
 
...
 
 
We will prepare the Lease and forward to you or your Solicitor when the first year rent for the Renewed Lease is agreed to by you and our client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">Our client has proposed the $96,000.00 per annum plus GST for the first year of the Renewed Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">Our client is of the opinion that the rent of $96,000.00 per annum plus GST is the market rent for the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">We are instructed that you have so far not agreed to the rent proposed by our client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">Under Clause 5.16A of the Lease , if both parties cannot agree on the rent, then the rent is to be determined by a Valuer appointed by the President of the Australian Institute of Valuers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">Our client requires your response to our client's proposed rent of $96,000.00 per annum plus GST by the 26 March 2007 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">If we do not have your response by the 26 March 2007, out client proposes that the rent be determined by a Valuer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">...
 
(Emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">Mr Ma explained the letter to Mrs Ho.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">She understood that she still had a three year lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">Mrs Ho told the other Gomax directors that she would continue to pay the old rent in the hope that Dukemaster would lower the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">At about this time, Mrs Ho met with the owners of two other shops in the Food Court (Mrs Tan of East on Paramount and Irene Watt of Chine on Paramount) and they decided to share the cost of a rental determination as described in [162] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">On 24 March 2007, Mrs Ho delivered a letter addressed to Dukemaster in the following terms: 
This letter is to advise that the rental charges of $96,000.00 per annum offered in the Renewed Lease to [Gomax] is NOT accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">On about 17 April 2007, Gomax received a letter from Dukemaster's lawyers in the following terms: 
We are instructed that you are in default under the Lease as you have failed to pay the monthly rent of $7,107.45 (inclusive of GST) due on the 1 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">We are further instructed that no arrangements have been made by you with the Landlord to pay the outstanding amount despite request to you by our client for payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">Please note that the April rent is based on the final year's rent of the expired Lease until you and our client come to an agreement on the rent for the first year of the Renewed Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">Notice is hereby given that unless outstanding amount totalling $7,107.45 is paid by 3.30pm on or before Tuesday, 24 April 2007, our client will re-enter and take possession of the premises without any further notice to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">In the event that our client re-enter (sic), and take possession of the premises, we have instructions to issue legal proceedings against you to recover all damages suffered by our client as a result of your defaulting on the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">We advise that the Landlord is also entitled to charge interests (sic) on the overdue moneys.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">Our client reserves all its rights under the Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">The letter is in the same terms as the letter sent to the owners of East on Paramount on the same date with the same deadline: see [166] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">As with East on Paramount (see [167] above), this was the first time that Gomax had received a letter of demand for late payment of rent and shortly after receiving the letter, Mrs Ho paid the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">As discussed previously, Mr Sheehan released the rental determinations in late July 2007: see [171] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">Mr Sheehan determined the rent for Shops 1 and 2 for the period from 23 January 2007 to 22 January 2008 at $65,000 per annum plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1266">The rent charged by Dukemaster ($96,000 excluding GST) is more than 45% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($65,000 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1267">About two weeks later, Mr Sant hand delivered to Mrs Ho a copy of the new lease with the annual rent in accordance with the determination by Mr Sheehan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1268">The lease did not contain any further terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1269">Mrs Ho and Mr Ma each took the issue up with Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1270">Mrs Ho telephoned Mrs Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1271">Mrs Ho's evidence was that Ms Wong told Mrs Ho that there would be no further term because the rent was much lower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1272">Ms Wong's evidence was that she told Mrs Ho that there would be no further term because the renewal option was not exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1273">Mr Ma's evidence was that Ms Wong told him that because Gomax had refused to take up the lease at $96,000, she was not going to extend the lease any more for Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1274">Ms Wong's evidence was that she told Mr Ma the same thing she told Mrs Ho --- that there was no further term because the renewal option was not exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1275">I reject Ms Wong's evidence in relation to both these conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1276">The reason given by her --- namely that there would be no further term because the renewal option was not exercised --- is improbable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1277">That is precisely what occurred in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1278">The only difference this time was that Gomax had rejected Dukemaster's stipulated rent and gone to a rental determination which was unsuccessful from Dukemaster's perspective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1279">Mrs Ho did not sign the new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1280">She hoped Dukemaster would agree to provide a further term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1281">No one from Dukemaster approached Mrs Ho or Gomax about the failure of them to sign the new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1282">Attempts by Gomax to sell the Boxcar Caf&eacute; have been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1283">Mrs Ho's evidence is that it will be very difficult to get a good price for the business because there is no guarantee of a further term when the current lease expires in 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1284">The two issues --- not agreeing to a higher rent and the lack of an additional term --- are interrelated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1285">As Mrs Ho said in her affidavit evidence: 
Gomax was in a no-win situation: if we had agreed to the higher rent we would have paid too much as the rental determination showed that the amount Dukemaster tried to charge us was much too high, yet now we are paying a fair rent, we cannot get any further term on Gomax's lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1286">In either event, the business would not have been saleable for a good price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1287">(2) CONDUCT MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE OR LIKELY TO MISLEAD OR DECEIVE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1288">
 The ACCC had a number of complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1289">Each complaint dealt with separate representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1290">Although some of the representations contain common elements, each must be considered separately because each is said to constitute a separate contravention of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1291">(A) LATE 2003 CONVERSATION
 First, the ACCC contended that the statements made by Ms Wong to Mrs Ho in late 2003 (see [234 and [235] above) were misleading and deceptive because Dukemaster represented to Mrs Ho that the time for Gomax to exercise its option to renew the lease for Shops 1 had 2 had expired ("the First Gomax Representation"), when, in fact, the time for Gomax to exercise its option had not expired because as a result of Dukemaster giving Gomax written notice under s 18(3) of the Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 (Vic) ("the RTRA"), the time for Gomax to exercise its option to renew the lease continued until at least six months after the requisite notice was eventually given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1292">Two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1293">(1) Was the representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1294">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1295">The First Gomax Representation was conveyed by the late 2003 conversation: see [234] and [235] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1296">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1297">The representation was false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1298">As the Respondents' Counsel submitted, the lease for Shops 1 and 2 (which was entered into in 2000) was a lease subject to the RTRA: see s 4(1), (2) and (4) of the RTRA and ss 2(5) and 11(1) and Pt 14 of the Retail Leases Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">Section 18 of the RTRA (in force in late 2003) provided: 
(1) In this section "option" does not include the statutory option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">(2) If a retail premises lease contains an option exercisable by the tenant to renew the lease for a further term, the lease must state---
 
 
(a) the date until which the option is exercisable; and
 
 
(b) the manner in which the option is to be exercised; and
 
 
(c) the terms and conditions upon which the lease is renewable under the option; and
 
 
(d) the manner in which the rent payable during the term for which the lease is renewed is to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">(3) If a retail premises lease contains an option exercisable by the tenant to renew the lease for a further term, the landlord must notify the tenant in writing of the date after which the option is no longer exercisable---
 
 
(a) at least 6 months; and
 
 
(b) no more than 12 months---
 
 
before that date but is not required to do so if the tenant exercises, or purports to exercise, the option before being notified of the date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1302">(3A) If a retail premises lease contains an option exercisable by the tenant to renew the lease for a further term, the only circumstances in which the option is not exercisable is if---
 
 
(a) the tenant has not remedied any default under the lease about which the landlord has given the tenant written notice; or
 
 
(b) the tenant has persistently defaulted under the lease throughout its term and the landlord has given the tenant written notice of the defaults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">(4) If sub-section (3) requires the landlord to notify the tenant but the landlord fails to do so within the time specified by that sub-section---
 
 
(a) the retail premises lease is taken to provide that the date after which the option is no longer exercisable is instead 6 months after the landlord notifies the tenant as required; and
 
 
(b) if that date is after the term of the lease ends, the lease continues until that date (on the same terms and conditions as applied immediately before the lease term ends); and (c) the tenant, whether or not the landlord has by then notified the tenant as required, may give written notice to the landlord terminating the lease from a specified day that is---
 
 
(i) on or after the date on which the term of the lease ends; and
 
 
(ii) before the date until which the lease would otherwise have continued because of paragraph (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">(5) If the tenant gives the landlord a notice of termination under sub-section (4)(c), the lease terminates on the day specified in the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">(6) If an option to renew is exercised because of subsection (4)(b) after the term of the lease ends, the lease for the further term commences on the expiry of the previous lease, disregarding for this purpose any period during which that lease continued because of that sub-section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">(7) The amendments made to this section by section 105 of the Retail Leases Act 2003 only have effect from 1 November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">The lease for Shops 1 and 2 contained "an option exercisable by the tenant to renew the lease for a further term": see Annexure A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">And contrary to Ms Wong's representations, the time for the exercise of that option had not expired because, contrary to s 18 of the RTRA, Dukemaster had not given notice in accordance with s 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">Again, however, that finding ([269] and [270] above) does not provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that the representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1311">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">In relation to this conduct, it did induce error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1313">Mrs Ho understood that the time for the exercise of the option had expired when it had not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1314">Unsurprisingly, it was never put to Mrs Ho or Mr Ma that the representation (if made) would not have induced error because they were somehow aware of s 18 of the RTRA and the obligations it imposed on Dukemaster, obligations which Dukemaster did not discharge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1315">For those reasons, the conduct comprising the First Gomax Representation was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1316">(B) 3 JANUARY 2007 LETTER
 Secondly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 3 January 2007 letter (see [247] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by that letter, Dukemaster represented to Gomax that: it believed that the proposed rent for the Third Shops 1 and 2 Lease (again, as pleaded by the ACCC) of $96,000 plus GST from 23 January 2007 to 22 January 2008 ("the $96,000 Rent") was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Second Gomax Representation"); it had a reasonable basis for believing that the $96,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value ("the Third Gomax Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $96,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1317">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 from 23 January 2007 to 22 January 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was approximately $65,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1318">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1319">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1320">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1321">The ACCC's complaint concerns the representations that the $96,000 Rent was "very reasonable" and "below the market value" and that Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for believing that the $96,000 Rent was very reasonable and below the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">Again, those issues are interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">In its terms, the 3 January 2007 letter made the Second and Third Gomax Representations: see [247] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">None of the principals of Gomax were in a position to know whether or not Dukemaster had sought valuation advice or information about comparable rents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">Mrs Ho did however ascertain from discussions with other tenants that Dukemaster had put up the rents of other tenants in the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">I have earlier analysed the market rent evidence in 2006 and 2007: see [88] to [111] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 in January 2007 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shops 1 and 2 was "very reasonable" and "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1330">As explained earlier (see [10(1)] above), if the evidence shows that the opinion expressed by Dukemaster lacked any or any adequate basis, the conduct contravenes s 52 of the TPA only if that conduct induces or is capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1331">In this context, we are concerned with the latter because as the summary of facts records (see [259] to [264] above), Gomax was not induced into error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1332">If the rent referred to in the 3 January 2007 letter was in fact "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value", then it would not be shown that the conduct complained of by the ACCC could induce or would be capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1333">In relation to Shops 1 and 2, I consider that the conduct complained of is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because it is much more probable than not that the $96,000 Rent was not "very reasonable" and / or "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1334">Mr Sheehan had earlier expressed an opinion on the current market rent of Shops 1 and 2 for the annual period commencing on 23 January 2007: see [259], [262] and [263] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1335">In that report, he described Shops 1 and 2 as "situated in the northwest section of the Little Bourke Street level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1336">In comparison to the other food services outlets within the [F]ood [C]ourt, [Shops 1 and 2] has a wide frontage of about 15 m which provides for a double outlet width.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1337">[Shops 1 and 2] includes an extensive service counter behind which is a partition wall section dividing the food preparation, cooking, washing and cool room area ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1338">The condition of improvements as inspected appeared well maintained ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1339">In preparation of his 2008 Report, Mr Sheehan was asked the following question in relation to Shops 1 and 2, Shop 4 and Shops 9 and 10: 
Do you remain of the view of Current Market Rent you expressed in each of the rental determination reports dated 26 July 2007 (for Shops 1 &amp; 2, Shop 4 and Shops 9 &amp; 10)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1340">In his 2008 Report, Mr Sheehan stated: 
Since concluding my assessments of current market rent applicable to each of the Determinations in July 2007, I have not become aware of any information which would affect my assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1341">It is noted that since these Determinations were made, the Lebanese Caf&eacute; (FJ Caf&eacute;), French Patisserie (Duchess Anne French Patisserie) and a Supermarket / Liquor Store have closed, the Soup &amp; Sandwich (Soupfrenzzy) appears to have been rebranded and that the retail complement appears not to have increased in vibrancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1342">I addressed the substance of this evidence at [200] --- [201].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1343">The rent proposed to be charged by Dukemaster ($96,000 excluding GST) is more than 45% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($65,000 excluding GST): see [262] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shops 1 and 2 for the annual period commencing on 23 January 2007 of $96,000 (excluding GST) was "very reasonable" or "below the market value" (as the 3 January 2007 letter stated it to be), or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shops 1 and 2 for that period was greater than $96,000 (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the Second and Third Gomax Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">The $96,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "very reasonable" nor "below the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">(C) 10 JANUARY 2007 CONVERSATION
 Thirdly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the 10 January 2007 conversation (see [249] - [252] above) were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because, by that conversation, Dukemaster represented to Gomax that: $96,000 was the market rent ("the Fourth Gomax Representation"); and Dukemaster had a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $96,000 Rent was the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 ("the Fifth Gomax Representation"), 
when, in fact, Dukemaster did not believe and did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the $96,000 Rent was the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 from 23 January 2007 to 22 January 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was approximately $65,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">The Fourth and Fifth Gomax Representations were conveyed by the 10 January 2007 conversation: see [249] - [252] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">As discussed earlier (see [278] above), the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster making the Fourth and Fifth Gomax Representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation evidence or advice in relation to the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 for the period from 23 January 2007 to 22 January 2008 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 4 was "the market rent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">Again, that finding ([289]) does not provide a sufficient basis for the further finding that each representation was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error: see [10(1)] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">However, in light of the market evidence considered earlier (see [278] above) and in the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shops 1 and 2 for the annual period commencing on 23 January 2007 of $96,000 (excluding GST) was "the correct amount" or "the market rent" or that Ms Wong genuinely believed the market value of the rent for Shop 1 and 2 for that period was $96,000 (excluding GST), I can only conclude that the Fourth and Fifth Gomax Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">(3) UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">
 The ACCC also alleged that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">In relation to Shops 1 and 2, those allegations fall to be considered under the following headings: 
(a) First Renewal in late 2003 / early 2004;
 
(b) Second Renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">A summary of the relevant legal principles is set out in Section B above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">Again, given my earlier findings in relation to s 52 of the TPA, and subject to the question of the appropriateness of any declarations and injunctions, a contravention of s 51AC would not otherwise add to or alter the other relief available: see generally Part VI of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">(A) FIRST RENEWAL
 The ACCC's first complaint was that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the renewal of the Shops 1 and 2 Lease in late 2003 / early 2004 (see Annexure A) was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA by reason of a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">As I said earlier (see [127]), s 51AC of the TPA does not require resolution of whether the factors listed by the ACCC are proved or not proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">The question is whether the supply by Dukemaster of those lease premises to Gomax was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">In assessing that question, the ACCC contends that the matters listed in s 51AC(3)(a), (c), (d) and (k) are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">Notwithstanding that the First Gomax Representation was conveyed and was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Gomax, in all the circumstances, I do not consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the Renewal of the First Shops 1 and 2 Lease and the "negotiation" of the Second Shops 1 and 2 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">The fact that the "partners" in Gomax decided to incorporate Gomax to conduct the business cannot be and is not determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">Similarly, Mrs Ho's limited command of written and spoken English is not determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">There were other directors of Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">The other directors Gomax included highly educated people who met "about every three months to make the key decisions about the business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">Gomax had the ability and the means to protect its interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">The failure of Dukemaster to comply with the RTRA is a serious matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">However, I am not satisfied that having regard to the composition of the board of directors of Gomax and the manner in which Gomax made key decisions about its business, that Dukemaster's conduct contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">In my view, s 51AC of the Act is not intended to provide a safety net for those corporations and individuals who have the ability and means (relative to the supplier) to deal with lease issues and yet, for reasons unexplained, fail to take any or sufficient steps to protect themselves or who make a commercial decision which ultimately proves to be the wrong decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">In this case, those "lease issues" included the requirement that Dukemaster give notice for exercise of the renewal in accordance with s 18 of the RTRA and the decision to accept rent of $72,000 under a new lease with an additional term instead of a renewal of the existing lease with a right to a rental determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">In my view, although Dukemaster's conduct was contrary to s 18 of the RTRA, it cannot be said that that conduct contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">It was not irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable in the manner described by Foster J in Allphones Retail (No.2) [2009] FCA 17: see [17] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">(B) SECOND RENEWAL
 Although I do not consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the First Renewal of Shops 1 and 2 Lease was unconscionable, the position in relation to the Second Renewal of the Shops 1 and 2 Lease is different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">Each of the Second to Fifth Gomax Representations was conveyed and was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Gomax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">But those misrepresentations and the circumstances in which those representations were made (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">Dukemaster not having obtained any or any appropriate valuation evidence or advice in relation to the market rental for Shops 1 and 2 for the annual period from 23 January 2007) are only part of the picture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">When the representations did not achieve Dukemaster's desired result (a lease at $96,000), Dukemaster embarked on conduct in relation to the Second Renewal which, in all the circumstances, was unconscionable in contravention of s 51AC of the TPA by reason of: the 3 January 2007 letter was the first notification to Gomax of the $96,000 Rent notwithstanding that: 
(a) Gomax had confirmed it wished to exercise the option for an additional term on 21 August 2006: see [244] above;
 
(b) Dukemaster had decided on the $96,000 Rent by no later than 23 August 2006 but took no step to advise Gomax until 3 January 2007: see [89], [92] and [247] above; and
 
(c) in October 2006, when Gomax contacted Dukemaster and asked them for a response to the 21 August 2006 letter, Dukemaster not only told Gomax that it "did not have any idea how much rent they should charge" (which was untrue) but Dukemaster did not respond to a reasonable request from Gomax to be told as soon as it could.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">Dukemaster not only knew and did not tell Gomax, it made false statements to Gomax;
 the 3 January 2007 letter required a response within seven days at a time when independent advice was not readily available and when there was no explanation provided by Dukemaster to justify the limited time in which Gomax could respond; in late January 2007, Dukemaster offered Gomax a longer term lease if it agreed to the $96,000 Rent and then sought to have Mrs Ho sign up to the new terms on a copy of the 3 January 2007 letter all at a time when Dukemaster knew the Boxcar business was not going well and Gomax were trying to sell the business: see [253] above; on 22 March 2007, Dukemaster sent the 22 March 2007 letter withdrawing the offer of a new lease with the additional term: see [258] above; on 17 April 2007 and contrary to prior practice (see [261] above), Dukemaster's lawyers sending a letter of demand to Gomax for non payment of rent and threatening repossession of the premises; in August 2007, Dukemaster hand delivered lease documents for signing by Gomax with rent in accordance with the Sheehan rental determination but excluding any additional term: see [263] above; in August 2007, Dukemaster refused to resurrect the previous offer of an additional term despite being asked to do so by Gomax for the stated reason that because Gomax had refused to take up the lease at $96,000, Dukemaster was not going to extend the lease any more to Gomax: see [263] above; and Dukemaster conveying the Second to Fifth Gomax Representations, some in the circumstances outlined above in English when it knew Mrs Ho had little or no ability to speak or read English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">
The conduct just described was deliberate and directed at achieving one objective --- rent of $96,000, which was substantially in excess of the market rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">And then when that objective was threatened and ultimately not achieved, Dukemaster's deliberate conduct continued to be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">For those reasons, that conduct was unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">(4) RELIEF 
 Again, in relation to these contraventions of the TPA, it is appropriate that there be declarations and injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">In addition, pursuant to s 87(1A) (read with s 87(1AA)) of the TPA, the Respondents should refund to Gomax the amount of rent they were overcharged totalling $16,882.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">The sum of $16,882 is calculated by subtracting the market rent from the rent in fact they paid from 23 January 2004 up to and including 22 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">For the reasons given earlier (see [142] above), on the question of interest, under s 51A of the FCA, Gomax was entitled to interest on those amounts from the date of payment up to and including 28 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">That amount of interest is $5,427.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">The ACCC also sought interest on the total amount from 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">For the reasons given earlier (see [143] above), the form of the order sought by the ACCC is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">Instead, the Respondents should pay Gomax interest on the amounts overpaid (see [302] above) from and including 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">If the parties are unable to quantify that amount, they may have the matter re-listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">That leaves one final amount --- the ACCC sought an order that the Respondents pay a further $1,650 for the valuation for the rental for the Third Shop 4 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">I do not consider that this is an amount that Gomax should recover from the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">As with Mr Tan and Mrs Lai, Gomax exercised a legal right available to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">Contrary to the ACCC's submissions that was necessary and, moreover, it achieved its objective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">F. SHOP 8 --- BAISO CAF&Eacute; 
(1) FACTS 
 (A) Up to 2004
 Baiso Japanese Caf&eacute; is in Shop 8 in the Food Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">The business is owned by Mr Mei who works full time in the caf&eacute; as a cook and is responsible for managing the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">He has owned and operated the business since July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">Mr Mei was born in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">He arrived in Australia in 1990 on a student visa and for the next five years worked as a cook in several take away shops in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">From 1995 to 2000, he managed a Chinese take away shop in the Chadstone Shopping Centre called "Sizzling Wok".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">For the last 12 months of that period, he owned a 30% share in that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">Mr Mei's English is limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">He speaks Mandarin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">Mr Mei gave evidence through an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">Mr Mei is married to Xin Lei Sheng ("Mrs Sheng").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">His wife also works in the caf&eacute; as a cook.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">Mrs Sheng left China in 1995 to join her husband and arrived in Australia together with their only daughter, Michelle Mei ("Ms Mei").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">On her arrival in Australia, she worked in a chocolate factory and then for a food company for three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">At the end of that period, Mrs Sheng worked in another take away food shop called "Asian Gourmet" in the Chadstone Shopping Centre and other take away food shops in the Southland Shopping Centre where she made sushi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">Mrs Sheng speaks fluent Mandarin but her English is limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">Mrs Sheng gave evidence through an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">Their daughter, Ms Mei, is currently 24 years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">Until late 2006, Ms Mei also worked in the caf&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">She currently works full time at Monash University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">She speaks English and Mandarin and sometimes translates and interprets for her parents on important matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">Mr Mei gave evidence that in April 2004 (before concluding the negotiations to buy the business then being operated at Shop 8), he and the existing owner of O Bento met Ms Wong at which time he outlined his experience to Ms Wong and, in response to him asking Ms Wong for a new lease with a five year term and a five year option, Ms Wong responded by saying that there would be no more five by five leases, the new lease would be three by three, she could not offer a new lease and that if the business did well, Dukemaster would offer a new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">Ms Wong's evidence was that Mr Mei spoke about his previous experience and the fact that he intended to change the name of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">Ms Wong did not refer to Mr Mei asking any question about a new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">I accept Mr Mei's version of what transpired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">The fact that Mr Mei was looking for a new lease with a longer term and an option to renew was commercially sensible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">The existing lease only had two years left to run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">Moreover, Mr Mei was not cross examined about the contents of the conversation and Ms Wong (who was in Court throughout Mr Mei's evidence) did not contradict Mr Mei's recounting of what transpired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">In June 2004, Mr Mei negotiated to purchase the "O Bento" business then operating from Shop 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">Mr Mei gave evidence that he believed Ms Wong when she said that if the business did well, she would grant him a new lease and he was confident that he and his wife could do well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">The transfer of the existing lease was signed on 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">The lease was a five year lease due to expire on 27 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">To the extent that the leasing history of the tenancy was not in dispute, it is summarised in Annexure A. Baiso started trading on 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">(B) 2006 - 2008
 Towards the end of 2006 or early 2007, Mr Mei was aware that he would have to ask Dukemaster for a new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">Consistent with the terms of the existing lease, the rent and promotional fee payable to Dukemaster had increased to $5,710.34 a month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">At that time, the annual rent component was $63,813.76 (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">Baiso could not afford to pay a much higher rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">Again, despite Dukemaster having held the 22 and 23 August 2006 meetings and having determined the rent for Shop 8 at that time (see [89] to [100] above), in contravention of s 16 of the RTRA Dukemaster took no step to contact Mr Mei to discuss granting him a new lease or advising him of the new rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">I deal with this issue in further detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">On 10 March 2007, Mr Mei (with the assistance of his daughter) wrote to Dukemaster in the following terms: 
Dear Dukemaster Pty Ltd:
 
 
I am the owner of Baiso Japanese Caf&eacute; in the Paramount Retail Centre food court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">I am aware that our lease ends on 28 July 2007, I would like [to] continue by signing a new lease with Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">Can you please arrange a time for a discussion at your convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">Thank you very much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">In April or May 2007, Mr Mei met Ms Wong and Mr Sant to discuss the new lease for Baiso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">The fact of the meeting was not in dispute ("the May 2007 conversation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">Mr Mei's evidence was that Ms Wong and Mr Mei spoke in Mandarin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">Ms Wong and Mr Sant spoke in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">Mr Sant did not speak Mandarin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">Ms Wong offered Mr Mei a three by three year lease, first year rent of $80,000 per annum plus GST with CPI rent increases after each year, market rent review at the end of the third year and no more promotional fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">Mr Mei said the rent was too high and that it would put too much pressure on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">He asked for a lower rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">Ms Wong responded saying that she was the manager, not the boss and that Ms Wong would have to take it to the bosses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">Mr Mei reiterated that the length of the lease was acceptable but not the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">Mr Mei asked Ms Wong to write the new rent down so that he could have a comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">Ms Wong then did some calculations on a piece of paper which she gave to Mr Mei - existing monthly rent was $5,995.84 and the future rent was $7,333.33.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">During the course of this meeting, Mr Mei said that Ms Wong sought to compare the rent for Shop 8 with the rents for other shops in the Food Court and said that the rent for Shop 8 was very similar or comparable to that in the Target Centre or QV Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">Mr Mei was not cross examined about the contents of his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">Ms Wong (who sat in Court during Mr Mei's evidence) did not contradict Mr Mei's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">She recalled Mr Mei asking for a lower rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">The lack of contradiction is not surprising given the contents of subsequent correspondence: see [317] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">Mr Mei discussed the rent increase with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">On 16 May 2007, a letter was sent to Dukemaster signed by Mr Mei in the following terms: 
Since our discussion on 10 th May, both my wife and I are very grateful for your help and consideration in many aspects of our business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">As for the topics raised in this meeting, we have decided to agree on the following:
 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">Rent will increase in accordance with CPI
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">Promotion fees will be cancelled
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">Rent period will by 3 by 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">However, there are several issues that we'd still like to raise with the shopping centre:
 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">Since we purchased the business in 2004, rent has increased by 5% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">At the same time, due to the shortage of rain and water, prices for nearly all of the raw materials we use have increased as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">Chilli prices have sky rocketed to $50/kg, snow peas to $16/kg, prices of egg (sic) have increased from $22/box to $40, and chicken meat have increased from $4.2/kg to $6.2/kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">However, we have kept our selling prices steady throughout this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">Not that we don't want to increase, but due to the concern that our customer flow is very limited and competition in the area is very fierce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">Under this sort of circumstances, the increase of rent to $88,000 per annum including GST will be too much for us to handle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">Can I please invite the shopping centre management to re-consider our difficulties and give us a more acceptable rent rate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">In regards to the offer made by the shopping centre to lease to us the idle shop space near the lift, after careful consideration, we have decided not to accept this offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">The main reason is that we have to pay an extra $20,000 of rent per annum plus renovation costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">We are not confident that we will be able to make as much profit as the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">Therefore, we would like to pass the offer on and sincerely thank you for your support and consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">I am looking forward to your reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">During cross examination, another version of this letter was shown to Mr Mei and his daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">The other version contained more sophisticated language and was more structured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">The author of the letter was not established although Mr Mei's daughter believed she might have sent the draft by email to her father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">Notwithstanding the differences in language and structure, the letter was substantially in the same terms as the letter ultimately sent to Dukemaster: see [315].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">Dukemaster responded on 26 June 2007 when Mr Sant hand delivered a letter to Mr Mei from Dukemaster's lawyers in the following terms: 
...
 
 
We refer to your letter of the 16 May 2007 to our client, and note that you have rejected our client's offer of a New Lease for the above premises for a term of three (3) years and an option of a further term of three (3) years at the commencing rent of $80,000.00 per annum plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">We note that as you have rejected our client's offer, you will now have the following two (2) options at the expiration of the current term on the 27 July 2007:
 
 
 Option 1: Continue to occupy the premises pursuant to the Holding Over provision under Clause 3.2 of the Lease, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">on a month-to-month basis at the rent of $80,000.00 per annum plus GST on or from the 28 July 2007 and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as the current Lease; or
 
 
 Option 2 : Vacate the premises at the expiration of the Lease, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">on or before the 27 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">Should you take Option 2, we refer to you to Clause 11 of the Lease which requires you to remove your installations / fittings and make good any damages or disfigurements caused to the premises and return the premises to the Landlord in a condition as at the Commencement Date, fair wear and tear excepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">We will also advise the Landlord to contact you to arrange for a final inspection to be conducted on the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">Please advise us as soon as possible whether or not you will take Option 1 or Option 2 so that we can advise our client accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">We await your prompt response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">Mr Mei had difficulty understanding the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">He understood that the rent was to be $80,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">He asked his daughter to translate the letter for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">Mr Mei was shocked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">He did not believe that he had rejected the offer of a new lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">He knew he had disagreed with the rent but was waiting for Ms Wong to come back to him after she had spoken to her boss about the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">As his letter of 16 May stated, he wanted a meeting to discuss the rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">Mr Mei showed the letter to his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">Neither option in the letter was acceptable to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">However, he knew he had to get a lease to protect his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">Mr Mei decided that even if he had a rent he could not afford, it was a lesser evil than the other option given to him in the letter --- lose his business and then possibly his house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">Mr Mei asked his daughter to respond by email to Dukemaster's lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">A letter was sent by his daughter in the following terms: 
Dear Mr Lim
 
 
My name is Michelle Mei and I write in regards to the letter we received from you on 26 June 2007, titled Lease: Dukemaster Pty Ltd to MEI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">It was stated in the letter that because Mei rejected Dukemaster's offer of a New Lease that he is now provided with two options at the expiration of the current lease on 27 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">I do not know if you have a copy of the letter Mei wrote to Dukemaster on 16 May 2007, or maybe you can contact your client to get a copy, but there was nothing in that original letter that insinuated in anyway that Mei was going to reject the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">The letter was set out in a format that some agreed points and some disagreed points and the main objective of that letter was to arrange a one-on-one meeting with Dukemaster to discuss about the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">Up until now, Baiso Japanese Caf&eacute; has not received anything in writing that resembled a lease, all that was said previously was the rent was to increase to $80,000, but no official lease was ever provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">Therefore, I think a misunderstanding has occurred regarding Mei's letter to Patricia Wong on 16 May 2007, and I'd appreciate it if you could contact your client and notify them that the offer of a New Lease was never rejected by Baiso in anyway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">In the meantime, Mei is hoping that he will be able to receive a copy of the New Lease so that he can have someone translate it for him to Mandarine (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">Mei's English ability is very limited, and that might have been a vital reason that caused this misunderstanding and confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">If it's possible, Baiso would like to arrange for a meeting with Patricia Wong in the presence of the Small Business Commissions in the near future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">Your help and understanding on this matter will be very much appreciated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">Regards

 Several days later, Mr Sant came to Shop 8 and collected Mr Mei to attend a meeting with Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1517">The meeting was attended by Ms Wong, Mr Sant and Mr Mei.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">It lasted for about 1 hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">Again, during the meeting, Mr Mei and Ms Wong spoke in Mandarin and Mr Sant and Ms Wong spoke in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">Ms Wong told Mr Mei that the tone taken by its lawyers in the letter dated 26 June 2007 was not representative of Dukemaster's attitude and that Dukemaster was not the sort of landlord who would just kick a tenant out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">Ms Wong also told Mr Mei that he should not pay attention to what was said by the other tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">During the course of this meeting, Mr Mei said he would accept the lease and the $80,000 rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">On 2 July 2007, Mr Sant hand delivered to Mr Mei another letter from Dukemaster's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">The letter enclosed a copy of the new lease together with other documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">At about this time, Mr Mei became aware that three other tenants in the Food Court were about to renew their leases and had decided to go to a rent determination rather than pay the rent proposed by Dukemaster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">One of the shops, East on Paramount, was larger than the shop operated by Mr Mei and in a similar location.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">Mr Mei decided to wait until these rental determinations were completed before he signed the lease for Baiso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">Mr Mei did not think that $80,000 was the market rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">Mrs Sheng's sworn viva voce evidence was that at least on two occasions after receiving the 2 July 2007 letter, she discussed the proposed lease with Ms Wong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">At least one of these conversations occurred about two days before the lease was due to expire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1531">Mrs Sheng's evidence about the timing and contents of these conversations was not altogether clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1532">At one point, Mrs Sheng admitted that it was possible that at least some of the matters allegedly discussed post 2 July 2007 could have been discussed as early as April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">However, it remained her uncontested evidence that at some point after she received the new lease, she discussed a number of matters with Ms Wong, including that she believed the rent was too high and that she was concerned that the new lease did not say that Baiso would be the only Japanese take away restaurant in the Food Court (the "July 2007 conversation").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">Ms Wong denied that any oral conversation occurred regarding the lease after 2 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">I reject Ms Wong's denial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">Counsel for the Respondents did not challenge Mrs Sheng's evidence that there was at least one occasion where Mrs Sheng asked Ms Wong for 60 days to sign the lease and Mrs Wong refused, saying that someone else was waiting to take the premises if Mr Mei and Mrs Sheng did not sign the lease Moreover, the Respondents' Counsel did not challenge Mrs Sheng's statement that "we had many discussions, we didn't only have one discussion, we had many discussions and definitely we had discussion that last time" (being where the conditions of the new lease were discussed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">Mr Mei signed the new lease on 25 or 26 July 2007, two days before the lease was to expire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">A week later, Mr Mei learned that the rental determinations had been completed and that the rent for East on Paramount (a larger shop) was about $40,000 per year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1539">Mrs Sheng's sworn viva voce evidence was that she had a discussion with Ms Wong about the "rental determinations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1540">The precise circumstances in which this conversation took place were not altogether clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1541">Mrs Sheng's evidence was that after she became aware of the rental determination for East on Paramount she approached Ms Wong about lowering the rent and Ms Wong refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1542">Counsel for the Respondents did not challenge Mrs Sheng's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1543">(2) CONDUCT MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE OR LIKELY TO MISLEAD OR DECEIVE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1544">
 The ACCC had two complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1545">Each complaint dealt with separate representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1546">Although some of the representations contain common elements, each must be considered separately because each is said to constitute a separate contravention of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1547">(A) MAY 2007 CONVERSATION
 First, the ACCC contends that the contents of the May 2007 conversation were misleading and deceptive because, by the May 2007 conversation, Dukemaster represented to Mr Mei that: the proposed $80,000 rent plus GST ("the $80,000 Rent") for the Second Shop 8 Lease was reasonable and was the market value ("the First Mei Representation"); and it had a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $80,000 Rent was reasonable and was the market value ("the Second Mei Representation"), 
when, in fact, the $80,000 Rent was not reasonable and Dukemaster did not have a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $80,000 Rent was reasonable and the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1548">Moreover, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 8 from 28 July 2007 to 27 July 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was significantly less than $80,000 and was approximately $40,250 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1549">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1550">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1551">First and Second Mei Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1552">It must be recalled that the Respondent's Counsel did not seek to cross examine Mr Mei about the contents of the May 2007 conversation: see [314] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1553">Each of the First and Second Mei Representations was conveyed by the May 2007 conversation: see [314] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1554">First and Second Mei Representations Misleading or Deceptive or Likely to Mislead or Deceive
 Taken as a whole, the evidence reveals no basis for Dukemaster holding a belief that the rent for Shop 8 was "reasonable" and "the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1555">Dukemaster had not obtained valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 8 for the period from 28 July 2007 to 27 July 2008 that provided a basis for it holding a belief that the rental it was seeking for Shop 8 was "reasonable" and "the market value": see [88] to [111] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1556">Conduct Induce or Capable of Inducing Error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1557">As explained earlier (see [10(1)] above), if the evidence shows that the opinion expressed by Dukemaster lacked any or any adequate basis, the conduct contravenes s 52 of the TPA only if that conduct induces or is capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1558">If the rent was in fact "reasonable" and / or "the market value", then it would not be shown that the conduct complained of by the ACCC could induce or would be capable of inducing error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1559">In relation to Shop 8, I consider that the conduct complained of is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive because it is much more probable than not that the $80,000 Rent was not "reasonable" and / or "market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1560">I have addressed the evidence of Mr Sheehan above see: [71] to [83].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1561">In relation to Shop 8, Mr Sheehan was asked to express an opinion on the current market rent of Shop 8 for the annual period commencing on 28 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1562">Against the background set out in the earlier analysis (see [71] to [85] above]) in dealing with Shop 8, Mr Sheehan noted that the previous rent for the shop for the period from 28 July 2006 to 27 July 2007 was $63,813.81 per annum (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1563">Shop 8 he described as "situated within the eastern section of the Little Bourke Street level adjacent to the double access doors leading to the loading dock and the garbage area" and "[i]n comparison to other food service outlets within the food court it has a smaller than average frontage of about 6m".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1564">As the summary of evidence records (see Annexure C) Mr Sheehan expressed that the market rent for Shop 8 for the annual period from 28 July 2007 was $40,250 (excluding GST), not $80,000 (excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1565">The rent proposed to be charged by Dukemaster ($80,000 excluding GST) is more than 95% above the market rent identified by Mr Sheehan ($40,250 excluding GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1566">In the absence of positive evidence from the Respondents that the market value of the rent for Shop 8 for the annual period from 28 July 2007 of $80,000 (excluding GST) was "reasonable" or "market value", I can only conclude that the First and Second Mei Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Mr Mei.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1567">The $80,000 Rent (excluding GST) was neither "reasonable" nor "the market value".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1568">(B) JULY 2007 CONVERSATION
 Secondly, the ACCC contends that the contents of the July 2007 conversation were misleading and deceptive because, by the July 2007 conversation, Dukemaster represented to Mr Mei that: the $80,000 Rent was reasonable and the market value ("the Third Mei Representation"); and it had a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $80,000 Rent was reasonable and the market value ("the Fourth Mei Representation"), 
when, in fact, the $80,000 Rent was not reasonable and Dukemaster did not have a reasonable basis for expressing its opinion that the $80,000 Rent was reasonable and the market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1569">Again, the ACCC submitted that Dukemaster had not obtained appropriate valuation advice or evidence in relation to the market rental for Shop 8 from 28 July 2007 to 27 July 2008 and that if it had done so, the market value was significantly less than $80,000 and was approximately $40,250 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1570">Again, the two questions arise in the context of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1571">(1) Was each representation conveyed and (2) if yes to (1), was it misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1572">Third and Fourth Mei Representations Conveyed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1573">I reject the ACCC's contention that each of the Third and Fourth Mei Representations was conveyed by the July 2007 conversation: see [322] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1574">The evidence did not disclose that Ms Wong made those representations during those conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1575">The claim fails at the first hurdle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1576">(3) UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT 
 The ACCC also alleged that Dukemaster's conduct was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1577">Those allegations concern the "negotiation" of the Second Shop 8 Lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1578">A summary of the relevant legal principles is set out in Section B above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1579">Again, given my earlier findings in relation to s 52 of the TPA, and subject to the question of the appropriateness of any declarations and injunctions, a contravention of s 51AC would not otherwise add to or alter the other relief available: see generally Part VI of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1580">(A) "NEGOTIATION" OF SECOND SHOP 8 LEASE
 The ACCC's complaint was that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the negotiation of the Second Shop 8 Lease (see Annexure A) was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA by reason of a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1581">As I said earlier (see [127]), s 51AC of the TPA does not require resolution of whether the factors listed by the ACCC are proved or not proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1582">The question is whether the supply by Dukemaster of lease premises to Mr Mei was, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1583">In assessing that question, the ACCC contends that the matters listed in s 51AC(3)(a), (c), (d), (j) and (k) are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1584">In all the circumstances, I consider that Dukemaster's conduct in relation to the negotiation of the Second Shop 8 Lease was unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1585">Each of the First and Second Mei Representations were conveyed and were not only misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive (see [325] --- [334] above) but were conveyed in circumstances where: Dukemaster knew from the outset that Mr Mei wanted a new lease: see [309] above; the representations were intended by Dukemaster to secure a new lease at a rental for which there was no basis beyond Dukemaster's decision to seek the amount stated; they were in breach of s 16 of the RTRA, that where a retail premises lease does not have an option under the lease to renew the lease for a further term (as was the case with the Baiso Lease), Dukemaster:
 
... must, at least 6 months but no more than 12 months before the lease term ends, give written notice to the tenant -
 
 
(a) offering the tenant a renewal of the lease on the terms specified in the notice (including a term setting out the rent); or
 
 
(b) informing the tenant that the landlord does not propose to offer the tenant a renewal of the lease,
 
 
Dukemaster failed to inform Mr Mei until April 2007 (only three months before the expiration of the lease) that it would grant him a new lease and the rental at which the new lease would be offered in circumstances where Dukemaster knew both of those facts as early as August 2006;
 Dukemaster refused to consider a request to reduce the $80,000 Rent notwithstanding other tenants had sought rental determinations and the results of those determinations were imminent; Dukemaster instructed its lawyers to send a letter of demand (see [317] above) when it knew that Mr Mei wanted a new lease, had not rejected the lease but wished to discuss the amount of the rent (see [315] above); Dukemaster refused Mr Mei's request for 60 days to consider the new lease notwithstanding that its failure to comply with s 16 of the RTRA resulted in the existing lease continuing for at least six months after the requisite notice was given in April 2007: see s 16(3) of the RTRA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1586">
Dukemaster's conduct was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1587">For those reasons, that conduct was unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1588">(B) CONDUCT AFTER ENTRY INTO SECOND SHOP 8 LEASE
 Finally, the ACCC complaint was that Dukemaster's conduct after entry into the Second Shop 8 Lease was unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AC(1)(a) of the TPA by reason of a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1589">Again, in assessing that question, the ACCC contends that the matters listed in s 51AC(3)(a), (c), (d), (j) and (k) are relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1590">In all the circumstances, I consider that Dukemaster's conduct after the entry into the Second Shop 8 Lease was unconscionable because Dukemaster refused to address Mrs Sheng's complaint regarding the excessive rent for Shop 8 notwithstanding that it had just been provided with a copy of the Rental Determination for a larger shop (Shop 4) which was substantially lower than the $80,000 Rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1591">For those reasons and the other reasons identified earlier (see [339]-[342], that conduct was irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1592">It was unfair and unreasonable and contravened s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1593">(4) RELIEF 
 Again, in relation to these contraventions of the TPA, it is appropriate that there be declarations and injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1594">In addition, pursuant to s 87(1A) (read with s 87(1AA)) of the TPA, the Respondents should refund to Mr Mei the amount of rent he was overcharged totalling $63,683.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1595">The sum of $63,683.00 is calculated by subtracting the market rent from the rent in fact they paid from 28 July 2007 up to and including 2 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1596">For the reasons given earlier (see [142] above), on the question of interest, under s 51A of the FCA, Mr Mei is entitled to interest on those amounts from the date of payment up to and including 28 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1597">That amount of interest is $4,623.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1598">The ACCC also sought interest on the total amount from 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1599">For the reasons given earlier (see [143] above), the form of the order sought by the ACCC is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1600">Instead, the Respondents should pay Mr Mei interest on the amounts overpaid (see [344] above) from and including 1 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1601">If the parties are unable to quantify that amount, they may have the matter re-listed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1602">That leaves two other issues --- a continuing claim for excessive rental and an order that the Second Shop 8 Lease be varied to reduce the rental payable by Mr Mei to $40,250 for the period from 28 July 2007 to 27 July 2009 with effect from 1 March 2009 to prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered by Mr Mei.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1603">The ACCC is not entitled to both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1604">The first is problematic because the loss and damage has not yet crystallised --- the rent has not been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1605">There is power to make the second order: s 87(1A) (read with s 87(1AA)) of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1606">However, in the circumstance, I do not propose to exercise my discretion and make an order in the terms sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1607">To do so would deal with first one term of the lease (rent) whereas other terms (including lease terms) were also in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1608">G OTHER MATTERS 
 (1) SIMILAR FACT EVIDENCE
 Although the conduct complained of by the ACCC in relation to each of the tenancies shares common characteristics, Counsel for the ACCC conceded the negotiations concerning the renewal of each lease should be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1609">I have therefore dealt with the matter on the footing that the events surrounding each tenancy should be treated separately from the events relied on in connection with other tenancies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1610">Although I have noted at various points in these reasons for decision, for the assistance of the reader, some of the more striking similarities and points of connection between the various events that give rise to these proceedings, I have not, and I am not to be understood as having, relied on propensity or similar fact reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1611">Having regard to the way in the matter was argued by the parties, I have refrained from making any finding about whether some underlying unity of conduct on the part of Dukemaster could be identified as informing or explaining what transpired with individual tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1612">(2) TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 It is neither appropriate nor possible to determine, for each of the tenants the taxation consequences of the award of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1613">The tenants will have to individually deal with the Australian Taxation Office in relation to them: see Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1 at [60] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1614">H. ORDERS 
 The ACCC proposed draft orders in the event that it was successful in whole or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1615">For the following reasons, the orders I propose to make to give effect to my findings are in some respects substantively different from the orders sought by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1616">The orders sought by the ACCC may be divided into a number of categories: declarations of contraventions of the TPA; injunctions; orders under s 87 of the TPA; disclosure orders; and compliance orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1617">Subject to minor matters, I have adopted the substance of the orders proposed by the ACCC in relation to categories 3 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1618">In relation to category 1 (the declarations of contraventions of the TPA), I have adopted in substance the orders proposed by the ACCC in relation to the contravention of ss 52 and 53(e) of the TPA but not the orders proposed by the ACCC in relation to the contravention of s 51AC of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1619">In my view, the declarations which I propose more appropriately reflect the needs of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1620">In relation to category 2 (injunctions), I consider that the conduct in this case is one which supports the grant of injunctions in the terms I have proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1621">The first substantive difference is that the injunctions are limited to the Food Court, where each of the tenancies in dispute was located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1622">The Paramount Centre (see [1] above) is a large building comprising a number of elements and numerous tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1623">This proceeding was not concerned with and did not consider Dukemaster's conduct in relation to those other elements or those other tenants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1624">As has been said on many occasions, an injunction should relate to the conduct established by the evidence and indicate the conduct which is enjoined so that there can be no doubt what is expected of the parties enjoined: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1625">Melway Publishing Pty Ltd v Robert Hicks Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 13 ; (2001) 205 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1626">Secondly, I do not consider that it is appropriate to grant the ACCC the mandatory injunctions it sought requiring Dukemaster (a) to deliver a written notice to each tenant that exercises an option to renew a lease in prescribed terms by prescribed dates and (b) to make its initial offers of a proposed rental in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1627">First, the Retail Leases Act contains provisions which I have little doubt that Dukemaster is now well aware of --- it must comply with them and failure to do so carries with it the consequences set out in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1628">The relevant provisions of the Retail Leases Act might change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1629">In those circumstances, it is inappropriate to grant the first kind of mandatory injunction sought by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1630">The second, the requirement that its initial offers of a proposed rental be in writing, is also inappropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1631">It lacks specificity --- for example, what is an "initial offer"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1632">Moreover, what contravention of the TPA is the injunction addressing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1633">That brings me to the disclosure orders (category 4) proposed by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1634">In general terms, the order required Dukemaster to translate a letter that the ACCC had drafted into Chinese and then to send the translated letter to each tenant and each former tenant of the Paramount Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1635">Putting to one side that the reference to tenants and former tenants of the Paramount Centre is inappropriate (see [353] above), the substance of the letter drafted by the ACCC lacked specificity and, in my view, raised more questions than it answered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1636">Moreover, as these reasons for decision demonstrate, a finding of contravention of the TPA by Dukemaster in relation to one tenant does not translate into a contravention against another tenant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1637">The facts of each tenancy must be considered separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1638">
