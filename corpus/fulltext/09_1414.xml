 INTRODUCTION 
 The appellant is a citizen of China, born in 1978, who arrived in Australia on 6 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He claimed to fear persecution in China based on his Christian activities and beliefs and his involvement in anti-Three Gorges Dam activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant applied for a protection visa, which a delegate of the Minister refused to grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He was invited to and did attend a hearing on 6 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant and a witness attended a further hearing on 12 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal made a decision affirming the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Federal Magistrate Driver dismissed the appellant's application for review of the Tribunal decision ( SZNLJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 606).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This is an appeal from his Honour's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Before the Tribunal, the appellant claimed that he had suffered persecution in China by reason of his involvement in Christian activities and anti-Three Gorges Dam activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He claimed to have become a Christian in May 2007 and to have distributed religious materials and the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He claimed to have been involved with protests by peasants who had migrated due to the Three Gorges Dam project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He says that he was arrested, detained, tortured and subjected to physical and mental persecution as part of a process called "education through labour" between 1 November 2007 and 31 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">After this incident, he went into hiding, illegally obtained an Australian visa and fled China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He claimed that he would be arrested if he returned to China because he had taken part in the underground movement of Christians and distributed religious materials and had helped the Three Gorges Dam peasants in their protests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant also claimed that after he arrived in Australia, he attended the Christian Assembly of Sydney church in Lidcombe and a Christian church in Auburn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In view of the matters raised in the appeal, it is relevant to give some further detail of the basis of the appellant's claims, as recorded by the Tribunal in its decision which, in turn, included the appellant's statement made in support of his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In his application, the appellant stated that from the time he became a Christian in May 2007, he spent almost all of his spare time with Mr Liu, his friend who had spread the Christian Gospel to him, and attended religious gatherings including Bible studying and weekly worship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Some months after that, he was baptised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The gathering group of which he became a member which had started with only three people, including himself, was developed into 83 church brothers and sisters including six sub-groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellant told the Tribunal that he wanted to spread the Gospel with Mr Liu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He said that he spread the Gospel when they assembled and when they distributed leaflets and the Bible to various people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal questioned the appellant as to what he told people when he spread the gospel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In response, he stated that he had seen a developer who did not pay construction workers on time and ' if he had been Christian he would not have done this, they should adhere to the Bible teaching that is they should not steal '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He also stated that he told residents of the Three Gorges area about stories in the Bible, mainly that God and Jesus had not forsaken them, as well as asking for religious freedom, respect for the constitution and help for the Three Gorges peasants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He told the Tribunal that he had read the Bible and explained his understanding of what the Bible said and represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Tribunal asked him if he read or studied anything other than the Bible and the appellant responded that he read Christian News and propaganda materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The appellant also stated that he bad been baptised and that other rituals included taking the 'waiver' [sic], the grape juice, singing, prayer on a Sunday and studying the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">When asked by the Tribunal whether there were other important rituals during a Christian life, he said confession (or, by reason of translation, perhaps baptism), marriage, prayer in the morning and before meals and prayer and mass on Sundays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was a citizen of China but did not otherwise accept the appellant's claims, finding that he was not a credible witness and did not appear to know much about Christianity in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence regarding how he came to Australia and his evidence regarding a person called Mr A Long who, he said, had provided assistance to him, as implausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal also found that the appellant's lack of knowledge of the church he attended in Sydney meant that it could not be satisfied that the appellant had attended that church other than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Accordingly, the Tribunal disregarded his conduct in Australia pursuant to s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal concluded that, as to the appellant's claim that he was a Christian: The Tribunal concluded that, based upon the appellant's overall lack of credibility, it was not satisfied that the appellant had suffered past harm as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal found that the appellant did not hold any Christian convictions and that there was no real chance of the appellant being persecuted now or in the foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S COURT 
 The grounds of the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrate's Court were: Federal Magistrate Driver was satisfied on the material before him, including the Tribunal's hearing record, that the hearing afforded the appellant was a real one and that there was no breach of s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">His Honour did not accept that the Tribunal's decision was illogical or unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Rather, his Honour concluded that the Tribunal had a made a reasoned assessment of the appellant's claims and evidence and found a lack of credibility in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">His Honour concluded at [8] that the adverse credibility findings made by the Tribunal were open to it on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Federal Magistrate Driver also found that the challenge based on s 424A of the Act had no substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Even though his Honour was of the view that the country information referred to by the Tribunal did not "figure" in the findings and reasons ultimately made by the Tribunal, his Honour observed that, in any event, there was no obligation on the Tribunal to disclose that information by reason of s 424A(3)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His Honour also expressed the opinion that the Tribunal probably exceeded its obligations pursuant to s 424AA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">That did not mean, his Honour observed, that the Tribunal exceeded its obligations such that there was any indication of error going to jurisdiction but merely that the Tribunal's approach enhanced the fairness of the hearing opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Two unpleaded grounds of review were raised during the hearing before Driver FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The first was that the appellant said that he was disadvantaged because he had not had the benefit of advice under the Minister's Panel Advice Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">While the appellant had asked to participate in the Scheme and a panel advisor had received the court book from the Minister's solicitors, it appeared that the advice had not been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Federal Magistrate Driver noted that the appellant had told him from the bar table that, while he had received the letter from the Court concerning the advisor, he did not understand the contents of it and did not ask his migration agent or anyone else to explain the letter to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">His Honour considered that in the circumstances as presented to him, the Court and the Minister had done all that they could to assist the appellant and that the non-receipt of advice was not a reason to delay the Court's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The appellant also alleged bias on the part of the Tribunal during the hearing in the Federal Magistrate's Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">As noted by Driver FM, the appellant supported this contention by detailed disagreement with the Tribunal's reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">His Honour explained to the appellant that even if the appellant's claims before the Tribunal were true and the Tribunal made mistakes in rejecting those claims, that would not establish bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In any event, his Honour found no evidence of the Tribunal's presiding member having a closed mind or even of a reasonable apprehension that the presiding member did not bring an unprejudiced mind to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">That is, Driver FM did not accept that the Tribunal was biased simply because the appellant disagreed with the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">THE NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 The grounds in the notice of appeal are: The Federal Magistrate erred in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Federal Magistrate was wrong in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal acted properly in its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The grounds are unparticularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">However, the appellant has filed written submissions which set out grounds of appeal and particulars of those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">They do not accord with the filed notice of appeal but the Minister takes no issue with that and has addressed the appellant's written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">THE APPEAL 
 Ground 1 --- section 420 
 The appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 420 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He submits that if the Tribunal did make a significant mistake and that if a differently constituted Tribunal might have reached a different decision, then it must be clear that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with s 420.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Section 420 of the Act is a facultative non-restrictive provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Its purpose is to free tribunals, at least to some degree, from constraints otherwise applicable to courts of law and regarded as inappropriate to tribunals ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [49] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Section 420 informs the grounds of review specified in s 476 of the Act but has only an indirect effect on review proceedings ( Eshetu at [76] per Gaudron and Kirby JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That is, the section does not impose procedures the breach of which gives rise to a ground of review ( Eshetu at [77]) per Gaudron and Kirby JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In any event, even if the appellant were to establish that the Tribunal made a "significant mistake", that does not necessarily establish jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The fact that, theoretically, another Tribunal may have reached a different decision on the claims as presented by the appellant does not mean that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 420.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The ground of appeal based on a contravention of s 420 is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Ground 2 --- access to legal advice
 The appellant submits that the Federal Magistrate failed ' to create a fair chance for [him] to seek [his] judicial review for the Tribunal's decision '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">This ground concerns access to legal advice through the Panel Advice Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It is apparent from the Federal Magistrate's decision that the appellant had asked to participate in the Panel Advice Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">A panel advisor had been provided and the Minister had sent the requisite material to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The advisor was contacted by the court on 8 May 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He advised that he had thought himself able to provide advice by 9 June 2009 and that he would send back an "Advice Given Form" to the Registry once advice had been given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It did not appear that the form had been returned prior to the hearing on 26 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">His Honour said that while in his view it was unfortunate that the appellant had apparently not received the advice pursuant to the Scheme, the Court and the Minister's solicitors had done what they could do to facilitate the provision of the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">As recorded in his Honour's reasons, the appellant accepted that he had received the letter from the Court concerning the allocation of a panel advisor but said that he did not understand the contents of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">His Honour said that for reasons best known to the appellant he did not ask his migration agent or someone else to explain the letter to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant said that he had talked about the letter with his migration agent who said that counsel would contact him and that he did not know how to make contact himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">These two versions are obviously inconsistent but it is not necessary to resolve the inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It is not the duty of the Federal Magistrates Court to ensure that those appearing before it obtain legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The appellant was represented by a migration agent, including at the time of receipt of the letter concerning the Panel Advice Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The letter stated that if the applicant had not heard from counsel within three weeks after the receipt of the green book from the Court, the applicant should contact counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The appellant did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The appellant does not challenge the fact that the Federal Magistrates Court and the Minister's solicitors had done what they could in relation to the provision of the advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">However, I considered that a short time should be allowed to enable the panel advisor to provide the advice and for the appellant to provide any further written submissions based upon that advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Court has received confirmation by the panel advisor that he met with the appellant on 9 November 2009 and provided written advice to the appellant on 12 November 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Further written submissions have been received from the appellant and written submissions in reply have been received from the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That disposes of this ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Ground 3 --- Bias / apprehended bias
 The appellant submits that the Tribunal member had a closed mind or that there was a reasonable apprehension that she did not bring an unprejudiced mind to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The particulars and submissions given in support of this ground contained in the appellant's first set of submissions all raise factual matters concerning the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In his further written submissions, the appellant submits that the Tribunal failed to provide him with a genuine opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing and that it had already formed a firm view before he was questioned about his faith because it was affected by incorrect independent country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">He refers to SZMSS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 93 in support of this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is apparent that the appellant disagrees with the factual findings of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That does not provide a basis for the serious allegation of actual bias, nor does it indicate that the Tribunal had a mind ' incapable of alteration ' or that ' a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge [or Tribunal] might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided ' ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [72] ; VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102 at [25] citing Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Contrary to the appellant's submission, the Tribunal's reasons at [29] to [33] indicate that the appellant was given the opportunity to speak generally about his faith at the Tribunal hearing (cf SZMSS at [12]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">For example, the appellant recounted his conversion to and practice of Christianity and explained his understanding of the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal asked the appellant why he converted to Christianity and what he told people when he spread the gospel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">These questions were largely responsive to the matters raised by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Other questions asked by the Tribunal concerned the appellant's own practice of Christianity in China and whether he had read or studied anything other than the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Otherwise, the Tribunal asked the appellant a question about each of the second coming and the appellant's view of creation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The appellant answered each question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There is no indication in the Tribunal's reasons that it asked these questions in a manner that suggested pre-judgment or a closed mind (cf SZMSS at [15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Questions exploring the appellant's knowledge of his claimed faith, on which he relied as a basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, do not of themselves indicate bias or a closed mind or a failure to consider the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The Tribunal then turned to the appellant's knowledge of the Church he attended in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It put a number of questions concerning the beliefs and practices of the Church to the appellant and to Mr Ng, known as Brother Wu, who had accompanied the appellant to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The Tribunal said that it had done some reading about the Church and it appears that such reading may have informed the Tribunal's questions to the appellant and Mr Ng.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">However, this does not indicate bias or a closed mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The ground of appeal based on an allegation of bias or apprehended bias by the Tribunal is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Did the Tribunal fail properly to consider the appellant's claim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The appellant raised a further matter at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He noted that the Tribunal made its finding that he was not a Christian based on his lack of detailed knowledge of the Bible and of the Church he had attended in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He said that he only converted to Christianity recently, in 2007, and never claimed to have in depth knowledge of the Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He said that he was not a Christian who based his faith on detailed knowledge of the Scriptures but that he was simply a follower of Christ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He said, in effect, that the Tribunal failed to consider his claim to be such a Christian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">While this ground raises interesting questions of philosophy, it does not accord with the appellant's claims as made to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The appellant told the Tribunal that he had studied the Bible and that Bible study was one of the tenets of Christianity that he followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Tribunal tested those assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Tribunal considered whether it was satisfied that the appellant was a Christian in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The Tribunal's conclusions were not based only or primarily on a failure on the part of the appellant to answer detailed questions about Christian beliefs and practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">If they had been, there would be some merit in the appellant's ground of appeal that the Tribunal failed to consider his claim that he was a recent convert to Christianity and that being a Christian or a follower of Christ, as the appellant claimed, did not necessitate a detailed knowledge of the Scriptures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The Tribunal considered the appellant's Christian faith in two contexts: in China and in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The transcript of the Tribunal hearing is not in evidence and the course of the hearing can be taken from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The nature of the discussion at the hearing regarding the appellant's Christian beliefs and practices in China and more generally has already been set out earlier in these reasons (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">at [4]---[6], [30] and [31]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Tribunal also questioned the appellant regarding the Church he attended in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It inquired whether it was different from other Christian Churches and why he had chosen that Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The appellant stated that his Church in Sydney had similar beliefs to what he believed in China but did not know whether this Church was different to other churches in Australia because he had never been to another church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">He also said that he was led to the Church by a person he lived with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The Tribunal then questioned Mr Ng, who was a leader of the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Mr Ng explained how the Church was different from other Christian churches but also said that while they had Watchman Nee, about whom they talked and whose books they studied, the young people did not know who Watchman Nee was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The appellant did not know about him and said he did not know who founded the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Tribunal then put to the appellant its concerns that he did not appear to know much about his present Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The Tribunal found the appellant not to be a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">This was not because of his knowledge of Christianity but because of the account that he gave about how he came to Sydney and the involvement of Mr A Long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The Tribunal then considered the appellant's evidence of his knowledge of the Christian Assembly of Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Tribunal found that the appellant lacked knowledge and had a very poor understanding of his Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">That lack of knowledge of itself did not cause the Tribunal to reject the appellant's claim that he was a Christian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The Tribunal did not accept that a person who has purportedly been prepared to risk detention for his religion, as the appellant claimed, would continue with the organisation without asking questions about the very specific practices of the church, which included Watchman Nee's book, the non-celebration of Christmas and its stance against the system of priests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Tribunal was concerned that the appellant displayed a lack of understanding of this "basic tenet" of this Church's teaching when he referred to Mr Ng as a priest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Tribunal concluded that, even though the appellant had attended the Christian Assembly of Sydney since his arrival in Australia and may have assembled with Christians in Auburn and read Christian News, he had not done so other than for the purposes of strengthening his claim to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Tribunal said that it disregarded this conduct, in accordance with its understanding of s 91R(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">As to the appellant's claim that he became a Christian in China, the Tribunal took into account that the appellant did not know much about Christianity in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">However, the basis for the Tribunal's finding that the appellant does not hold Christian convictions was not based so much on his lack of knowledge as it was based upon the finding of overall lack of credibility (based on the account concerning Mr A Long) and his inability to articulate meaningfully why he converted to Christianity and how he himself spread Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The Tribunal did consider the appellant's claim to be a Christian based on the activities he claimed to have engaged in, without presuming that a genuine Christian must have detailed knowledge of the Bible or Christian practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The Tribunal did not reject the appellant's claims for lack of knowledge but because of its findings as to the appellant's own account of his conversion and activities in China and its assessment of his credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The Tribunal did not fail to consider the appellant's claims, as made to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">For the sake of completeness, although not raised by the appellant in the appeal, I agree with Driver FM that, in referring to independent country information not put to the appellant, the Tribunal did not contravene s 424A(1) by reason of s 424A(3)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Conclusion
 It follows that the appellant has not demonstrated any error that would lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal failed to exercise or exceeded its jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">No error has been identified in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate nor can any other error of law be discerned from the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Tribunal identified with particularity all of the appellant's claims and the supporting material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Tribunal explored his claims with him at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It raised with the appellant the inconsistencies in his evidence and doubts over his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The Tribunal made findings based on the evidence and material before it and applied the correct law to its findings in reaching its conclusion that it was not satisfied that the appellant was a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
