 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 
 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court refusing to grant constitutional writ relief to the appellant in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa: SZLSW v Minister of Immigration [2008] FMCA 498.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellant was a Pakistani citizen who hailed from the North West Frontier Province.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant arrived in Australia in early September 2007 and was detained at the airport because of irregularities perceived with the manner in which he entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He made an application for a protection visa later in September 2007 and was assisted by the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The service continued to represent him up to the time at which the delegate refused his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He then applied to the tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision with the assistance of a solicitor migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The tribunal held an initial hearing on 6 November 2007 in which a number of concerns with the claims made by the appellant were discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">At that hearing the tribunal informed the appellant that it would write to him about issues of concern it had raised with him at the hearing and would give him the option either to provide a written submission or to have another hearing at which he could respond or comment on the issues of concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 8 November 2007 the tribunal wrote to the appellant confirming those options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The letter outlined detailed issues under six separate headings relating to issues that concerned the tribunal arising from his evidence at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant's solicitor migration agent responded advising the tribunal that the appellant wished to attend a further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The tribunal then invited him to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 The appellant attended at the second hearing and gave further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">During the course of the second hearing the appellant handed to the tribunal two untranslated newspaper articles in the Pashto language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">These related to a concern that the tribunal had raised orally and in writing with him, arising from the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant claimed that a group he named as Ansar Islam was a radical Islamist group that had beaten him, burnt his house and told him not to return to his village on pain of death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The tribunal informed the appellant orally and in writing that despite many hours of searching it had been unable to find any information on Ansar Islam on the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It said that if that group was involved in beatings and killings then it would have expected that there would be some information about it available on the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In its letter of 8 November the tribunal told the appellant that he had given it:
 "... an increasingly fanciful story about the group being set up in secret by the government as an explanation as to why no information was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal asked you if you could have been referring to a group called Ansar al-Islam and you claimed that the group that beat you was called Ansar Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Tribunal put to you that it could not be satisfied that such a group existed at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">" 

 
5 The appellant had claimed that he was entitled to a protection visa based on his claimed fear of persecution in Pakistan for what the tribunal characterised, without criticism, as a Convention related reason of political opinion or membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In its statement of reasons and findings the tribunal set out in detail the appellant's claims and an account of the first hearing in its letter of 8 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Then it noted that it would deal with his evidence at the second hearing in the findings and reasons section of its decision record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The tribunal said that the appellant had been told that the tribunal would consider all his claims very carefully prior to making its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">ISSUES 
 
6 The appellant was represented before the trial judge and before me by counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The two issues raised by the appeal are that the trial judge erred by failing to find that:
 
 
 (1) the tribunal had not complied with s 424(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) when it requested and got information that it considered relevant to the appellant's credibility because it then failed to have regard to that information, being the two newspaper articles;
 
 (2) the tribunal made a jurisdictional error because it failed to consider or give weight to matters which were supportive of the appellant's claims and only considered material which negated them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 

7 The trial judge considered in detail the arguments and a number of other grounds of review which had been put below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Relevantly the tribunal found that it did not consider the appellant to have been a witness of truth for a considerable number of reasons which it gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES 
 
8 In relation to Ansar Islam the tribunal said:
 "At the second hearing the [appellant] provided the Tribunal with some untranslated newspaper articles in Pashto which he claimed referred to Ansar Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The interpreter confirmed this was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The existence of the group does not however satisfy the Tribunal that the applicant was targeted by this group whilst he was in Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">His accounts of the meeting and his beating were vague, lacking in particularised detail and unconvincing and did not satisfy the Tribunal that the incidents he claimed happened, or if they did, that they happened for the reasons claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Despite prompting, the applicant was unable to provide additional particularlised details of the incidents to satisfy the Tribunal that the incidents he described actually occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He was unable to verify that his house had in fact been burnt down nor did he mention that he fled to Peshawar with his mother in previous written statements either to the department or the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal finds the applicant's account unpersuasive and is not satisfied that the applicant was beaten or had his house burnt and his life threatened by Ansar Islam or any other radical/extremist Islamist group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">" 
9 The appellant claimed that this passage demonstrated a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">He claimed that the tribunal did not have regard to the full newspaper articles since it failed to have them translated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The appellant argued that the tribunal had a duty to have a translation made of the articles because they, in their entirety, were information given by the applicant for review to the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He argued that s 424(1) of the Act was engaged, in that the tribunal had got information at the hearing in the form of the newspaper articles themselves and the section required that "the Tribunal must have regard to that information in making the decision on the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">"
 
10 There is no doubt that the tribunal did not have a translation of the articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Nor did the trial judge or myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">What the tribunal did was to have regard to the interpreter's confirmation of the purpose for which the appellant provided the articles, namely, that they referred in Pashto to Ansar Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In my opinion that confirmation was the information which the appellant put to the tribunal, namely, that there were objective sources (the two articles) that identified the existence of the group whose existence the tribunal previously had not been able to ascertain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In the passage quoted above, the tribunal had regard to the fact that the group existed in the very next sentence of its findings and reasons after its reference to the two articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">But the tribunal then said that it still was not satisfied by the appellant's account that he had been targeted by that group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 In X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319 the Full Court considered a situation in which the tribunal had refused to have regard to an applicant for review's diary records of a particular period because they had not been translated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The majority, Gray and Moore JJ, in separate reasons, discussed the obligation of a decision-maker to have regard to untranslated material put before him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Gray J referred to the decision of Wilcox, Whitlam and Marshall JJ in Cabal v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546 at [25] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There the Full Court had noted that the tribunal may be under an obligation to obtain a translation of a particular document which was in a foreign language and whose relevance had been explained to the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">However, in Cabal [2001] FCA 546 at [25] the Full Court held that, in general, the tribunal was not required to translate material in a foreign language or to consider large volumes of material whose relevance was not explained and its failure to do so was not a departure from the process of review mandated by the then provisions of the Act, in particular s 414(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 In X v Minister for Immigration 116 FCR at 328 [30] the relevant passages sought to be relied on by X had been translated subsequently and were before the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In a later case Moore J summarised the effect of the authorities: S14/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1153 (affirmed [2004] FCAFC 171 , although this point was not dealt with by the Full Court).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He said at [49] that:
 "Circumstances can arise where the failure of a Tribunal to obtain the translation of a document, or at least where it fails to inform the applicant who has furnished the document that it does not propose to rely [on] it because it was not translated and thus deny the applicant an opportunity to explain its contents, will result in a denial of procedural fairness: see X v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">However generally the Tribunal is not obliged to obtain a translation of documents furnished by the applicant in a foreign language at least in circumstances where the Tribunal ascertains the gist of the material if it is significant: see Cabal v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 546.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In the present case the Tribunal asked the applicant, through the interpreter, a series of questions both about the newspaper article and the brother's letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In so doing it ascertained the gist of each document for the purposes of understanding the way in which the applicant relied on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Its approach was, in my opinion, unexceptionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 
 
 

13 The appellant had an opportunity to explain the relevance of the newspaper articles to the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The only relevance of the two untranslated articles that the appellant explained to the tribunal was that they referred to Ansar Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The interpreter confirmed to the tribunal that was the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The tribunal accepted that its prima facie view, as communicated in its letter of 8 November that there was no evidence that the group existed, had been shown not to be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">14 I am of opinion that the tribunal had regard to the information provided by the appellant, namely that the group existed as evidenced by its mention in the newspaper articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">There was no material before the trial judge, as he found, or before me to suggest that there was relevantly anything more in the newspaper articles than this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The tribunal obtained and relied on this information in the passage of its findings and reasons which I have quoted above, namely, that the group existed, it was radical or extremist and it engaged in conduct of the kind that the appellant described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">15 The central question for the tribunal was whether or not it accepted the appellant's account of being subjected to persecutory conduct by that group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The tribunal was not satisfied that he had, for the reasons that it gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The tribunal was obliged to have regard to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It could not ignore it and had to consider it in coming to the view that it ultimately did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I am satisfied that the tribunal took the information which the appellant gave it into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The information was not that the appellant was relying on the newspaper articles for their whole content, or independently of their corroboration that Ansar Islam existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Rather, the evidence revealed that there was nothing in the newspaper articles on which the appellant relied before the tribunal, beyond the group's existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">And, the tribunal had regard to that information being the only purpose for which the articles were tendered and, indeed, made a finding in favour of the appellant's version of events on that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">16 The trial judge found that, on the tribunal's description of what happened at the second hearing, (which was the only evidence before him or me) the proposition which the appellant wished to draw from the untranslated newspaper articles had been fully presented to the tribunal with the assistance of the interpreter and that there was no evidence that there was anything else relevant in the articles upon which he relied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The trial judge found that in those circumstances the gist of what the appellant wished to draw from the articles had been put to the tribunal and that there were no obligations of fairness that required it to take the matter any further, in particular to have a translation of the articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">17 The trial judge also referred to the fact that the tribunal had on four different occasions in writing stated that any documents which required translation needed to be translated by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In this case the appellant was represented by an experienced solicitor migration agent who was able to consider an appropriate approach to advise the appellant to take before the tribunal to look after his interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I am unable to discern any jurisdictional error in the approach the tribunal took on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">18 Moreover, in my opinion the absence, even today of any translation of the newspaper articles is significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There is no evidence to indicate that they had anything in them beyond the point which the tribunal recorded as being made by the appellant, namely that they recorded the existence of Ansar Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This provides another reason to refuse relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The absence of such evidence means that no useful result would ensue from the grant of relief desired by the appellant, since there is no reason to think that a further hearing with translated articles would have provided any further information to which the tribunal could have had regard relevant to its exercise of its functions: see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at 618 [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">THE TRIBUNAL'S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE 
 
19 The second ground of appeal focused on the way in which the tribunal expressed its reasoning for rejecting the appellant's second factual account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In particular, in its findings and reasons the tribunal reviewed each of the six matters it had raised with the appellant in its letter of 8 November, determining each of them adversely to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">However, in the course of those determinations the tribunal considered the further explanations and statements made by the appellant at the second hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">And, on a number of occasions, it modified the harsher view it had explained in its letter as the conclusion to which it was tending at that earlier time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">For example, at the second hearing the appellant explained that the account he had given in his interview with the delegate of his dealing with police officers in Pakistan was not different to the account that he had given at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The tribunal noted that it later had listened to the tape of the interview with the delegate and found that this partly confirmed the appellant's claim of his dealings with police officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">But, the tribunal came to the view that the inherent improbability of that claim meant that it was not satisfied that the appellant had in fact had the experience that he recounted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">20 Likewise, after the second hearing the tribunal modified its earlier view concerning the appellant's claims about Ansar Islam from not being satisfied that the group existed at all, as recorded in its letter of 8 November, to accepting its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">But it was not satisfied about the appellant's account of his connection with the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In particular, the tribunal had noted in its letter of 8 November, as I have set out above, that it found it very difficult to accept that the appellant had not fabricated his story about the group to support a refugee claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">21 In the final section of its findings and reasons under the heading "Credibility" the tribunal stated that it had had regard to the whole of the appellant's account and considered its overall plausibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It referred to the fact that an applicant was not obliged to provide corroboration of his or her statements but nonetheless a decision-maker was not required to accept those uncritically, when they were unsupported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It then said:
 "The Tribunal is not satisfied that the [appellant] did not fabricate the account of his experiences in Pakistan with the anti narcotics force and an extremist Islamist organisation in order to support a claim for protection in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal further finds that the applicant's account of his departure from Pakistan and his arrival in Australia is inherently implausible to the extent that it cannot be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">" (emphasis added) 
22 The appellant argued that this statement indicated that the tribunal had, in effect, created a reversal of the onus of proof or imposed an onus on the appellant to satisfy it that he had not fabricated an account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He referred to Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 555 F-D where O'Connor, Branson and Marshall JJ noted that under the then provisions of the Act, the tribunal would have been mistaken to adopt a procedure which either placed on an applicant an onus of establishing that he was truthful or was based on the assumption that the purpose of the hearing before it was to discover whether the applicant for review was a truthful person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Undoubtedly, that is still apposite, but the reasons of an administration decision-maker cannot be read in isolation or construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272, said that such reasons are meant to inform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">They are not to be scrutinised in over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons have been expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Their Honours emphasised that the Court was not to turn a judicial review of the exercise of jurisdiction by an executive decision-maker into a merits based review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">23 In Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423-424 [67]-[70]; [2000] HCA 1 ; 74 ALJR 405 at 417, McHugh J pointed out that it was quintessentially the function of the tribunal to come to a decision about the credibility of an applicant for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">If one took out of context the statement concerning fabrication, that I have quoted in the credibility section of the tribunal's findings and reasons, it may well fall within the criticism noted in Kopalapillai 86 FCR 555 F-G.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">However, in the context of the reasons as a whole, I am not satisfied that that is a fair or appropriate way to read the tribunal's reasoning on the appellant's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">24 First, the tribunal's reference to not being satisfied about a non-fabrication was made in the context of it giving reasons following on from its explanations at the first hearing and in its letter identifying its then state of thinking concerning its satisfaction with the appellant's account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">That is, the tribunal had told the appellant, perhaps in an over-fair manner, that it had very serious reservations about his credibility and explained why that was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In that context, I am of opinion that a fair reading of the criticised passage was that the tribunal, in effect, was saying that nothing at the second hearing had displaced its earlier view of considerable lack of belief of the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">25 It referred to three incidents, namely the appellant's experience with the anti-narcotics force, his experience with Ansar Islam and his travel from Pakistan to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It had discussed those matters at the first hearing and in its letter of 8 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">I have already dealt with the Ansar Islam issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The reference to the narcotics force related to discussion on the tape of the interview with the delegate and the perceived differences in the appellant's accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In effect, the appellant had claimed that he had been approached as a complete stranger very shortly before he left Pakistan by a brigadier in the Pakistan police and army to become involved in drug trafficking when he, the appellant, was asserting that he had become a member, indeed a leader, of an anti-drug trafficking organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The tribunal found that the whole account was implausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In my opinion, no jurisdictional error has been shown in the way in which the tribunal came to that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">One reason why the tribunal was under the impression, at the first hearing, that this was fabricated lay in the difference it then perceived between the original account of the incident as contained in the delegate's written reasons and the story as recounted by the appellant to the tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">When it became clear to the tribunal, having listened to the tape of the delegate's interview, that its impression was wrong about that apparent discrepancy, the tribunal accepted that there was some consistency between the two accounts, although there were other significant differences to which it pointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It came to the overall view that it was not prepared to believe either version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">26 Lastly, the tribunal noted that the appellant had claimed in writing that he departed from Pakistan on 31 August 2007 and had stayed in Bangkok for seven to eight days, leaving there on 8 September 2007 and arriving in Australia the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">At the first hearing he claimed that he had departed Pakistan on his own passport and arrived in Bangkok about a month before arriving on Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The tribunal put to him that that would make his claims about the meeting with the police and brigadier as happening after he claimed he had departed Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">That view was open to the tribunal on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">27 The tribunal also referred to other evidence showing that the appellant had met his brother in Bangkok in circumstances where they had been observed in Bangkok Airport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The tribunal asserted that the brother was entitled to permanent residence in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The tribunal noted the appellant's claim that he met his brother in Bangkok "accidentally".</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">When the tribunal questioned that claim, he had asserted that his brother had been called home to Pakistan and they had made arrangements to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The tribunal said that it had difficulty in believing any part of this story including the whole of the appellant's accounts of his departing from Pakistan and arriving in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It noted that it had difficulty in accepting his claim that he passed immigration officials and airline security with a false passport in someone else's name which was both in French and English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">28 In my opinion, because the tribunal had raised all these matters with the appellant during the course of the first hearing and in its letter of 8 November 2007, when it came to the credibility section of its findings and decision there was already a context for its remark that it was not satisfied that the appellant had not fabricated these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">That context enables me to be satisfied that reading the tribunal's reasons for its decision as a whole, it did not approach the determination of the proceedings by reversing the onus of proof on the appellant, or imposing one on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Rather, it was simply expressing the view that, at the end of the day, the initial impression it had communicated to the appellant during the course of and after the first hearing had not been displaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">I therefore reject the second ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I note that this ground appears to have been argued differently before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">29 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">LEGAL PRACTITIONERS PROVISION OF WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TO ONE ANOTHER 
 
30 The commencement of the hearing of this appeal was delayed today because counsel for the appellant, who had filed written submissions which were expressly responded to by the Minister's written submissions, had not been sent a copy of counsel for the Minister's submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Instead, the solicitors for the Minister sent the Minister's submissions to the appellant, who was in migration detention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">This is a practice which I have observed develop over recent times when an appellant is represented by counsel (whether or not he or she is in detention).</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The oversight here is one for which counsel for the Minister in this case apologised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">However, it is becoming more and more common for counsel or solicitors acting for the Minister to take the view that it is not a matter of professional courtesy to send directly to opposing counsel copies of their submissions, where applicants or appellants are self-represented because they have no solicitor on the record but have pro bono counsel appearing for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It is not a practice which should continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">31 This is not a practice which I regard as appropriate for the proper discharge of the efficient business of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Nor do I regard it as an appropriate way for professional advocates to deal with one another in cases where there is no solicitor or legal practitioner on the record of the Court for a party but where it is known that counsel is acting for that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In my opinion professional courtesy and the interests of the proper administration of justice should require those acting for the Minister in these cases to send a copy of their written submissions and lists of authorities directly to their known opponents rather than simply sending them to parties who, as in the present case, may not know that their legal representatives have not received these essential materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">No significant time or expense is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Unnecessary delay in the efficient conduct of the litigation will be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Associate:
