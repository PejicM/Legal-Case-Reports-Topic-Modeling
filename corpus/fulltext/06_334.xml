<sentence id="s0">
 
1 On 15 September 2005, Delta Metallics Pty Ltd, doing business as the Australian Academy of Boxing ("AAB"), instituted proceedings for infringement of a registered trade mark "BOXACISE".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">AAB's central claim is that the respondent, Allan Hawley Jacobs, trading as Fightboi Health and Fitness Centre, infringed its word trademark by use of the deceptively similar word "Boxercise".</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 9 December 2005, the respondent filed his Defence and Cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 17 March 2006, AAB filed a notice of motion seeking to strike out portions of some paragraphs of the defence and two paragraphs of the cross-claim's prayer for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In the alternative, AAB asks the court to order that these paragraphs be struck out unless the respondent files further and better particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 AAB challenges the following parts of the defence:
 
 " 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The generic word BOXERCISE has become more well known than the applicant's BOXACISE mark and is not held as meaning and distinctively or exclusivity indicating a sport and fitness service provided by or under the authority of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The BOXACISE mark has lost distinctiveness and exclusivity through misuse; the applicant falsely and recklessly allows his mark to be replaced by the word BOXERCISE for a fee indifferent to the deception and confusion it causes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant does so (1) in breach of the Trade Marks Act [1995 (Cth) ("TMA")] , without being required or authorised to do so by the Act, a direction of the Registrar or an order of a court and (2) in breach of s52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 [(Cth) ("TPA")].</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant's BOXACISE mark now lacks the essential characteristic of being capable of distinguishing his services in respect of which his marks are registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicant falsely and recklessly applies the name BOXERCISE which is substantially identical with his registered trade marks 597134 and 577380 without being required to do so by the Act, a direction of the Registrar or an order of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">... 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The word BOXERCISE has become a sign that since the date of registration of the Applicant's trade mark is accepted as a sign that describes or is the name of an exercise and fitness service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant falsely and recklessly applies the name BOXERCISE which is substantially identical with his registered trade marks 597134 and 577380 without being required to do so by the Act, a direction of the Registrar or an order of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant accepts money for allowing individuals to use the term BOXERCISE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">... 
 
 
 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicant falsely and recklessly applies, and allows others to apply the BOXERCISE word for a fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The applicant does so (1) in breach of the [TMA] , without being required or authorised to do so by the Act, a direction of the Registrar or an order of a court and (2) in breach of s52 of the [TPA] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">" 

AAB asks the Court to strike out the following paragraphs of the respondent's prayer for relief:
 
 " 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Pursuant to s24 and s 87 of the [TMA] the Registrar of Trademarks is to rectify the register and remove trade marks number 597134 and 577380.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Pursuant to s146(2) and s149 of the [TMA] a penalty in whatever form the court thinks fit is to be imposed on [AAB] for falsely and recklessly applying BOXERCISE a sign substantially identical with BOXACISE registered trade marks NUMBER 597134 AND 577380 without being required or authorised to do so by the act, a direction of the Registrar or an order of a court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 

4 By its reply, AAB indicated that the defence and cross-claim did not comply with the rules of pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Counsel for AAB reiterated this today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It is clear from correspondence between the parties that AAB says that the challenged parts of the defence and cross-claim do not comply with O 11 and O 12 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 ("the Rules").</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">AAB claims that the pleadings demonstrate the following deficiencies, among others: (1) the pleadings fail to particularise allegations of misrepresentation (i.e., that the applicant acted "falsely and recklessly") in contravention of O 11 r 10, O 12 r 2 and O 12 r 3; (2) the pleadings do not particularise which provisions of the TMA that AAB is alleged to have breached; (3) the pleadings do not provide particulars as to how and why such provisions have been breached; (4) the pleadings do not provide particulars regarding the claim that the BOXACISE mark has lost its exclusivity; and (5) the pleadings do not particularise the allegation that the applicant accepts money for allowing individuals to use the word BOXERCISE in place of the word BOXACISE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">5 The respondent appears in person in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">His pleadings lack the precision expected of pleadings drafted by a legal practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Whilst allowance can be made for the respondent's lack of representation, the requirements of the Rules apply to all litigants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">For the reasons I am about to give, AAB is entitled to have the defective pleadings struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">6 Without providing an exhaustive list of defects, it is sufficient to state that the challenged portions of the respondent's Defence and Cross-Claim do not comply with the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">For example, paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 21 all allege that AAB acted "falsely and recklessly" in some regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This allegation appears akin to one of fraud, and as such must be further particularised pursuant to O 12 r 2: see Banque Commerciale SA (In Liquidation) v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 285 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Even if it is not intended as an allegation of fraud (or misrepresentation or wilful default), O 12 r 3 obliges the respondent to particularise the facts relied upon for his allegations that AAB had such a condition of mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">7 Also, the respondent must provide particulars of AAB's alleged breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth): see Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia [2000] FCA 1572 ; (2001) ATPR 41-794 at 42,547-42,548, [63] - [66] per French J with whom Beaumont and Finkelstein JJ agreed (outlining the detailed requirements for pleading a claim under s 52 of the TPA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8 Furthermore, pursuant to O 11 r 10 the respondent must plead specifically the provisions of the TMA he claims AAB has violated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Amongst other things, O 11 r 10 requires a party to plead specifically any matter of fact or point of law that, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It is insufficient to specify provisions in the prayer for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It must be borne in mind that no relief can be granted unless justified by what has been pleaded in the body of the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">9 If the deficiencies in the pleading could be cured by the provision of further and better particulars, I would order that such particulars be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There is, however, a basic problem that the provision of particulars will not overcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It is a fundamental rule of pleading that a respondent must state in his defence the material facts essential to any affirmative case he wants to make in answer to the applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">These facts (and not the evidence for them) are to be stated in a summary form according to the pleading rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">As far as convenient, each material fact or other matter is to be put into a separate paragraph, with paragraphs numbered consecutively (O 11, r 1 and r 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Proper particulars are required of the relevant allegations (see, e.g., [6]-[8] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 21 of the defence and cross-claim do not comply with these requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">10 A court is ordinarily cautious when exercising its discretion to strike out a pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">No court wishes to deprive a respondent of the opportunity to defend himself in proceedings brought against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In light of the deficiencies in the respondent's pleadings, I would strike out the challenged parts of paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As paragraphs 2 and 3 of the respondent's prayer for relief are based on the challenged paragraphs of his defence, those paragraphs of the prayer for relief will also be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">At the same time, I would grant the respondent liberty to file a draft proposed amended Defence and Cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As counsel for AAB noted, this course will afford the parties an opportunity to ensure the pleading is in proper form before it is finally filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">11 By its notice of motion, the applicant sought its costs of the motion on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Counsel properly did not press this application today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is true that the applicant sough to put the respondent on notice that there were problems with his pleading late last year when it wrote its letter of 22 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Ordinarily, however, costs in this court are awarded on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The respondent has made a good faith effort to respond to the allegations against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 (" Re Wilcox ") at 156-157, Cooper and Merkel JJ said that: (a) the court ought not to depart from the usual party and party basis for costs unless this was warranted by the circumstances of the case; and (b) these circumstances arise "as and when the justice of the case so requires or where there may be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the usual course".</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I do not find that the circumstances of this case warrant a departure from the usual course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">12 Nevertheless, the applicant has been successful in its motion and, notwithstanding the respondent's opposition, costs should follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I propose to order that the respondent pay the costs of the motion on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">13 I also propose to direct that the parties file and serve submissions on the following two questions: whether or not the proceeding should be transferred to the Queensland District Registry; and (2) whether or not the proceeding should be referred to mediation under O 72 of the Federal Court Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I have already raised these matters with the parties in the course of the recent directions hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I would also make a further direction in the terms discussed in court today in relation to matters presently the subject of a confidentiality order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">14 Counsel for AAB has undertaken to draft a minute of orders in conformity with these reasons and to seek instructions in relation to an undertaking as to confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Accordingly, I defer making orders until counsel has had an opportunity to take instructions and prepare draft orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Associate:
