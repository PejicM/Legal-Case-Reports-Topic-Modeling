<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The companies that make up the Westpoint group are in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Most, if not all, are hopelessly insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">As a consequence investors will recover only a small proportion of their investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The rate of return will not, however, be the same for each investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The reason is that their money has gone into different companies in the group and the value of the assets of each company is different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This case is concerned with investors who have "transferred" their investment from one Westpoint group company to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">As a result of the transfer they may be worse off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The question that arises is whether those investors can undo the transfer and prove in liquidation of the company in which they first invested their money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This and other related questions come before the court on a liquidators summons for directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">To avoid the criticism that the questions are purely hypothetical the liquidators have identified an investor, Brendan Dunphy, who initially made an investment with York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">) and then transferred that investment to Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liq.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">) The facts of his case found the arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">There are two defendants, one who is an investor in York Street Mezzanine and another being an investor in Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">There are orders that the first defendant represent all York Street Mezzanine investors and that the second defendant represent all Ann Street Mezzanine investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">2 The best place to begin is with a sketch of the background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The business of the Westpoint group was to construct large residential and retail developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">To finance a project most of the funds were borrowed from a traditional lending institution, such as a bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Additional finance was raised from small investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In the case of each development a structure along the following lines was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">A development company purchased the land and undertook the development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The development company borrowed funds from an institutional lender on the security of a first mortgage over the land and a charge over its assets and undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">What is referred to as a "mezzanine" company raised the balance of the funds from the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Those funds were raised by way of promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The promissory notes had a minimum face value of $50,000 and a maturity date that was usually 36 months from the issue date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Investors were to receive interest on the amount of their investment, generally at the rate of 12% per annum payable monthly in arrears, together with an additional 2% of the capital invested payable on the maturity date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The fundraising was promoted by Information Memorandum issued by the mezzanine company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">3 Money raised from investors was first deposited into an account maintained by the mezzanine company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It was then transferred into an account of Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd which, according to the liquidators, acted as "the primary administrative entity within the Westpoint group".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The transfer was recorded as a loan by the mezzanine company to the development company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The loan was secured by a second registered mortgage over the land and a second charge over the developments company's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">4 By at least July 2004, if not much earlier, the Westpoint group began to run out of cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mezzanine companies could not meet their obligations under their promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A plan was devised to extend the maturity date of the promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The plan was to persuade investors to transfer (the word used was "rollover") their investment from one mezzanine company to another by accepting a new promissory note in exchange for their old note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The new note would be given a later maturity date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">If an investor decided to rollover his investment the rollover was affected by a series of book entries in the books of the relevant companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The book entries recorded that the investor had been repaid the face value of his promissory note and that the investor had lent that amount to another mezzanine company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">5 It is convenient now to look at Mr Dunphy's dealings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He invested money with York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">That company had been established to raise funds for the development of the site of the Scots Church in York Street, Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Information Memorandum issued by York Street Mezzanine described the project as the construction of 148 apartments and 10 retail shops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The development had a forecast value of approximately $128 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Information Memorandum stated that York Street Mezzanine hoped to raise $40 million from the public, of which up to $36 million would be raised by the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The minimum investment was $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Information Memorandum explained that "investors will receive interest of 12% per annum payable monthly in arrears plus a flat 2% payable with the repayment of capital on the Expiry Date of the Promissory Note on 30 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">" It was noted, however, that the "expiry date" could be brought forward to "any earlier date York Street Mezzanine in its sole discretion determines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" Investors were informed that the money raised would be lent to Scots Church Development Ltd, the company that was undertaking the development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">6 The Information Memorandum contained a detachable "Promissory Note Application Form" that an intending investor was required to complete and return to York Street Mezzanine together with a cheque for the amount of his investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The application form contained the following undertaking: "The Applicant agrees to the issue of each Promissory Note by York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd on the following terms: 1) The Applicant will not demand payment on each Promissory Note until the Expiry Date as referred to in the Promissory Note; and 2) Full or Part payment of the face value of each Promissory Note may be made at the sole discretion of York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd at any time before the expiry date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">"
 
7 There was a sample promissory note on the reverse side of the application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It was described as a "Promissory Note".</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It contained a promise by York Street Mezzanine to pay the "Investor" a sum referred to as the "Principal Sum" (which would be the amount invested) and "Interest ... at the rate of 12% per annum on a monthly basis in arrears".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The principal sum plus 2% of the principal sum was to be paid on the "Expiry Date" namely 30 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The note was "non-negotiable and non-transferable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">8 Mr Dunphy received a copy of the Information Memorandum in late 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">He applied for a promissory note with a face value of $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">He paid that amount to York Street Mezzanine but the evidence does not indicate how the payment was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">At any rate, on 24 January 2005 York Street Mezzanine issued Mr Dunphy with a promissory note for $100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The note had a maturity date of 30 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">9 In about mid July 2005 Mr Dunphy received a letter from York Street Mezzanine inviting him to "rollover" his investment into a development referred to as the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The letter provided a brief description of the development referring to it as "an investment product regulated by ASIC and the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" Enclosed with the letter was a copy of an Information Memorandum (the letter referred to it as a "prospectus") concerning the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Mr Dunphy was given three options from which to choose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">They were: "Option 1: Rollover your current principal sum early and be paid, in cash, your 2% redemption on [a specified date]; Option 2: Rollover your principal sum plus the 2% redemption amount effective from receipt of your signed application form; Option 3: Rollover your principal sum plus the 2% redemption amount and any top-up investment amount effective from receipt of you (sic) signed application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" Also enclosed with the letter was a rollover application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">10 The letter informed that if Mr Dunphy decided to accept the "special offer" and "secure this limited opportunity" he was required to complete the attached rollover application form (which, I note, was on York Street Mezzanine letterhead) and post it, together with his York Street promissory note, to York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The letter went on to say that if Mr Dunphy did not accept the offer the York Street Mezzanine promissory note would be "redeemed on the current expiry date".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">11 The request that Mr Dunphy return his York Street promissory note was necessary to protect the issuer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">At common law, where a note was negotiable or payable to a bearer, the position was that the holder could only demand payment upon presentment the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">If the note was not negotiable it was sufficient to either produce the note or to satisfactorily account for its loss: Story's Commentaries on the Law of Promissory Notes (4th ed 1856) paras 106-112.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The common law rule regarding negotiable promissory notes was harsh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">This led the Chancery Court to develop the rule that if a note had been lost relief could still be obtained provided the holder indemnified the issuer in case the issuer was compelled to pay on the note to another holder: Story at paras 445-450.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Now, s 74 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1909 (Cth) provides that where a promissory note that is not overdue has been lost or destroyed the holder may request the issuer to provide a replacement note provided the holder indemnifies the issuer for any losses suffered as a result of re-issuing the note and (if required) provides adequate security for the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In addition s 75 provides that an action upon a note, the loss of the note shall not be set up as a defence, provided a satisfactory indemnity is given against the claims of any other person on the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">12 Returning to the facts, Mr Dunphy chose to rollover his investment in accordance with Option 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He completed the rollover application form noting (by ticking the appropriate section) that he had elected to take that option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The section read: "I/We the undersigned holder of a promissory/s note issued by York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd direct York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd to: 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Rollover and pay the face value of the promissory note $100,000 to the Ann Street Development, as applications (sic) monies, which are to be issued to me/us pursuant to the Information Memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Pay an amount equal to 2% bonus redemption premium to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">"
 
13 The rollover application form advised Mr Dunphy that it was important that he had read and understood all parts of the Information Memorandum for the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Following this advice appeared the following statement: "When signing the direction to pay form you are acknowledging, agreeing, and consenting to be bound by the provisions of the Information Memorandum as amended from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">"
 
14 The Information Memorandum contained a description of the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The development site was at the corner of Ann Street and Hutton Lane in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The proposal was to construct a tower comprising 206 residential apartments, 190 hotel apartments and 4 retail tenancies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The construction company was Ann Street Brisbane Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The amount required for the project was $103 million of which $63 million would be borrowed from institutional lenders and the balance raised by "the special projects company", Ann Street Mezzanine, on the security of promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Overall, the structure was the same as that adopted for the York Street development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">15 Mr Dunphy returned his completed rollover application form together with his York Street promissory note to York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">A short time later, that is on 1 August 2005, Ann Street Mezzanine issued Mr Dunphy with a promissory note having a face value of $100,000 and a maturity date of 1 August 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In all other respects the note was identical to the York Street promissory note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">16 Each of York Street Mezzanine and Ann Street Mezzanine maintained detailed accounting records relating to the issue of promissory notes and payments made pursuant to those promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Each company also maintained detailed records of all dealings with the funds raised on the issue of promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The records included journals, ledgers, transaction reports and rollover and transfer details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They indicate that the following transactions were effected by book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">On 1 August 2005 York Street Mezzanine paid Mr Dunphy the face value of his promissory note by making that payment to Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Ann Street Mezzanine lent the amount "received" from Mr Dunphy to Ann Street Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Corresponding book entries were made adjusting the inter-company liabilities between Ann Street Mezzanine, York Street Mezzanine, Scots Church and Ann Street Brisbane (the development companies) and Westpoint Corp (which also acted as group treasurer).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In addition, York Street paid Mr Dunphy the 2% bonus redemption premium, not by "book entry" but either by cheque or deposit into an account Mr Dunphy maintained with his bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">17 Following the issue of the Ann Street promissory note, Ann Street Mezzanine began to pay Mr Dunphy the interest due under the promissory note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Those payments continued until shortly before the collapse of the Westpoint group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">18 The first question that arises on these facts is whether the document issued by York Street Mezzanine as a promissory note is a document of that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">A promissory note may be described as a written engagement by one person to unconditionally pay a specified sum at a specified time to a person therein named or sometimes to his order, or often to the bearer at large: Blackstone's Commentaries , (1st ed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">1766) vol 2 at 467; Bills of Exchange Act , s 89.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The liability of the maker of a promissory note is that he will pay it according to its tenor, that is in accordance with the terms of his promise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">19 The York Street promissory note was payable on 30 November 2005 or earlier at York Street Mezzanine's discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It is an established principle that a note cannot be expressed to be payable on a contingency: Carlos v Fancourt (1794) 5 Term Rep 482, 486; [(1794) 101 ER 272, 273].</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The rule is now codified: see Bills of Exchange Act , s 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The principle has led some courts to conclude that a document will not be a promissory note if the payer has an option to pay the sum due on any day of his choosing before the maturity date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">For example, the majority of the Court of Appeal in Williamson v Rider [1963] 1 QB 89 decided that an instrument payable "on or before" a specified date was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">They held that the option to pay earlier than the specified date was a contingency in the time of payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Ormerod LJ dissented .</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He said there was no uncertainty because the maker of the note was not under any obligation to pay the note until the maturity date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He went on to say ([1963] 1 QB at 102) that "if [the maker] chooses to pay --- and it is purely a matter for him --- at an earlier date ... then the holder of the bill is under an obligation to accept that payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">"
 
20 The decision in Williamson v Rider was followed by a later Court of Appeal in Claydon v Bradley [1987] 1 All ER 522, albeit reluctantly: see the reasons of Dillon LJ at 525.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">On the other hand the decision was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in John Burrows Ltd v Subsurface Surveys Ltd [1968] SCR 607.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The judgment of the Supreme Court was delivered by Ritchie J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">He said (at 614) of a promissory note that permitted the payer to make payments "on account of principal from time to time [of] the whole or any portion thereof upon giving thirty (30) days' notice of intention prior to such payment that "the fact that the maker was accorded the privilege of making payments on account of principal from time to time did not alter the nature of his unconditional promise to pay at the time fixed by the instrument, but merely gave him an option to make earlier payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">" Williamson v Rider was also rejected by the High Court of Ireland in Creative Press Ltd v Harman [1973] IR (Irish) 313.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Two leading textbooks, Byles on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (27th ed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">2002) at para 24-06 and Chalmers and Guest on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (16th ed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">2005) at para 2-085 prefer the dissenting judgment of Ormerod LJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">See also A.H. Hudson , Time and Promissory Notes (1962) 25 MLR 593.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">21 The position in Australia is complicated as there are conflicting decisions on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In Gore v Octahim Wise Ltd [1995] 2 Qd R 242 Williams J held that an instrument which permitted the maker to "repay the Principal Sum in whole or in part at any time" was subject to a contingency and so could not be characterised as a promissory note, following the decision of Williamson v Rider .</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">In ASIC v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd (2004) 52 ACSR 168 [(2004) 187 FCR 270] Simmonds J reached the opposite conclusion, preferring the approach taken by Omerod LJ instead of that in Gore v Octahim .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">22 There is a difficulty with the Emu Brewery decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Australian Securities Commission Ltd v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15 ; (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492 required Simmonds J to follow Gore v Octahim unless the decision was "plainly wrong": see also Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 at [135] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Simmonds J decided, however, that the rule laid down by the High Court applied only to intermediate appellate courts and not to first instance judges from whose decisions there is a right of appeal to an intermediate appellate court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">In this respect he followed the approach suggested by Owen J in Walker v Midlink Nominees Pty Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 210 [(2000) 22 WAR 318].</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">There Owen J said that only "due respect" need be given to first instance decisions of equivalent courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Yet the contrary view had been expressed in Re Brashs Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 477 by Hayne J, then a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Hayne J said (at 483): "Although the court [in ASIC v Marlborough Gold Mines ] was speaking particularly of the decisions of intermediate appellate courts, I consider the point is one of general application and that I should be very slow indeed to depart from the decision of a single judge in relation to the Corporations Law unless... convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong".</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Four months after his decision in Walker v Midlink Nominees Owen J was informed of Re Brashs Pty Ltd and applied it in Sentron Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 158 FLR 147.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Regrettably, Simmonds J seems not to have been referred to either Re Brashs Pty Ltd or Sentron Pty Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In due course, however, his decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd (in liq) v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2006) 57 ACSR 752.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">23 In the event, the situation which confronts me is covered by ASIC v Marlborough Gold Mines .</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Technically speaking, I must choose between the two decisions: --- Gore v Octahim and the Court of Appeal in Emu Brewery v ASIC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">But, as a matter of comity, I am required to follow Emu Brewery v ASIC unless the decision is plainly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The decision is not plainly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I would, in any event, have followed the Court of Appeal for three reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">First, it is the latest decision on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Second, and this is a more important reason, ASIC v Emu Brewery arises out of a transaction which, in all relevant respects, is the same as that now under consideration and also involved the Westpoint group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It would be productive of great uncertainty if promissory notes issued by one company in the group were to be treated differently from promissory notes issued by another company in the same group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It would also bring the law into disrepute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The third reason is that I agree in the analysis of both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">24 This brings me to another aspect of the law relating to promissory notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The ordinary rule is that to discharge a bill of exchange, and so to discharge a promissory note, the issuer is required to make a payment in money to the payee or bearer: Morley v Culverwell (1840) 7 M&amp;W 174 [(1840) 151 ER 727]; London Banking Corporation Ltd v Horsnail (1898) 3 Com Cas 105; Chitty on Bills of Exchange (8th ed 1833) at 432-433: Story's Commentaries on the Law of Promissory Notes (4th ed 1856) paras 113-115.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In other words the payment must be in legal tender (money) or by the transfer of a money fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">25 This method of payment is highly inconvenient, especially where large sums are involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It is not uncommon, therefore, to find that parties to a bill of exchange agree that payment can be made by some other means which is commercially acceptable, such as by the delivery of a bankers cheque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Not surprisingly, it has been held that parties to a note may agree that the note can be satisfied otherwise than by the transfer of legal tender (money).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In that way (that is by the agreement of the parties) the law relating to bills of exchange (including promissory notes) is brought in line with the law relating to contracts generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Chalmers and Guest on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (16th ed, 2005) at para 8-005; Byles on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (27th ed, 2002) at para 13-04: The result is that, by agreement, payment of money due under a bill of exchange can be made by set off, by the delivery of goods, by a bond, by cheque or bankers draft or even by book entry: see eg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Pease v Hirst (1829) 10 B&amp;C 122; [(1829) 109 ER 396]; Callandar v Howard (1850) 19 LJ CP 312 [(1850) 138 ER 117).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">For a recent example see Gokal &amp; Co (HK) Ltd v Rippleworth Ltd [1998] CLY 370.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">26 There is every reason to permit a payment to be made by a book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Often it is simply a short-hand for money or a cheque being handed across the table and money or a cheque being handed back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It would be entirely inconsistent with modern commercial life if a payment due by one person to another could not be effected in this manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">At any rate, that is how the law has progressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">See, for example Manzi v Smith [1975] HCA 35 ; (1975) 132 CLR 671; Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">All that is required is an actual agreement by the relevant parties that payment be made by means of entries in books of account: Manzi v Smith at 674 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The agreement may be express or it may be inferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In the case of a bill of exchange, however, in the absence of an express agreement the court will not readily infer an agreement that the payment, which must otherwise be in money, may be made by some other means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">27 I propose now to consider whether York Street Mezzanine discharged its obligation to Mr Dunphy under the York Street promissory note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">If it did not Mr Dunphy remains a creditor of York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Here it is necessary to resolve several issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The first is whether Mr Dunphy agreed to accept the discharge of the York Street promissory note by a payment by York Street Mezzanine to Ann Street Mezzanine of an amount equal to the face value of the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The second issue is whether Mr Dunphy agreed that the payment to Ann Street Mezzanine could be effected by book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">These issues are interrelated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The final issue is whether these arrangements, if they are found to exist, can be set aside ab initio and so be treated as never having been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">28 There is no difficulty with the first issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The answer is to be found in the rollover application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">By his acceptance of the rollover offer Mr Dunphy "direct[ed] York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd to ... rollover and pay the face value of the [York Street] promissory note ... to the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">" This was an unmistakable direction to pay the sum due to Mr Dunphy to Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">If the payment was made it is in law equivalent to a payment direct to the creditor and is a good discharge of the debt: Roper v Bumford (1810) 3 Taunt 76; [(1810) 128 ER 31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">29 As to the second issue (could the promissory note be discharged by book entry), the rollover acceptance form is silent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">That is, there is no express agreement that payment of the amount necessary to discharge the York Street promissory note need not be in legal tender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">There may, however, be an implicit agreement to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">To analyse whether that is what the parties intended regard should be had to the following matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">First, Mr Dunphy's purpose in accepting the rollover offer was to purchase a promissory note from Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Second, to achieve that purpose he had to pay $100,000 to Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Third, it would have been obvious to Mr Dunphy that each of York Street Mezzanine and Ann Street Mezzanine were companies in the Westpoint group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Fourth, there was no instruction to pay Ann Street Mezzanine in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Lastly, there was no obvious reason for the money to be paid in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">In my opinion (albeit after a good deal of hesitation) payment to Ann Street Mezzanine by book entry was both anticipated by the parties and, by implication, agreed to by them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">30 Even if it were not possible to infer the agreement of Mr Dunphy to a payment by book entry then his conduct would preclude him from denying the existence of such an agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Here I have in mind, Mr Dunphy's acceptance without complaint of the issue to him of a promissory note by Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It is now too late for Mr Dunphy to deny that York Street Mezzanine had paid out its promissory note or that Ann Street Mezzanine had been paid for the promissory note it issued to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">31 Of course, the conclusion about the efficacy of the payment by book entry depends upon there being a "valid" agreement (express or implied) that the York Street promissory note could be discharged by a payment by book entry: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v P Iori &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (1987) 15 FCR 363, 379 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Accordingly, if Mr Dunphy could avoid the agreement to discharge the promissory note by a book entry payment (that is if the agreement could be set aside ab initio ), York Street Mezzanine would still owe Mr Dunphy the face value of the note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">32 It is necessary, therefore, to examine whether Mr Dunphy is able to avoid the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The first step in the analysis is to identify rather more precisely than has been done thus far the agreement in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In a broad sense two discreet arrangements sprung up when Mr Dunphy accepted the rollover offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The first was an arrangement between York Street Mezzanine and Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Prior to the acceptance of the offer York Street Mezzanine had the right, but not the obligation, to discharge its promissory note before maturity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">However, when the offer was accepted York Street Mezzanine became bound to discharge the note by making a payment in accordance with the direction in the rollover acceptance form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">That document did not state when the payment was to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">No doubt the payment had to be made either immediately or within a reasonable time of the acceptance of the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">York Street Mezzanine also became bound to pay the 2% "redemption amount" at the same time
 
33 Those aspects of the arrangement were between York Street Mezzanine and Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">They imposed no duties upon Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Nor did they confer any benefits on Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">But in due course an arrangement between Mr Dunphy and Ann Street Mezzanine did come into existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Mr Dunphy had directed that his money be paid to Ann Street Mezzanine "as applications (sic) monies, which are to be issued to me/us pursuant to the [Ann Street Development] Information Memorandum" and had agreed "to be bound by the provisions of the Information Memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">" In my opinion this amounted to an offer by Mr Dunphy to take a $100,000 promissory note from Ann Street Mezzanine rather than the acceptance by him of an offer to issue a note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Even if it be assumed that when making the rollover offer York Street Mezzanine was also acting as agent for Ann Street Mezzanine, there is nothing in the language of either the rollover acceptance form or the Information Memorandum to suggest that any offer was being made by Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Nor do I consider that Mr Dunphy had entered into a unilateral contract of the kind discussed in New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite &amp; Co Ltd [1975] AC 154, 167-168, 171, 177.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">34 The agreement between Mr Dunphy and Ann Street Mezzanine came into existence when Mr Dunphy's offer was accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It is not clear when this occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">At the latest it was when Ann Street Mezzanine issued the promissory note in August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">There may have been an earlier acceptance of Mr Dunphy's offer but on the facts as presently known there was no evidence of an earlier act of acceptance which, of course, must have been communicated to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">35 The agreement Mr Dunphy made with Ann Street Mezzanine is not independent of his agreement with York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">York Street Mezzanine's agreement to bring forward the maturity date of its promissory note and make a payment (by book entry) to Ann Street Mezzanine was dependant upon Ann Street Mezzanine issuing a replacement promissory note to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Put in more formal language, the performance of the obligations by York Street Mezzanine under its agreement with Mr Dunphy was conditional upon at least the existence, if not the execution, of the agreement between Mr Dunphy and Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The corollary is that if the agreement with Ann Street Mezzanine and Mr Dunphy can be avoided the agreement with York Street Mezzanine will fail as a consequence of the non-fulfilment of that condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">36 In that situation the consequences would be as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">First, the York Street promissory note would remain unsatisfied and Mr Dunphy would still be a creditor of York Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Second with no payment having been made for the Ann Street promissory note Mr Dunphy would not be a creditor of Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">37 In this latter connection I note that because of their importance to trade all bills of exchange (including promissory notes) are prima facie deemed to have been made for valuable consideration: Philliskirk v Pluckwell (1814) 2 M&amp;S 393 [(1814) 105 ER 427]; Crawley v Crowther (1702) 2 Freem 257 [(1702) 22 ER 1194].</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">But the presumption is rebuttable, at least in an action between the immediate parties to the bill: Holliday v Atkinson (1826) 5 B &amp; C 501 [(1826) 108 ER 187]; Chalmers and Guest on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (16th ed, 2005) at paras 4-006 to 4-009; Byles on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (27th ed, 2002) at para 19-41 to 19-47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Likewise if a bill is founded on fraud, duress or illegality: Awde v Dixon (1851) 5 Eq 512 [(1851) 155 ER 798]; Bills of Exchange Act ss 95(1) and 35 (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">38 This brings me to the question whether there is any basis upon which Mr Dunphy might be able to set aside his agreement with Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">So far as the common law is concerned, the right of rescission for fraud or misrepresentation is so well known it needs no discussion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There are, however, one or two aspects of this common law right that are worth discussing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">39 Ann Street Mezzanine is in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It is common ground that prior to its liquidation Mr Dunphy took no step to rescind the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This immediately raises the question whether the fact of liquidation is a bar to rescission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">In Oakes v Turquand and Harding (1867) LR 2 HL 325; the House of Lords held that a person induced by fraud to become a shareholder lost the right to rescind his subscription contract upon the winding up of the company even though he might have been entitled to do so earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The reason was that "innocent third parties [that is creditors] have acquired rights which would be defeated by the rescission:" Tennent v City of Glasgow Bank (1879) 4 App Cas 615, 621.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In my view the principle in Oakes v Turquand cannot be extended to a person who is not a shareholder and who wishes to rescind a contract with a company that has been placed into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In Southern British National Trust Ltd (in liq) v Pither [1937] HCA 28 ; (1937) 57 CLR 89 the High Court refused to extend the rule in Oakes v Turquand to debenture holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Dixon J said at (113-114): "It is unnecessary to examine the basis of this firmly settled rule [established in Oakes v Turquand ].</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">But the decided cases show that its adoption was influenced by consideration of the position occupied by shareholders in an unincorporated company, who, of course, like partners, could not by repudiating their contract inter se escape liability to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">It was also influenced by the fact that creditors might be supposed to have acted on the face of the membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">But the fact that, when the company suspended and went into liquidation, and in time change took place in the relation of creditors and shareholders to the assets and of the shareholders inter se made the rule inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">It has, in my opinion, no application to the charge created in favour of other debenture holders in this case, which presents no analogy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">" [Citations omitted]
 
40 The position in England is not as clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Initially the position taken was that Oaks v Turquand applied only to the subscription contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">See eg Morrison, The Principles of Rescission of Contracts (1st ed, 1916) at 195-197.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">There is a suggestion in the most recent edition of Chitty on Contracts (29th ed, 2004) vol 1 at 6-114 that the rule is of general application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">I am not satisfied that that is the true position in England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It is not the rule in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">41 If rescission at common law were available to Mr Dunphy the right once exercised operates ab initio on the ground that the fraud or misrepresentation is an initial invalidating act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1; Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">That explains why the party rescinding is not entitled to compensation for the loss of his contract, but only to restitutio in integrum .</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">42 It is by no means clear whether the common law remedy is available to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Even in cases of fraud and misrepresentation, the right to rescind may be lost if the wronged party has, by his conduct, elected to affirm the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">On the discovery of the facts which entitle him to rescind, the wronged party must elect between rescission and the confirmation of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">An election once made is final and cannot be revoked: Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Rescission will also be impossible if there can be no restitution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">In Clarke v Dickson (1858) EB&amp;E 148, 154-155; [(1858) 120 ER 463, 466] Crompton J said: "When once it is settled that a contract induced by fraud is not void but voidable at the option of the party defrauded, it seems to me to follow that, when that party exercises his option to rescind the contract, he must be in such a state to rescind; that is, he must be in such a situation as to be able to put the parties into their original state before the contract ... That is founded on the plainest principles of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">"
 
43 The common law is not the only basis upon which the agreement might be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Mr Dunphy may be able to rely on the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to avoid his agreement with Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">There are two provisions that appear to be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The first is s 601MB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">That section relevantly provides:
 
 "(1) If: 
 
 
 
 (a) a managed investment scheme is being operated in contravention of subsection 601ED(5) and a person (the offeror ) offers an interest in the scheme for subscription, or issues an invitation to subscribe for an interest in the scheme; or 
 (b) a person (the offeror ) fails to comply with Division 2 of Part 7.9 when offering an interest in a registered scheme for subscription or issuing an invitation to subscribe for an interest in a registered scheme; 
 
 
 
 
 a contract entered into by a person (other than the offeror) to subscribe for the interest as a result of the person accepting the offer, or of the acceptance of an offer made by the person in response to the invitation, is voidable at the option of that person by notice in writing to the offeror.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (4) Within 21 days after the notice is given, the offeror may apply to the Court for an order declaring the notice to have had no effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">" 
 
 

44 It will be observed that s 601MB(1) operates only on a contract to subscribe for an interest in a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The definition of a managed investment scheme is found in s 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The potential availability of s 601MB is based on the assumption that the Ann Street Development is a scheme that satisfies the definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">I have been asked to accept this assumption, at least for the time being.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">I think that is an appropriate course if for no other reason than that there are two decisions (including one of my own) in which it has been held that an arrangement that is in all material respects the same as the Ann Street Development is a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The decisions are ASIC v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd (2004) 52 ACSR 168 and Financial Industry Complaints Service Ltd v Deakin Financial Services Pty Ltd (2006) 60 ACSR 372.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">45 There are several conditions that must be satisfied before a notice of avoidance can be given under s 601MB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Where the scheme is not registered the first condition is that the managed investment scheme is being operated in contravention of s 601ED(5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That section prohibits the operation of a managed investment scheme that is required to be registered under s 601EB unless the scheme is registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">It is common ground that the Ann Street Development is not registered under that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">46 The second condition is that a person (the offeror) has offered an interest in the managed investment scheme for subscription or has issued an invitation to subscribe for an interest in the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The facts here are rather sketchy but as things presently stand it does not seem that Ann Street Mezzanine made any offer to Mr Dunphy to acquire an interest in the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Rather, the Information Memorandum (the contents of which have previously been described) published by Ann Street Mezzanine can fairly be described as an invitation by Ann Street Mezzanine to recipients of the memorandum to subscribe for an interest in the Ann Street Development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">I have already explained how, at least in partial response to that invitation, Mr Dunphy made an offer to acquire a promissory note and when that offer was accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">47 If the conditions mentioned in s 601MB(1) are satisfied the contract to subscribe for the interest in the managed investment scheme is "voidable" at the option of the investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">If the investor wishes to exercise that option he must give a notice to that effect to the offeror.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The offeror may within 21 days apply to the court to have the notice declared invalid (s 601MB(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Such a declaration will be made if "in all the circumstances it is just as equitable to make the declaration" (s 601MB(6)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">If no application is made then at the end of 21 days, or if an application is made and no declaration is made after the application and any appeals have been determined, "the notice takes effect to void the contract" (s 601MB(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">I take this to mean that the contract is void ab initio , with the consequence that the investor can recover what he paid for his investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In other words, the parties to the contract are to be restored as far as may be possible to the position they were in before the contract was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The alternative and unconventional meaning of "void" is that the contract is only dissolved as regards to future performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">That construction would run counter to the plain object of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">48 Thus, if Mr Dunphy were to give a notice under s 601MB(1) and the notice stands he would be required to return the Ann Street promissory note and repay any interest he had received from Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">In return Ann Street Mezzanine would be obliged to refund the subscription money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Here there need not be (indeed could not be) a refund in cash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">All that needs to be done would be to reverse the payment that had been effected by book entry presumably by a reversing book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">49 The foregoing discussion is based on an assumption that may or may not be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The assumption is that no money actually passed from York Street Mezzanine to Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">That is to say, the discussion assumes that the only payment received by Ann Street Mezzanine on behalf of Mr Dunphy was a payment by book entry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">However, if this assumption be incorrect and actual money did change hands, restitution by book entry would not be available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">In that circumstance Ann Street Mezzanine would be indebted to Mr Dunphy for the face value of the note and because of the company's insolvency Mr Dunphy would stand in competition with all other unsecured creditors for the repayment of his debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">50 The other provision pursuant to which Mr Dunphy might be able to set aside the agreement with Ann Street Mezzanine is s 925A of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">That section is located in Part 7.6 , Div 11, Subdiv B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">That subdivision applies to an agreement between a person (the non-licensee) and another person (the client) that constitutes or relates to the provision of a financial service by the non-licensee if the agreement is entered into in the course of a financial services business carried on by the non-licensee and the non-licensee is required to but does not hold an Australian financial services licence: see s 924A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Section 925A is the key provision in Subdiv B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The section provides that, in certain circumstances, the client may give notice stating that the client wishes to rescind the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The effect of such a notice is to rescind the agreement unless rescission would affect the rights of an innocent third party: s 925B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">In that event the court may make an order for the partial rescission of the agreement under s 925C if that would avoid the prejudice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">51 To determine whether s 925A has application to the facts at hand requires an examination of several provisions in Part 7 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">First reference must be made to s 766A which describes when a person "provides a financial service".</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">A person will be taken to provide a financial service if, relevantly, they (b) "deal in a financial product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">" According to s 766C(1)(b) a person deals in a financial product if the person "issues a financial product".</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">A financial product is issued to a person when "it is first issued, granted or otherwise made available to a person": s 761E(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">That person "acquires the product from the issuer; and ... the issuer provides the product to the person": s 761E(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">52 Section 764A(1) provides that a "financial product" includes, amongst other things, an interest in a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Certain dealings are, however, not to be treated as a dealing in a financial product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Relevantly, for present purposes s 766C(4)(d) provides that a transaction by a body corporate is not to be taken to be a dealing in a financial product "if the transaction relates only to ... securities of that entity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">53 The effect, then, of s 766A and s 761E is that, subject to any statutory exceptions, an agreement will relate to "provision of a financial service" if it results in the issue to a person of an interest in a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">54 In dealing with the application of s 925A I will, as before, assume that the acquisition by Mr Dunphy of a promissory note from Ann Street Mezzanine is an acquisition of an interest in a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">I note that an interest in a managed investment scheme is defined in s 9 to mean "a right to benefits produced by the scheme".</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Here the relevant scheme is not simply the issue of promissory notes by Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">It is much wider than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">In ASIC v Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd (2004) 52 ACSR 168, 186 Simmonds J described an almost identical scheme as one by which "investors were asked ... to contribute their money so as to permit the special purpose corporate vehicle to make possible the "mezzanine" finance arrangements for the particular project described for them, and in return would gain the sorts of benefits the vehicle's participation in these arrangements would make possible for the investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">" 
 
55 Section 925A is not excluded by the exception in s 766C(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">That provision is concerned to exclude from what would otherwise be 'a dealing in a financial product' (say a managed investment scheme) a limited class of "transaction".</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The use of the word "transaction" focuses attention not only on the agreement pursuant to which a financial product is issued but on the whole dealing or matter of which the particular agreement forms a part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">On no view of the dealings between Ann Street Mezzanine and Mr Dunphy could it be said they relate only to securities in Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">The dealings might be of that character if the issue of the promissory note was looked at in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">But that is not what the exception allows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">56 Going back to s 924A , the section provides that Subdiv B applies to an agreement for the provision of financial service by a non-licensee only if the agreement is entered into in the course of a "financial services business" that is carried on by the non-licensee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">"Financial services business" is defined in s 761A to mean "a business of providing financial services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">I will assume that Ann Street Mezzanine carries on a financial services business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">This assumption, however, is not without its difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Ann Street Mezzanine was set up to perform the following functions, namely to raise $40 million, lend that amount to Ann Street Brisbane, recover the money lent and finally return it to investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It may be impossible to deny that Ann Street Mezzanine was carrying on a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Normally "business" is a "wide and general" concept: Actors &amp; Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169, 184.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">It may extend to anything a corporation does.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">But for s 925A to apply it would be necessary to characterise the business carried on by Ann Street Mezzanine as a "financial services business" and, it is not clear whether it was of that character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">57 Putting to one side the nature of the business carried on by Ann Street Mezzanine, s 925A is otherwise available to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">This is because Ann Street Mezzanine, which did not hold a "financial service licence", entered into an agreement to provide a "financial service" to Mr Dunphy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">In the result, Mr Dunphy may, at least theoretically, be able to give notice of rescission of his agreement with Ann Street Mezzanine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">Whether such a notice would be effective will depend on three things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">First, the notice must be given within a reasonable time after Mr Dunphy had become aware of the facts which entitle him to give the notice: s 925A(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Second, Mr Dunphy must not by his conduct have affirmed the agreement: s 925A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Third, the rescission cannot prejudice the rights of innocent third parties: s 925B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Whether or not Mr Dunphy is able to satisfy those conditions is a matter for another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">58 I trust that by now I have said enough to answer the questions raised by the liquidators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">I will leave it to them to bring in short minutes of orders to give effect to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">If any issue remains outstanding it can be raised by any party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">I certify that the preceding fifty-eight (58) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
