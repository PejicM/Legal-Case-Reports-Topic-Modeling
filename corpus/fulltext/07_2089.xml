1 This is an application, under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act "), for the Court to approve a settlement of part of a representative proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The details of the proceeding in which the application is made are summarised in the judgment of Gordon J in Haslam v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2007] FCA 897 at [2] - [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The settlement has been reached between certain of the applicants, acting on behalf of all group members, and the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It will be convenient to refer to it as "the MFL settlement".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The terms of the settlement were contained in a deed dated 13 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The deed was a confidential exhibit in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 By order dated 30 November 2007 (as varied by a further order which I made this morning) I ordered that:
 
 "1... 
 
 2... 
 
 
 
 3 On or before 3 December 2007 the Applicant's solicitors shall post by ordinary mail to all group members in the representative proceeding: 
 
 
 
 
 
 a a notice of proposed settlement in a form approved by the Court in respect of settlement of the representative proceeding in terms of the Deed of Settlement between the Applicant's and the first and second Respondents dated 13 November 2007 ("the Deed of Settlement"); and

<sentence id="s8">
 
 

3 I fixed the hearing of the application for approval of the MFL settlement for hearing this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The applicant's solicitors complied with order number three which I made on 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 3 December 2007 the applicant's solicitors sent to each group member a notice of proposed settlement in the form approved by the Court on 30 November 2007 and an opt-out notice in a form approved by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The group members were each advised of his or her right to object to the approval of the MFL settlement by notice filed in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 No opt-out notices and no notices of objection to the settlement have been filed by any group member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 Counsel for the applicants submitted that the MFL settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate, in the interests of the group members as a whole and should, therefore, be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This submission was supported by counsel appearing for the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 The principles which guide the exercise of the Court's power under s 33V and the considerations which are, or may be, relevant in the exercise of the power have been identified in a series of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Those authorities have, conveniently, been collected by Gordon J in Haslam at [17]-[20].</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I have had regard to those principles and considerations which arise in the present application in dealing with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 The application is supported by an affidavit of Mr Leonard Adrian Warren, a principal of Russell Kennedy, the solicitors for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He deposed to the following relevant matters:
 
 &#8226; His communications with group members had led him to the belief that they are "broadly in favour of the proposed settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">"
 &#8226; Most of the group members had attended the mediation at which the settlement was negotiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">A broad outline of the settlement was explained to them and all of them were in favour of the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">&#8226; He had explained to each of the group members the strength and weaknesses of their legal position on various legal issues and had concluded "that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, having regard, in particular, to the possibility that a worse result may have been achieved at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">"
 &#8226; Approval of the settlement will save the group members substantial costs and anxiety associated with a trial at which they were not assured of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">

9 As is already noted the terms of the MFL settlement are confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">It is sufficient for present purposes to note that it provides for measures by which title to their properties will be restored to group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 It is clear from the material exhibited to Mr Warren's affidavit that the applicants' legal advisers have dealt with the considerations that were identified in the authorities, which bear on the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 33V of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Having examined that material I am satisfied that the MFL settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate, in the interests of the group members as a whole and that it should be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Associate:
