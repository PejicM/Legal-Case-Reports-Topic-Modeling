 INTRODUCTION 
 This is an appeal from the orders of Smith FM made on 3 October 2008 dismissing an application for an order of review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 2 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal's reasons were handed down on 13 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He arrived in Australia on 18 August 2007 and applied shortly afterward for a protection (Class XA) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant's claims were set out in a statutory declaration made on 26 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal referred to those claims commencing at [18] of its reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Tribunal noted that the appellant worked as a fisherman in a local village in Lianjiang County and that he and other villagers were notified in January 2007 that they could no longer fish close to the shore because the land had been confiscated by the army.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant claimed that on 8 May 2007, he and another local fisherman arranged a demonstration of approximately 100 people to demonstrate outside the local government building.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant said that he was arrested at the demonstration and detained for a period of about three weeks, during which he was physically and mentally persecuted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">THE HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 The appellant appeared before the Tribunal at a hearing on 27 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He brought his passport with him and confirmed to the Tribunal that the passport was issued on 17 March 2007 to replace an earlier one which he had lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal took into account in its reasons the fact that the replacement passport was issued approximately two months before the demonstration, rather than having been issued in response to what took place following the demonstration of 8 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">After the oral hearing, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant apparently pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) providing particulars of information which the Tribunal considered would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant responded to the letter in the form of a statutory declaration made 30 April 2008 and received by the Tribunal on 1 May 2008, the effect of which, the Tribunal said in its reasons at [53], was that the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on political grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Tribunal observed that the appellant claimed to be regarded as an anti-government activist because he organised the protest and he claimed to have been detained for that reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He also claimed that he will be persecuted if he returns to China because he fled from that country and because there is a "black mark" against his name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS 
 The Tribunal found that in many respects the appellant's oral evidence was deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal observed that while he could answer questions about the matters directly referred to in his statutory declaration, his answers to questions about matters which were said to be within his direct experience, but not referred to in his statutory declaration, were vague and lacking in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal went on to consider whether there might be particular circumstances which could have affected the appellant's ability to give evidence and to provide a credible account of the events leading to his departure from China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that there was a satisfactory explanation for this deficiency in the appellant's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The substance of the Tribunal's reasons is set out in [60]: 
 In the circumstances, I am of the view that the applicant was familiar with the claims set out in the statement that was prepared for him by his adviser, because he had learned them, but was unable to provide convincing answers about matters not included in the statement because many of the claims are not true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">If the applicant had really been involved in organising a demonstration; had he really been arrested and detained, I would expect that he would be able to readily provide the details sought from him at the hearing in relation to those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Given his inability to do so, and his apparent evasiveness when questioned about these issues, I consider that the applicant was not telling the truth about these events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I do not accept that the applicant was involved in organising a protest as he claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I do not accept that he was detained as a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I do not accept that the [sic] continued to be harassed, and of adverse interest to the authorities prior to his departure from China in August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 The Tribunal took into account other matters in rejecting the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It considered his evidence about the departure arrangements from China to be unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It found, at [62], that the appellant travelled to Australia using a passport issued in March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It observed, at [62], that passports are quite costly and that a person in the financial position of the appellant would not obtain a passport if he did not intend to travel overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal went on to say: 
 As the passport was issued before the applicant's claimed difficulties with the authorities, I am satisfied that prior to these claimed difficulties, he had formed the intention to travel overseas, and that he had the means to do so, legally, with his passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 The second additional matter which the Tribunal took into account was that it found the appellant's evidence about the assistance provided to him by a friend in making departure arrangements to be inconsistent, implausible and not credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal accepted that a friend had helped the appellant to obtain a visa to Australia and provided false information to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with or without the appellant's knowledge, but the Tribunal found that any difficulty that the appellant may have faced in obtaining a visa to travel to Australia had nothing to do with the Chinese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal was not satisfied with the appellant's explanation of these arrangements, and said that it would expect him to be able to provide a coherent and sensible account of his actions and motivations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence on this point to be evasive and took into account his "unhelpful demeanour" when he was questioned about that issue: [65].</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Accordingly, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was involved in protest activity as he claimed or that he had been arrested and detained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant had a "black mark" against his name or any profile that would result in a real chance of his persecution on return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 The appellant relied on three grounds of review before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The first ground may be described as a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The particulars of the ground of bias were the Tribunal's reasoning in relation to the cost of obtaining a passport and the consequences which flowed from that in the Tribunal's reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The second ground of the application characterised the same reasoning as revealing bias and an incorrect finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The learned Federal Magistrate, at [16] of his reasons, said that he was not persuaded that it was not open to the Tribunal to form the conclusion that it did on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">He was not persuaded that the Tribunal's refusal to accept the appellant's explanation was not open to it or that it showed unreasonableness or irrationality within the principles stated in the well known authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The third ground of review challenged the Tribunal's reasons in not accepting the appellant's explanation for those parts of his evidence which were found to be vague and lacking in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The learned Federal Magistrate was of the view that these criticisms did not reveal any jurisdictional error by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">THE APPEAL 
 The notice of appeal states two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The first is that the Federal Magistrate erred in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The second is that the Federal Magistrate was wrong in finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal acted properly in making its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The substance of these complaints is set out in three particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The first refers to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The second is that the Federal Magistrate was wrong not to find that the Tribunal failed to properly consider the appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The third particular is that there was "no evidence" that the Tribunal considered the explanations given by the appellant in response to the s 424A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The appellant appeared before me in person this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">He was assisted by a Mandarin interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">He said that the main point he wanted to make was that the Tribunal's decision was biased against him because it was based upon a prior assumption which the Tribunal was not entitled to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As to the claim of bias, I am satisfied that there is no foundation for this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It is true that the learned Federal Magistrate did not refer to the principles in relation to reasonable apprehension of bias stated in authorities, such as Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at [27] --- [32], nor did the learned Federal Magistrate refer to the principles in relation to actual bias stated in authorities such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">However, it is plain that the Federal Magistrate was of the view that the claim of bias was made upon the footing that the Tribunal made a wrong finding of fact in relation to the appellant's explanation about the renewal of his passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I see no error in the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that the findings of fact were open to the Tribunal on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">His view that this finding revealed no irrationality or unreasonableness was sufficient to dispose of the claim of bias, whether treated as a claim of reasonable apprehension of bias or actual bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It follows in my view that the ground of appeal based on bias must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I should add that there was nothing in the reasons of the Tribunal to suggest that it approached the matter with a closed mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Also, it seems to me that the learned Federal Magistrate did turn his mind to the issue of bias in what he said at [14] --- [16] of his reasons of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">As I have said, I see no error in the conclusion that he reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Moreover, I do not consider that there is any substance in the claim made by the appellant that the Tribunal made an assumption which was not open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The Tribunal may, in a general sense, be said to have made an assumption about the effect of the appellant's admitted possession of a passport issued in March 2007, some two months before the demonstration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, in my view, this is covered by what the Federal Magistrate said in his reasons, namely that this was a finding of fact which was open to the Tribunal and that it revealed no irrationality or unreasonableness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It cannot be said that the Tribunal failed to take into account an integer of the appellant's claims in accordance with the principles stated in authorities such as the reasons of Allsop J in Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Nor do I consider that there was any substance in the claim that the Tribunal failed to consider the appellant's claims made in his statutory declaration in response to the Tribunal's s 424A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Tribunal's reasons set out at [53] the substance of the statutory declaration and there are a number of references in the Tribunal's reasons to the fact that it took into account the content of the statutory declaration of April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It is true that the Tribunal did not refer in its reasons to every one of the 12 paragraphs of the statutory declaration of 30 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">However, in my view it is sufficiently clear that the Tribunal's reasons disclose a consideration of each of the grounds in the appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">As a Full Court said in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46] , it is not necessary for a tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in the Tribunal's written reasons (French, Sackville and Hely JJ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Their Honours went on at [46] to observe that there was a distinction between the tribunal failing to advert to evidence in its written reasons, and a failure by the tribunal to address a contention which, if accepted, might establish that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">As I have already said, it seems to me that the reasons of the Federal Magistrate revealed a consideration of the grounds in the application for review and I am also of the view that the Tribunal's reasons for decision indicate that it considered all of the matters that formed the basis of the appellant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Accordingly, I am satisfied that the appellant has failed to identify any error in the decision or reasoning of the Federal Magistrate or any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson J.</sentence>
