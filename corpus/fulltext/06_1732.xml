1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the ACCC') made application to the Court on 27 September 2006 for various remedies arising from alleged contraventions, by each of the respondents, of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Specifically, it was alleged that the first respondent ('DPG') contravened s 48 of the Act by engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance and that the second ('Mr Kemp') and third ('Mr Dopson') respondents were directly knowingly concerned in those contraventions and were, for this reason, liable to pecuniary penalties under s 76(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 In the relatively short period which has followed the commencement of the proceeding the parties have acted with commendable celerity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 1 November 2006 a joint defence was filed which contained substantial admissions of liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A statement of agreed facts was filed on 15 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">An amended version of the statement was filed on 30 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At that time the Court was also provided with minutes of orders sought by consent of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 6 December 2006 joint submissions were filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This morning I heard brief oral submissions on behalf of the ACCC and the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 DPG carries on the business of importing digital set top boxes which are used to facilitate the reception of digital signals in analogue television sets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The DPG supplied various models of digital set top boxes to retailers in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">One of those retailers was Hantrex Pty Ltd ('Hantrex').</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Kemp was the sole and managing director of DPG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Dopson was the national sales manager of DPG.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 The ACCC statement of claim alleged that:
 
 (a) DPG was liable as the principal contravener in respect of 24 acts of resale price maintenance, contrary to s 48 of the Act;
 (b) Mr Kemp was liable as a person directly knowingly concerned in and a party to 14 of DPG's contraventions of s 48 of the Act; and
 (c) Mr Dopson was liable as a person directly knowingly concerned in and a party to 10 of those contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">

5 On 1 November 2006, in their joint defence, the respondents made the following admissions:
 
(a) DPG admitted 20 of the 24 contraventions alleged against it;
 
(b) Mr Kemp admitted 11 of the 14 contraventions alleged against him;
 
(c) Mr Dopson admitted 9 of the 10 contraventions alleged against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">6 The ACCC did not press the allegations which were not admitted by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The statement of agreed facts, which I accept, explains the details of the conduct on which the allegations, made by the ACCC, are founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The 20 contravening acts admitted by DPG were performed between 7 October 2003 and 9 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">They involved either Mr Kemp or Mr Dopson requesting Hantrex to cease advertising digital set top boxes supplied by DPG at prices less than those stipulated by DPG as its recommended retail price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In each case Hantrex responded by either increasing the advertised price or removing reference to a price from its advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There is no evidence as to the extent of any pecuniary losses sustained by Hantrex or by consumers as a result of the respondent's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 Resale price maintenance is a form of anti competitive conduct which the legislature has been concerned to prevent in the public interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Corporations, and those through whom they act, who engage in resale price maintenance face serious pecuniary penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The maximum penalty for a contravention, by a corporation, of s 48 is $10 million: see s 76(1A)(b) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The maximum penalty for an individual who is directly knowingly concerned in such a contravention is $500,000: see s 76(1B) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Where contraventions have occurred the Court is empowered, in addition to imposing pecuniary penalties, to grant injunctions which are designed to prevent repetition of conduct which constitutes a contravention of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">By s 86C of the Act the Court is empowered to make what are termed 'probation' orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Such orders may require the establishment of compliance and education programmes within a company which are designed to ensure that employees are aware of the requirements of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Section 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) further empowers the Court by providing for the making of binding declarations of right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 The consent orders proposed by the parties include:
 
(a) Declarations that particular conduct, engaged in by each of the respondents constituted a contravention of the Act;
 
(b) Injunctions restraining each of the respondents from engaging in proscribed conduct for a period of three years from the date of the order;
 
(c) Orders requiring DPG to establish an education programme for its employees;
 
(d) An Order that the respondents pay the ACCC's costs fixed in the sum of $10,000;
 
(e) An Order that the first respondent pay a pecuniary penalty of $238,000 in seven instalments;
 
(f) An Order that Mr Kemp pay a pecuniary penalty of $42,000 in seven instalments; and
 
(g) An Order that Mr Dopson pay a pecuniary penalty of $17,500 in seven instalments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">A further Order provides for what is to occur in the event of any default, on the part of a respondent, in relation to the timely payment of any instalment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">10 The Court is not, of course, bound to make Orders giving effect to the terms of settlement agreed on by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, having considered the submissions made in support of the proposed Orders, I am persuaded that it is appropriate that those Orders should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">11 The proposed declarations are appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They serve the public interest by making it plain that conduct of the kind admitted by the respondents contravenes the Act: see Australian Consumer &amp; Competition Commission v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at 333; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">12 The injunctive relief is clearly expressed so as to make it plain to the respondents what conduct on their parts is proscribed in the three year period during which the injunctions will be operative: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Francis [2004] FCA 487 ; (2004) 142 FCR 1 at 39.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 The probation order is modelled on an order made by Merkel J in ACCC v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706 ; (2005) ATPR 42-072.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is an agreed fact that the contraventions for which the respondents accept responsibility in the present case occurred as a result of inadvertence on the part of Mr Kemp and Mr Dopson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Neither of them became aware that they had been acting in a manner proscribed by the Act until February 2006 when the ACCC served a notice on DPG under s 155 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It was also agreed that Mr Kemp had an incorrect understanding of the relevant law and had communicated his errant views to staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In these circumstances it is appropriate that a regime should be established to ensure that all employees of DPG are made aware of the legal obligations imposed on DPG and its employees by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">14 The principles to be applied by the Court in determining whether to order the imposition of a pecuniary penalty for contravention of the Act, where parties propose a particular sum, are expounded in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-295.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">They are refined and elaborated upon in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] to [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I am also mindful of the observations of Emmett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 819 ; (2004) ATPR 42-011at [46] to [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In particular, I note the following observations made by His Honour in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 '[53] ... there is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation, particularly litigation that is likely to be lengthy and complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Thus, in giving weight to a joint submission on a proposal that would resolve a proceeding, the Court can have regard to the savings of resources both for a regulator, such as the Commission, and for the Court if the proposal were to be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The savings in resources, for example, are capable of being used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 
 
 [ 54] The view of a regulator such as the Commission as a specialist body is relevant in determining the question of penalty, although it is by no means determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Court will expect a regulator such as the Commission to explain to it the process of reasoning that has led to the resolution proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In particular, if a proposed penalty involves a discount from that which might otherwise be considered to be the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of cooperation, the Court would expect the Commission to explain the basis upon which the discount had been calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 ... 
 [56] The Court will be mindful that, where an agreed penalty is proposed, there may be elements of compromise involved in both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Thus, it may be that evidentiary difficulties perceived by the Commission would warrant the abandonment of some claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Certainty of outcome for both parties may be a very significant factor in the reasoning process that leads to agreement on penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">For reasons such as those, if the Court is not disposed to impose a penalty proposed by the parties, it would be appropriate to give the parties the opportunity to withdraw consent for all of the proposed orders and to permit the proceeding to continue on a contested basis.</sentence>

See also Commerce Commission v New Zealand Milk Corporation [1994] NZLR 730 at 733.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">15 In determining to accept the proposed monetary penalties in this case I have had regard to the following considerations:
 
 &#8226; The seriousness of the contravening conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">&#8226; The need for specific and general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">&#8226; The period over which the contraventions occurred (some 20 months).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">&#8226; The contraventions occurred as a result of an inadequate and imperfect understanding, on the part of Mr Kemp and Mr Dopson, of the provisions of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">They did not arise from any considered decision to act in breach of the restrictions imposed by the Act in order to obtain commercial advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">&#8226; In dealing with Hantrex Mr Kemp and Mr Dopson did not act in an aggressive or overbearing manner when seeking to influence Hantrex not to sell the digital set top boxes at prices lower than the recommended retail prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">&#8226; DPG is a relatively small but growing family company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">&#8226; The capacity of DPG and the personal respondents to pay the proposed penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">&#8226; The substantial cooperation provided by the respondents in the course of the ACCC's enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">&#8226; The early acknowledgement of liability by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">&#8226; The view of the ACCC that the proposed monetary penalties are appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">(In this context I note the advice of the parties that a 30% discount has been applied to reflect the level of co-operation provided by the respondents and the consequential savings to the ACCC of costs which would otherwise have been incurred in the conduct of any investigation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">&#8226; The absence of any prior contraventions of the Act by any respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">&#8226; The totality principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">&#8226; The public interest in promoting the settlement of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">

16 Orders will be made by consent in the terms proposed.</sentence>
