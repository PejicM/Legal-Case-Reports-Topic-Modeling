<sentence id="s0">
 
 Here the question is whether a costs order should be made against the liquidator of Jonkay Pty Ltd (in liq) in an action that was, by leave, brought against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The plaintiff was the successful party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He prefers not to apply for a costs order against the company for it has no assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Instead he asks that the liquidator pay his costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The facts may be reduced to a relatively simple statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 20 September 2006 the plaintiff entered into a contract with the company to purchase for $780,000 a parcel of land at Noosaville.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The plaintiff paid the deposit of $39,000 to the company's estate agent and was to pay the balance at settlement which was due on 20 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">At the time of the contract, however, Bluestone Mortgages was in possession of the land in its capacity as mortgagee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Therefore, the company had no authority to sell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Moreover, the mortgagee had not assented to the sale and thus was not bound by the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The liquidator was appointed on 10 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">A few days later the plaintiff's solicitor advised the liquidator of the existence of the contract and provided him with a copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 25 October 2006 the liquidator wrote to the mortgagee inquiring whether it would "ratify the contract offer made [by the plaintiff] and allow [the sale] to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">" The plaintiff's solicitor made a similar enquiry of the mortgagee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The mortgagee did not adopt the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Instead it put the land up for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Accordingly, on 6 November 2006 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote both to the agent and to the company's solicitors advising them that the contract was terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He also asked for a refund of the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Neither the agent nor the solicitors took any step to return the money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The agent did seek instructions from the liquidator but was told that as the mortgagee had entered into possession the liquidator "now [has] no role to pay in determining whether the contract that has been exchanged can be completed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The solicitors said they could do nothing in the absence of instructions from the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The plaintiff's solicitor asked the liquidator to intervene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The liquidator refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He explained his position in a letter dated 9 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I will set out some extracts: 
 
 "I consider that I have no role to play in deciding whether the contract that was entered into between Jonkay Pty Ltd and Mr Jenkins can proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I confirm my previous advices that you should make contact with Bluestone Mortgagees in that regard as it is they who control the subject property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">" 
 ... 
 [G]iven that I have not taken any steps in relation to the contract it follows that it is difficult for me to give instructions to the real estate agent ... in relation to how the deposit held pursuant to that contract should be dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 ... 
 I consider that it would be difficult for me to give instructions in the current circumstance without first seeking legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I confirm that I am without funds to seek such advice in the liquidation of Jonkay Pty Limited and that the mortgagee's solicitor has advised that there is no realistic prospect that any funds will become available to the company from any equity after a sale of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 ... 
 I note that I have suggested to you that you seek the consent of the Mortgagee to the course of action proposed by you, but that you have been unable to do so to date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">As an alternative to resolve this impasse please be advised that on the basis that I receive: 
 
 
 &#8226; a consent, release and indemnity from your client 
 &#8226; a consent and release from the Mortgagee, and 
 &#8226; a consent and release from the Estate Agent, 
 
 
 
 then I will instruct the agent to pay their deposit to your client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 
 
 It is clear that the liquidator was of the view that the company was not entitled to the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He appeared to be uncertain whether it should go back to the plaintiff or whether the mortgagee was entitled to the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The reason for his uncertainty was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">That has now been cleared up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Counsel for the liquidator has identified two matters that troubled his client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">First, as company had sold the land while the mortgagee was in possession the sale might have been a fraud on the mortgagee who might then be entitled to the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The second flowed from the rule that a mortgagee in possession is entitled to the rents and profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The liquidator thought that by reason of that rule the mortgagee might also be entitled to the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Neither point had any substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">As the mortgagee had not adopted the contract, the plaintiff was entitled to get his money back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His entitlement not being recognised, the plaintiff had to go to court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">First, he applied for leave under s 471B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Then he initiated the action and, in due course, obtained an order that the agent refund the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He now seeks the costs from the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There is a general rule that in a proceeding by or against a liquidator the real party to the action is the company and the company's assets are responsible for the costs: In re Marseilles Extension Railway and Land Company (1885) 30 Ch D 598.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Of course if the liquidator is the plaintiff he will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful defendant but has an indemnity for those costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">If this were not the rule a liquidator would be in an impossible position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">He would only bring an action if it were bound to succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">He might not resist claims brought against the company unless they were clearly hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There is also the risk that good people would be deterred from taking on the responsibility of acting as a liquidator: Re Wilson Lovatt &amp; Sons Ltd [1977] 1 All ER 274.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There are exceptions to the rule that the company's assets should bear the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Broadly speaking, if the liquidator acts unreasonably, recklessly or even negligently and his conduct leads to the unnecessary incurring of costs, those costs ought to be paid by the liquidator: In re Beddoe; Downes v Cottam [1893] 1 Ch 547; Mead v Watson (2005) 23 ACLC 718.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In deciding whether the liquidator is acting unreasonably it is necessary to have regard to s 545 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Subsection (1) provides that "a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">(There are certain exceptions in relation to lodging of documents with ASIC: see s 545(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">) The effect of the section is that, apart from lodging certain documents, a liquidator is not required to do anything if he cannot recover his expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It means the liquidator commits no wrong in failing to carry out any duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Here I think the liquidator found himself in a difficult position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">He was not sure what to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">He thought that he was at risk if he were to accede to the plaintiff's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Ordinarily the liquidator should have obtained legal advice regarding what to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">If he had there is little doubt he would have been told to refund the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The liquidator did not consult a lawyer because he had no funding to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">So he did nothing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Still, he is protected by s 545 unless it could be shown that it would have been obvious to any liquidator that the plaintiff was entitled to his money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I cannot make that finding and therefore I will not make a costs order against the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">So far as the costs of this application against the liquidator are concerned, they should lie where they fall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The liquidator should have told the plaintiff why he would not direct a return of the money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Had he done so, the application may not have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The plaintiff is, however, entitled to his costs against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
