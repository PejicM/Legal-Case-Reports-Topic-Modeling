 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Further hearing in this matter be set down for.......................2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">

 The applicant is a partner and licensed insolvency practitioner in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The applicant deposes in an affidavit sworn 12 January 2009 that, following the presentation of a bankruptcy petition to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales and its service effected upon the respondent, the respondent was declared bankrupt at a hearing on 25 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicant deposes further (in summary) that: Annexed to the applicant's affidavit is a certified copy of a letter from a Registrar in Bankruptcy of the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom reciting a number of facts also found in the applicant's affidavit, and requesting the assistance of the Court in relation to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Three additional affidavits have been filed supporting the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">They are: two affidavits sworn by Michael Anthony Coates, the solicitor of the applicant, on 21 January 2009 and 6 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Coates has deposed, inter alia , that he has received instructions from the applicant (subsequent to the execution of the applicant's affidavit) seeking orders that Jason Walter Bettles of Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants, a registered trustee in Australia, be appointed interim receiver of the divisible property of the respondent situated in Australia; and an affidavit sworn by Jason Walter Bettles consenting to being appointed as a receiver of the divisible property of the respondent situated in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">CONSIDERATION 
 This matter came before me this morning on an ex parte basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">At the hearing it became clear that orders sought by the applicant were pursuant to s 29 Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Section 29 provides as follows: 
 (1) All Courts having jurisdiction under this Act, the Judges of those Courts and the officers of or under the control of those Courts shall severally act in aid of and be auxiliary to each other in all matters of bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

 
 (2) In all matters of bankruptcy, the Court: 

 
(a) shall act in aid of and be auxiliary to the courts of the external Territories, and of prescribed countries, that have jurisdiction in bankruptcy; and
 
(b) may act in aid of and be auxiliary to the courts of other countries that have jurisdiction in bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 (3) Where a letter of request from a court of an external Territory, or of a country other than Australia, requesting aid in a matter of bankruptcy is filed in the Court, the Court may exercise such powers with respect to the matter as it could exercise if the matter had arisen within its own jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">

 
 (4) The Court may request a court of an external Territory, or of a country other than Australia, that has jurisdiction in bankruptcy to act in aid of and be auxiliary to it in any matter of bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">

 
 (5) In this section, prescribed country means: 

 
(a) the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand;
 
(b) a country prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection; and 
 
(c) a colony, overseas territory or protectorate of a country specified in paragraph (a) or of a country so prescribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">On the evidence before me a number of issues are clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">First, the respondent is a bankrupt in the United Kingdom pursuant to an order of the High Court of Justice of the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Second, the High Court of Justice is a court of a prescribed country for the purposes of s 29 Bankruptcy Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Third, upon the commencement of the respondent's bankruptcy, the bankrupt's estate as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986 Act (UK) vested in the applicant immediately upon the appointment taking effect: s 306(1) Insolvency Act 1986 Act (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The bankrupt's property as defined by the Insolvency Act 1986 Act (UK) includes money, goods, things in action, land and every description of property wherever situated: s 436 Insolvency Act 1986 Act (UK).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Real property of the respondent situated in Australia as described in the applicant's affidavit falls within this statutory definition and is potentially subject to the bankruptcy administration by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Fourth, prima facie there is evidence before me that the respondent has previously acted to the detriment of his creditors to dispose of property which was properly the subject of an insolvency administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Fifth, although the orders made in respect of the respondent's property by the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom are not recognised in this Court as operating as an assignment of the respondent's Australian lands ( Australian Mutual Provident Society v Gregory (1908) 5 CLR 615), the Court may act in aid of the foreign court under s 29 Bankruptcy Act to make property in Australia available to the trustee in bankruptcy to enable it to be realised for the benefit of the creditors in the foreign bankruptcy: Australian Mutual Provident Society v Gregory (1908) 5 CLR 615 at 623, 625, 628, 630; Radich v Bank of New Zealand [1993] FCA 450 ; (1993) 45 FCR 101 at 109, 115, 119; Dick as Trustee in Bankruptcy v McIntosh [2001] FCA 1008 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Indeed, s 29(1) requires this Court to give all assistance it can to a requesting Court if the conditions of the section are satisfied, leaving this Court with a discretion as to what assistance ought to be given (including discretion as to any conditions attach to the provision of assistance): Re Ayres; Ex parte Evans (1981) 51 FLR 395 at 405-407 esp at 407 per Lockhart J; Ayres v Evans (1981) 56 FLR 235 (FC) at 240, 247, 254-255; Radich v Bank of New Zealand at 105, 118; Dick as Trustee in Bankruptcy v McIntosh at [8].</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Sixth, it is clear that under s 29 Bankruptcy Act the Court has power to appoint a receiver of the respondent's property in Australia in aid of the administration of the respondent's insolvent estate in the United Kingdom: Re Ayres; Ex parte Evans (1981) 51 FLR at 408-409; Ayres v Evans (1981) 56 FLR at 240, 247, 255; Radich v Bank of New Zealand at 121-122; Dick as Trustee in Bankruptcy v McIntosh at [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Finally, I note that s 21 Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) provides: 
 If the Model Law (as it has the force of law in Australia) or a provision of this Act is inconsistent with section 29 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , the Model Law or the provision of this Act prevails, and that section has no effect to the extent of the inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

 In this case Mr Coates for the applicant has submitted that the present application is not made in terms of the Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency as enacted in Australia by the Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On the facts before me there is prima facie no inconsistency between s 29 and either the Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency or the Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) An order restraining a person from dealing with his or her own property is an extreme measure, particularly where the properties identified by the applicant are owned jointly with a third party, and the application is made ex parte .</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">However in the circumstances I consider that: Were the respondent a bankrupt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act I consider that, on the evidence before me, the Court would have both jurisdiction and cause to make a freezing order to prevent frustration or abuse of the Court's process pursuant to O 25A Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In my view, and in light of the facts and principles I have set out in this judgment, the Court has power pursuant to s 29 Bankruptcy Act to make the interim orders sought by the applicant, and should make those interim orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In conclusion however, I understand that the original letter from the Registrar of the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom requesting aid, a certified copy of which was annexed to the affidavit of the applicant, has not yet been produced to the District Registrar of Queensland Registry of the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I am prepared for the purposes of today's application to make the orders sought on the basis of the certified copy of that letter, however I also direct the applicant's solicitors to ensure that letter be produced expeditiously and delivered to the District Registrar to whom it is addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Associate:
Dated: 6 February 2009
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: Mr Michael Coates of Bennett &amp; Philp 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: The Respondent did not appear 
 Date of Hearing: 6 February 2009 
 
 Date of Judgment: 6 February 2009
