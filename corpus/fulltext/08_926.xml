1 By notice of motion dated 6 May 2008 ("the first motion"), Margaret Robinson, Edward Roe and Peter Matsumoto, on behalf of the Walman Yawuru sought the following interlocutory injunctive relief:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">That until a final determination under section 56(1) or 57 (2) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) is made the parties or their agents be restrained from taking any action: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Which would extinguish native title rights and interests as described in the decision of Merkel J on 28 April 2006; and including Area 631 (Broome Common), Reserve 1647 (Cemetery), and Areas 2735, 2736 and 2738 as per the appeal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">(b) Which was inconsistent with the native title rights of the second respondent as found by Merkel J on 28 April 2006; or
 (c) Which would cause physical damage to the land in the determination area as found by Merkel J on 28 April 2006: and in Area 631 (Broome Common), Reserve 1647 (Cemetery), and Areas 2735, 2736 and 2738 as per the appeal decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 
 

2 The applicant in the proceeding Frank Sebastian &amp; Others, on behalf of the Rubibi People, by its motion dated 28 May 2008, seeks an order that the first motion be dismissed pursuant to the provisions of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The application is supported by the affidavit of Krysti Justine Guest affirmed on 28 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">GENERAL BACKGROUND 
 
3 The substantive proceedings concerned competing claims under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act ") for native title in respect of land and waters in and around Broome in the West Kimberley Region of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant has been called the "Rubibi applicant" in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This is because they were brought by a group of people who adopted the name "Rubibi", which is an aboriginal soak or waterhole in Broome and a name generally associated with the Broome Aboriginal community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Rubibi applicant brought the proceedings on behalf of the Yawuru Community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The applicants in the first motion were originally applicants but became respondents to the proceedings on behalf of a subset of the Yawuru Community, known as the Walman Yawuru ("the Walman Yawuru respondents" ) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Their independent application for native title was dismissed: Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia (No 7) [2006] FCA 459.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They were joined as respondents on their application, by order of Merkel J: Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia (No 3) [2002] FCA 876 ; (2002) 120 FCR 512.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 The Walman Yawuru respondents had contended that they had competing and conflicting native title rights and interests, relevantly, in respect of the area being claimed by the Rubibi applicant on behalf of the Yawuru Community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The joinder was made so that the Court could determine all disputes between the competing claimants as to the existence, nature and extent of the native title rights and interests being claimed by both the Yawuru and the Walman Yawuru claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The Walman Yawuru respondents were found to have a special attachment to part of the claim area known as the Mangalagun area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">However, it was not such as to constitute or give rise to a native title right or interest as defined in ss 223(1) and 253 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It followed that no rights or interests claimed by the Walman Yawuru respondents were possessed by them as members of the Walman Yawuru clan: Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia (No 5) [2005] FCA 1025 [233] and [375].</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 In later reasons, Merkel J held that any native title rights and interest in the claim area were held by the Yawuru people on a communal basis and not by members of the Walman Yawuru on a group or clan basis and that they did not have native title rights and interests in that capacity in the claim area: Rubibi Community v The State of Western Australia (No 6) [2006] FCA 82.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">[9]
 
8 Nonetheless, the Walman Yawuru respondents later contended that, as a result of this recognition of special attachment to specific areas in Rubibi (No 5) they were entitled, under s 225(c) of the Act to have that attachment recognised in the determination as an "other interest" in relation to the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, Merkel J held that the only "rights" or "interests" the Walman Yawuru clan members might have in relation to the Yawuru claim area were those held in any capacity they might have as members of the Yawuru Community and not "other interests" that were required to be set out in the determination pursuant to s 225(c) of the Act : Rubibi (No 7), [13] 
 
9 The Walman Yawuru respondents were accordingly unsuccessful in the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">These findings were undisturbed on appeal: The State of Western Australia v Sebastian [2008] FCAFC 65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">10 The proceedings were the subject of final orders made by Merkel J in April 2006 in Rubibi (No 7) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Those orders were amended by orders of French J made on 23 November 2006, 30 April 2007 and 9 May 2007 pursuant to a limited liberty to apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The final orders included: 
 
(a) a determination of native title in which it was determined relevantly that the native title is held by the Yawuru Community;
 
(b) orders dealing with the determination of a prescribed body corporate ("PBC") under s 56(1) or s 57(2) of the Act to hold the native title rights and interests on trust for the common law holders of the native title or to act as agent on their behalf; 
 
(c) liberty to apply to a Judge of the Court in respect of limited matters, namely matters arising out of the determination of a PBC and the inclusion in the Determination of maps showing the location of the determination area and of the areas comprising it; and 
 
(d) a declaration that, in respect of areas where native title has been determined to exist, the Rubibi proceedings are not "finalised" within the meaning of s 190(4)(e) of the Act until a PBC has been determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 

The orders and declarations made by Merkel J on 28 April 2006 as well as the orders made by French J on 30 April 2007 are annexed to these reasons for ease of explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">11 Importantly, for reasons I will explain later, the determination as to the existence of native title does not take effect until the making of a determination in respect to a PBC under s 56(1) or s 57(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">12 It is anticipated that final orders will shortly be made giving effect to the reasons of the Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">BACKGROUND TO THE MOTION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 
 
13 The motion was supported by an affidavit of Mr Edward Roe affirmed on 30 April 2008 together with affidavits by Ms Robin Hanigan affirmed on 2 May and 4 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">14 Edward Leonard Roe, an elder of the Walman Yawuru clan, stated that after receiving notice of a meeting from the Kimberley Land Council ("KLC"), who represent the Rubibi applicant in relation to the negotiations, it was decided that the Walman Yawuru members would not participate in the negotiations due to previous threats of violence and because they were awaiting the decision of the appeal in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">A letter to that effect was sent to the KLC, the State of Western Australia ("the State") and other relevant parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">15 Mr Roe deposes to the perceived threat to the native title of the Walman Yawuru as a result of negotiations being conducted between the Rubibi applicant and the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He says that the Walman Yawuru are concerned to protect their traditional and custodial country especially those areas in respect of which clan members were found in the original proceedings to hold special attachment and responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He also states his concern on behalf of the Walman Yawuru to the perceived threat to damage to areas of country covered by these negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The affidavit was affirmed two days after the determination of native title made at first instance by Merkel J on 28 April 2006 but before the decision of the Full Court to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It asserts, on a number of occasions that the Walman Yawuru have native title to their "clan and custodial country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">16 Ms Hanigan is a law student who, on 10 February 2003, was granted leave by this Court under s 85 of the Act to represent the Walman Yawuru in the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">She stated that she received an undated letter from the KLC on 11 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">That letter stated that "the State had commenced negotiations with Rubibi (applicants) in order to settle native title and heritage issues affecting specific future developments proposed for Broome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" The "Rubibi Steering Committee" was to represent all the native title holders, as determined by the Court, in the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It stated that a global agreement was to be negotiated as opposed to "future act" negotiations for each individual area of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The global agreement was to be for the whole community of native title holders, despite the fact that the Walman Yawuru people had, in the past, taken separate action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It also invited Ms Hanigan to meet with the Rubibi Steering Committee to discuss any concerns the Walman Yawuru had in negotiating a "global" agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On 7 June 2007, the State sent a letter to Ms Hanigan indicating, amongst other things, that substantive negotiations would commence in July of that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">17 Ms Hanigan maintained in her correspondence that the Rubibi Steering Committee did not represent the Walman Yawuru and that they wished to be independently represented in the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">She complained that the KLC and State have failed to provide details of the locations of the "specific future developments" that may affect the Walman Yawuru claim area, or to provide full and frank disclosure of the negotiations between the State and the Rubibi Steering Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">18 Ms Hanigan also pointed to the concern of the Walman Yawuru in relation to the State's alleged disregard of their objection to the compulsory acquisition and subsequent clearing and development of certain land at Cable Beach, Broome as well as the damage to Ngaminyarri, a location found in the original proceedings to hold native title and to be important to the Walman Yawuru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">19 This affidavit too was sworn in the period between the determination judgment and the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">20 In her affidavit of 4 June 2008, Ms Hanigan refers to evidence given in the proceedings in support of assertions for clan-based native title rights and interests in Walman Yawuru traditional clan and custodial lands that covered only part of the Rubibi claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">She refers to a finding at first instance and by the Full Court of a general finding that native title existed in the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">She complains that the actions by the State and the KLC have effectively denied the Walman Yawuru the options of taking action either in the courts or under State or Commonwealth Aboriginal Heritage Protection legislation to protect specific sites of cultural significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Another compelling reason in support in the proposed interlocutory injunction is said to be the possibility that part of the determination area may be chosen for a gas processing plant and/or an associated alumina refinery plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The "critical issue" is said to be that the State and the KLC have entered into a formal agreement which recognises the KLC as the sole authority to enter into negotiations and discussions on behalf of "Traditional Owners" including the Walman Yawuru in Broome over the potential gas processing sites to service the Browse Basin gasfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">THE MOTION FOR DISMISSAL 
 
21 Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("FCA Act ") lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment, including summary dismissal: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is nonetheless not relief which is granted lightly and the Court should be cautious in dismissing proceedings pursuant to s 31A: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The utility of bringing such a motion in the present circumstances is questionable when, inevitably, there was, in effect, full argument on the first motion as the means of considering the motion for dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I will refer to the Walman Yawuru respondents, in respect to the dismissal motion, simply as the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">22 The applicant contends that the first motion has no reasonable prospect of success for the following reasons: 
 
 
 (a) the Court is functus officio; 
 (b) the Court has no jurisdiction under the Act to deal with the motion;
 (c) there is no material which could support injunctive orders;
 (d) the applicant in the motion has no procedural rights to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 Functus Officio 
 
23 The applicant submit that having made final orders, the Court is functus officio , apart from the exercise of liberty to apply, in respect of the determination of a PBC, and the inclusion of maps of the determination area in the Rubibi Determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">24 The relief sought in the first notice of motion it is said, does not fall within either category and therefore, the liberty to apply ordered by Merkel J in Rubibi (No 7) does not extend so far as to allow the making of the application for the relief sought in the first notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Further, on the appeal, the only procedural steps available to any of the parties, including the Walman Yawuru Respondents, in relation to the proceeding on appeal are in accordance with the final orders, once made, of the Full Court or to file an application in the High Court of Australia seeking special leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">25 For these reasons the applicant submits that the first motion is incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">26 I am not persuaded that this is necessarily the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Common Law Superior Courts of record do not become functus officio merely upon the making and entry of the judgment or order that determines the rights of the parties: they retain power in the same suit to make supplemental orders not limited to orders in aid of the enforcement and working out of the order determining the rights of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">So observed Drummond J in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v The Shell Company of Australia Limited (1997) 72 FCR 386 at 395.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">His Honour also observed that this Court's ancillary powers flow from authority under ss 22 and 23 of the FCA Act to resolve the whole of the controversy between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">27 This Court has power to make supplemental orders and the exercise of this jurisdiction, while no doubt requiring caution, is not limited to the making of orders in aid of the enforcement and working out of original orders, although to do so may be appropriate: Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) v White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224 at 234-236.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">These principles were reaffirmed recently by a Full Court in Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">28 Because of the position adopted by the respondent, to which I will turn shortly, it is not necessary to decide this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is unnecessary, for the same reason, to deal directly with the balance of arguments made by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I will assume, without deciding the question, that the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the first motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">29 The principle concern of the applicants on the first motion relates to "future acts" which would extinguish, impair, or would otherwise be inconsistent with native title rights and interests, the subject of the determination and which might result from negotiations currently on foot between the Rubibi applicant and the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It is accepted by the parties that any action that falls within paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of the first motion is an act affecting native title, and potentially a future act, in respect of which procedural rights may accrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Further it is accepted that any action falling within paragraph 1(c), in so far as it affects native title rights and interests, is also potentially a future act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Such future acts, could include, for example, an indigenous land use agreement involving the extinguishment of native title or surrender of native title in return for payment of compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">30 It is for the applicant to establish the grounds to warrant an order for dismissal under s 31A: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; 236 ALR 720.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Nonetheless the respondents submit that two issues arise on the first motion which, if resolved against them, would justify an order for dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I take this concession to mean that if the applicant satisfies me that the respondents have no reasonable prospects of successfully demonstrating that the two issues are serious issues to be tried then the first motion ought to be summarily dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Both issues reflect the core submission of the respondents which is to the effect that the applicant has no authority to negotiate future acts, on behalf of the Yawuru Community which includes the Walman Yawuru clan, with the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In this way the matters for judgment have been significantly confined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The First Issue 
 
31 The first issue is as to whether the applicant is the "native title party" for the purpose of negotiating with the State in respect to future acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It involves consideration of s 30(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Properly understood this issue does not involve any question of the construction of that statutory provision but rather, whether, on the facts, the provision presently has application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">32 The requirement to negotiate in respect to future acts is provided for in Subdivision P of Div 3 of Part 2 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Notification must be given by a Government party, before the act is done, relevantly here, to the registered native title claimant, which is by definition also the native title party (ss 29(2)(b) and 30 (1)(a); definition of "registered native title claimant" in s 253).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">33 It was common ground between the parties that procedural rights in relation to future acts, including the right to negotiate, accrued to a registered native title claimant, defined under s 253 of the Act , as relevantly, persons whose names appear in an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims as the applicant in relation to a claim to hold native title in relation to land and waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">34 On 24 September 1999, some of the persons comprising the Rubibi applicant were registered as a native title claimant in respect of the application which covers the whole of the area described in the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The application was amended, inter alia , to include all of the people comprising the Rubibi applicant and that registration was confirmed on 12 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">All the people comprising the Rubibi applicant are still registered as native title claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">35 A PBC has not yet been the subject of a determination by the Court under s 56(1) or s 57(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">36 The respondent submits however that the Rubibi applicant has ceased to be a native title party because it has ceased to be a registered native title claimant by virtue of s 30(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Section 30(2) of the Act provides:
 
 
 (2) A person ceases to be a native title party if the person ceases to be a registered native title claimant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">
 
 
37 Ms Hanigan placed reliance for her submission upon the printed note appearing alongside s 30(2) which provides:
 Note: If a native title claim is successful, the registered native title claimant will be succeeded as a native title party by the registered native title body corporate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">38 Clearly the Act contemplates that once an effective determination has been made the registered native title claimant will be removed from the Register and substituted by a PBC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">However, to the extent that it was determined that native title existed, the determination was to take effect immediately upon the making of a determination under s 56(1) or s 57(2) of the Act : Order 2(b) of Merkel J made on 28 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">No determination has been made under either of those provisions of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Accordingly the determination of native title has not yet taken effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">39 Counsel for the State has advised me, and I accept, that Order 2(b) was drafted in terms so as to ensure that the Rubibi applicant as the registered native title claimant would remain on the Register of Native Title Claims so that any party, such as the State, proposing to do a future act over the area where native title was determined to exist would know whom to notify of the relevant act until such time as a PBC was determined under s 56 and s 57(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">40 This drafting addressed a perceived hiatus in the Act whereby, once a native title determination had been made and taken effect over an area of land, the Registrar of the Federal Court would notify the Native Title Registrar pursuant to s 189A(b) of the Act and the Native Title Register would then be amended to remove the entry pursuant to s 190(4)(d) of the Act if the application was finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Early determinations became effective immediately with respect to areas where native title had been extinguished, as well as areas where native title existed, but allowed a period of time for nomination of a prescribed body corporate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">An example of this is to be found in the orders made in James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">In such a case, there was an hiatus period between removal of the entry from the Register of Native Title Claims and thereby removal of the details of the registered native title claimant and the entry onto the National Native Title Register of the PBC: s 193(2)(e) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In James , a period of 3 months was allowed for nomination of a PBC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Arguably, in this period there was no native title party (s 253 of the Act ) to notify or to negotiate with for the purposes of Part 2 Division 3 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">41 Since the orders of 28 April 2006 were made in these proceedings, s 190 of the Act has been amended, by s 100 of the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Act 2007 (No 125 of 2007), in the following terms:
 100.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">After paragraph 190(4)(d) Insert: 
 
 (da) if an approved determination of native title is made to the effect that native title exists in relation to an area: 
 
 (i) but no determination has yet been made under section 56; or (ii) a determination has been made under section 56 that the native title rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders, but no determination has yet been made under subsection 57(2) of which prescribed body corporate is to perform the functions mentioned in subsection 57(3); 
 
 amend the entry on the Register that relates to the claim so that it reflects that fact;...
 
 

42 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment (Technical Amendments) Bill 2007 ("the Explanatory Memorandum") at 1.319 and 1.320 relevantly states:
 Item 100 would insert paragraph 190(4)(da).</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Proposed paragraph 190(4)(da) would make clear that when a determination of native title has been made but no RNTBC has yet been determined, the Register of Native Title Claims should be amended to reflect that situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The NNTT currently proceeds on the basis that the claim is not finalised until the RNTBC has been determined or registered, which ensures that the native title holders may still be notified of any proposed future acts pending registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">However, this approach gives rise to confusion where the determination establishes that native title has been extinguished over parts of the claim area, in so far as the National Native Title Register will not reflect this (and could suggest that the claimants continue to have procedural rights over those parts).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">43 Accordingly in the period between the making of a native title determination and the making of a PBC determination or nomination, the Register of Native Title Claims will make the situation clear to ensure that procedural rights are only accorded to the registered native title claimants over areas where native title has been found to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The concern that led to the drafting of Order 2(b) has now been legislatively addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">44 In any event, because the determination of native title in this case, by virtue of Order 2(b) is yet to take effect, the Rubibi applicant, as a matter of fact, is the registered native title claimant on the Register of Native Title Claims and it is the native title party, by virtue of ss 30 and 253 of the Act for the purpose of negotiating future acts with the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">45 Accordingly s 30(2) of the Act has no application presently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The respondents' submission fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Second Issue 
 
46 The respondents submit that even if the Rubibi applicant, by virtue of their registration on the Register of Native Title Claims, hold the procedural rights including the right to negotiate in respect to the claim area, the Walman Yawuru, who form part of the Yawuru Community, have not authorised the Rubibi applicant to make the native title application and to deal with matters in relation to it as required under s 251B of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">47 Section 251B sets out the meaning of "authorise" for the purposes of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 61(1) of the Act relevantly provides that a native title determination application may be made by persons "authorised" by all the persons (the native title claim group) who according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interest comprising the particular native title claim provided the persons are also included in the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">48 In order for a claim to be registered on the Register of Native Title Claims, the Registrar must be satisfied pursuant to s 190C that, inter alia :
 
 
 (4)(b) The applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the persons in the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 

49 Until now no challenge to the authorisation of the Rubibi applicant as the registered native title applicant, on behalf of the Yawuru Community, has been taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">No application to replace the Rubibi applicant, under the provisions of s 66B of the Act was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The description of the native title claimant group in the Further Amended Native Title Determination Application Claimant Application dated 24 September 2004 includes a list of apical ancestors which is the same as the list now included in Schedule 1 to the Determination made 28 April 2006 but for the omission of the last name on the Application list, which was omitted as a result of Merkel J finding that the Goolarabooloo people were not part of the native title holding group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The first two apical ancestors named on both lists are those persons identified in oral submissions by Ms Hanigan on 4 June 2008 as the apical ancestors of the Walman Yawuru people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">50 Accordingly, the native title claim group in the WAD 6006 of 1998 Application includes the Walman Yawuru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Registrar was satisfied that the claim was authorised by all persons in the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">No challenge has been made concerning authorisation and the claim is now finalised, but for the nomination of the PBC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Final orders have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In my opinion, the Walman Yawuru cannot now raise the question of the lack of authorisation of the Rubibi applicant to deal with matters arising under the application, including the nomination of a PBC as well as future act negotiations under the provisions of the Act pending the determination of the PBC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In its negotiations with the State the Rubibi applicant represents the Yawuru Community which includes the Walman Yawuru people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">51 This submission also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">CONCLUSION 
 
52 For these reasons I am satisfied that there are no arguable serious issues to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Accordingly I am of the opinion that there is no reasonable prospect that the first motion can be successfully prosecuted and it ought to be dismissed under the provisions of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">COSTS 
 
53 The jurisdiction to order costs is conferred by s 43 of the FCA Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The power to do so is discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However that power is affected, in respect of proceedings brought under the Act by virtue of s 85A of the Act which provides: 
 
 85A Costs 
 

 
(1) Unless the Federal Court orders otherwise, each party to a proceeding must bear his or her own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 Unreasonable conduct 


 
(2) Without limiting the Court's power to make orders under subsection (1), if the Federal Court is satisfied that a party to a proceeding has, by any unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to incur costs in connection with the institution or conduct of the proceeding, the Court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">54 The first motion is brought within the substantive proceedings which are proceedings under s 61 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">I have proceeded, in these reasons, on the basis that the Court has jurisdiction and is not functus officio .</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The prima facie position under s 85A(1) is that in such proceedings each party will bear his or her own costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">55 The issues involved are, at one level, complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The applicants in the first motion have not been represented by solicitors or counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">I would not, in the circumstances, be prepared to characterise the conduct of the applicants in the first motion as being unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">This is so, even though I have concluded that the first motion has no reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The position may well have been different if the applicants in the first motion had been represented by experienced lawyers: cf Birri-Gubba (Cape Upstart) People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 659.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">[37] These observations should not be seen in any way as a reflection on Ms Hanigan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Ms Hanigan is a law student who I have no doubt has been doing her best to represent the interests of the applicants in the first motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">They are not in receipt of public funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">56 Furthermore, the articulation by Ms Hanigan of the two issues, which I have dealt with, together with her concession, quite properly made, that the resolution of these adverse to those whom she represents would justify the summary dismissal of the first motion greatly reduced both the time of the hearing and the issues for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">57 No other basis exists, in my view, to depart from the prima facie rule under s 85A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I would make no order as to costs either in respect of the first motion or the dismissal motion, each of which was necessarily tied to the other.</sentence>
