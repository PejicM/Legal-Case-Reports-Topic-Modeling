 The nature and history of the proceeding
 The principal question raised in this appeal concerns the powers of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") when dealing with a review of a deemed decision to refuse access to documents, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In particular, the question is whether the Tribunal has power to compel the recipient of a request for access to documents to make an actual decision in response to the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In 2003, the applicant, Ms Bienstein, made a separate request to each of the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth ("the Attorney-General") and the Minister for Justice and Customs (now the Minister for Home Affairs) (in each case, "the Minister") for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Attorney-General and the Minister each purported to transfer the request to the Attorney-General's Department, pursuant to s 16 of the FOI Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Ms Bienstein applied to the Tribunal for review of a deemed decision, pursuant to ss 55 and 56 of the FOI Act, on the basis that, at the expiration of the requisite period from the making of each request, there had not been a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In each case, the Tribunal determined that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">See Re: Bienstein and Attorney-General (Cth) [2004] AATA 896 and Re: Bienstein and Minister for Justice and Customs [2004] AATA 895.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Tribunal concluded that each request for access to documents had been transferred validly to the Attorney-General's Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Ms Bienstein appealed to this Court from those two decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">She was successful on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The decision of the Tribunal on each of the applications for review was set aside and each of the cases was remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and decided again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">See Bienstein v Attorney-General [2007] FCA 1174 (2007) 162 FCR 405.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 31 October 2007, the Tribunal gave directions, requiring the Attorney-General and the Minister to file and serve a summary of all the evidence detailing the searches conducted and any other documents on which they intended to rely at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal scheduled a directions hearing for 26 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">By letter dated 12 November 2007, Ms Bienstein submitted that the directions were inconsistent with the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">She submitted that the Tribunal should have directed that "a decision be furnished and a section 37 statement be filed and served in support of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">" Ms Bienstein sought amendment of the directions accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There was argument about this issue at a telephone directions hearing on 26 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Following that, on 4 January 2008, the Tribunal published a decision expressed in the following terms: 
 
 The Tribunal has decided that: 
 

 
 
 (1) it has no power to direct the Attorney-General or the Justice Minister to make a decision; 
 

 
 
 (2) it has jurisdiction to review the decisions deemed to have been made by the Attorney-General and the Justice Minister i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">decisions to refuse Mrs Bienstein's request for access to documents; 
 

 
 
 (3) the Attorney-General and Justice Minister have a duty to comply with s 37(1) of the AAT Act and, under that section, the time within which they must do so to is extended until 1 February 2008; and 
 

 
 
 (4) it is under no obligation to order that the directions hearing be recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 

 
At the same time, the Tribunal gave written reasons for that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">See Bienstein v Attorney-General (Commonwealth of Australia) [2008] AATA 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 4 February 2008, Ms Bienstein filed in this Court a purported appeal pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act") in respect of this decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That proceeding became number VID 65 of 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Ms Bienstein subsequently discontinued it, probably as a result of becoming aware of authorities such as Director-General of Social Services v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 47 FLR 80 , in which it has been held that an interlocutory ruling or decision by the Tribunal is not necessarily a "decision" from which an appeal lies pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal proceeded to deal with the two applications for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In the course of managing them, the Tribunal made a further interlocutory decision on 23 April 2008, as to the directions to be given, declining to accept submissions of Ms Bienstein, who sought detailed directions to each respondent as to the nature of the searches that each should undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">See Bienstein v Attorney-General (Commonwealth of Australia) [2008] AATA 330.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On 5 May and 6 June 2008, the Tribunal conducted a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On 13 June 2008, the Tribunal published its decision, affirming the decisions deemed to have been made by the Attorney-General and the Minister to refuse access to documents as requested by Ms Bienstein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal found that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister had taken all reasonable steps to find documents meeting the terms of Ms Bienstein's requests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal was satisfied that no documents, other than those that had already been found, existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">On 16 July 2008, Ms Bienstein filed a notice of appeal in this Court in respect of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">That appeal became proceeding number VID 563 of 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 2 January 2009, Ms Bienstein filed an application for an order of review, pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act"), which became proceeding number VID 1 of 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Originally, Ms Bienstein named as respondents to that proceeding Malcolm Bennett, the FOI Director of the Attorney-General's Department, as well as the Attorney-General and the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">By consent on 3 February 2009, it was ordered that Mr Bennett be removed as a party to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The object of the proceeding was to obtain an order that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister make a decision on Ms Bienstein's request for documents and provide Ms Bienstein with notice of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">On 28 January 2009, the Attorney-General and the Minister filed a notice of objection to the competency of that proceeding, contending that the application was filed outside the time limits set out in s 11(3) and (4) of the ADJR Act, and that the Attorney-General and the Minister were not under any duty, and did not have any power, to make decisions under the FOI Act, and consequently there was no failure to make decisions they had a duty to make, within s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Proceedings numbers VID 563 of 2008 and VID 1 of 2009 were heard together.</sentence>

 Section 26 of the AAT Act provides: 
 
 (1) Subject to section 42D, after an application is made to the Tribunal for a review of a decision, the decision may not be altered otherwise than by the Tribunal on the review unless:

<sentence id="s64">
 

 Making a decision
 Ms Bienstein sought to justify the central proposition of her argument, that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs was and is required to make a decision on her request, in a number of ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The one thing she could not do was to point to any provision of the FOI Act imposing a specific duty to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The effect of s 56(1) of the FOI Act is to treat a failure to make a decision within the 30 day time limit as a deemed decision to refuse to grant access to the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">There is no positive provision to the effect that a decision must be made within the 30 day period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The absence of such a provision tends to suggest that there is no enforceable right to have a decision made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Ms Bienstein said that, once judgment had been given on her earlier applications to the Court, she expected that the Attorney-General and the Minister would each give a decision on her request for access to documents within 30 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Why she might have expected this is not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The orders of the Court certainly did not purport to give rise to any such obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Once the Tribunal's decisions that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with Ms Bienstein's applications for review were set aside, each case was remitted to the Tribunal to be heard and decided again according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The orders clearly left the cases in the hands of the Tribunal, rather than in the hands of the Attorney-General and the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Ms Bienstein's argument placed heavy reliance on what she characterised as words of limitation in s 56(1) of the FOI Act, "for the purpose of enabling an application to be made to the Tribunal under section 55".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Her argument was that deeming a decision refusing to grant access to documents to have been made for this limited purpose demonstrated a legislative intention not to substitute the deemed decision for an actual decision on the request for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Ms Bienstein drew attention to the contrasting terminology in s 30A(1B) of the FOI Act, in which a decision in relation to remission of an application fee "is taken, for all purposes of this Act" to have been made when the time limit expires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Similarly, Ms Bienstein pointed to s 25(5) of the AAT Act, under which a failure to do what is required "shall be deemed to constitute the making of a decision" at the expiration of the time limit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">There are no qualifying words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Ms Bienstein sought to construe s 56(1), in conjunction with s 58(1), of the FOI Act as conferring on the Tribunal power to review the failure of the recipient of a request for access to documents to make a decision, not to review a refusal to grant access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Her argument was that the function of the Tribunal was to determine whether the Attorney-General and the Minister should have made decisions on her requests, rather than to review a refusal to grant access to the documents requested, there not having been any actual refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Ms Bienstein asked rhetorically if the FOI Act contained no obligation on a Minister to make a decision, why would any Minister ever make a decision?</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Ms Bienstein argued that if, for constitutional reasons, the Tribunal could not direct the Attorney-General or the Minister to make a decision in relation to her request for access to documents, because it lacked enforcement powers, the Court could nonetheless do so under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">This was the reason for the filing of the application under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Ms Bienstein contended that there was no difficulty about that application being outside the time limit imposed by s 11(3) of the ADJR Act because, in the absence of an actual decision, there was no point from which time could begin to run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Each of Ms Bienstein's arguments runs up against the problem of the absence from the FOI Act of any express obligation to make a decision on the part of a recipient of a request for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Instead of an express obligation to make a decision, there are two possibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">One is that the recipient of the request will make a decision, in which case there is a right of review conferred by s 55(1) of the FOI Act (subject to any requirement of internal review imposed by s 54).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">If no decision is made, s 56(1), in conjunction with s 55(1)(a), gives rise to a right of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The purpose of s 56(1) is clearly to provide to a person who has a right of review as a result of a deemed decision the same right as that given by s 55(1)(a) to a person who has a right of review as a result of an actual decision refusing to grant access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In the case of a deemed refusal, it is not the failure to make a decision that the Tribunal reviews, but the refusal to grant access to documents that is deemed to have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The closing words of s 56(1), "a decision refusing to grant access to the document", make this abundantly clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">If authority be needed to support the proposition, it is found in Cashman &amp; Partners v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health [1995] FCA 1730 ; (1995) 61 FCR 301 at 306.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In that case, the recipient of a request for access to documents had not made a decision within the 30 day period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The person making the request applied to the Tribunal for review of the deemed refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Tribunal directed the recipient of the request to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The recipient did not comply with the direction, but filed an affidavit identifying documents as falling within the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal made a decision setting aside the deemed decision to refuse access by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It remitted the matter to the recipient of the request with a direction to grant access to certain designated documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The question then arose as to whether the Tribunal should make a recommendation, pursuant to s 66 of the FOI Act, for the payment of costs of the proceeding in the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal declined to make a recommendation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The proceeding in the Court was an appeal from the decision to decline to make a recommendation for the payment of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">On the appeal, at 305, Beazley J found that the Tribunal had identified what she described as "the second decision" as the relevant decision for its review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Her Honour then proceeded at 306 to hold that the relevant decision was the deemed decision refusing to grant access to the documents, not the decision to make the affidavit setting out the documents access to which was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In doing so, her Honour declined to distinguish Hounslow v Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Sweeney J, 20 December 1985) on the basis that, in that case, there had been an actual decision to refuse access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Her Honour said: 
 
 I do not consider the ground upon which counsel sought to distinguish Sweeney J's decision in Hounslow to be a relevant point of distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">An applicant is in no different position in the case of a deemed refusal than in the case of a considered refusal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In each case, the applicant is not granted access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In each case, the applicant has the right to apply to the Tribunal for review of the decision although the relevant factors on review will, of course, be different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In my opinion, subject to the respondent's s 56(5) submission, Sweeney J's decision in Hounslow applies to this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 

 
It is not entirely clear what her Honour meant by the proposition that the relevant factors on review will be different as between an actual decision to refuse access and a deemed decision to refuse access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In each case, the task of the Tribunal will be to make the correct or preferable decision on the material before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Cashman is clear authority for the view that the Tribunal's task in the case of a deemed decision to refuse access to documents is no different from its task in the case of an actual decision to refuse access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This proposition disposes of another of Ms Bienstein's arguments in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">That is the argument that the making of a decision would have given the Tribunal the opportunity to look at the reasons for a decision to see if they complied with the FOI Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In reviewing a decision of any kind, the function of the Tribunal is not to decide whether the reasons given by the original decision-maker are correct or adequate or appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The task of the Tribunal is to make its own decision and to do so by starting afresh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">This has been recognised since Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1979] AATA 179 ; (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 419 per Bowen CJ and Deane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">A comparison of terminology between different statutes, or even between different provisions in the same statute, can sometimes be useful in determining the meaning of a statutory provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Differences in terminology are not necessarily a reliable indicator of an intention to produce different results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">There is a clear purpose behind the use of the words "for the purpose of enabling an application to be made to the Tribunal" in s 56(1) of the FOI Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">That purpose is to make it clear that it is not necessary for a person affected by a deemed decision to refuse access to documents to go through the internal review process for which s 54 provides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In the case of an actual decision to refuse access to documents, internal review under s 54 would be a prerequisite to an application to the Tribunal for review under s 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In the case of a deemed decision to refuse, Parliament has obviously taken the view that it would be pointless to waste the time of a person requesting access to documents by requiring him or her to seek internal review of a decision that had not in fact been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By contrast, the effect of the words "for all purposes of this Act" in s 30A(1B) would be to subject a deemed decision to refuse to remit an application fee to the same requirement of internal review as would be imposed in the event of an actual decision refusing to remit the fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">A comparison of these two provisions with s 25(5) of the AAT Act is of little value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The AAT Act is a general application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The specific provisions of the FOI Act would take precedence over the general provisions of the AAT Act in the event of conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Given that the specific words of both s 56(1) and s 30A(1B) of the FOI Act have identifiable purposes, any attempt to attach significance to the absence of qualifying words in s 25(5) of the AAT Act cannot succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The argument that s 58(1) of the FOI Act gives the Tribunal power to review a failure to make a decision is not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Section 58(1) constitutes the conferral on the Tribunal of wide powers in a proceeding to review a decision or, as in the present case, a deemed decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The conferral of a power "to review any decision that has been made" does not amount to the conferral of a power to review a failure to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">For the Tribunal to attempt to review a failure to make a decision would be a distraction from the task of the Tribunal, which is to make the correct or preferable decision, on the material before it, in relation to the request for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It is not to the point to ask why any Minister would ever make a decision if there is no obligation to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Doubtless, many Ministers do make decisions, because they see it as important to respond to requests for access to documents, rather than to allow the responsibility to be undertaken by the Tribunal on a review of a deemed decision refusing to grant access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Tribunal was correct to determine, in its decision of 4 January 2008, that it had no power to direct the Attorney-General or the Minister to make a decision, but had jurisdiction to review the decisions deemed to have been made by the Attorney-General and the Minister to refuse Ms Bienstein's requests for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">As the Tribunal recognised at [29] of its reasons for this decision, it had a power under s 42D of the AAT Act to remit a decision for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">If it had chosen to exercise this power, and remitted the relevant deemed decision to each of the Attorney-General and the Minister, each of them might have been motivated to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">It is by no means clear that this would have occurred, because the advocate representing both the Attorney-General and the Minister had made it clear to the Tribunal at a directions hearing that neither proposed to make a further decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">This may have been a reason for the Tribunal refraining from exercising its power to remit under s 42D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In any event, that power is a discretionary one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The exercise of a discretion conferred on the Tribunal is immune from appeal to this Court unless it raises a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The exercise of the discretion by the Tribunal in the present case does not raise a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Similarly, the power given to the Tribunal by s 56(6) of the FOI Act to allow further time to deal with a request for access to documents involved a discretionary power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Neither that subsection nor s 56(5) of the FOI Act authorises the Tribunal to direct the making of a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">As the Tribunal said at [31] of its reasons for decision of 4 January 2008: 
 
 Section 56(5) does not authorise the Tribunal to direct an agency or Minister to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It permits it only to facilitate the making of a decision should the agency or Minister wish to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Such further decisions are not infrequent and assist in narrowing the documents that are truly in issue between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">
 

 For these reasons, the Tribunal was correct to hold that it did not have power to direct either the Attorney-General or the Minister to make an actual decision on Ms Bienstein's request for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Tribunal dealt with the deemed decision to refuse such access, as it was obliged to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Bias
 In argument, Ms Bienstein raised the question of bias on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Initially, she said that bias was not advanced as a ground for overturning the Tribunal's decision, but was advanced on the basis that, if the decision were to be overturned on other grounds, the Tribunal should be reconstituted upon the case being remitted to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In reply, Ms Bienstein said that she wished to raise the question of bias as a separate ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">She made it clear that she was not alleging bias against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Rather, she was alleging that the Tribunal had either an actual or an apprehended predisposition to protect Ministers from having to comply with requests for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The test that must be satisfied before a decision-maker can be disqualified for bias is well known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the decision-maker might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Obviously, the fact that the ultimate decision in a proceeding is adverse to a party is not evidence of bias against that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In the overwhelming majority of cases, one party will be successful and the other unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The basis on which Ms Bienstein alleged bias is set out at some length in her amended notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It may be summarised as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Ms Bienstein characterised the Deputy President who constituted the Tribunal as her opponent and suggested that the advocate for the Attorney-General and the Minister had minimal input into arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">She referred to a directions hearing at which she said the Deputy President had spoken more than three times as much as the advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Ms Bienstein complained that the advocate for the Attorney-General and the Minister was an officer of the Attorney-General's Department and was therefore not a proper person to appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">She was concerned that, although the transfers of the requests for access to documents to the Attorney-General's Department had been held to be invalid, it was still an officer of that department who was appearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Further, the advocate said that he did not take instructions directly from the Attorney-General or the Minister, but only from their staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The Deputy President ruled that the Tribunal was not an appropriate forum to discuss how the advocate received instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Ms Bienstein characterised this as the Tribunal preventing the advocate from disclosing more information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">She said the Tribunal provided no opportunity for the parties to make submissions on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Ms Bienstein complained that directions hearings were being conducted by the Tribunal by telephone, and were not being recorded for transcript purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The Deputy President refused to order them to be recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Ms Bienstein was alleging failure to comply with my earlier judgment, as well as bias, lack of independence and collusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">She said that the absence of recording for transcript meant that these issues could not come to light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Part of the complaint of bias concerned the refusal of the Tribunal to order the Attorney-General and the Minister to make decisions and the Tribunal's refusal to review their failure to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Ms Bienstein contended that the Tribunal had failed to disclose information vital to her understanding about her rights, by failing to explain the difference between a court, which has the power to enforce, and the Tribunal which does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Ms Bienstein asked the Tribunal to order that each of the Attorney-General and the Minister file a statement complying with s 37 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Ms Bienstein said that such a statement should attach all of the required documents, including print-outs of computer screens showing all searches and all results of searches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Initially, the Tribunal ordered only a statement of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Eventually, it directed the Attorney-General and the Minister to provide s 37 statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Ms Bienstein complained that these were inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">They were signed by an officer of the Attorney-General's Department (which Ms Bienstein regarded as a contravention of my earlier judgment), were meaningless in the absence of any decision by the Attorney-General or the Minister, and did not attach documentary evidence as Ms Bienstein thought they should.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Ms Bienstein criticised the Tribunal for accepting these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Tribunal refused a request by Ms Bienstein to direct that the documents be re-done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Ms Bienstein then wrote a letter to the Tribunal, detailing her complaints, but the Tribunal did not act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Ms Bienstein complained again that the Deputy President behaved as if she were Ms Bienstein's opponent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">She also alleged that the Tribunal had misconstrued her letter in subsequent reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">She also alleged that the Tribunal effectively refused to determine a question of law relating to s 37 and allowed "a patently insufficient defence to stand in a matter where the Respondent bears onus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">" To a large extent, Ms Bienstein's complaints about the Tribunal's handling of the case can be traced to her understanding of my earlier judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">That judgment did not establish the proposition that the Attorney-General and the Minister were obliged to make decisions on Ms Bienstein's requests for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Each case was remitted to the Tribunal, and it was for the Tribunal to exercise the function of dealing with each request and making its own decision on that request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">As I have said, the Tribunal could not compel either the Attorney-General or the Minister to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">A statement under s 37(1) of the AAT Act is a statement of reasons (including findings on questions of fact) by the original decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Such a statement is required to be accompanied by the documents relevant to review by the Tribunal of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">In the absence of an actual decision, it is hardly surprising that the Tribunal resisted Ms Bienstein's attempts to persuade it to require the lodging of such a statement by either the Attorney-General or the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Nor is it surprising that, when the Tribunal did accede to Ms Bienstein's request and order s 37 statements, the statements were not of great assistance to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">There was no actual decision reasons for which could be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">There was no review of such an actual decision by the Tribunal, so it was difficult to know what documents might have been relevant to such a review if there had been any decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Ms Bienstein simply had the wrong idea about the function of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">No doubt this contributed to her frustration that the Tribunal did not accept that the situation was as she saw it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">For the Deputy President constituting the Tribunal to be the principal person responding to an applicant's submissions in a directions hearing is not necessarily indicative of the Deputy President becoming Ms Bienstein's opponent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">At a directions hearing, a party is seeking directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It is appropriate that the Tribunal respond to every suggestion as to what directions might be made, without necessarily calling on the opposing party to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It is often more convenient for a judge, or a Tribunal member, to filter out from one side's requests those that are not appropriate before calling upon the other party to respond to those that may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">It was also appropriate for the Tribunal to put an end to Ms Bienstein's attempts to investigate how the advocate for the Attorney-General and the Minister was receiving instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It was not for Ms Bienstein to select the person who would appear for the Attorney-General and the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It was not for Ms Bienstein to query the nature or quality of that person's instructions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">If the Attorney-General and the Minister wished to use an officer of the Attorney-General's Department, that was a matter for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">If they wished to authorise members of their staff to instruct that officer, again that was a matter for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">There was no point in pursuing the matter in the Tribunal, which could not have made any decision about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The Tribunal's refusal to record directions hearings was also not evidence of bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">By s 33(1)(a) of the AAT Act, the procedure of the Tribunal is within the discretion of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Nothing in the AAT Act requires that there be a transcript of every hearing, particularly of a directions hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The need for expedition and economy in conducting proceedings will often give rise to telephone directions hearings that are not recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The fact that Ms Bienstein wished to raise allegations of bias, lack of independence, contempt of this Court, or collusion (as a result of her misunderstanding of the effect of the earlier judgment) did not give her a right to require the Tribunal to have all directions hearings recorded for the purpose of transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">For these reasons, Ms Bienstein has failed to establish that a reasonable lay observer would have apprehended that the Tribunal did not bring an open mind to Ms Bienstein's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Other Questions
 The appellant's amended notice of appeal contained several other questions, in the following terms: Whether a decision deemed by the FOI Act to have been made "for the purpose of making an application to the Tribunal" may be taken in Tribunal proceedings as deemed for a different or an additional purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">
 Whether an FOI request directed to a Minister may lawfully be transferred or referred for processing to the Minister's Department and whether the effect of a valid transfer is to free the transferor agency or Minister of the duty to furnish to the applicant notices of acknowledgment and decision in accordance with s 15 FOI Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">
 What, in a FOI proceeding where the adequacy of searches is in issue, constitutes compliance with s 37 AAT Act?</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">
 What duties did the decision in Bienstein v Attorney-General and Justice Minister [2007] FCA 1174 settle on: 
 
 
 
 (a) lawyers who appeared for the Respondents in that proceeding and their instructor(s); 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) the Attorney-General's Department and the Departmental Officer in possession of the purportedly transferred requests; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (c) the Respondents; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (d) the Tribunal; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (e) the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, where the FOI legislation is administered by the Privacy &amp; FOI policy Branch and the responsible Minister, being Cabinet Secretary, Senator Faulkner; 
 
 

 To what extent is the Tribunal competent to enforce the Applicant's rights under s 11 FOI Act in applications brought on the basis of the Respondent's failure to furnish a timely decision on the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">
 Whether each government agency and Minister has a duty under the FOI Act to establish procedures consistent with that legislative scheme for the receipt and processing of requests in and by the said agency or Ministerial office and for the receipt and implementation of consequential Tribunal and Court decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 These questions are posed in a way that makes them academic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">They are in general terms, rather than terms that are specific to the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">A question of law on which an appeal can be brought pursuant to s 44(1) of the AAT Act is a means by which a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may invite the Court to find that the Tribunal has made an error of law affecting its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Section 44(1) of the AAT Act confers on the Court, as part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth under Ch III of the Constitution , jurisdiction to deal with appeals on such questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The Court does not have power to give general expositions of the law on various subjects, even if those subjects are in some way related to a decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Thus, the Court cannot provide the sort of advice that is apparently sought by each of questions 3, 4, 5 and 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The general effect of questions 1 and 2 was narrowed by Ms Bienstein's oral arguments to the question whether the Tribunal had power to order the Attorney-General and the Minister to make decisions on Ms Bienstein's requests for access to documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">That question has been dealt with above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">To the extent to which questions 1 and 2 in the amended notice of appeal are in broader terms, they cannot be dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">The Tribunal's ultimate finding
 The Tribunal's decision of 13 June 2008 was to affirm the decision deemed to have been made by each of the Attorney-General and the Minister to refuse access to documents as requested by Ms Bienstein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This decision was based on a finding that all reasonable steps had been taken by each of the Attorney-General and the Minister to find the documents Ms Bienstein sought and that, except for the documents that had been located and dealt with previously, the documents to which Ms Bienstein requested access did not exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">By s 24A of the FOI Act, a finding in these terms justifies a refusal of a request for access to a document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Whether all reasonable steps had been taken, and whether documents exist, are questions of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Findings of fact on those questions can only be overturned in this Court if there is some error of law on the part of the Tribunal that leads to a conclusion that the finding is not a proper result of the exercise of the Tribunal's powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Ordinarily, a finding of fact of this nature will mean that, even if there are errors of law on the part of the Tribunal, if those errors do not taint the findings of fact under s 24A of the FOI Act, the Tribunal's decision will stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The findings of the Tribunal under s 24A of the FOI Act in the present case have additional significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">If Ms Bienstein had managed to make out a case that the Attorney-General and the Minister were required to make decisions on her requests for access to documents she would not necessarily be entitled to the relief she sought in her proceeding under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">This is because the grant of such relief would be futile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Each of the Attorney-General and the Minister would have been entitled simply to refuse Ms Bienstein's request for access to documents on the basis that all reasonable steps had been taken to find the documents and no further documents existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Tribunal's findings of fact under s 24A of the FOI Act were fatal to Ms Bienstein's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Costs
 In the course of the hearing of the appeal, I asked specifically of counsel whether the Attorney-General and the Minister would seek an order for costs against Ms Bienstein if they were successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">I was advised subsequently by letter to my associate that the Attorney-General and the Minister did seek costs in the event that they were successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Ms Bienstein has failed to establish any of the points on which her case was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In particular, she has failed to justify her belief that she had a right to have a decision from each of the Attorney-General and the Minister in relation to her request for access to documents, notwithstanding that each case had been remitted to the Tribunal for its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">In the circumstances, there is no reason why the usual principle, that costs follow the event, should not be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Conclusion
 The appeal in proceeding number VID 563 of 2008 and the application in proceeding number VID 1 of 2009 must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">In each case, Ms Bienstein will be ordered to pay the respondents' costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray.</sentence>
