 1 This is an appeal from the decision of Hartnett FM, dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appeal was heard by a single judge pursuant to a direction by the Chief Justice under s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a 28 year old national of Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He arrived in Australia on 22 July 1998 as a holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 560.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant was enrolled in an Advanced Diploma of Computer Science at RMIT University ('RMIT') from July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The appellant's subclass 560 visa was valid until 15 August 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On that date, the appellant was granted a further subclass 560 visa which remained valid until 15 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 15 March 2002, the appellant lodged an application for a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 572.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The relevant legislative provisions for the subclass 572 visa can be briefly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The requirements for grant of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 572, are set out in Sch 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations').</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Clause 572.212 requires that if the application for a visa is made in Australia, the applicant must have complied substantially with the conditions to which the visa (if any) held, or last held, by the applicant is, or was, subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Clause 572.226 requires that if the application was made in Australia, the visa applicant must continue to satisfy the criterion in cl 572.212.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 At the time of his application, the last visa held by the appellant was a subclass 560 visa, which was valid for the period 15 August 2000 to 15 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It was a requirement of that visa that the appellant complied with condition 8202 under Sch 8 of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">By virtue of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Overseas Students) Act 2000 (Cth), condition 8202 is that:
 
 '(a) in the case of a holder of a Subclass 560 visa who is an AusAID or secondary school exchange student the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study; and 
 (b) in any other case --- the holder is enrolled in a registered course; and 
 (c) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records --- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester --- for the course; or 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term and semester of that course; and 
 (d) in any case --- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester --- for the course; or 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 

6 By letter to the appellant dated 23 April 2002, the respondent's delegate refused to grant the appellant a subclass 572 visa on the basis that the delegate was not satisfied that the appellant had complied substantially with condition 8202 during the period of his last visa, and accordingly that the appellant did not meet cl 572.212 of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">THE TRIBUNAL'S REVIEW OF THE DELEGATE'S DECISION 
 
7 The appellant applied for review of the delegate's decision by application to the Tribunal dated 20 May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Tribunal heard the application on 23 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The appellant attended the hearing and gave oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 The Tribunal had before it a transcript of the appellant's academic results covering the periods from 1 February 2000 to 30 November 2000 and from 5 February 2001 to 30 November 2001, together with confirmation of his continued enrolment in 2002, which the appellant had submitted for the purposes of his visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Tribunal found that the appellant achieved the following results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">2000 Academic Year: 
Passed: 0 Failed: 6 Did not sit: 15 Withdrawn: 13 No record: 1

 2001 Academic Year: 
Passed: 5 Failed: 1 Did not sit: 9 Withdrawn: 22 Exempted: 2

 
9 On 13 December 2002, the Tribunal received a facsimile letter from Mr McCann, Head of Department, Faculty of Applied Science at RMIT, which stated:
 
 'Our records indicate that [the appellant] commenced the Advanced Diploma of Computer Science (ADCS) program in this Department in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">During that year, his academic results were very poor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Given more time, it might be possible for me to unearth [the appellant's] attendance records for 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 [The appellant] continued in the ADCS program throughout 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Whilst he passed a number of courses in the program during 2001, overall his academic results remained well short of satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Our attendance records for [the appellant] for 2001 indicate that his attendance that year was unsatisfactory (significantly less than 80%).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 [The appellant] was enrolled in the ADCS program for the first half of 2002 (Semester 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">During this period, our records indicate that both his academic results and also his attendance at classes (approx 80%) were satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">' 
 
 

10 On 16 January 2003, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to comment in writing and to provide additional information in relation to circumstances which may have adversely affected his academic record in 2000 and 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appellant responded on 25 February 2003, stating that he believed RMIT's records was wrong in relation to his academic results because of problems with the university's new software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The appellant also claimed that some of his results may be missing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He informed the Tribunal that he believed he could obtain exemptions from many of the subjects which RMIT's records show him to have failed and that he was awaiting his original student results to be sent from Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The appellant requested an extension of time to be able to show the Tribunal that he had complied with his visa conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal granted an extension of time until 3 April 2003 to provide further information and comments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The appellant did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">11 The appellant applied for an adjournment of the Tribunal hearing due to ill health, and the hearing was consequently rescheduled for 17 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The appellant did not attend on that day but agreed to attend a hearing on 23 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">12 At the Tribunal hearing, the appellant lodged nine laminated documents which appeared to the Tribunal member to be upgraded RMIT Transcripts of Results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The appellant also lodged a letter dated 16 May 2003 purporting to be signed by Mr McCann of RMIT, which stated that the appellant's results for 2000 and 2001 are now found to be satisfactory, and two medical certificates purporting to be from the Royal Melbourne Hospital for the periods 30 July 2001 to 16 August 2001 and for 17 days from 17 July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Tribunal member perused these documents and found several indications that none of the documents were genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The appellant subsequently admitted that he had forged all the documents, although he contended that a friend had forged Mr McCann's signature on the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">13 In relation to the appellant's academic results, the Tribunal found that in Semester 2, 2000, the appellant passed no subjects and that during the 2001 academic year the appellant achieved a total of seven passes/exemptions out of the 17 subjects that he undertook (having withdrawn from 22).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Tribunal found that the appellant's education provider did not certify that the appellant had achieved an academic result that was at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">14 In relation to the appellant's attendance, the Tribunal did not make a finding as to the appellant's compliance with condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal stated that RMIT did not provide the Tribunal with exact figures for the appellant's attendance throughout the relevant period, however the Tribunal noted that it was clear that the appellant's attendance was poor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">15 The Tribunal took into account that strict compliance with cls 572.212 and 572.226 is not required and that substantial compliance is sufficient to meet the criteria: Baidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 (' Baidakova' ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Tribunal considered whether there were any circumstances beyond the control of the appellant, such as absence or failure due to illness, and whether the appellant was able to provide evidence in support of these circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">This accorded with the guidelines in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs' Procedures Advice Manual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In the Tribunal's view, the appellant had failed to provide any genuine information of such circumstances beyond his control, or any genuine information regarding his unsatisfactory academic results or attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Rather, the Tribunal found that the appellant had presented and relied upon forged documents to explain or excuse his breach of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal also noted that the appellant's breach was significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">16 On the basis of the relevant material before it and applying the test in Baidakova , the Tribunal found that at the time of his application, the appellant had not complied substantially with the conditions of his Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 560, during the period 15 August 2000 to 15 March 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Therefore the Tribunal determined that the appellant failed to meet the requirements of cl 572.212 and affirmed the delegate's decision not to grant a subclass 572 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S REVIEW OF THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 
17 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of the Tribunal's decision on 17 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The application was dismissed by Hartnett FM on 17 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">His Honour found that the Tribunal's reasons disclosed no error or law or principle and that there had been no breach of natural justice or unfairness in relation to the way in which the Tribunal had conducted its proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">18 In the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant contended that the Tribunal had ignored a relevant consideration, being the alleged practice that RMIT provided results without commenting upon whether they were satisfactory or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Hartnett FM's reasons state that the appellant's contention appeared to be derived from a telephone conversation between a Tribunal officer and the international student officer at RMIT on 6 August 2003 in which the international student officer is alleged to have said:
 
 'RMIT gives results but don't comment on whether or not they are satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She said that the Tribunal will need to work this out from his results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">' 
 

19 Hartnett FM went on to state:
 
 'Whatever the practice of RMIT might be, and whatever the international student officer's understanding of that practice might have been, condition 8202 clearly requires that the visa holder: 
 
 
 
 Achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 
 In the absence of such a certificate there is not compliance with condition 8202, and subject to the possibility of substantial compliance, an applicant would not satisfy the requirements for a further visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 In any event it is clear that RMIT did not consider the applicant's results to be at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The applicant's Head of Department sent the Tribunal a facsimile on 13 December 2002, describing the academic results as "very poor" and "well short of satisfactory" for 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The international student officer herself when asked in writing, and presumably when RMIT's obligations were explained to her, responded that the applicant --- 
 
 
 
 did not achieve a satisfactory result --- 
 
 
 
 for the 2000 and 2001 academic years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 Accordingly it cannot be said that the Tribunal ignored a relevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 The applicant alleged the Tribunal made its own findings about whether the applicant's results were satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">That is not what the Tribunal did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It found that RMIT had not certified the results to be at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">There was no certificate provided and nor should there have been such a certificate based on the applicant's academic results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 

20 Hartnett FM noted that the appellant was advised by the Tribunal in correspondence of 16 January 2003 that information obtained by the Tribunal indicated that his attendance and academic results were unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Tribunal gave the appellant an opportunity to submit further information and comments in relation to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In the circumstances, Hartnett FM was not persuaded that there had been any breach of natural justice or unfairness in relation to the way the Tribunal conducted its proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">ISSUES ON APPEAL 
 
21 An appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court's decision is an appeal by way of a re-hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The powers of the appellate court are to be exercised only where the appellant can demonstrate, having regard to all the evidence before the appellate court, that the order that is the subject of appeal is the result of some legal, factual or discretionary error: Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">22 On appeal, the appellant alleged a number of jurisdictional errors based on the purported practice of RMIT not to comment on whether results were satisfactory or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The appellant contended that the Tribunal had been informed that RMIT had a policy of providing academic results without comment as to whether those results were satisfactory or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">In light of that policy, the appellant submitted that strict compliance with condition 8202 was not possible and it was open to the Tribunal to make its own finding as to whether the appellant had achieved substantial compliance with condition 8202: Gurung v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 772 (' Gurung ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The appellant submitted that the Tribunal did not properly make its own finding about whether the appellant's results were satisfactory, but rather relied on the opinions of RMIT staff whose statements about the appellant's academic performance were contrary to RMIT's established procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">23 These circumstances were said by the appellant to give rise to jurisdictional error on two bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">First, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal had relied upon opinions expressed by staff members of RMIT as to whether or not the appellant's results in the years 2000 and 2001 were or were not satisfactory, knowing that the giving of such opinions was contrary to RMIT's established procedure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This was said to be a jurisdictional error in several ways, including denial of procedural fairness and reliance upon irrelevant material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">24 There is no substance in these contentions, essentially for the reasons given by Hartnett FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The basis for the contention that RMIT had an established procedure of not expressing opinions as to whether or not results were satisfactory seems to be flimsy, to say the least.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It appears to be based entirely upon a telephone conversation between a Tribunal officer and an international student officer at RMIT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The suggestion is not consistent with formal advices sent to the Tribunal by the head of the relevant department at RMIT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">But in any event, whatever the practice of RMIT might be, condition 8202 requires that the visa holder achieve an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">There was no such certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">25 The second alleged jurisdictional error is said to be based upon a misapplication of Gurung .</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In Gurung , Tamberlin J stated at [14]:
 
 'Condition 8202(d) requires that the holder of the visa achieve an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory... for a course that runs for at least a semester, for each term or semester of that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In the present case there was no such certification and in making its finding, the Tribunal has not usurped or encroached upon the province of the educational institution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">On its face, it was clearly open for the Tribunal to make a finding that the academic performance of the applicant was not satisfactory having regard to his high failure rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">' 
 

26 At the hearing, counsel for the appellant sought to argue that Gurung stands for the proposition that, in the absence of certification of academic results from the education provider, the Tribunal should have made its own finding of substantial compliance with condition 8202 having regard to the applicant's failure rates as a percentage of the number of subjects for which the appellant sat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Counsel asserted that in 2001 the appellant passed five out of the six subjects for which he sat, which was said to be a failure rate of 16.6 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Counsel then submitted that this failure rate was better than the appellant's failure rate in the first semester of 2002 (26.3 per cent), for which period RMIT certified that the appellant had achieved a satisfactory result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">On the basis of these calculations, it was submitted that RMIT's statements concerning the appellant's academic results were internally inconsistent, and that the Tribunal had misdirected itself by relying on those statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">27 The factual basis for these submissions appears to be entirely misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The failure rates calculated by counsel ignore the subjects where the appellant did not sit the examination, but did not withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">As the Tribunal rightly found, these subjects must be taken into account in considering whether the appellant achieved a satisfactory result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Tribunal correctly found that the appellant only achieved seven passes/exemptions out of the 17 subjects that he undertook during the 2001 academic year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Those 17 subjects comprised the five passed, one failed, nine for which the appellant did not sit, and two exemptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">28 The next step in the appellant's submissions is also misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Counsel for the appellant contended that in considering the question whether there had been substantial compliance with condition 8202, the decision in Gurung requires that the Tribunal confine itself to an examination of the appellant's academic results rather than an assessment of the appellant's academic progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In my opinion, this is a misreading of Gurung : Tamberlin J in that case held that it was open to the Tribunal to find that the applicant had not substantially complied with condition 8202, having regard to the applicant's high failure rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">His Honour did not suggest that the Tribunal must have regard solely to the applicant's failure rate, expressed as a percentage of the number of subjects for which the appellant sat, in assessing whether there has been substantial compliance with condition 8202: see Kim v Witton (1995) 59 FCR 258.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">RMIT did not certify that the appellant's results were at least satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">As Hartnett FM stated, there was no certificate provided and nor should there have been having regard to the evidence of the appellant's academic results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">There was ample evidence of the appellant's poor academic performance in the present case, and of RMIT's opinion that the appellant's results were unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">29 In my view, it was clearly open to the Tribunal to find that the appellant failed to substantially comply with condition 8202 during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal did not misdirect itself, and there is no error disclosed in Hartnett FM's acceptance of the Tribunal's findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">30 I also agree with the reasons of Hartnett FM that there is no evidence that the appellant has been denied natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The appellant was informed by the Tribunal that RMIT had indicated that his academic results and attendance were not satisfactory during the relevant period and he was given an opportunity to comment or provide further information to support his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The appellant did not avail himself of that opportunity but instead attempted to rely on forged documents at the Tribunal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In my view, the Tribunal conducted its proceedings appropriately and fairly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">31 I order that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young J.</sentence>
