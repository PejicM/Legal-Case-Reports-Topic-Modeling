 BUCHANAN J: 
 
1 By a notice of motion filed on 10 January 2008 the applicant appears to seek the reinstatement, under s 25(2B)(bc) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), of an appeal to this Court which was dismissed by a judge of the Court on 31 October 2007 when he did not appear at the hearing of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He did not appear either when the notice of motion was listed for hearing on 8 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">At the conclusion of those proceedings I made an order dismissing the notice of motion and a direction, pursuant to Order 46 r7A of the Federal Court Rules that the Registrar not accept any document from the applicant for filing unless the leave of a judge was first obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I indicated that I would publish my reasons for the order and direction at a later date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These are those reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The applicant is a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China who arrived in Australia on 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">One week later he made an application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">On 29 August 2006 a delegate of the Minister refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The applicant applied for a review of the delegate's decision to the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') constituted under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 20 October 2006 the RRT wrote to the applicant inviting him to attend a hearing on 16 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The applicant did not reply to the letter and did not attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 19 December 2006 the RRT handed down a decision affirming the decision of the delegate to refuse a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The applicant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMCA') for judicial review of the decision of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The FMCA rejected all of the arguments he advanced in support of his application for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Federal Magistrate also considered, independently of his submissions, whether any jurisdictional error appeared in the decision of the RRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He concluded that it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The application for judicial review was dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The applicant brought an appeal to this Court from the decision of the FMCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The grounds of appeal seem, having regard to the terms of the decision of the FMCA, to be without any substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">At the hearing of the appeal the applicant did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">His appeal to this Court was dismissed on 31 October 2007 but he was at the same time granted leave to apply on or before 30 December 2007 to vary or discharge the order dismissing his appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The orders made on that day were as follows:
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appeal be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The appellant to pay the respondents' costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The respondents not perfect this order before 30 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The appellant have leave to apply on or before 30 December 2007 to vary or discharge these orders, such application to be supported by evidence from a medical practitioner that the appellant was unable to appear in court on 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">' 
 
 

5 Despite the fact that he had two months in which to make such an application the applicant did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I do not know why his present notice of motion was accepted for filing in the Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">By the time he sought to file it there were no proceedings on foot to which the notice of motion could relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Nevertheless, as it is, at least purportedly, before the Court I shall deal with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">6 The notice of motion states, as the order sought, the following:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Due to sickness, I was unable to attend the court on 31 Oct 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Please see the attached medical certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">' 
 
 
 

7 In support of the notice of motion the applicant filed an affidavit which says only:
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I was unable to attend hearing on 31 Oct 2007 due to my sickness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">' 
 

8 He attached a medical certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The certificate is dated 9 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">On the face of the notice of motion and the material filed in support of it there is no basis to reinstate the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">No explanation was given for the failure to apply to vary or discharge the order of 31 October 2007 by the date specified in that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9 Although the notice of motion was itself liable to be dismissed for the non-appearance of the applicant it was better, in my view, to dismiss it for lack of merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That was the intended effect of the order which I made on 8 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I should indicate also that I see no reason to have any doubt about the correctness of the decision of the FMCA which the applicant wished to challenge by the appeal which was dismissed on 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">10 The failure of the applicant to appear in either of the proceedings in this Court relating to his appeal imposes an unnecessary burden on the first respondent, who has been represented on each occasion, and on the resources of the Court, including the arrangements for interpreters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In view of the history of the applicant's failures to appear in the proceedings, or comply with the requirements in the earlier orders, I decided it was also appropriate to direct, pursuant to Order 46 r 7A of the Federal Court Rules , that the Registry not accept any further document from the applicant for filing unless the leave of a judge was first obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">11 The written submission for the Minister about the notice of motion sought costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">At the time I dismissed the notice of motion I omitted to deal with that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It is appropriate to dismiss the notice of motion with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I will make that further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Associate:
