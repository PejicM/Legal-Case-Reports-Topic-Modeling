 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant ("Mr Patankar"), a citizen of India, is a qualified architect who is additionally skilled in information technology ("IT").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In May 2001 Mr Patankar was granted a subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In February 2003 he was granted a fresh subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At the time that he received the second of these visas he was advised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("DIMIA") that if he wished to change his employer he was required to apply for a new subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In June 2003 Mr Patankar became an employee in Australia of the first respondent ("Excom") in circumstances that are in dispute but which resulted in a breach of the conditions of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 In this proceeding Mr Patankar makes claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA"), in the tort of negligent misstatement and for breach of contract for damage allegedly suffered by him as a result of the breach of the conditions of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is not in dispute that Mr Patankar has not held a visa authorising him to work in Australia since, at the latest, August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
4 Mr Patankar spent approximately six months in Australia in 1998, and again in 2000, on each occasion having entered Australia on a tourist visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 14 May 2001 he received advice from the Australian Consulate General in Mumbai, India, that he had been granted a subclass 457 visa which permitted him to travel to, enter and remain in, Australia until 14 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He was further advised that his visa was subject to the condition that "[t]he holder must not change employer or occupation in Australia without the permission in writing of the Secretary" (visa condition 8107).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The employer who had sponsored Mr Patankar for the purpose of his subclass 457 visa was Educom Australia (Educom).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 In late 2002 Educom went into administration and Mr Patankar was made redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In early 2003 he approached Consultants Exchange Australasia Pty Limited ("CXC") to become his work visa sponsors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">CXC was approved by the DIMIA as a subclass 457 visa sponsor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 By a letter dated 20 February 2003 from DIMIA, Mr Patankar received advice that his application for a subclass 457 visa to work for CXC as an Information Technology Manager had been approved subject to the conditions that he must not:
 
&#8226; cease to be employed by the sponsoring employer; or
 
&#8226; work in a position or occupation inconsistent with the approved position or occupation; or
 
&#8226; engage in work for another person or for himself while working for the sponsoring employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The letter advised:
 
 If you wish to change employer, you must apply for a new subclass 457 visa and meet the requirements at that time...Failure to apply for a new visa may result in cancellation of your visa and removal from Australia of you and any family members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">

Mr Patankar gave evidence that when he received this letter he read and understood the conditions to which his visa was subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 CXC was a contractor management company; that is, it provided a corporate structure whereby third parties could engage the services of contractors while they remained on the payroll of CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">CXC operated on the basis that it was each contractor's own responsibility to find a third party who wished to engage his or her services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Once a contractor had identified a third party who required his or her services, a tripartite agreement was entered into between CXC, the third party and the consultant pursuant to which CXC received all payments made in respect of work undertaken by the consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It appears that the remuneration paid to the consultant by CXC was, in effect, the amount paid to CXC less a "management fee" of 4.5%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The standard tripartite agreement provided that upon receipt from the consultant of time-sheets approved and signed by the third party's manager, CXC would submit to the third party invoices on which, unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment would be due in seven days from the date of the invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 Notwithstanding that it was not until 20 February 2003 that Mr Patankar learnt that his application for a subclass 457 visa to work for CXC had been approved, he does not dispute that he was paid by CXC for the pay period starting on 6 January 2003 and ending on 26 January 2003 and also for the pay period commencing on 27 January 2003 and ending on 9 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Indeed, it appears that no payment was received by Mr Patankar from CXC later than 28 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mr Patankar left Australia on 2 March 2003 and did not return until 2 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">9 In early June 2003 Mr Patankar responded to a job advertisement placed by Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He attended a job interview with the third respondent (Mr Braganza) on 6 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">At this time Mr Braganza was the NSW Training Manager for Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Patankar attended a second interview on about 10 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Braganza was present throughout the second interview and the second respondent (Mr Newey) was present for part of that interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">At this time Mr Newey was a director of Excom and its NSW Branch Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">There is serious conflict between the parties as to what was said during the course of these two interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">My findings on this issue are set out below (see [54]-[60]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 It is not in dispute that on 12 June 2003 Mr Braganza gave Mr Patankar a letter which offered him the position of Technical Systems Instructor for Excom on terms and conditions set out in that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The letter stated that the commencement date for his employment was Monday 16 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The terms and conditions set out in the letter included provision for annual leave, sick leave and long service leave; restraint on involvement with any other similar business; performance review; and monthly payment of remuneration by way of automatic transfer on Excom's usual pay day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That is, the terms and conditions were consistent with Mr Patankar being offered a position as an employee of Excom rather than a consultancy while remaining employed by CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 The provisions of the letter concerning performance review commenced with the statement: "Your performance is of critical importance to the Company, and we are committed to assisting you to [achieve] your potential and the goals agreed with the Company".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The letter included the following statement under the heading "Completeness":
 
 This letter of appointment and your position description, together with all rules and policies, as notified from time to time, represent a full record of the terms and conditions of employment and replace all previous written contracts or agreements and understandings (if any).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

12 Mr Patankar gave evidence that he took the offer of employment home, thought the offer through and was keen to accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">He went to Excom's office on 13 June 2003 and signed the letter of offer in the presence of Mr Hope, Operations Manager for Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He observed Mr Braganza sign the letter for Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">13 On 16 June 2003 Mr Patankar started work at Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">On that day he completed and signed an "Employee Details" form, a form headed "Bank Authority Details" giving details of his bank account and an Australian Taxation Office form headed "Tax File Number Declaration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Excom made a payment of salary directly into Mr Patankar's bank account on 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">14 There is a dispute on the evidence as to when Mr Newey learnt that Excom had made a salary payment to Mr Patankar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Patankar gave evidence that he complained to Mr Newey on 1 July 2003about the payment being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I prefer Mr Newey's evidence that he learnt of the payment during the second half of July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is not in dispute that on 7 August 2003 Mr Newey, in the presence of Mr Patankar, telephoned DIMIA and advised that Excom had employed Mr Patankar in breach of the conditions of his subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On the same day Excom, on the advice of DIMIA, terminated Mr Patankar's employment with immediate effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">PLEADINGS 
 Trade Practices Act 
 
15 Mr Patankar's claim that Excom breached s 52 and s 53B of the TPA is based upon allegations that untrue representations were made to him at the first and second job interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Those representations are pleaded in paras 12 and 19 of the amended statement of claim (Statement of Claim).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Those paragraphs are in the following form:
 
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">During the first job interview, the Third Respondent made the following representation ('the first representation') on behalf of the First Respondent to the Applicant in relation to the advertised position of Technical Systems Instructor:.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The third Respondent told the Applicant that the First Respondent would sponsor the Applicant on his work visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Third Respondent told the Applicant that the First Respondent was in a position to sponsor the applicant on a work visa in relation to the position of Technical Systems Instructor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Third Respondent also told the Applicant that his was not the only work visa to be taken over and that there were four other such work visa candidates whose transfer applications the First Respondent had to file with DIMIA; the Third Respondent informed the applicant that the Melbourne office of the First Respondent had been entrusted with this job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Third Respondent told the Applicant that he would have to await their instructions and directions before taking any action on the transfer of his work visa from cXc to Excom Education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 The first representation
 
 The First Respondent represented to the Applicant that the First Respondent had the legal capacity to sponsor the applicant on a Subclass 457 Visa as at the time that the First Respondent made the offer of employment to the Applicant in June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">...
 
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">During the second job interview, the Second and Third Respondents made the following representation ('the second representation') on behalf of the First Respondent to the Applicant in relation to the position of Technical Systems Instructor: 
 
 
 
 The second representation
 
 
 
 The First Respondent represented to the Applicant that the First Respondent had the legal capacity to sponsor the Applicant on a Subclass 457 Visa in June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Second and Third Respondents told the Applicant that the First Respondent had the legal capacity to sponsor him on a subclass 457 Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 (passages in bold are underlined in original)
 
 

16 I have assumed that the emphasised portions of the above paragraphs, which were inserted by amendment, refer to the alleged factual circumstances said to give rise to the pleaded representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">17 It is pleaded that each of Mr Newey and Mr Braganza was involved in Excom's contraventions of the TPA within the meaning of s 75B of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Tort of Negligent Misstatement 
 
18 Mr Patankar's case is also pleaded as a case of loss, injury and damage caused by the respondents' negligent misstatements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The relevant statements are those identified in paragraphs 12 and 19 of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It is pleaded that those statements were made in circumstances where the respondents owed Mr Patankar a duty to provide truthful information in relation to Excom's legal capacity to sponsor Mr Patankar under a subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Breach of Contract 
 
19 Mr Patankar's case in contract is pleaded to arise from his acceptance of the offer of employment made by Excom as set out in the letter dated 12 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Paragraphs 27 and 28 of the Statement of Claim makes the following allegations:
 
 
 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It was further an express verbal condition of the contract of employment offered by the First Respondent to the Applicant that the First Respondent would do all things necessary to arrange for the lawful and expeditious transfer of cXc's visa sponsorship of the Applicant from cXc to the First Respondent and that the First Respondent would execute a tripartite agreement with cXc and the Applicant for the purpose of allowing cXc to provide the Applicant's services to the First Respondent until such time as the First Respondent obtained approval from DIMIA to sponsor the Applicant on his Subclass 457 Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 
 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It was further an express or implied term or warranty, or both, of the contract of employment offered by the First Respondent to the Applicant that the First Respondent would at all times be eligible to sponsor the Applicant on a Subclass 457 Visa prior to commencing to pay the Applicant the agreed remuneration payable under the contract of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 
 

20 Additionally it is pleaded that on 13 June 2003 CXC advised Excom that Excom, Mr Patankar and CXC would be required to execute a tripartite agreement so as to provide for Mr Patankar to remain on the payroll of CXC until any application by Excom to sponsor Mr Patankar was approved by DIMIA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The allegation is made that Excom "did not demur from the advice received from CXC".</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">21 The pleaded particulars of alleged breach of contract are as follows:
 
 
 (a) The First Respondent failed to assist the Applicant [to] achieve his potential and goals agreed with the First Respondent in breach of clause 24 of the offer of employment pleaded in paragraphs 26 above;
 
 (b) The First Respondent failed to execute a tripartite agreement with cXc and the Applicant which was contrary to the condition pleaded at paragraph 27 above;
 
 (b) The First Respondent breached the term of warranty pleaded at paragraph 28 above in that the First Respondent was not at any time between 13 June 2003 and no earlier than 5 August 2003 an eligible sponsor employer for the Applicant for the purposes of sponsoring the Applicant on a Subclass 457 Visa;
 
 (c) The First Respondent breached the condition, term or warranty pleaded at paragraph 27 and 28 above by paying the Applicant a salary payment directly on or about 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 
 
 EVIDENCE RE THE FIRST INTERVIEW 
 
22 Mr Newey gave evidence that, ahead of Mr Patankar's first job interview, he had advised Mr Braganza that Excom was in the process of applying to DIMIA for visa sponsorship status approval and that Excom would be able to sponsor people when this process was complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He also gave evidence that at this time he was handling all employment visa related matters and that Mr Braganza was accustomed to refer the discussion of such matters to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He said that, while aware that Excom could enter into a tripartite agreement with another organisation that had sponsorship status approval, by June 2003 he had dismissed the option of using tripartite agreements for the following reasons:
 
(1) the legal and administrative overheads of such arrangements had proven prohibitive in the past; and
 
(2) to ensure that the distinctive culture of Excom was maintained, Excom preferred long term permanent employees to contractors --- especially for positions of technical instructors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">23 Mr Patankar gave affidavit evidence that at the first interview he and Mr Braganza had a conversation to the following effect:
 
 
 JP "Bertrand, I'm on a work visa sponsored by CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">They bill the client for my services and then they pay me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">A tripartite agreement executed between me, the company that wanted to avail of my services, and CXC makes this easily possible for any company to avail of my training services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">"
 
 BB "You should be willing to work as an employee of Excom, and not as a contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">"
 
 JP "Then my work visa sponsorship would have to be taken over by Excom, from CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It will involve both myself and Excom independently applying to DIMIA for sponsorship approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">At least, that has been my experience in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">"
 
 BB "OK, Excom Education will sponsor your work visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Our Melbourne office will handle your visa, so you should wait to hear from them before you write to DIMIA, OK?</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">"
 
 JP "OK.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">"
 
 BB "However you should be willing to bear the expense of the work visa transfer application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">"
 
 JP "I see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">How much will that be?</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">"
 
 BB "It shouldn't be more than one thousand dollars (Australian).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">"
 
 JP "Well, OK.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">I should be able to pay that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">"
 
 

24 Mr Patankar further gave affidavit evidence that Mr Braganza said the following at the first interview:
 
 
 (a) "I intend to offer you the position of Technical Systems Instructor here at Excom Education; however, this will be subject to both CXC and yourself agreeing to transfer your work visa sponsorship from CXC to Excom Education";
 
 (b) "Excom Education will be able to take over your visa sponsorship, you don't need to worry about that";
 
 (c) "You are not the only applicant whose work visa is to be taken over; there are four other such work visa candidates whose transfer applications Excom Education will have to file with DIMIA"; and
 
 (d) "Our Melbourne office of Excom Education will be handling the transfer applications; you will need to await their instructions and directions about it ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 


 
25 Under cross-examination Mr Patankar insisted that it was "standard" for him to tell a potential employer that he was on a visa sponsored by CXC and that he told Mr Braganza this at the first interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">When asked to identify the number of previous employers to whom he had given this information Mr Patankar identified two employers --- although he later clarified that he probably had not actually worked for the second of those employers (see [46] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">26 Mr Braganza did not claim to have a detailed recollection of the first interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He gave affidavit and oral evidence that it was Excom's standard procedure in Sydney at the time to conduct at least two interviews before a candidate was offered a job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">He said that it was his practice to conduct the first interview alone to access the candidate's technical abilities and classroom skills and, if the candidate performed sufficiently well, he would arrange a second interview at which Mr Newey would ordinarily also be present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He said that he did not make a job offer before the second interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">27 Mr Braganza gave affidavit evidence that he was not in a position to commit Excom to sponsor Mr Patankar's work visa; he was not involved in dealing with work visas and was not familiar with the process involved; and he understood at Excom it was Mr Newey who was responsible for work visa issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He said that he did not know in June 2003 precisely what visa Mr Patankar held or the conditions of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He further said that he did not know in June 2003 whether or not Mr Patankar would breach his visa conditions were he to accept an offer of employment from Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">He understood that a visa holder was responsible for complying with the conditions of his or her visa and that he did not ever see Mr Patankar's visa or a copy of its conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I interpolate that it is not in dispute that Mr Patankar's visa was at all relevant times held by CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">28 Mr Braganza gave oral evidence that he did not remember one way or the other whether Mr Patankar raised his visa status at his first interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">However, subject to the matters identified below, he was adamant that the conversation of which Mr Patankar gave evidence did not occur (see [23]-[24] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Mr Braganza agreed that he told Mr Patankar that he should be willing to work as an employee and not as a contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He said that he did not have a recollection one way or the other about whether Mr Patankar said to him: "then my work visa sponsorship would have to be taken over by Excom from CXC".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He agreed that he could have said to Mr Patankar at the first interview that he intended to offer him the position of Technical Systems Instructor at Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">EVIDENCE RE THE SECOND INTERVIEW 
 
29 Mr Patankar's affidavit evidence was that at his second job interview he had a conversation with Mr Braganza in which words to the following effect were said:
 
 
 BB "We want to offer you the position of Technical Systems Instructor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Your remuneration will be at the amount of $76,300 per annum gross.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Following your accepting the offer of employment, we will begin the Visa transfer process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">"
 
 JP "I will only be able to accept your offer of employment if you can confirm that you have the capacity to sponsor my work visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">"
 
 BB "Yes, we can do that, not a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">"
 
 JP "The transfer involves my current employer releasing me as an employee first, only then can Excom sponsor me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Steve Lowe [sic], my account manager at CXC will co-ordinate the work visa transfer from CXC to Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">"
 
 BB "I have heard from Steve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Excom Education will manage your work visa transfer from our Melbourne Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">"
 
 

In oral evidence Mr Patankar clarified that he did not assert that Mr Newey was present during the above conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">30 Mr Patankar's oral evidence was that during the second interview he must have briefly "touched base" on the issue of the tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">He denied that Mr Newey told him before he commenced employment with Excom on 16 June 2003 that Excom was still in the process of obtaining approval to sponsor applicants for work visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">31 Mr Braganza accepted that he offered Mr Patankar the position of Technical Systems Instructor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">He said that the proposed remuneration was $70,000 per annum plus 9% compulsory superannuation payable monthly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">However, he denied that Mr Patankar said that he would only be able to accept the offer if Excom could confirm that it had the capacity to sponsor his work visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I interpolate that it is not in dispute that Excom did not then have that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Mr Braganza also denied that any of the rest of the alleged conversation set out in [29] above occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">EVENTS AFTER ACCEPTANCE OF EMPLOYMENT 
 
32 Mr Patankar gave evidence that he believed that CXC had explained to Excom the importance of Excom paying him through CXC until DIMIA had approved and completed the transfer of his work visa to Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He further claimed that he envisaged that at the "appropriate time" a written application to DIMIA would be submitted by Excom to initiate the transfer of his work visa to Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">33 By contrast, Mr Braganza gave evidence that Mr Patankar did not tell him that, notwithstanding that he accepted the offer of employment contained in the letter of 12 June 2003, Mr Patankar wished to remain on the payroll of CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Braganza also gave evidence that at no time before Excom first made a payment of salary to Mr Patankar was he told by Mr Patankar, or anyone else, that Mr Patankar might be in breach of his visa conditions if he accepted Excom's offer of employment, commenced to work for Excom or received monthly payments from Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">34 Mr Patankar gave evidence that between 16 June 2003 and 1 July 2003 he spoke to Mr Braganza on a number of occasions concerning the tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He claimed that on one of these occasions he had a conversation with Mr Braganza to the following effect:
 
 
 JP "Have you received the tripartite agreement from Steve Lowe [sic]?</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">"
 
 BB "Yes I have been in contact with Steve Lowe [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He sent me the agreement by email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">"
 
 JP "That is the tripartite agreement, which needs to be signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">When can I sign it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">How's my application for the transfer of my sponsorship going?</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">"
 
 BB "Our Melbourne office is handling that; it will come to you from the Melbourne office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">You know there are another four applications which are being processed at the same time as yours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">"
 
 

35 Mr Braganza denied the above conversation and additionally gave evidence that he had no recollection of Mr Low, or anyone at CXC, sending him a tripartite agreement by email between 16 June 2003 and 1 July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Additionally, Mr Braganza gave evidence that he has never spoken with Mr Low.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">36 Mr Low, who is employed by CXC as a Business Development Manager, gave evidence on behalf of Mr Patankar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">His affidavit evidence was that in early June 2003 Mr Patankar told him that he had attended a job interview with Excom and that immediately thereafter, at Mr Patankar's request, he telephoned Mr Braganza.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He deposed to a conversation between them to the following effect:
 
 
 SL "Jayant has advised me that you have offered him a position at Excom Education and he has asked me to contact you to explain the arrangements that are required until his visa is transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">"
 
 BB "Yes, Jayant has advised me about the tripartite agreement, but Excom Education proposed to employ Jayant directly and as an employee of Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">We are willing to take over his visa sponsorship so that this can happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">"
 
 SL "That's fine, however, it is essential that a tripartite agreement is entered into whilst Jayant's visa is in the process of being transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Jayant must remain on the payroll of CXC to meet his visa conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The tripartite agreement enables Jayant to work for you whilst being payrolled through CXC so as to remain under CXC's sponsorship till such time as his sponsorship is transferred to Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">"
 
 

37 Mr Low further gave affidavit evidence that a conversation between him and Mr Braganza to the following effect took place possibly one or two days later:
 
 
 SL "I am following up from our previous conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">As I advised, a tripartite agreement will need to be executed before Jayant can start work at Excom Education, as Jayant must remain payrolled through CXC until his visa is transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I can email you a short copy of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">"
 
 BB "We would prefer to use our own contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I will arrange for that to be sent to your office.</sentence>

38 Mr Low said that when he did not receive a tripartite contract from Excom he assumed that Mr Patankar's visa had been successfully transferred and that he was working for Excom directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">He acknowledged that he received an email from Mr Patankar on 23 July 2003 in which Mr Patankar asked him for the tripartite agreement and that he replied:

 Our 3 way Contract.</sentence>

39 Mr Newey gave evidence that he had no contemporaneous knowledge of Mr Braganza giving Mr Patankar the formal letter of offer dated 12 June 2003 or of Mr Patankar accepting the offer on 13 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">I accept this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Excom's application for approval as a sponsor for subclass 457 visas had not then been approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">I am confident that in this circumstance Mr Newey would not have wittingly allowed Excom to engage an employee in breach of the employee's visa conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This assessment finds support in Mr Newey's later conduct which is referred to in [40]-[42] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">I conclude that there was a break-down in communication and understanding between Mr Newey and Mr Braganza concerning Mr Patankar's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Newey envisaged that an offer of employment would be made to Mr Patankar after Excom's application for approval as a sponsor for subclass 457 visas was approved; Mr Braganza apparently failed to appreciate the need to await that approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">40 Mr Newey further gave evidence that prior to Mr Patankar commencing employment with Excom on 16 June 2003 he spoke to Mr Patankar in words to the following effect:
 
 Until our sponsorship approval comes through, EXCOM can't formally employ you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I suggest one possible way to make the best use of the time before then would be to have you undertake preparation for the courses you will be teaching when you join EXCOM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">We'll make available for you the use of EXCOM's facilities, including course materials, software, and an EXCOM e-mail account so you may undertake this preparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">This will be to both our benefit, as you will be able to update your accreditations so that when you commence there will be less delay for you to get up to speed to be able to deliver courses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">

41 Mr Newey said that he arranged with Mr Braganza to have Excom facilities made available to Mr Patankar and for Mr Patankar to attend a training session with other instructors at the end of June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He further said that he did not become aware until late July 2003 that Mr Patankar had been employed by Excom despite his not having the appropriate work visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In early August 2003, in conjunction with Mr Patankar, he notified DIMIA and subsequently complied with the Department's directions to terminate Mr Patankar's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">42 By letter dated 2 October 2003, Mr Newey wrote to a DIMIA officer concerning Mr Patankar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">I accept his evidence that he endeavoured to put Mr Patankar's position to the Department in the best light that he could.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I also conclude that Mr Newey was anxious to ensure that Excom's own reputation was not diminished in the eyes of DIMIA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">These two factors, I find, probably caused Mr Newey to depart a little from the strict truth in drafting the letter although he, albeit somewhat half-heartedly, denied this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The letter included the following passage:
 
 At the time which we were looking to employ Mr Patankar we were also in the process of applying for approval for business sponsorship for a small number of personnel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Given the pending result of this application --- which has since been approved --- we were simultaneously investigating options for Mr Patankar to work with us under a tri-partite arrangement through Consultancy Exchange Australasia, or directly with EXCOM following approval of our sponsorship status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">We are aware Mr. Patankar had informed his previous nominator, Consultancy Exchange Australasia (CXC), of his intentions to accept an employment offer made by our company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">We are also aware that he asked for their instructions and advice on what needed to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Also, our office communicated with CXC on a few occasions with regards to employment arrangements being made for Mr. Patankar to work for us through CXC as this was one of the options we were assessing, and our office was contacted by CXC to follow up on certain contracts which were required for Mr. Patankar to be eligible to work in our company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Mr. Patankar himself also called our offices to check up on requirements being met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Unfortunately one of our managers who was handling this matter was not fully aware of the complexities and all the consequences of such a matter, and he mistakenly thought that all was taken care of, thus providing a green light for Mr. Patankar to commence work for us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">...
 
 CREDIBILITY 
 Mr Patankar 
 
43 I do not accept Mr Patankar as an entirely truthful witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Nearly five years have passed since the events of which he gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Some of his evidence might be explained by his having, over that period, reconstructed his recall in a way which shifts to others the responsibility for his Australian visa problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In some other regards I am satisfied that he sought to mislead the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">44 Mr Patankar gave confusing and non-responsive answers when questioned about the work undertaken by him in Australia between the time when Educom went into administration and the grant of his subclass 457 visa to work for CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Ultimately he said that in January and February 2003 he did not understand that he was not then entitled to work in Australia as he did not hold an operative subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I do not accept his evidence in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">When Mr Patankar received written advice from the Australian Consulate General that his initial application for a subclass 457 visa had succeeded, he was advised that he could not change employer without the permission in writing of the Secretary (see [6] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">When Educom went into administration and Mr Patankar was made redundant, he plainly understood that he needed to obtain a new subclass 457 visa which allowed him to work for another employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It was for this reason that he approached CXC to become his visa sponsor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">45 I am also satisfied that Mr Patankar was not frank with the Court concerning whether he had worked for Sydney University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The issue arose in the following way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">When it was suggested to Mr Patankar that he did not tell Mr Braganza that he was on a work visa sponsored by CXC, he responded:
 
 Of course not, I did tell him and I told him quite clearly...that used to be my opening statement whenever I approached any employer, I had to first clarify where I'm coming from, how I am legally being employed and what are the terms and conditions associated with my services which are available to any company or organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">That used to be standard so I just explained that to him at our first meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">

46 When invited to nominate the potential employers with whom he had adopted this standard he could initially only nominate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">When it was put to him that he had in fact only done contracting work for one company while employed by CXC, he mentioned that he had also done some part-time weekend work for Sydney University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">When asked for details of his work for Sydney University he said it "wasn't too long".</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He said that he did just a few short courses over a few weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">When it was suggested to him that there must have been a tripartite agreement to which Sydney University and CXC were parties, and that payments made by Sydney University in respect of his services would have been picked up by the PAYG Payment Summary given to him by CXC, he indicated that his memory was "hazy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Thereafter he said that it was possible that he didn't end up doing any work for Sydney University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Later he volunteered that he did have discussions with the University of Sydney regarding his mode of payment through CXC but he believed that the course did not eventuate because "for some reason they had some scheduling difficulties and issues".</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">47 It is not necessary for me to make a finding as to whether Mr Patankar worked for Sydney University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">If he did, it seems that he was not paid for doing so by CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">A subpoena served on CXC did not lead to a production of a tripartite agreement to which the University and CXC were parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The importance of Mr Patankar's evidence concerning Sydney University is twofold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">First, it reveals that he was willing to overstate his evidence by suggesting that he had a standard practice of providing advice to potential "employers" concerning his visa status when he had in fact had little occasion to develop a practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Secondly, I am satisfied that Mr Patankar sought to change his evidence about having worked for Sydney University when it became apparent that difficulties attended that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">48 I place little weight on any evidence of Mr Patankar that is self-serving unless it finds support in the evidence as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Mr Low 
 
49 I also have reservations about Mr Low's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Assuming, as I am willing to do, that Mr Low did not seek deliberately to mislead the Court, I am satisfied that he gave his evidence carelessly and that he was overly anxious to assist Mr Patankar's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In particular, I conclude that Mr Low swore his affidavit without taking reasonable steps to ensure that it was both accurate and unlikely to mislead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">By way of example, paragraphs 10-11 of Mr Low's affidavit, as read, stated:
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In January 2003, Jayant [ie Mr Patankar] entered into an employment agreement with CXC and CXC took over Jayant's visa sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">CXC was an established visa sponsor with DIMIA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Up to June 2003, Jayant had been engaged with a number of third party users.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Jayant worked for Global Knowledge Networks and The University of Sydney and on both occasions tripartite agreements had been entered into and Jayant was payrolled through CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 

50 The documentary evidence before the Court shows that CXC provided Mr Patankar with an employment agreement for his signature under cover of a letter dated 3 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">As mentioned above, DIMIA did not grant Mr Patankar a subclass 457 visa to work for CXC until 20 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It appears that the only third party for whom Mr Patankar worked in his capacity as an employee of CXC was Total Internet Centre in Newcastle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The only mention made by Mr Patankar of Global Knowledge Networks was in the context of his previous employment by Educom; he deposed to Educom going into administration following a failed merger and acquisition by Global Knowledge Networks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">I have discussed above Mr Patankar's evidence concerning Sydney University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Finally, it is not in dispute that Mr Patankar was not in Australia for the whole of the period from January to June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">He returned to India on 2 March 2003 (ie less than two weeks after the issue of his subclass 457 visa to work for CXC) and did not return until 2 June 2003 (ie two days before he responded to Excom's job interview).</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The implication that paragraphs 10-11 of Mr Low's affidavit is calculated to convey is that Mr Patankar lawfully worked in Australia pursuant to an employment agreement with CXC from January to June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">This implication is false for the reasons identified above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">51 While I am not positively satisfied that Mr Low sought to mislead the Court, I place little weight on his evidence unless it finds support in the evidence as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Mr Newey 
 
52 Nothing in Mr Newey's evidence or his demeanour caused me to form an unfavourable impression of him as a witness and, generally speaking, I accept his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">My reservation concerns his evidence that his letter to DIMIA (see [42] above) did not include untrue assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Mr Braganza 
 
53 I also formed a favourable impression of Mr Braganza.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">I have no reason to believe that he sought to mislead the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">However, I think it more likely than not that his memory concerning the circumstances surrounding Mr Patankar's employment by Excom is defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The explanation for this may well lie in the length of time that has passed since Mr Patankar was employed by Excom, for whom Mr Braganza no longer works, and his limited concern at the time with the technicalities affecting visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">FINDINGS 
 
54 I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that either Mr Patankar advised Mr Braganza of his visa status during the first interview or that Mr Braganza was already aware of this fact from Mr Patankar's response to the job advertisement placed by Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It seems to me that Mr Braganza's knowledge of Mr Patankar's visa status and his knowledge of Excom's attitude to tripartite agreements probably explains why Mr Braganza told him during the first interview that he should be willing to work as an employee and not as a contractor (see [28] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">I am also satisfied that Mr Newey was aware of Mr Patankar's visa status at about this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Mr Newey acknowledged that he had this information prior to Mr Patankar's commencing work with Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">55 I am also satisfied that prior to the first interview Mr Braganza had learnt from Mr Newey that Excom had applied to DIMIA for sponsorship status approval to allow it to employ five individuals on subclass 457 visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I think it likely that he told Mr Patankar something to this effect at the first interview although he now has no memory of having done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">I conclude that the reason why Mr Braganza has no memory of this is that he carried no responsibility within Excom with respect to work visas and knew little about the intricacies of subclass 457 visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">56 However, I am not satisfied that Mr Braganza told Mr Patankar that Excom would sponsor him on his work visa or that Excom was in a position to sponsor him on his work visa in relation to the position of Technical Systems Instructor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Nor do I accept that Mr Braganza told Mr Patankar either of the following two things each of which the evidence establishes to be false; first, that his was not the only work visa to be taken over and that there were four other work visa candidates whose transfer applications Excom had to file with DIMIA; and secondly, that the Melbourne office of Excom had been entrusted with this job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Any reference made by Mr Braganza to the Melbourne office of Excom would, I am satisfied, have been in the context of salary payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">I therefore do not accept Mr Patankar's evidence that Mr Braganza said to him words to the effect that he should wait to hear from the Melbourne office before writing to DIMIA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">57 Mr Patankar conceded in oral evidence that Mr Newey was not present at the time when Mr Braganza, as Mr Patankar alleges, made the representation at the second interview that Excom had the legal capacity to sponsor Mr Patankar on a subclass 457 visa in June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The pleaded allegation that Mr Newey told Mr Patankar that Excom had the legal capacity to sponsor him on a subclass 457 visa was accepted to be false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">58 I do not accept Mr Patankar's evidence that during the second interview he said to Mr Braganza that he would only be able to accept Excom's offer of employment if Mr Braganza could confirm that Excom had the capacity to sponsor his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Nor do I accept that Mr Braganza told him that Excom could sponsor his work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">59 I accept that Mr Patankar may have said to Mr Braganza words to the effect that Excom could only sponsor him if he ceased to be an employee of CXC and that Mr Low would co-ordinate the work visa transfer from CXC to Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">However, I am not satisfied that Mr Braganza replied that he had heard from Mr Low or that he said that Excom would manage the transfer of the work visa from Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">As indicated above, I accept that the Melbourne office of Excom did not manage work visa issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I also accept that Mr Braganza understood that Mr Newey was responsible for issues concerning work visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">I find that the conversation to which Mr Low deposed (see [36] above) did not take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">I accept Mr Newey's evidence that Excom had decided against the option of entering into tripartite agreements with organisations that had sponsorship status approval (see [22] above) and wished to employ its own staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">This is consistent with Excom applying to have its own visa sponsorship status approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">It was Mr Braganza's knowledge of Excom's attitude in this regard which, I am satisfied, informed his advice to Mr Patankar during the first interview that he should be willing to work as an employee of Excom (see [28] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">60 I reject Mr Patankar's oral evidence that during the second interview he must have briefly "touched base" on the issue of a tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">He did not refer to having done so in his affidavit evidence concerning the second interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Moreover, I am satisfied that Mr Patankar's later conduct in commencing work without executing a tripartite agreement, was inconsistent with his being concerned at this time about a tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">61 As mentioned above, Mr Newey gave evidence that sometime before 16 June 2003 he spoke with Mr Patankar about Excom's still being in the process of obtaining sponsorship status (see [40] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">62 Mr Patankar unequivocally denied that the conversation of which Mr Newey gave evidence occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It was not clearly put to Mr Newey that his evidence concerning the alleged conversation was untrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">It was put to him that Mr Patankar did not accept the suggestion to undertake preparation for teaching and update his accreditation using Excom's facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Mr Newey said that he did although he qualified this with "as far as I'm aware, he did accept it, because he then came in and started...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Having regard to the evidence on this topic I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that sometime before 16 June 2003 Mr Newey did speak to Mr Patankar in words to the effect of which he gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Whether or not Mr Patankar expressed his acceptance of Mr Newey's suggestion, I conclude that Mr Patankar understood that Excom was not proposing to enter into a tripartite agreement to allow Mr Patankar to work with Excom as a consultant while continuing to be employed by CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">63 Several aspects of the evidence confirm that Mr Patankar was aware at the time that he accepted Excom's offer of employment that he would not be working under a tripartite agreement to which Excom and CXC would be parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">First, the terms upon which he was offered employment were inconsistent with his being a consultant to Excom (see [10] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Secondly, he accepted that he did not fill out any time sheets upon which CXC could make payments to him although he had earlier done so while working as a contractor for Total Internet Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Thirdly, he did not sign, ask to sign, or even see a tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Moreover, his completion on 16 June 2003 of the forms identified in [13] above, is consistent with his understanding that he was commencing work that day as an employee of Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">64 In my view Mr Patankar's evidence concerning his employment arrangements in January and early February 2003 throws light upon the circumstances in which he accepted the offer of employment by Excom in June 2003 (see [8] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">When asked in cross-examination whether he had started work with Total Internet Centre on 6 January 2003 (ie a date before the grant of his subclass 457 visa authorising him to work for CXC) he replied:
 
 Yes, but it was already explained to them that CXC is taking over my work visa and they're going to be my employers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">As soon as the paperwork is done CXC will be paid for my services and I'll be paid all to CXC [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">

When asked if he started work with Total Internet Centre before he had entered into any contract with CXC, he replied:
 
 I had already spoken to CXC, I had taken their advice on that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">

When asked if CXC had advised him that he could start work on 6 January 2003 he responded that he didn't remember very clearly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">65 It is not appropriate for me to reach a view as to the propriety of the conduct of CXC in January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">CXC is not a party to this proceeding and it may not accept Mr Patankar's version of what happened at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">However, I am satisfied that Mr Patankar was well aware in January 2003 that he did not hold a subclass 457 visa authorising him to work for CXC or any employer other than Educom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">I am also satisfied that in January 2003 he was willing to commence work with Total Internet Centre in the expectation that he would shortly thereafter be granted a subclass 457 visa authorising him to work for CXC and that he could at that time enter into a tripartite agreement with CXC and Total Internet Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">That is, as I find, Mr Patankar was willing in January 2003 to chance working for a new employer ahead of being granted the necessary subclass 457 visa in the belief that "paperwork" subsequently entered into would render it unlikely that the authorities would learn of his having commenced work ahead of the grant to him of the necessary subclass 457 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">66 Mr Patankar's experience in January 2003 was that his expectation of being granted a new subclass 457 visa was well-founded and that no problems arose from his having started work ahead of the grant of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">I conclude that he decided that it would be worthwhile to follow a similar course in June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">That is, that Mr Patankar decided that he could start working for Excom on 16 June 2003 because Excom was likely soon thereafter to receive approval to be a sponsor for subclass 457 visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">I am satisfied that neither Mr Newey nor Mr Braganza gave him any reason to believe that Excom would enter into a tripartite agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Indeed, as indicated above, I find that they both indicated that it would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">67 I accept that Mr Low may well have communicated with someone at Excom (who may or may not have been Mr Braganza) on the topic of an agreement to which Mr Patankar, Excom and CXC would all be parties before 16 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">However, I reject Mr Low's evidence that Mr Braganza said to him that Excom would use its own contract and that he would arrange for it to be sent to CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">As I have already mentioned, I am satisfied that Excom had earlier decided as a matter of policy that it would not engage contractors under tripartite agreements (see [22] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">68 I consider it more likely than not that it was not until about 23 July 2003, when he sought a form of tripartite agreement from Mr Low, that Mr Patankar took any steps to regularise his employment by Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It is not necessary for me to determine what precipitated Mr Patankar's action at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The critical time for present purposes is earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">I am satisfied that Mr Patankar accepted Excom's offer of employment and thereafter commenced to work as an employee of Excom knowing that he did not have a subclass 457 visa that allowed him to work as an employee of Excom and further knowing that Excom did not propose to engage him as a contractor pursuant to a tripartite agreement with CXC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
69 The Statement of Claim pleads that each of the first and second representations, as therein defined (see [15] above), constituted conduct in breach of s 52 and s 53B of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">As indicated above, I am not satisfied that either the first or the second representation was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Mr Patankar's case for damages pursuant to s 82 and s 87 of the TPA therefore fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">NEGLIGENT MISSTATEMENT 
 
70 Mr Patankar's case in negligent misstatement is similarly based on the first and second representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">As I am not satisfied that either of the alleged representations was made, his claim for damages for negligent misstatement also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">BREACH OF CONTRACT 
 
71 The Statement of Claim pleads that Excom breached its employment contract with Mr Patankar by failing to assist him to achieve his potential and goals as provided for by cl 24 of the offer of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">It is not clear that this claim was pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">In my view it is clear that the opening words of cl 24 of the terms and conditions upon which Mr Patankar was offered employment by Excom were aspirational in the sense that they merely sought to describe the attitude that would inform the way in which Excom would conduct staff performance reviews ( Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 ; Bishop v Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518).</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The meaning of the words is insufficiently certain to be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">They were not, in my view, intended of themselves to give rise to any legal obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">72 The plea that it was an express verbal condition of the contract of employment that Excom would do all things necessary to arrange for the lawful and expeditious transfer of CXC's visa sponsorship of Mr Patankar to Excom whilst in the meantime executing a tripartite agreement with CXC and Mr Patankar is not supported by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">The only relevant offer made to Mr Patankar by Excom was an offer of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">By accepting that offer and commencing work Mr Patankar became an employee of Excom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Mr Patankar could not concurrently be an employee of CXC and work for Excom as a consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">73 Contrary to the assumption that pervades the Statement of Claim and the Reply, it was not Excom's payment of remuneration into Mr Patankar's bank account that caused Mr Patankar to be in breach of visa condition 8107.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Visa condition 8107 relevantly provides:
 
 The holder must not:
 
 
 
 (a) if the visa was granted to enable the holder to be employed in Australia:
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) cease to be employed by the employer in relation to which the visa was granted; or
 
 (ii) work in a position or occupation inconsistent with the position or occupation in relation to which the visa was granted; or
 
 (iii) engage in work for another person or on the holder's own account while undertaking the employment in relation to which the visa was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">
 
 
 
 
 
 

74 By accepting Excom's offer of employment and working as an employee of Excom, Mr Patankar worked in a position inconsistent with the position in relation to which his visa was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Excom's payment of his salary by way of transfer into his bank account evidenced Mr Patankar's breach of visa condition 8107; it did not constitute the breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">75 The pleaded allegation that Excom breached a warranty that it would at all times be eligible to sponsor Mr Patankar on a subclass 457 visa prior to commencing to pay him the agreed remuneration under the contract of employment fails for the same reasons as the allegation concerning an express verbal condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">First, the alleged warranty is not supported by the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Secondly, it was not the payment of the agreed remuneration that resulted in the breach of visa condition 8107; it was the making of the contract of employment and the working thereunder that constituted the visa breach.</sentence>
