<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The applicant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, alleges that the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, and two of its alleged officers, Mr Noonan and Mr Lancsar, were accessories to a number of alleged contraventions of s 45E(3) and s 45EA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) by Bovis Lend Lease Limited ("BLL").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">BLL has admitted one of the alleged contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">No such concession has been made by the other respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In these circumstances, it was decided that the case against BLL would be dealt with on its admissions independently of the present, contested, proceedings against the other respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The seemingly unusual consequence of this bifurcation is that, on the state of the evidence before me, I am not reasonably satisfied that the contravening conduct conceded by BLL has in fact been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The relevant events, which it will be necessary to analyse in a little detail, fall within a relatively narrow compass.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In 2002 BLL, a company providing nation-wide project management and construction services, contracted with a third party to provide those services in the construction of medium density apartments for the "Landmark" development in the Australian Capital Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 In early 2003 BLL contracted with Bernmar Projects Pty Ltd, the company of a Mr Luketic, for the provision of some plasterboard services to BLL at the Landmark site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Bernmar in turn engaged six independent subcontractors to supply those services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That contract was later reduced to writing and was subsequently varied to include further work at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Officers of the CFMEU and the union itself objected to Bernmar's use of the subcontractors for the work in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Likewise, some officers of BLL had their own concerns about the bases of the subcontractors' engagements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 At this time BLL and the CFMEU were negotiating their fifth Australia-wide enterprise agreement --- the "Joint Development Agreement" (or JDA-V) --- which would (i) apply on construction sites managed by BLL throughout Australia, save for Western Australia; (ii) regulate the terms and conditions upon which members of the CFMEU would provide various services to BLL; and (iii) regulate the terms upon which BLL would acquire those services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As will be seen, the engagement of the Bernmar subcontractors --- or "ABN subbies" as they were called --- became an irritant in those negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 Following events which occurred on 3 April 2003 during negotiations for JDA-V, BLL terminated Bernmar's contract on 4 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The notice given to Bernmar on that date specified that the termination was effected under the contract and was "due to Bernmar's breach of Subcontract provisions relating to industrial matters, including breaches of clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the Schedule of Industrial Requirements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Reference will be made below to the provisions of the subcontract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 It is the ACCC's contention that that termination was the product of an arrangement or understanding between BLL and the CFMEU, or alternatively its officers, which contained a provision included for the purpose of preventing or hindering BLL continuing acquisition of plasterboard services from Bernmar at the Landmark site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The alleged arrangement or understanding is said to have been reached on any one, or possibly more, of three dates --- 18 March 2003, 3 April 2003 and 4 April 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The offending provision is variously cast for each date and, in the case of 3 April, is cast in alternatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">THE STATUTORY SETTING AND THE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES 
 
7 There are three distinct matters to which it is necessary to refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The first relates to ss 45E and 45EA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The second, to accessorial liability and ss 76 and 75B of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The third concerns the standard of proof in this matter and s 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicable principles in relation to each of these are not in dispute in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">They have been the subject of recent judicial consideration, notably in Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 ("CEPU") and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (2006) 157 FCR 162.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Sections 45E and 45EA 
 
8 Section 45E, insofar as presently relevant, provides:
 (1) This section applies in the following situations: 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 (b) an acquisition situation --- in this situation, a person (the first person) has been accustomed, or is under an obligation, to acquire goods or services from another person (the second person).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 
Despite paragraphs (a) and (b), this section does not apply unless the first or second person is a corporation or both of them are corporations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">... 
 
 (3) In an acquisition situation, the first person must not make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, with an organisation of employees, an officer of such an organisation or a person acting for and on behalf of such an officer or organisation, if the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision included for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) preventing or hindering the first person from acquiring or continuing to acquire such goods or services from the second person; or 
 
 (b) preventing or hindering the first person from acquiring or continuing to acquire such goods or services from the second person, except subject to a condition: 
 
 
 
 (i) that is not a condition to which the acquisition of such goods or services by the first person from the second person has previously been subject because of a provision in a contract between those persons; and (ii) that is about the person to whom, the manner in which or the terms on which the second person may supply any goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">... 
 
 (7) In this section, a reference to a person who has been accustomed to acquire goods or services from a second person includes ... :
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a regular acquirer of such goods or services from the second person; or 
 
 (b) a person who, when last acquiring such goods or services, acquired them from the second person; or
 
 (c) a person who, at any time during the immediately preceding 3 months, acquired such goods or services from the second person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 
 

9 For its part, s 45EA provides, insofar as presently relevant that:
 A person must not give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding if, because of the provision, the making of the contract or arrangement, or the arriving at the understanding, by the person: (a) contravened subsection [s 45E(3)] 
10 The concepts in these various provisions have not been defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, they have been the subject of judicial illumination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">For present purposes I need refer only to the following, presently uncontroversial, propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">First , for an "arrangement or understanding" to be found, there must be a "meeting of the minds" of the parties under which one or both of them committed to a particular course of action: CEPU at [15] and [175]; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Amcor Printing Papers Group Ltd (2000) 169 ALR 344 at [75].</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As Smithers J observed in Top Performance Motors Pty Ltd v Ira Berk (Qld) Pty Ltd (1975) 24 FLR 286 at 291:
 Where the minds of the parties are at one that a proposed transaction between them proceeds on the basis of ... the adoption of a particular course of conduct, it would seem that there would be an understanding within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Secondly , a mere expectation, as a matter of fact, or a hope that something might be done or happen or that a party will act in a particular way, is not of itself sufficient to found an arrangement or understanding: see Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2005) 159 FCR 452 at [45]; IPM Operation at [104]-[112].</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Thirdly , the necessary consensus or meeting of minds need not involve, though it commonly will in fact embody, a reciprocity of obligation: Amcor Printing Papers at [75].</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Fourthly , as to the requirement that the provision be included in the arrangement or understanding for the proscribed purpose or for purposes which include that purpose, the test of purpose is a subjective one and the proscribed subjective purpose is to be had by each party to the arrangement or understanding: CEPU at [182].</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Fifthly , the purpose of conduct for present purposes is the end sought to be accomplished by the conduct and is to be distinguished from the motive for such conduct which is the reason for seeking that end: CEPU at [181] and the cases there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Sixthly , the term "hindering" in s 45E(3) has been given a broad construction and encompasses conduct which in any way affects to an appreciable extent the ease of the usual way of supplying or acquiring an article or service: IPM Operations at [127]; Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers --- Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited [1993] FCA 266 ; (1993) 42 FCR 452 at 459-460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Accessorial liability 
 
11 Though s 45E requires that there be two or more parties to an arrangement or understanding, only the "first person" to whom the section applies will be a contravener of the provision as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">While the "first person's" offending arrangement or understanding must be with an organisation of employees, an officer of such an organisation or a person acting on behalf of such an officer or organisation, that organisation, officer or person can only be exposed to civil proceedings under the Act in respect of the first person's contravening conduct if it, etc, falls within the accessorial liability provisions of s 76(1) or s 75B of the TP Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Section 76, which provides for the imposition of civil penalties against (inter alia) accessories, only applies to a union which is an accessory to a contravention of s 45E, and not its officers or agents: see s 76(2) and CEPU at [183]-[188].</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">An officer or agent of a union, on the other hand, may nonetheless be liable under the general accessorial liability provisions of s 75B for other relief under the Act (eg an injunction under s 80) if he or she is found to be an accessory to a contravention of s 45E.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">12 The substantive requirements to be satisfied to constitute a union (s 76(1)(c)-(f)) or a person (s 75B(1)(a)-(d)) an accessory to a contravention of s 45E are, for present purposes, substantially identical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">What is required is that the Court be satisfied (in the language of s 76(1)) that the union or the person concerned:
 
 
 (c) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured a person to contravene such a provision; or 
 
 
 
 (d) has induced, or attempted to induce, a person, whether by threats or promises or otherwise, to contravene such a provision; or
 
 (e) has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention by a person of such a provision; or 
 
 (f) has conspired with others to contravene such a provision 
 
 
 

Common to these alternatives is the requirement that the alleged accessory acted with knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up the contravention whether or not the accessory knew that those matters amounted to a contravention of s 45E: CEPU at [188]; Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 667.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Standard of Proof 
 
13 I need only refer briefly to this matter and then only for s 76 civil penalty proceedings purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">This matter has been considered at length in CEPU at [29]-[38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Section 76 proceedings are civil proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">As such, by virtue of s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), it attracts the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Accordingly, I must be satisfied that the ACCC has established that the circumstances appearing in the evidence gave rise to a reasonable and definite inference, not merely to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability, that BLL and the CFMEU, an officer of the CFMEU, or an agent of the CFMEU or of an officer thereof, made one or more arrangements or arrived at one or more understandings within the meaning of s 45E: CEPU at [38].</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">A PRELIMINARY NOTE ON PARTIES AND PERSONS 
 
14 I will later in these reasons make a number of rulings on evidentiary matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">For ease in exposition I will here refer to evidence which may be in issue, but without prejudice to what I have to say later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">15 I have already described BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I would simply add the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The two officers of the company who gave evidence in this proceeding are Mr Hensley and Mr Little.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Hensley, since May 1996, has been National Industrial Relations Manager for BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In that role he was responsible (for presently relevant purposes) (a) for maintenance of working relationships with unions and employer groups; and (b) for implementation and renegotiation of JDAs covering directly employed construction workers nationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Little began employment with BLL in the ACT in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">From late 2002 until mid February 2003 he was Senior Construction Manager (Residential) reporting to the Regional Operations Manager for the ACT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In late February 2003 he was appointed to the latter position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">As regional manager Little was responsible for the delivery of all BLL's construction works in the ACT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">This included the Landmark development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">His responsibilities included the regional management of industrial relations issues for all projects in the ACT at regional level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I will later comment on my impression of these witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">A third BLL officer, Mr Woodcock, participated in some of the events in issue in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">He was at relevant times the Asia Pacific Operations Director for BLL and was the person to whom Hensley then reported directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He did not give evidence in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Hunter, who seemingly was BLL project manager at the Landmark site, was also an actor in some of the events of present concern and, particularly, in dealings with Luketic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He likewise did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">16 Bernmar, the company the object of the alleged s 45E provision, was specially formed by its principal, Luketic, to provide plasterboard services in the ACT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Luketic's contact with BLL was Hunter who was the project manager at the Landmark site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Luketic gave evidence in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">17 The three principal CFMEU officials involved in this matter were Mr Sutton, Noonan and Lancsar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">While statements were filed and served by Sutton and Noonan these were not read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">No oral evidence was given by any of the above three.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">At all relevant times Sutton was the Divisional Secretary of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He was involved in the 2003 JDA-V negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Noonan was, in 2003, Divisional Assistant Secretary of the Construction and General Division of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He was the person principally responsible for negotiating JDA-V with BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Lancsar at that time was a union organiser in the ACT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He was a CFMEU representative involved in discussions concerning Bernmar and attended a number of the meetings to which reference will be made below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Witnesses 
 
18 Only three witnesses gave oral evidence ---Luketic, Little and Hensley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Of these, it is only necessary that I comment upon Hensley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I have reached the view that his evidence should be treated with quite some caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Often he evaded answering questions directly or at all --- a matter of comment both by counsel and by myself at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">His answers, regularly, had the ring of advocacy and were unhelpful for that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They revealed as well that his statement had been cast in a fashion that on occasion created misleading impressions both of the significance of what was being recounted and of what actually had been said in conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I will illustrate what I have said in passing below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">I should also add that, in relation to Little, I have preferred his oral over his written evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Though to a significantly lesser extent, his statement in places is misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">THE ACCC'S CLAIMS 
 
19 The ACCC alleges that BLL made one or more of four arrangements, or arrived at one or more of four understandings, with the CFMEU, or alternatively its officers, containing provisions that contravened s 45E(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">I will deal with these, not in the order in which they have been pleaded (and emphasised), but sequentially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I do this because it is important, in my view, to appreciate both how events unfolded and the significance of the passage of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The four claimed arrangements or understandings are as follows (I will refer to BLL and the CFMEU or its officers for present purposes as "the parties").</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">20 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">On or about 18 March 2003 the parties made an arrangement or arrived at an understanding containing a provision that BLL would take steps to ensure that Bernmar's workers were engaged as employees, or alternatively were covered for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy in compliance with CFMEU's demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This arrangement is said to have been made at a meeting on 18 March in Sydney involving Woodcock and Hensley of BLL and Sutton and Noonan of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">At that meeting Sutton drafted a letter which in form was from Hensley to Sutton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">As will be seen, it concerned Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">This letter was, with minor changes, later sent to Sutton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is said to evidence the claimed arrangement or understanding though its language does not reflect precisely either of the pleaded alternatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">21 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">On 3 April, at the time of a JDA-V negotiations meeting attended by amongst others Hensley, Little, Noonan and Lancsar, an arrangement was made or an understanding arrived at containing provisions that:
 
 
 (i) BLL would terminate Bernmar's contract and further, or in the alternative, would no longer acquire plasterboard services from Bernmar at the Landmark site; and 
 (ii) BLL and the CFMEU would continue the negotiation of the JDA-V. 
 

22 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">By no later than 3 April, an arrangement was made or an understanding arrived at containing a provision that BLL would comply with the CFMEU's requirement that BLL refrain from acquiring plasterboard services from Bernmar unless Bernmar's subcontractors were engaged as employees rather than independent contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">23 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">On 4 April an arrangement was made or an understanding arrived at containing a provision that BLL would terminate Bernmar's contract and, further or in the alternative, would no longer acquire plasterboard services from Bernmar at the Landmark site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">24 For reasons which I will later give, it is only the third of the above arrangements or understandings that gives rise to a serious question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The others have little resonance in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">25 I should emphasise that this proceedings has been defended strictly on the basis of the case as pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This has been made plain throughout and there is, in my view, no room for any suggestion that the case has been conducted on some other basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I do not understand the ACCC to contend otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">THE EVIDENCE 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Background: a contentious industrial practice 
 
26 The catalyst for the events that occurred in this matter was the perception entertained ultimately both by some representatives of the CFMEU (and notably Lancsar) and of BLL (notably Little) that, in engaging ABN subcontractors, Bernmar was, or may have been, engaging in the practice of "body hire" or "pyramid subcontracting" so as to avoid award or legislative obligations to those who were performing work for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">27 For present purposes it is unnecessary to differentiate between "body hire" and "pyramid subcontracting".</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It is Hensley's evidence that both of them are very close to being the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Hensley described "body hire" as where a subcontractor in turn subcontracts work to a number of individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He was prepared to exempt from his description --- though he acknowledged others might not --- those instances of sequential subcontracting where the person subcontracted has a specialisation not possessed by the person engaging that subcontractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This refinement is not presently relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Bernmar was formed to provide plasterboard and painting services and its subcontractors were, on Luketic's evidence, engaged to provide plasterboard services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">28 BLL's standard contract for subcontractors in 2003 addressed the practice of body hire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Clause 2.4.1 of the contract prohibited a subcontractor from subcontracting all or part of the contracted works without the prior written approval of BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It has not been suggested that such approval had been given or that this term had been varied orally in Bernmar's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The Schedule of Industrial Requirements ("the IR Schedule") to the contract provided in cll 3.3 and 3.5 that:
 
 
 3.3 The Subcontractor must abide by Clause 2.4.1 of the Subcontract Terms and must not engage in or be party to the practices known as 'body hire' or 'pyramid subcontracting' in executing the Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">...
 
 3.5 The Subcontractor must not engage in any arrangements or practices designed to avoid award or legislative obligations including (but not limited to treating a genuine employee as an independent contractor or allowing inappropriate application of the Prescribed Payments System (PPS) of taxation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">
 

29 For the sake of completeness, I would note that cll 5.1 and 5.2 went on to provide:
 
 
 5.1 Prior to commencing work on the Site the Subcontractor must make itself aware of all the procedural requirements for the Works and the Site relating to industrial matters, including all relevant legislation, awards, enterprise agreements, codes of practice, industry agreements and site agreements which may apply to the Works or the Site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The Subcontractor must ensure that its personnel comply with all the abovementioned legislation, awards and agreements during the execution of the Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">5.2 The Subcontractor must ensure that its personnel are paid, as a minimum, at the rates fixed by relevant awards, enterprise agreements or orders of industrial tribunals and are employed under the conditions (including hours of work) prescribed therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 

30 I refer to the contractual provisions not because the evidence indicates that Hensley and Little, or for that matter Hunter, consciously adverted to their actual terms at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">It does not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">What it does establish is that Hensley and particularly Little were well aware at that time of the general burden and purposes of the provisions to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">While, as will be seen, those provisions acquired a contractual significance in the course of the events to which I will later refer, I mention them here primarily to illuminate the context in which those events were played out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">31 I would add to the above the evidence of Hensley in cross-examination that, if a contractor was in breach of cl 3.5, action might be taken to rectify the situation or explain the circumstances, but he thought it very doubtful that the absence of adequate explanation or consent could lead to termination of a contract: "It hasn't happened in my time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">"
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The engagement of Bernmar 
 
32 In early January 2003, Hunter, who was BLL's project manager at the Landmark site and, according to Luketic, a friend of his for 20 years, contacted Luketic to enquire whether he was interested in tendering for a job at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Luketic told him he was interested but only if he could do it on a subcontractor basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">According to Luketic, Hunter said he did not have a problem with that whatsoever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Luketic then took steps to have Bernmar incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">He obtained a Landmark contract on about 21 January.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">33 Luketic's evidence was that he again said to Hunter that he was going to use "subbies" only and was told that was fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He reiterated this intent on a later occasion to Hunter and again received reassurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">On 20 February 2003 he signed a contract with BLL to provide specified plasterboard services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">On 21 February Hunter made him aware that the CFMEU was interested in Bernmar, Hunter, according to Luketic, saying to him that "[w]e have to prove that your subbies are subcontractors and not employees".</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Concerns with Bernmar's "workers" 
 
34 Though evidence of the genesis of the CFMEU's interest in, and concerns about, Bernmar's subcontractors is wanting, it is clear that by 20 February 2003 BLL was for a variety of reasons aware that the CFMEU was taking issue with Bernmar use of subcontractors in its work for BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Hensley's evidence was that on 20 February 2003 (the day before JDA-V negotiations were to resume) he was forewarned by Noonan that there were "problems in Canberra".</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He took this to be a reference to the use of ABN subcontractors there: "the plasterboard industry in Canberra is notorious for [body-hire] arrangements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He considered this to be one of a number of issues in the JDA-V negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Though the CFMEU walked out of the meeting on 21 February, I am not at all satisfied on the evidence that the ABN subcontractors issue was the actual cause of it notwithstanding Hensley's evidence suggesting to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As Hensley himself conceded, a walk-out was to be expected as part of the modus operandi of the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">35 By 21 February Little, in Canberra, had been made aware both of Lancsar's concern that Bernmar did not have workers compensation insurance for the subcontractors and of the like concern of Mr Judd, BLL's Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality Officer, who had approached him (Little) to discuss Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In his conversation with Judd, Little recorded an exchange to the following effect:
 Martin Little What do you think we should do about it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Steve Judd I think it might be a good idea to get the people from WorkCover to come on-site and explain what's required by law and to give an opinion on whether or not Bernmar needs workers' compensation insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">That way, we'll have a definitive assessment by a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Martin Little That sounds like a good idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Steve Judd I'll organise a meeting and let you know when it's happening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">36 The matter I would emphasise in passing is that the ACT WorkCover meeting was organised by BLL, not the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Luketic's evidence of the provenance of this meeting is that he was told by Hunter that "[w]e've organised [the] meeting".</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The ACCC's oral submissions attribute the resort to WorkCover as, in effect, a contrivance of Lancsar to further the CFMEU's purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">37 A meeting was held on 26 February involving Little, Hunter and Judd, Lancsar and Mr Wilson of the CFMEU and Mr Ulrich and another officer of WorkCover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Little's oral account of the purpose of the meeting and of his resultant concerns are captured in the following exchange:
 
 
 Q [The meeting was arranged] with a view to ascertaining what the status of Mr Luketic's workforce was, in fact?</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">A It was just an understanding how he was contracting and allow that opportunity for all parties to hear that from WorkCover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Q It was as a consequence of that meeting that you became concerned as you told us, that Mr Luketic may have been engaging in practices which may have been a breach of clause 3.5 of the agreement?</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">A Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 
 
 
 Q Can you see in paragraph 10, you record Mr Lancsar as saying certain things.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">You see that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">A I do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">
 
 
 
 Q You understood Mr Lancsar, did you, in saying what you record him there as saying, to be asserting that the arrangement that Mr Luketic had with his workforce was one designed to avoid award and other legislative obligations?</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">A Yes, I understood that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">
 
 
 
 Q That, in fact, accorded with your understanding or your belief at that point in time, as you have told us?</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">A Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">
 
 
 
 Q Immediately after this meeting, you spoke to Mr Luketic and asked him to get workers compensation insurance?</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">A I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">
 
 
 
 Q That was the matter, although you had other matters of concern, that was the matter that was of immediate concern to you because it may have exposed BLL to some liability under the workers compensation standard?</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">A Yes, that's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">
 
 
 
 Q It was not the only matter that was concerning you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">A No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 
 
 
 Q The essence of your concern, if I could just encapsulate it, was whether or not what Mr Luketic was describing as subcontractors were, in effect and in truth, employees?</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">
 
 ... 
 
 Q Mr Uhlrich said to the meeting, including you, words to this effect, didn't he?</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">'On balance, it appears that Bernmar's workforce are employees for the purpose of the Workers Compensation Act, therefore Bernmar is required to obtain workers compensation insurance'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">A I believe that he did say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">
 
 
 
 Q That was of immediate concern to you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 Q As [you] told us, that was only one of the concerns?</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">... 
 
 Q Now, in fact, is this the position that after the meeting of 26 February to which we've just referred, you formed the belief that Bernmar's workers were employees not subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Isn't that so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">A I did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 
 
 
 Q You formed that belief upon the basis of the material that had been put before the meeting with Mr Uhlrich and others on 26 February?</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 
 
 Q You continued to have that belief until April 2003, isn't that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">A Sorry, can you explain 'until April 2003'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Q Until the contract was terminated?</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 
 
 
 Q Was your belief between February 2003 and the date of termination, that what Mr Luketic was doing was engaging in a process designed to avoid award and other legislative requirements which you regarded as being a breach of clause 3.5 to which I've already taken you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">A Yes, I did have that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 
 
 
 Q Your conversations with Mr Lancsar, when he referred to Mr Luketic's arrangements, you understood Mr Lancsar to have the same view as you did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">I'm asking about your understanding?</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">A That was my understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Whether it was right, I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">
 
 
38 For the sake of completeness, I would note that by letter of 10 March 2003, Ulrich said of the 26 February meeting that in the scenarios described by Bernmar, "the 5 subcontractors engaged could be deemed workers for the purposes of workers compensation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">39 Immediately after the above meeting, Little spoke to Hunter and Luketic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">He told Luketic he needed to get workers compensation insurance; Luketic agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Little told Hunter he was "to monitor this and ensure that the appropriate insurance cover is obtained"; Hunter agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Luketic obtained a cover note the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Shortly thereafter Little spoke to Hunter by telephone concerning whether BLL should pay Bernmar's insurance premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Hunter proposed BLL should; Little disagreed because "he was supposed to have it from the beginning".</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">40 From conversations with Noonan on 24 and 25 February 2003, Hensley was made aware that the union wanted problems in Canberra addressed --- these included BLL's approach to the sourcing of subcontractors in the ACT --- and that a scheduled JDA-V negotiation meeting was to be cancelled because of inaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">By 26 February Hensley was equally aware that there was an issue over whether Bernmar was a "legitimate subcontractor" in relation to his workers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">41 On 27 February Hensley went to Canberra and along with Mr Norman (Little's predecessor) he met with ACT CFMEU officials including Lancsar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">At that meeting, according to Hensley, Lancsar indicated his view that ABN subbies were not all illegal but objection was taken to Bernmar's workforce and its legitimacy (a view that Lancsar reiterated to him on 4 March).</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Nonetheless, Hensley said he did not understand that there was an acceptance of ABN subcontractors on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">He acknowledged, though, that this was not said to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It was "implied".</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">42 On 28 February, Hensley and Woodcock met with Sutton and Noonan in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Though he said in his witness statement that, based on this meeting, it was his belief that the CFMEU had decided at a national level to put pressure on BLL to assist the CFMEU in resolving the use of ABN subcontractors in the ACT, Hensley accepted that at the meeting BLL was only asked to ensure two things in relation to subcontractors --- that there was workers compensation coverage and there were safe work practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">43 Little gave evidence that in late February or early March he had a discussion with Hensley about Luketic at Hensley's instigation and from an industrial relations point of view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">This included Little's concerns about Luketic's practices in relation to his subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">While Hensley said he would have had discussions with Little prior to 4 March, he could not recall Little telling him he thought Bernmar did not have legitimate arrangements in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">He accepted, though, that there must have been a discussion about workers compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">44 Lancsar and Hensley met at the CFMEU office in Canberra on 4 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">At that meeting Lancsar made it clear to Hensley that he accepted that ABN contractors can be legitimate but that Luketic was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In cross-examination Hensley accepted that he understood Lancsar to be saying that the arrangement that Luketic had with his workforce was designed to avoid legislative, award and other obligations to his workforce and if that was so there would be a breach of obligations between Bernmar and BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Lancsar indicated his view that BLL should be setting a standard of legitimate employment practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Hensley did not understand Lancsar at the meeting to be suggesting that BLL ought to be getting rid of Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">45 In his statement Hensley said that by 4 March:
 ... it was my view that it was not sensible from a commercial point of view for BLL to undertake to ensure that its subcontractors used employees rather than sole trader subcontractors in all or even most cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">There were two reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">First, it was not for BLL to dictate how people were remunerated, and BLL shouldn't be dictating the employment arrangements of sub contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Secondly, to ban ABN's would make it difficult for BLL to attract labour to its projects and would be more expensive for BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">I was also proceeding on the belief, (up until the meeting on 3 April 2003 referred to later in this statement), that it was likely that Mr Lancsar, who appeared to be driving the issue, could be calmed down and persuaded to cease agitating the issue if BLL improved its relationship with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">He nonetheless accepted in oral evidence that BLL had its own employment arrangements in place governing its subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Equally, in relation to banning ABN subcontractors, he said in cross-examination:
 
 
 Q Now, I think you've already agreed with me that nothing had been said to you up until that point of time which indicated that anyone from the union required BLL to ban simpliciter ABNs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">A There wasn't a specific request to ban there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">There was a desire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">
 
 
 
 Q What was communicated to you, and as you've told us, was they wanted you to ban the use of ABNs which were not regarded as being a legitimate use of ABNs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">A I took it as being potentially more than that, but, yes, that was the minimum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">
 
 
 
 Q Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">You would agree that the non-legitimate use of ABNs was in any event banned under clause 3.5 of the contract between BLL and Bernmar?</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">A If it was established they were non-legitimate, they would have to be fixed up, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 
46 On 13 March 2003, Hensley was informed that at a site meeting in New South Wales at Jackson's Landing, a mass meeting of construction workers voted to go out for 24 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">They had been addressed by Sutton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The workers were said to have voted to go out on the bases that BLL was not moving fast enough to resolve the use of a "shonky subbie" (ie Bernmar) in Canberra and, distinctly, the Master Builders Association ("MBA") negotiations was being influenced by "the majors over the ACT 36 hour calendar".</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Similar votes were taken the same day at several other sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">THE 18 MARCH MEETING AND LETTER 
 
47 Hensley described this meeting, and the composition of the letter that was later sent by him to Sutton, in the following passages of his statement:
 On 18 March 2003, David Woodcock and I met with John Sutton at the CFMEU's National Office in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">I think it is likely that Dave Noonan from the CFMEU was also present at this meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Words to the following effect were said during that meeting: John Sutton I want to talk about labour practices on the Landmark project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Nothing has been done about Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">I want BLL to commit to ensuring that Bernmar's workforce is appropriately covered for workers' compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">This has to be done immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">David Woodcock There are market issues down in Canberra that you should be aware of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">There is a shortage of trades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Landmark was a very tightly won project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Things are very tight, and we're under a lot of pressure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">This is a distressed project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">John Sutton Don't think we'll give you leniency over that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">It's your problem, not ours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">We're concerned that this is signalling a move toward shonky subbies on your part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Give us an assurance that you're not moving that way Landmark is not a residential project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">David Woodcock or Eric Hensley That is the nature of the market in Canberra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">We have been through this in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">ABNs are not illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">John Sutton Yes, but this guy is not legitimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">This is not a residential project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">If you want the JDA discussions to continue, we need some commitments from you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Eric Hensley We understood Bernmar was resolving the issue direct with the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">We see it as Bernmar's issue to resolve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">But we do agree that it's important that Bernmar's workforce is appropriately covered and we'll do all that we can to ensure that it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">But it may take some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">We need some time to move Bernmar toward legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">John Sutton We want a written commitment from you on what you are going to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">All I want is a statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">David Woodcock and Eric Hensley We can't do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">John Sutton You can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">I'll draft it for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">David Woodcock We'll have a look at it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">John Sutton then sat down and drafted the letter in front of us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">He did this without any collaboration with us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">When he finished writing the letter by hand he gave it to us ... We indicated to him that we would review the letter and let him know if we could send it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In my experience it was an unusual course of events for a union official to draft a letter for BLL to send.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">It has never happened to me before or since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">However, I was prepared to go along with it because the letter didn't require us to do anything we weren't already doing or planning to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">48 After the meeting Woodcock indicated to Hensley: "Well that was what we expected".</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Hensley then made some changes (minor) to the letter; gave it to BLL in-house lawyers (who also suggested minor changes); and then sent it to Sutton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">49 Formal parts apart, the letter stated:
 Further to our discussion of this afternoon please see below certain proposals that Bovis Lend Lease is prepared to commit to in relation to its operations in the ACT 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Rostered Day Off Agreement Bovis will commit to 3 RDO's in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Bovis will commit to an additional 7 RDO's in 2004 and a further 3 RDO's in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Bovis will commit to phase in the RDO's on the above formula with the calendar to be agreed to, consisting of paid leave days, specific shut down weekends centred around key local public holidays, and a residue of a small number of flexible days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Sourcing of additional labour Bovis will source additional direct labour from former company employees (subject to their availability) and skills in consultation with the ACTU Branch of the CFMEU pending finalisation of the new JDA over the next few months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Labour practices on Landmark Project Bovis agree that the said project is not a small residential project and will advise it's subcontractors of its expectations on such a project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Bovis will discuss the current situation of Bernmar Pty Ltd with a view to ensuring that all its workforce is appropriately covered for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">This situation with Bernmar Pty Ltd will be finalised within 7 days of today's date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Bovis will ensure all subcontractors on the project are also aware of their obligations in respect to employment practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">50 On the same day Hensley described the meeting to Little in words to the following effect: 
 We agreed to send them a letter in which we make certain commitments regarding labour practices on the Landmark Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">I'll send you a copy of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Basically, it just sets out what we're already doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">We say that we will discuss the current situation of Bernmar with a view to ensuring that all Bernmar's workforce is appropriately covered for workers' compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It doesn't say that Bernmar has to have any of those things, but just that we'll discuss the situation to ensure that it's appropriately covered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">We also commit to ensuring that all subcontractors on the project are aware of their obligations in respect of employment practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">I don't think it adds anything more than we've been talking about already.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">51 As to the meeting and the letter Hensley said in oral evidence that:
 
(i) he had no clear recollection of Noonan being there for the full meeting and he did not believe he was there when the letter was written; 
 
(ii) the use of the word "appropriately" in the conversation and the letter was significant and meant "appropriate" as discussed with Lancsar, ie there were persons on ABNs "but they've got to be appropriately covered" as well as "appropriately" under the contract (whatever this last may have signified); 
 
(iii) at no time did he understand Sutton was saying to him at the meeting, or any one from the union at any other time, that BLL was to arrange an enterprise bargaining agreement between Bernmar and its workforce; 
 
(iv) moving "Bernmar toward legitimacy" meant to "correct employment relations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">The cross-examination of Hensley on this topic is emblematic of how he gave evidence: 
 Q Now, you then say: We need some time to move Bernmar toward legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Do you see that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">
 
 Q Now, by 'legitimacy', you there meant, did you not, legitimacy in terms of the industrial relations between Bernmar and its workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">A It was more the union's definition of 'legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">' They were the ones who raised those words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">If it was getting closer to their definition, I was happy there was movement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Q Mr Hensley, by the use of the term 'legitimacy' there, you had in mind correct employment arrangements, didn't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">A Yes, of course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Q By 'correct employment arrangements,' you were there communicating to Mr Sutton that you did not regard the employment relations between Bernmar and its workforce as being correct and that you needed sometime [sic] to move that relationship to a correct position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Isn't that so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">A Certainly the improvement --- there needed to be improvement in the relationship and the contractual arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">I believed the detail of that wasn't totally known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Q You, Mr Hensley, when you used the words 'we need sometime [sic] to move Bernmar to legitimacy' had in mind firstly that the relationship between Bernmar and its workforce was not legitimate in the sense that we have discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Isn't that so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">A Based on the claim we were told, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Q No, not based on the claim you were told.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">You had in mind when you used the words that you needed time to move Bernmar towards legitimacy that the relationship between Bernmar and its workforce was not legitimate in the sense that we have discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Is that not so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">A We were told that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Certainly the relationship between the union and Bernmar needed improvement, but I would expect --- and I have to take it on face value that there were concerns with that relationship between the employees or ABN and Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">
 
Q Mr Hensley, the words that you used were: 
 
 
 We need sometime [sic] to move Bernmar toward legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">
 
 
 Do you see that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">
 
 Q You were there talking about BLL needing time to move Bernmar toward legitimacy, were you not?</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">
 
 
 
 Q What you were communicating to Mr Sutton was, firstly, 'We'; that is, BLL, 'did not regard the relationship between Bernmar and its workforce as being legitimate', in the sense that we have discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Is that not so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Q And secondly that you needed time; that is, BLL needed time, to move that relationship from a position of illegitimacy to one of legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Is that not so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">A We were on that path, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Q Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">You were on that path independently of anything that the union had said to you previously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">A Independently?</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">
 
 Q Yes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">
 
 A From 24 February, certainly --- sorry --- from the 26 th when the audit was done, there was movement in improving the paperwork on the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">
 
 
 
 Q Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Now, you were asked about this, just to be very clear about it, in the interview referred to in MFI 1 [with the ACCC].</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">You were asked this question:
 
 
 
 
 
 Did you agree with John Sutton that the Bernmar issue would be fixed?---I'm not sure what you mean by fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">
 
 That their - - -?---They had to comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">We needed sometime [sic] to move Bernmar towards legitimacy, you know, correct employment arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">
 
 
 
 Do you recall giving that answer?</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">A Along those lines, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">
 
 
 Q Well, not along those lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Do you recall giving that answer?</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">A If that was recorded, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Q Well, let me show you page 79 of MFI 1, top of the page.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">It's question 477 down to the answer after question 479 above the words 'Ms Lowther.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">' It's towards the very end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">About two pages from the end?</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">A Yes, I see this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Q You agree that they were the questions and the answers that you gave as I read them out to you earlier?</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Q Those answers which you gave and which I read out were true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Is that not so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">A That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">
 

(v) he agreed that when he read the letter his reaction to it was that he was prepared to go along with it, as he said in his statement, because it did not require BLL to do anything which they were not already doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">His cross-examination on this was as follows:
 
 
 Q What you were already doing was trying to move Bernmar's relationship with its workforce to a state of legitimacy --- isn't that so?</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">--- since February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
 
 
 
 Q You were doing that in light of the powers that were reserved to BLL under the schedule of industrial relations under its contract with Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Isn't that right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">A At that time, referring to the schedule of industrial relations, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">It was about legitimacy and, you say, moving the union and Bernmar together to discuss their relationships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">
 
 
 
 Q Mr Hensley, we've been through the question of legitimacy before?</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">A I know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">
 
 
 
 Q My question to you --- and it couldn't have been clear or no doubt you would have given me a direct answer, and I'm sorry if it wasn't, but what you were already doing and had been doing since February was endeavouring to move Bernmar to a state of legitimacy in the relations it had with its employees relying upon the schedule of industrial relations within the contract between Bernmar and BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">A Me personally or the company?</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
 
 
 Q The company?</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">A The company, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 
 
 
 Q Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Because moving Bernmar's relations with its workforce to a state of legitimacy was a matter of importance to BLL, was it not?</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">A Yes, it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">
 
 Q And yes it was?</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">A Yes, it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">It always is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">
 
 Q As at 18 March, you --- and by 'you' I mean the company BLL --- were planning to continue to do so, as best it could, in terms of the schedule of industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Correct?</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">A Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">
 
 
In re-examination Hensley said, in reference to this answer, that he did not speak to anyone in the company at or about 18 March 2003 who made reference to the IR Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">(vi) in agreeing to, and sending, the letter Hensley's purpose was not to hinder BLL in its acquisition of services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">THE ALLEGED 18 MARCH 2003 ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING 
 
52 The claim as pleaded is of an arrangement or understanding including a provision that, in compliance with the CFMEU's demands, BLL would take steps to ensure that Bernmar's workers (i) were engaged as employees; or (ii) were covered for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">53 The first of these alternatives can be dismissed shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Whatever may have been the CFMEU's desires, there is no evidence reasonably to support a finding that the CFMEU demanded that BLL would take steps to ensure that Bernmar's workers were to be engaged as employees as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">In oral submissions Mr O'Bryan QC conceded that the ACCC was not submitting that Bernmar's workers were to be turned into employees for all purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">If this be the case, then I have considerable difficulty in understanding what the alleged "employee requirement" actually signified --- if it was intended to signify anything more than the second alternative relating to cover for workers compensation etc. Hensley gave no evidence of any CFMEU demand that BLL ensure Bernmar workers were engaged as employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">And he did not understand BLL was being asked to arrange an enterprise bargaining agreement between Bernmar and its workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">54 The essence of the ACCC's second alternative would seem to be as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">There clearly was an arrangement or understanding in the terms of the 18 March 2003 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">That arrangement or understanding obliged BLL to ensure that Bernmar's workforce were covered, as if employees, for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">A purpose of this provision included (as put in closing written submissions):
 
 
 (a) hindering BLL from acquiring or continuing to acquire services from Bernmar, contrary to section 45E(3)(a), in that the provision had an object of making more prescriptive the terms and conditions upon which BLL had hitherto acquired the services from Bernmar (because hitherto BLL was indifferent as to the basis upon which Bernmar engaged its workforce) and it also inserted a more onerous condition into the existing relationship; and 
 
 (b) preventing or hindering BLL from acquiring or continuing to acquire services from Bernmar except subject to a condition that was not a condition to which the acquisition of services from Bernmar had previously been subject, and was about the manner in which or the terms on which Bernmar may supply services to BLL, contrary to section 45E(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">
 

55 In my view the letter in its setting merely demonstrated BLL's preparedness, in response to the CFMEU's importuning, to make plain to the relevant CFMEU officials what they had wished to have made plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">This was that BLL would discuss the current situation with Bernmar with a view to ensuring that all its workforce was appropriately covered for workers compensation etc, and that the situation would be finalised within seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">While there may have been considerable potential ambiguity in the terms of the letter as such, those terms considered in the context of the matter itself plainly enough indicated that a course would be pursued which involved the making of judgments (hence the importance of the word "appropriate") and the taking of actions (as Bernmar was moved to legitimacy) within a specified period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">I do not speculate on whether Sutton expected such ready compliance from BLL's officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">What the evidence establishes is that Hensley --- and, inferentially, Woodcock --- agreed to send the letter because in their view it committed BLL to no more than what it was already doing or planned to do having regard to the JDA-V negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">56 While the evidence suggests some level of inadequacy in internal communications, it is clear, and I so find that, far from being indifferent to the bases upon which Bernmar engaged its workforce (Hunter's representations to Luketic notwithstanding), concerns were entertained on that score in BLL and by, variously, Hensley, Little and Judd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Probably from late February or early March, Hensley was aware that the ABN subcontractor issue in Canberra was an impediment to the prosecution of the JDA-V negotiations and that Bernmar was becoming a catalyst of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">I am satisfied that probably several weeks prior to the 18 March meeting, Hensley had been apprised by Little of the workers compensation issue; he fully understood Lancsar's position as to the illegitimacy of the basis upon which Bernmar's workforce had been engaged; and he independently had reached his own understanding that Bernmar had to be moved toward a "state of legitimacy" in its relations with its workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">I do not consider it of particular moment whether or not Hensley's point of reference in this was BLL's subcontract and its IR Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Hensley understood both what was the issue and its significance, and that it required address because, as he conceded, it was a matter of importance to BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">57 From late February 2003 Little likewise formed concerns about Bernmar and its workforce, prompted initially by Judd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">I reiterate, it was Judd's suggestion that the 26 February WorkCover meeting be arranged by BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">It is unnecessary for me to repeat Little's concerns generally (which he understood to be the same as Lancsar's), although I note again he was concerned about BLL's possible financial exposure because of Bernmar's lack of workers compensation cover.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">I accept Little's evidence that he informed Hensley of his concerns and that they had discussed Hensley's concerns about Luketic's practices in relation to his ABN subbies, albeit Hensley raised these as industrial relations issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Though Hensley could not specifically recall these discussions, considered in context, I infer that they probably contributed to Hensley's own understanding of the issue concerning Bernmar's workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">58 I am satisfied that BLL through Hensley independently had arrived at the view in late February or early March that Bernmar's engagement of its workforce had the character of body hire and that the workforce ought not to have been subcontractors but ought to have had appropriate cover for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">I equally am satisfied that Hensley considered that he could properly insist that such coverage should be provided by Bernmar --- that it could be so moved to legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">59 Though the ACCC has raised the issue of the CFMEU seeking in effect to enforce BLL's contract with Bernmar, I am satisfied that the parties at the time dealt with the matter without specific regard to the precise terms of that contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Nonetheless, they had an informed understanding of what was, or was not, to be considered inappropriate or illegitimate practice and Hensley was well aware of the reflection of these in the usual prescriptions and proscriptions of BLL's standard form contracts with subcontractors and in the IR Schedule "template" to use his description of the standard schedules with which, I infer, he was well familiar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">BLL had its own self-interest to protect in ensuring that Bernmar did not so offend in its practices and it had since late February been seeking to have Bernmar conform to appropriate or legitimate practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">60 While in the 18 March letter BLL indicated proposals it was "prepared to commit to" in the ACT, it saw those concerning Bernmar as involving no fresh adoption by it of a proposed course of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">That course had been pursued independently from late February.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">What, probably, was new was the setting of a seven day time limit within which "[the] situation with Bernmar Pty Ltd [would] be finalised".</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Though not itself the product of a consensus, the proposed course was, in the circumstances, the subject of a consensus between BLL and the CFMEU and one through which BLL could properly be said to have obliged itself to act as it proposed it would.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">In such circumstances, for s 45E(3) purposes, BLL's subjective purpose in so committing itself is of the first importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">61 I have indicated above that BLL through Hensley had independently arrived at the view that Bernmar's engagement of its workforce had the character of body hire and that its workforce ought to have had appropriate cover for workers compensation, long service leave, superannuation and redundancy arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">62 I have also indicated that, while I consider BLL (through Hensley) was not acting with reference to the precise terms of the BLL-Bernmar contract as such, it did have an informed understanding of what was, or was not, to be considered inappropriate or illegitimate industrial relations practice and was acting accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">This said, I am not satisfied that what BLL was doing or planning to do, with a view to ensuring appropriate cover etc for Bernmar's workforce, was not in substance open to it under, and in furtherance of the intendment of, the terms of its contract with Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The ACCC contends that, as the contract and the IR Schedule did not contain express provisions relating to long service leave, etc, the alleged provision had an object of making more prescriptive the terms and conditions on which BLL acquired services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">This contention I consider to be more one of form than of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The contract and IR Schedule do address the industrial relations issue that BLL was seeking to address in moving Bernmar to legitimacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">Hensley made plain that his purpose was not to hinder or prevent BLL from acquiring services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">I accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">If there was an agreement or understanding containing a provision as alleged, the subjective purpose for the inclusion of that provision was, in BLL's case, to ensure compliance with the law and appropriate industrial relations practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The latter, in my view, was consistent, ultimately, with the obvious intent of BLL's contract with Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">If there was an arrangement or understanding between BLL and the CFMEU or its officers, it was not one that contained a provision included for a purpose proscribed by s 45E(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">63 I should reiterate for the sake of completeness that, while evidence was led of Hunter's representations concerning Luketic's engagement of subcontractors, no case of oral variation of the standard form contract for subcontractors was pleaded or advanced at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">After the 18 March 2003 letter 
 
64 On the day following the meeting of 18 March, Hensley asked Little if he could follow up on the letter sent to Sutton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">It was Hensley's intent in this that Little was to talk to Luketic to ensure that he was talking to Lancsar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">There is no evidence that this intent was explicitly communicated to Little.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">65 Little's evidence is that he met Hensley on 24 March to discuss Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Hensley asked him whether anything had happened that he should know about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Little said he replied: 
 No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">As far as I know, Bernmar and the CFMEU are sorting it out between themselves, with help from Frank [Gillingham, the Director of Industrial relations for the MBA of the ACT].</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">I would note in passing a statement of Mr Gillingham was put in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">I have not derived particular assistance from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">Later on 24 March Little attended a meeting with Hensley, and Lancsar and Mr Parry of the CFMEU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The primary topic discussed was not Bernmar though it was referred to briefly by either Hensley or Little himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Little said either Lancsar or Parry indicated they were meeting Bernmar the following day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">66 Hensley also gave evidence of the joint meeting with Lancsar and Parry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">He said he had Little organise it "to discuss, among other things, the issues outlined in my letter to John Sutton".</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Detailed evidence of discussion of those issues was not given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">On the same day Hensley spoke to Gillingham who advised him that he and Luketic were going to dispute WorkCover's assessment of Bernmar's workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">67 From 25 March until 2 April Little was in New Zealand and did not attend to any work matters during that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">This, as I will indicate, is not without significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">68 On 27 March Hensley informed a number of BLL senior management that, following discussions with Noonan, a meeting for the JDA-V negotiations had been scheduled for 3 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">On 31 March he made enquiries of a BLL official as to whether Bernmar's workforce was being appropriately remunerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">From a sparse reply of 1 April 2003, he formed the view they were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">I do not regard this evidence as of any positive significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">69 To backtrack, on 25 March Luketic was offered significant additional work at the Landmark site by Hunter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">He agreed to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Luketic said he was asked by Mr Rosin of BLL on 27 March whether he would ask if his subbies would be interested in becoming employees of Bernmar on full conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">He later met with his subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Two of the six indicated they were interested and this response was passed on to Rosin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">70 On 31 March Luketic met with Lancsar and Gillingham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">He told Lancsar that two of his subbies might be employees in a couple of weeks and that he had been given further work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">He reported Lancsar as saying that nobody would be working at Landmark "unless they're on wages and full conditions" and, in relation to the new work, that he would have let Luketic go if he only had to finish his old work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">The 3 April 2003 meeting 
 
71 This JDA-V negotiations meeting was held in Sydney at BLL's office and was attended by a significant number of BLL representatives and a small number of predominantly CFMEU union officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">For present purposes, Hensley and Little were present, as were Noonan and Lancsar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Shortly before 10.00 am when the negotiations were scheduled to commence Noonan approached Hensley and said, according to Hensley, words to the effect:
 We've got big problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">We're not going to meet because BLL has not resolved the ACT issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">I want to speak to you Eric and you (pointing to Martin Little).</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Hensley's evidence was that, as far as he knew, the concerns about Bernmar had been addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">He, Little, Noonan and Lancsar then went to a separate room where words to the following effect were said:
 Dave Noonan We're not going anywhere on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">We're not continuing with the negotiation until the issue with Canberra is resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">It is my understanding that Dave Noonan was here referring to the use of subcontractors by Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Eric Hensley What do you mean?</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">They're talking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">They're sorting things out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Dave Noonan That's not what Les tells me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Eric Hensley (to Martin Little) I thought this was on track --- what's going on?</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Martin Little So did I. Eric Hensley (to Dave Noonan) What do you expect us to do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Dave Noonan You'll think of something creative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">You guys are professionals at screwing subbies, we don't need to tell you how to do your job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Speak to your boss Woodcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">You'll work it out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Hensley said he appreciated from Noonan's demeanour that the issue was serious and that Lancsar was "very wound up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The meeting lasted less than a minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">72 In his oral evidence of the above encounter Hensley accepted that Noonan was not asking him and Little to do anything specific and that he understood that the ball was in his court to work out what it was he was going to do to legitimise the employment relationship between Bernmar and its workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">I would note in passing that Hensley has acknowledged he did not have notes of the above conversations or for that matter of any conversations at or surrounding the 3 April meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">73 Little's account in his statement of the encounter was that after he and Hensley were told by Noonan that he wanted to speak to them, they went to a large meeting room where words to the following effect were spoken: 
 David Noonan The matter of the shonky subcontractor in the ACT hasn't been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">You've had plenty of time to resolve it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">There has been no effort by BLL to resolve the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">We've discussed it and decided we won't progress with the negotiations until this matter is resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Eric Hensley We've been having meetings with the local union people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">Matters have been discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Steps have been taken to resolve this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Martin Little Bernmar is meeting with the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">David Noonan That's not good enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">This has to be resolved now, before anything else happens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">David Noonan Let's meet separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Eric Hensley, David Noonan, Les Lancsar and I then left the large meeting, passed back through the lobby, and went into a smaller meeting room across the lobby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">David Noonan Fix it now or we'll start shutting down projects around the country; and JDA negotiations will not continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Martin Little I thought you were meeting with Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Les Lancsar There is no hope of Bernmar and the union sorting it out between themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Eric Hensley or Martin Little We need some time to think about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">David Noonan I want immediate action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">This needs to be fixed now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">74 In oral evidence he likewise accepted that Noonan did not say he wanted Bernmar's contract terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">He equally accepted that Noonan wanted the matter of Luketic fixed but he left it entirely to Hensley and himself to work out how that was going to happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Little indicated he had a clear recollection of this encounter because of its significance to the 3 April meeting and of "the way it was carried out by Dave Noonan" whom he later described as appearing agitated and overly aggressive: "he wouldn't brook any discussion from Mr Hensley or myself and cut us off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">"
 
75 After the encounter with Noonan and, probably, Lancsar, the parties separated and Hensley and Little had a discussion as to how BLL should respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Hensley's account of this in his statement was to the following effect:
 Eric Hensley What have we been doing for the past month?</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">What is going on?</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">This guy is still not complying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">We need to do something about this now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">We can't let this drag on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Martin Little I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">I thought it was all done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Les and Bernie got together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Eric Hensley Well it's obviously not happening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">What are we going to do about it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">What's your solution?</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Martin Little I don't think we can keep him on the job any longer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">We've given him lots of opportunities to fix things up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">I think there's an area in his contract which can explore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Workers compensation may be an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">We might be able to terminate his contract for non-compliance with insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Eric Hensley Let's give Woody a call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Anyway this guy shouldn't be punished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">We don't want to go down the back-charge route.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">We need to talk to Woody about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">If there is a legal way of terminating his contract we should consider that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">76 In cross-examination Hensley indicated that the reference to Luketic "still not complying" related to his non-compliance with the BLL-Bernmar contract and that that had been on the agenda since late February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">77 Hensley's statement continued:
 At this time, it was my view that after six weeks of discussion with the CFMEU regarding Bernmar, the only option left to BLL was to terminate Bernmar's contract ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The sole reason that Martin Little and I considered termination of Bernmar's contract was in order to advise the CFMEU of the termination in order for negotiations of the JDA V to continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">78 Hensley had no reliable recollection of discussing with Little the options open to BLL although he did accept that Little raised the possibility of terminating the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Nonetheless, he accepted ultimately that options were discussed and a course determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">He accepted that the reason why he agreed to terminate the contract was to enable the JDA-V negotiations to continue as they were of great importance to BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">He did not think his purpose was to terminate a subcontractor's agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">79 Little's version of the discussion in his statement was:
 Eric Hensley What have we been doing for the past month?</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">What is going on?</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Martin Little Everything was fine at our meeting on 24 March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">It was on track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Martin Little or Eric Hensley What is this about?</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">This goes far beyond EBAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">Its got to be about something bigger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">I thought everything was being taken care of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">What are we missing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">What went wrong?</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">What is the union after here?</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Eric Hensley Lets discuss our options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">What are they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">How are we going to appease the union?</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">We can ignore the union and keep Bernmar on-site, or we can get Bernmar off-site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">I don't think keeping Bernmar on-site is an option any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The union won't accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Dave wants this fixed now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">There is no other option but to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Martin Little I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">The only option is to get Bernmar off Landmark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The next question is, how do we do it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Eric Hensley When does he finish his contract?</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Martin Little I think he has several months left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Eric Hensley or Martin Little That's too long for the union to accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Martin Little I know he hasn't complied with his legislative obligations or the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">He didn't have workers compensation when he started, even though he was supposed to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">And then when he got found out by WorkCover, he only got a cover note for one month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">And I'm sure he is not complying in other respects as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">I don't think he's paying PAYE or super or long service leave entitlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">We can probably terminate his contract on those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">Eric Hensley They might be grounds for terminating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">We need to find out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Eric Hensley or Martin Little Let's call Woody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">80 In cross-examination he reiterated that, at Hensley's instigation, they discussed the options which included keeping Bernmar on site and ignoring the union or getting Bernmar off-site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">He agreed they seriously thought about those two options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">He accepted that he was of the view prior to 3 April that Bernmar was in breach of its contractual arrangements; that the idea to terminate for breach only occurred to him on 3 April; and that the best course to adopt in light of the encounter was to terminate on what he believed were legitimate grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The decision to terminate, as he had previously said to the ACCC, was made "[b]asically because of their non-compliance with legislation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">While Little said he did feel there was pressure to have Bernmar directly employ its workforce, he agreed that he could not recall any discussion where such pressure was put on him and he confirmed that he had acknowledged such was the case in responding to a question of the interim Building Industry Taskforce on 4 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">81 In the call made to Woodcock (who was in Singapore), it was explained there was a problem with the JDA-V negotiations because of the Bernmar issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Little's, though not Hensley's, account of the conversation is that one or other of them told Woodcock that:
 Dave and Les Lancsar ... said that the union will go national with this unless we get Bernmar off-site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">In cross-examination Little accepted that neither Noonan nor Lancsar had said that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">82 His account of the conversation continued: 
 David Woodcock How did this happen?</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Eric Hensley or Martin Little I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">We met with the CFMEU in Canberra on 24 March and everything seemed to be on track.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">They told us they were meeting with Bernmar the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Les now says that the union and Bernmar can't sort it out and they want us to fix it immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">David Woodcock What do you propose we do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">Eric Hensley or Martin Little We think that the only option is to appease the union by getting Bernmar off-site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">We think that we can terminate Bernmar's contract for not complying with his legislative obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">We think this is the only option we have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">David Woodcock Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">But you need to get legal advice first on whether you can terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Eric Hensley or Martin Little Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">David Woodcock After you've spoken with the lawyers, let [me] know what they said before you go ahead and terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">83 Little spoke, first, to a Ms Moffat and, then, to Mr Fildissis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Both were BLL in-house lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">He explained to each in turn the factual matters which led him to believe that Bernmar was in breach of its subcontract with BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Moffat declined to give advice on the bases that the matter was outside her expertise and referred Little to Fildissis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">He received oral advice from him after a conversation of about ten minutes and it confirmed his own view that he had a proper basis for terminating the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">84 Hensley was not present during the conversation with Fildissis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">After speaking with Fildissis, Little called a Mr Spinelli (of BLL) and asked him to draft a termination letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">He then called Woodcock and had a conversation to the following effect:
 Martin Little We got the legal advice and it can go ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">We're in the process of doing it now, and the JDA negotiations have resumed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">David Woodcock Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Little agreed in cross-examination that at that time the negotiations had not resumed and that what he said to him was erroneous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">85 Though Little's instruction to Spinelli preceded his call to Woodcock, the conversation he said he had with Spinelli requires note:
 Martin Little I need you to draft a termination letter for one of the subcontractors we have working at the Landmark site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">Write this down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The name of the subcontractor is Bernmar Projects Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">Put 'Landmark Apartments --- termination of subcontract number LC0027' in the subject line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Then write the following: 'in accordance with clause 12.3 of the abovementioned subcontract dated 20 February 2003, and as a result of your breach of clauses 5.1 and 5.2 of the schedule of industrial requirements, Bovis Lend Lease hereby gives notice of our intent to terminate your subcontract effective immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">' New paragraph, 'should you wish to discuss the above in more detail please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Andrew Spinelli Whose name should the letter go in?</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Martin Little Put it in my name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Andrew Spinelli Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">Martin Little The letter needs to be reviewed by John Fildissis in the subcontract team before it's given to Bernie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">After you've drafted it, email it through to John.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">86 In his statement Hensley said he then told Noonan that "we're right to reconvene" as "[t]he issue's been resolved".</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">In cross-examination he said this conversation was by phone and that he did not communicate to Noonan precisely what had been determined because he did not precisely know the detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">In his statement he said he could not rule out having told Noonan of BLL's decision to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">I would note in passing that in his answer to the ACCC's s 155 notice (on which, see later in these reasons) Lancsar said he believed Hensley informed him that the Bernmar contract was to be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">87 Little's evidence is that Hensley told Noonan and Lancsar in person that:
 We're fixing the problem but we need time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">He will be gone from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">To which Noonan replied: 
 You bloody better.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Little acknowledged that he understood Noonan to be saying that "You bloody better fix the problem" and not that "You bloody better get him off the site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">88 The JDA-V negotiations were then reconvened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">89 Finally, Hensley agreed that the decision to terminate at which he arrived with Little was subject to Woodcock's approval and, as noted above, that approval was later given subject to getting confirmatory legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">Hensley acknowledged he did not obtain from Woodcock his view as to why he was agreeing to the termination of the contract, or what his purpose was in so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">90 Woodcock was not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">I simply note that Little gave evidence that he saw Woodcock in Sydney about three weeks before Little gave evidence at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">Little indicated that Woodcock was no longer employed by BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">THE ALLEGED FIRST 3 APRIL 2003 ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING 
 
91 This, as already noted, alleges an arrangement was made or an understanding was arrived at containing provisions that:
 
 
 (i) BLL would terminate Bernmar's contract and further, or in the alternative would no longer acquire plasterboard services from Bernmar at the Landmark site; and 
 (ii) BLL and the CFMEU would continue the negotiation of the JDA-V. 
 

92 I note at the outset the specificity of the provision alleged as a pleading issue has arisen in relation to this claim, as I will later indicate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">93 Put shortly the ACCC's case, as it emerged from written and oral submissions, oscillated between two possible constructions which it says can properly be put upon the events of 3 April when considered in context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Both focus upon the "Fix it now" statements of Noonan in the encounter with Hensley and Little which, I accept, were to the effect described by Little in his witness statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">94 The ACCC's, first, contention is that, while there may have been a number of possible options open to BLL, realistically (given the halt to the JDA-V negotiations on that day and the urgent demand made) "fix it" meant "Get rid of Bernmar now".</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">The union was not leaving a universe of possibilities open to BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">BLL did what was required and the clearest indication of the purposes of the parties, it is said, is revealed in what actually happened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The alternate contention is that even if BLL had a number of options open to it, it made its termination decision and offered up this course to appease the union's demand that the situation be fixed immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">The union, it is said, accepted that offer by recommencing the JDA-V negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">Standing uncertainly between these two positions is the ACCC's apparent acceptance of the proposition that termination in this setting should be taken as being one of the available ways of "fixing it" within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">95 The respondents' case (I will deal with the union, Noonan and Lancsar collectively) is that the evidence simply does not substantiate that an arrangement was made, or an understanding was arrived at, in the terms pleaded or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">Prior to Hensley and Little discussing their options after the encounter, there had been no meeting of the minds as to what actually was to be done and no demand was made to do a particular thing; each party may have had an expectation as to what might happen but that was not sufficient to establish a consensus; the actual decision maker --- Woodcock --- was not called so there is no express evidence as to BLL's basis for, or purpose in, terminating the contract; and the decision to terminate was taken prior to its communication to the union (if it was so communicated) and when it was communicated it was simply communicated as a fact, not as an offer to be accepted by the union.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Finally, the union contends, the ACCC's contention that the arrangement or understanding resulted from BLL's presenting the union with its termination decision which the union accepted was not the case pleaded and was contrary to the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">The decision to terminate was independently made by BLL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">96 For my own part, I am satisfied that at least the following was the common understanding of the parties in consequence of what I have described as the encounter between Noonan, Lancsar, Hensley and Little on 3 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">It was that the JDA-V negotiations would not continue then unless BLL took immediate action to fix the Bernmar issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">I equally am satisfied that Noonan was applying pressure for a decision to be made by BLL, the more so because the issue was not seen to be one that would, or could, be resolved by the union and Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">As Luketic's evidence made plain, no agreement between Lancsar and himself could be reached at the 31 March meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Importantly, the concern with Bernmar's workforce was not the union's alone and the union was aware of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Hensley acknowledged this both at the 18 March meeting when he said to Sutton and Hensley that he needed some time "to move Bernmar toward legitimacy" and in the proposal he committed to in his letter to Sutton of that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">I am further satisfied that Hensley well understood from late February that the Bernmar issue could disrupt the JDA-V negotiations and it was his wish that those negotiations proceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">97 Both Hensley and Little accepted that, at the 3 April encounter, Noonan did not ask for anything specific to be done at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">It was left to Hensley and Little, hence BLL, to determine what was going to be done in relation to Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">It is not for me to speculate whether Noonan had the hope or expectation that Bernmar's contract would be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">98 When the parties separated after the encounter there was then no arrangement or understanding that Bernmar was to be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">I accept Little's evidence that he and Hensley, at Hensley's instigation, discussed their options but with an appreciation that the matter had been allowed to drift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">I also accept Hensley's evidence that they reviewed what had happened for the preceding six weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Having judged that keeping Bernmar on site was not an option any more, they concluded they had no option but to terminate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">99 I would comment in passing that it can properly be said that BLL contributed significantly to the predicament in which it found itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">BLL's follow up of the 18 March letter seems, on the evidence, slight indeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Responsibility for resolving the workforce issue seems to have been devolved onto Bernmar and the CFMEU with help from Gillingham of the MBA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The seven day time limit passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Further work was given to Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">And no one in BLL, seemingly, assumed responsibility for this matter from 25 March until 2 April (while Little was in New Zealand).</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">It is, in my view, unsurprising that Hensley records his discussion with Little commencing with the observation:
 What have we been doing for the past month?</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">What is going on?</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">This guy is still not complying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">We need to do something about this now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">We can't let this drag on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">100 While Little's version of the discussions attributes to Hensley the comment "How are we going to appease the union", I consider that that comment has to be seen in a context both of relative inaction from BLL when action was promised and of the comment during the discussion attributed by Hensley to Little that "[w]e've given him lots of opportunities to fix things up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">101 It may well have been the case that but for the union's conduct Bernmar may have not been terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">This said, I am not satisfied that the actual decision proposed by Hensley and Little was other than one which resulted from their own evaluation --- albeit in pressured circumstances --- as to what was the appropriate course to take in the circumstances having regard to BLL's own previous action and inaction, their expectation of likely union responses, their continuing concerns about Bernmar's workforce and the advancement of the JDA-V negotiations and BLL's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">I am satisfied that the proposed decision was not simply a response as of course to a demand which they understood was intended to, and did, leave no other choice, and in which they acquiesced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">102 I refer to "the proposed decision" for the reason that the actual decision maker for BLL was Woodcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">As I have noted he did not give evidence and it has not been suggested he was unavailable to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">What is clear is that he was misled by Little as to what the CFMEU "fix it" demand entailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">He was told, erroneously, that the union officials said "the union will go national with this unless we get Bernmar off-site".</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">This, I accept, set the context in which he was told of the proposed termination decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">When he later approved the decision after legal advice was taken, he was told, again erroneously, that the JDA-V negotiations had been resumed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">In my view, considered in context, Woodcock's --- hence BLL's --- termination decision was an understandable response to the threat he was told had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">But that threat was not Noonan's "fix it" demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">103 It is unnecessary that I explore further the significance of the erroneous communications to Woodcock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">My reason for this is that I am not satisfied that Noonan presented BLL, and was at the time understood to be presenting BLL, with a demand to terminate Bernmar and that BLL, either at the time or subsequently, acquiesced in that demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">In consequence I reject the first basis upon which the ACCC has put its claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">104 As to the alternate basis (which the ACCC described in shorthand form as BLL's "counter-offer" which the CFMEU accepted), I have two responses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">First, I agree with the respondents' submission that this was not the case pleaded against them nor was it reflected, in my view, in the manner in which the trial was conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">Secondly, in any event, I am not satisfied that this claim has been made out on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">105 As I have indicated, no demand to terminate was made by Noonan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">BLL was asked to "fix it now" and it made its decision to terminate and Little put in train the processes that would lead to that decision being communicated to Luketic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">I accept that Hensley told Noonan that "[w]e're right to reconvene" which he elaborated by saying "[t]he issue's been resolved" (which for BLL it had been by then).</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">I also am satisfied, despite Hensley's reservation about the matter, that he told Noonan that Bernmar would be gone from the site but time for this was needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Noonan's "You bloody better" comment was, in my view, no more than an emphatic statement indicating in context that the union would hold him to his word that "We're fixing the problem".</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">What occurred was far removed from the realm of making and accepting offers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">BLL took its own step --- and a decisive one at that --- to fix the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">It doubtless anticipated that the union would be satisfied with the solution that was being put into place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">The evidence does not suggest any anticipation that the recommencement of the JDA-V negotiations was contingent upon the union's acceptance of the particular solution adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">BLL had unilaterally set in train the steps necessary to eliminate the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">I agree with the respondents' submission that, in telling Noonan and probably Lancsar of the termination decision, BLL was not offering a solution for the union's consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">It was reporting a decision it had independently made which would fix the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">There was no arrangement reached, or understanding arrived at, such as the ACCC has sought to advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">106 The actual terms of the provisions pleaded by the ACCC are in the alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">I have rejected the termination version propounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">I simply note that there is nothing in the evidence that could found the alternate version of no longer acquiring plasterboard services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">107 I reject the first of the 3 April claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">THE SECOND ALLEGED 3 APRIL 2003 ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING 
 
108 To reiterate, the ACCC's claim here is that by no later than 3 April an arrangement was made or an understanding arrived at containing a provision that BLL would comply with CFMEU's requirement that BLL refrain from acquiring services from Bernmar unless Bernmar's subcontractors were engaged as employees rather than as independent contractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">109 This claim, as I understand it, is relied upon in the event I reject, as I have above, the first 3 April arrangement or understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">The ACCC contends that on the evidence the following has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">(i) It was clear that the union was complaining about BLL's use of Bernmar, as a sub-contractor who in turn employed ABN subcontractors, because Bernmar's workers would not receive ordinary employment entitlements such as superannuation, long service leave and redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">(ii) It was also clear that the union wanted it "fixed"; at the 18 March 2003 meeting, the union wanted it resolved within seven days; by the 3 April 2003 meeting, the union wanted it fixed immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">(iii) There were two ways that BLL could "fix" the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">Either it could persuade Bernmar to cease engaging ABN subcontractors, or it could cease acquiring services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">Either way, it is clear that the union required BLL to refrain from acquiring plasterboard services from Bernmar unless Bernmar's subcontractors were engaged as employees, rather than independent subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">BLL had no contractual relationship with Bernmar's subcontractors and had no way of interfering in those relationships.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">Thus, the first alternative could not be guaranteed of delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">Bernmar did make enquiries as to the preparedness of its subcontractors to be engaged as employees and there was resistance from a majority of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">(iv) On 3 April 2003, BLL agreed to this requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">There was therefore an arrangement or understanding formed on that date containing a provision that BLL would comply with the requirement of the union to refrain from acquiring plasterboard services from Bernmar unless Bernmar's subcontractors were engaged as employees, rather than independent subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">110 This arrangement, it is said, was not an absolute prohibition on the use of Bernmar, because BLL could acquire services from Bernmar if Bernmar's workers became employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">However, a purpose of it was to hinder BLL from continuing to acquire plasterboard services from Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">An objective of the provision was to remove the flexibility of BLL to continue to acquire plasterboard services from Bernmar however Bernmar chose to engage its workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">This conclusion is, it is said, unaffected by any requirements in the contract between BLL and Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">Whilst the requirements existed only in the contract between BLL and Bernmar, it was entirely up to BLL as to whether to enforce those requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">The arrangement imposed the demands of a third party, a stranger to the contract, into the existing contractual relationship between BLL and Bernmar, and removed BLL's ability to choose whether to require Bernmar to have employees only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">111 Put shortly, the respondents contend: (i) The CFMEU and its officers did not at any time require that all of Bernmar's work force be employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">In any event this was already a requirement of BLL's contract with Bernmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">(ii) The CFMEU and its officers, as BLL well knew, were not opposed to the engagement of subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Any opposition expressed was opposition to the engagement by Bernmar of a work force under the guise of subcontractors when in truth and in substance they were employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">BLL in its contract with Bernmar had at least equivalent or more restrictive arrangements or prohibitions on such practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">(iii) The evidence does not establish that Bernmar's workers were in fact subcontractors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">The evidence is to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">BLL was of the view from late February 2003 on the material put before it that Bernmar's workforce were in fact employees and their characterisation as subcontractors was no more than an arrangement or practice designed to avoid award and legislative obligations and/or was a case of treating genuine employees as independent contractors so as to avoid award and legislative obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">112 I do not intend to retraverse the evidence and my previous findings in dealing with this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Much that informs it has been dealt with and rejected in considering the alleged 18 March 2003 arrangement or understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">In dealing with that arrangement or understanding I indicated that the evidence to that date did not reasonably support a finding that the CFMEU demanded that BLL would take steps to ensure that Bernmar's workers were to be engaged as employees as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">I also noted Mr O'Bryan SC's concession in oral submission in response to my questioning that the ACCC was not submitting that Bernmar's workers were to be turned into employees for all purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">113 I have considerable difficulty in seeing how that concession could be made to apply to the present claim which explicitly differentiates between "employees" and "subcontractors".</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Equally the ACCC's written closing submission is premised on the same distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">Accordingly, I will deal with the pleading according to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">114 No less so than with the 18 March arrangement, I am satisfied that there is no evidence reasonably to support the arrangement or understanding presently alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">In light of what I have already said in these reasons, it is unnecessary that I enlarge upon these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">I would, though, reiterate that Hensley, Little and Judd had their own legitimate concerns about Bernmar's workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">Little shared Lancsar's view about the workforce's status in fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">Hensley was of the view that it had the character of body hire and he knew Bernmar had to be moved to legitimacy, that by 3 April Luketic was "still not complying" and that he could not "let this drag on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">The BLL officials were addressing the workforce's terms of engagement, not their formal status as employees or subcontractors as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">The same can properly be said of the union and its officers --- as witness Sutton's statement to Woodcock at the 18 March meeting (as reported by Hensley: see [47] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">115 I reject this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">THE 4 APRIL 2003 ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING 
 
116 I need not refer again to the terms of this alleged arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">As the ACCC indicated in its closing written submission, it could only come into play if BLL did not communicate to the union on 3 April how it intended to fix the Bernmar issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">I have found it was so communicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">It is thus unnecessary to consider this contingent claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">EVIDENCE RULINGS 
 (i) MFI:2 --- Hensley's response to a s 155 notice 
 
117 On 3 December 2004 Hensley provided a written response to a series of questions asked of him by the ACCC in a s 155 notice: see TP Act, s 155.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">One part of his answers --- para (bb) --- related to the 3 April 2003 meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">Mr Inatey SC cross-examined Hensley on a sentence in that part where he said:
 I cannot provide a precise account of what was said, and by whom, at the meeting; 
and on his comment that, after Noonan first spoke to him:
 Mr Noonan, Mr Little and I went into a separate room.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">The latter comment was inconsistent with his witness statement which referred to Lancsar also being present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">However, I would note that, the latter comment apart, Hensley was not cross-examined on the document in relation to what was said or done at the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">118 The ACCC called upon Mr Inatey SC to tender all of the answer in para (bb).</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">I deferred ruling on whether I would admit the paragraph into evidence under s 45 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), but allowed re-examination (over formal objection) on the voir dire relating to the contents of that paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">I did indicate at the time that, if I did not admit para (bb), I would derive no assistance at all in the circumstances from a submission that Hensley's recollections on two occasions were different and Mr Inatey SC accepted that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">However I did indicate that I would admit the sentence following the "precise account" one on which cross-examination occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">It was:
 However, to the best of my knowledge, the following is the substance or effect of what occurred 
119 While the ACCC could properly re-examine Hensley on the parts of para (bb) cross-examined upon pursuant to s 43 , it had no right to require para (bb) to be tendered under s 45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">That section provides:
 45 Production of documents 
 
 (1) This section applies if a party is cross-examining or has cross-examined a witness about: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a prior inconsistent statement alleged to have been made by the witness that is recorded in a document; or 
 
 (b) a previous representation alleged to have been made by another person that is recorded in a document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">
 
 
 
 
 (2) If the court so orders or if another party so requires, the party must produce:
 
 (a) the document;
 
 ...
 
 to the court or to that other party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">(3) The court may:
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) examine a document or evidence that has been so produced; and
 
 (b) give directions as to its use; and
 
 (c) admit it even if it has not been tendered by a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">
 
 
 
 
 (4) Subsection (3) does not permit the court to admit a document or evidence that is not admissible because of Chapter 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">(5) The mere production of a document to a witness who is being cross-examined does not give rise to a requirement that the cross-examiner tender the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">
 

120 As I have indicated, I do not consider that the apparent difference in Hensley's recollection relating to Lancsar's presence at the 3 April encounter in his s 155 answer and then in his statement and evidence is of any particular moment at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">Few have invincible and wholly consistent memories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">I accept that on both occasions Hensley was doing his best.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">The matter said to be inconsistent is of no consequence in the view I take of the evidence in this proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">I see no justification in these circumstances in admitting para (bb) as such into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">(ii) The respondents' affidavits and the s 155 answers 
 
121 As I have indicated, while Sutton and Noonan prepared witness statements which were filed and served, they were not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">The ACCC sought to tender their statements at least to the extent that they contained admissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Again Sutton and Lancsar answered s 155 notices and the ACCC sought to tender admissions said to be contained in their respective answers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">My provisional view at the time, which I then indicated to the parties, was that the statements and s 155 answers were admissible to the extent that they contained admissions of a party in whose case they were to be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">I directed the ACCC in the case of each document to identify the admissions sought to be tendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">In the event these were few in number; they related, primarily, (a) to the respective positions and responsibilities of Sutton, Noonan and Lancsar at the time of the events in question and, in Sutton's case, of the giving of the s 155 answers; (b) to confirmation both of the occurrence and general tenor of conversations with Hensley and of Noonan's concerns regarding Bernmar's subcontractors; and (c) to Lancsar's participation in the 3 April meeting and to his being told that Bernmar's subcontract was to be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">On the view I have taken of the issues in this matter, the evidence sought to be tendered was of peripheral significance (save in relation to proving the respective positions and responsibilities of Sutton, Noonan and Lancsar) and, at best, simply confirmed what I have found to have been otherwise established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">For this reason I do not intend to deal specifically with each of the admissions allegedly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">The statements 
 
122 To formalise my rulings, it is necessary that I deal separately with the witness statements and s 155 answers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">123 The case law in this country is discordant on whether one party to a proceedings can seek to tender admissions made in a witness statement or affidavit filed and served by another party in that proceeding pursuant to rule of court or court order, but who does not call the maker of that statement or read that affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">On one view, the statement or affidavit remains subject to legal professional privilege; on the other, filing and service operates, without more, as a full or limited waiver: see generally Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 at [12] - [19] where the case law has been helpfully reviewed by Gordon J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">124 As I am in entire agreement with the conclusions reached by her Honour on the proper approach to be taken to the question in a case such as the present --- particularly in light of observations made by the Full Court of this Court in Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [25] --- my comments will be brief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">125 I am prepared to assume for present purposes that Sutton and Noonan's communications with the CFMEU's and Noonan's solicitors for the purpose of preparing their statements were confidential communications: cf Cadbury at [11].</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">The statements themselves were filed and served for the purposes of the proceedings pursuant to a number of directions made by Gyles J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">Their service on the ACCC was subject to the implied undertaking given by the parties to the Court not to use any document produced to them in the course of the proceeding otherwise than in relation to the proceeding: see Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">The use proposed by the ACCC in this case raises no issue in relation to the implied undertaking: cf Cadbury at [20]-[22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">The only question arising from that use is one of privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Assuming the statements to be privileged prior to service, whether or not it subsists after their service falls to be determined by the common law and not by the Evidence Act , the provisions of that Act having no applications to a disclosure so made: cf s 122.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">126 As the Full Court observed in Liberty Funding in endorsing the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 958 that a party could tender, as an admission, parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party (at [25]):
 Thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in Austress) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">Their Honours went on to point out (at [26]):
 This so-called "limited waiver" by service such that the privilege is waived only for the purpose of the legal proceedings in question might be seen to be no more than the operation of the implied undertaking dealt with in Harman [and Esso].</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">127 The reasoning of the Full Court, as Gordon J noted in Cadbury at [16], is persuasive and sensible and it leads to the conclusion that, save where a disclosure is made for a particular and limited purpose, the filing and service operates as a complete, and not simply limited, waiver of privilege: at [16]-[18]; for the reason that the uses that may be made of the served document in the proceedings are "inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect": Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">128 I agree with her Honour's view of the approach that Liberty Funding mandates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">It is the implied undertaking, not privilege, which in this case limits the use the ACCC can make of the statements, but that use is not inconsistent with, or precluded by, the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">The tender is in the proceedings in which the statements were served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">129 I should add the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">First, I am satisfied having regard both to his stated position and responsibilities in 2003 and to the manner of his participation in events in this matter, that it is reasonably open to find that Sutton had authority to make representations on behalf of the CFMEU in relation to the matters the subject of his statement: see Evidence Act , s 87(1)(a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">I should emphasise that to the extent that his statement contains admissions, they can only be used against the CFMEU: Evidence Act , s 83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">130 Secondly, I also am satisfied that Hensley's statement can be used against the CFMEU to the extent that it contains admissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">It is reasonably open to find that he had authority to act for the CFMEU in relation to the matters in which he participated and that the representations he made were within the scope of that authority: s 87(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">Such admissions as he made are also able to be used in the case against him personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">The s 155 answers 
 
131 I will assume the answers given to the ACCC by Sutton and Lancsar were confidential in the sense that they were given (a) in relation to one of the limited matters specified in s 155(1) of the TP Act and (b) in furtherance of the performance of the ACCC's functions under the TP Act in relation to those matters, but not otherwise: cf Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Department of Community Services and Health [1989] FCA 384 ; (1990) 22 FCR 73 at 110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">This said, the use proposed to be made of the information so provided falls squarely within the scope of the purpose for which the answers were given, ie the ACCC's enforcement of the Act in respect of an alleged contravention of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">The information was not said to be the subject of any privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">And while the answers were given under compulsion of law: ss 155(5) and (6A); there is no statutory preclusion of their use in civil --- as distinct from criminal: s 155(7) --- proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Accordingly, to the extent that they contain admissions of a party to these proceedings, they are admissible against that party in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act : see ss 81 , 83 and 87 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">CONCLUSION 
 
132 As I am not satisfied that the ACCC has established any of the contraventions of s 45E which it has alleged, no question of the accessorial liability of the first, third and fourth respondents arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">Accordingly I will order that the application be dismissed as it relates to those respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">I also will order that the ACCC pay the costs of those respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-two (132) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>
