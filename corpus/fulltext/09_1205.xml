<sentence id="s0">
 In Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas (No 2) [2009] FCA 1084 ("the judgment") I dismissed the claim of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant sought relief pursuant to Pt A para 7 of the application filed 13 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">After delivering judgment I ordered the parties to file and serve separate submissions as to costs incurred in respect of hearings leading to the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court: s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Two clear issues for determination arise from these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They are: Whether costs should be reserved until the conclusion of the substantive proceedings; and In light of the concession of the applicant that costs should follow the event --- whether the respondents' costs should be awarded on a party-party basis or an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Should costs be reserved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The applicant has submitted that costs should be reserved to the trial of the balance of the proceedings, when the Court will have a more extensive understanding of the parties' conduct, and will be able to form a more informed and balanced view of where costs should ultimately fall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In my view however there is no advantage to either the Court or the successful respondents in reserving costs until this time, nor circumstances justifying such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Following agreement of the parties, the Court had ordered that the claims of the applicant in Pt A para 7 of the application be heard and determined separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The judgment constituted the Court's orders and reasoning in respect of these discrete claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The discretion to be exercised by the Court in relation to these claims relates to matters relevant to these claims, and not to other parts of the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Order 62 rule 3 provides as follows: 
 
 (1) The Court may in any proceeding exercise its powers and discretions as to costs at any stage of the proceeding or after the conclusion of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 

 In Allstate Life Insurance Co and Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 1459 , where the respondents had been successful in meeting appeals dealing with a discrete question and the Court had ordered that the appellants pay the respondents' costs of the appeals, Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ observed: 
 
 [4] The proceeding has been set down for hearing commencing on 18 March 1996 and unless settled may subsist for a substantial time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The litigation is complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is unlikely that final judgment will be given until late 1996 or even later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The successful parties to the appeals before this Court will therefore, in the ordinary course of events, not recover their costs for a long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 

 
 
 [5] It would be wrong if the successful parties do not enjoy the fruits of their order for costs for such a long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The parties entitled to the benefit of the order for costs which this Court has made in appeals from interlocutory orders should not be deprived of that benefit until the case has been finally disposed of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 

 In my view similar principles apply in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The respondents, who were successful in respect of issues arising in relation to Pt A para 7 of the application, have incurred costs to which they are now entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The applicant's claims in the substantive proceedings will not be heard until early 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">There is no justification for leaving a determination of costs arising from the separate hearing of Pt A para 7 of the application until that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Basis of costs award
 The respondents submit that they should both be entitled to an award of costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Troy Thomas
 In relation to Mr Troy Thomas, the applicant submits that there was no basis for a claim that Mr Thomas had incurred separate costs and in any case that an award of costs should not be on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">However the respondents submit that: It is well settled that the purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 , De Alwis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Although the usual rule is that costs be awarded against the unsuccessful party on a party-party basis, the Court has a discretion to award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases: Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 231-234.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Circumstances where the Court may consider awarding costs on an indemnity basis include: While it was clear at the hearings of 11 June 2009 and 22 June 2009 that there was substantial identity of interest between the respondents, nonetheless I accept the submission of the respondents that Mr Troy Thomas incurred costs separately from Mr Rhys Thomas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Further, I consider that there is a sound basis for an order awarding Mr Troy Thomas his costs incurred in these proceedings on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">As I observed in the judgment, notwithstanding that Mr Troy Thomas was required to meet the proceedings, HFAT did not open a case against him, nor did HFAT produce evidence in support of its claims against him in terms of Pt A para 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Indeed, the applicant conceded in its submissions that, given the state of the evidence, there was no sufficient basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to this aspect of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I consider that the claims against Mr Troy Thomas in terms of Pt A para 7 were of the nature described in Colgate-Palmolive (1993) 46 FCR and InterTAN [2005] FCAFC 54 , namely allegations which ought never to have been made, and which had no chance of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Taking this view, and particularly in light of the fact that Mr Troy Thomas was required to take steps to defend himself against the applicant's case including engaging legal representation, I consider that the case against Mr Troy Thomas exhibits special features justifying the Court exercising its discretion to order costs incurred by him to be paid on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr Rhys Thomas
 It was clear throughout the proceedings that the applicant's primary case in respect of the removal of the booking records was against Mr Rhys Thomas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In relation to costs incurred by Mr Rhys Thomas however I do not consider an award of costs on an indemnity basis is warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">I do not consider that the claim against Mr Rhys Thomas had no chance of success or was hopeless or groundless, nor do I consider that the case against him exhibited special features so as to warrant the Court exercising its discretion to award indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I form this view because I consider that: I consider that the appropriate order is that the applicant pay costs incurred by Mr Rhys Thomas on a party-party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
