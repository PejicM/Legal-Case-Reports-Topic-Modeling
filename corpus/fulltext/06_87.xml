<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 9 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Federal Magistrate dismissed as incompetent an application for judicial review which had been filed on 19 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">That application concerned a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 17 June 2003 in which the Tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("the Minister") to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The reason why the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application as incompetent was because he formed the view that the Tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and that the application was filed outside the time limit prescribed in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The decision of the Federal Magistrate was made against a background where the applicant had already litigated, in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court, the issue of whether the Tribunal's decision was attended by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 In my opinion, the Federal Magistrate was correct in dismissing the application as incompetent for the reasons given by his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant has no prospects of succeeding in any appeal if time were extended and leave given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Accordingly, the application to extend time is refused with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Associate:
