 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The present cases are applications for revocation of a patent pursuant to s 138(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the 1990 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The patent claims an enantiomer of a racemate where that racemate was disclosed and claimed by an earlier patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">This has been an issue in relation to other compounds, most recently in two judgments published after the close of evidence and, in one case, after the close of addresses --- the decision of Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 and the decision of the Full Court in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC [2008] FCAFC 82 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Australian Patent 597784 (the patent in suit) was applied for on 4 February 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The patentee is Sanofi-Aventis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Application had been made for international versions of the patent in suit on 17 February and 27 November 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is not contended that the priority date is later than the second of those dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The term of the patent in suit has been extended pursuant to the provisions of Pt 3 of Ch 6 of the 1990 Act by five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Thus, the patent in suit is due to expire on 4 February 2013.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 Each of Apotex Pty Ltd (Apotex) and Spirit Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (Spirit) seeks revocation of the patent in suit on the grounds of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step, not being a manner of manufacture, inutility and false suggestion or misrepresentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Both proceedings were heard together, on the same body of evidence, and one set of reasons will be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Chemical background 
 
4 The title of the invention in the specification is:
 "Dextro-rotatory enantiomer of methyl alpha-5 (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro (3,2-c) thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate, a process for its preparation and the pharmaceutical compositions containing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">" 
5 The compound the subject of claim 1 of the patent in suit has the international non-proprietary name clopidogrel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">After obtaining regulatory approval, a product was launched by Sanofi-Aventis in 1998 under the name Plavix, the active ingredient of which is the bisulfate salt of clopidogrel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It has been very successful commercially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It inhibits platelet aggregation at the site of blood vessel damage and so inhibits thrombus or clot formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is admitted that the applicant Apotex intends to make and sell compositions, the active ingredient of which is clopidogrel bisulfate and, so, would be in breach of claims 1, 3, 10 and 11 of the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The invention relates to organic chemistry, which is concerned with the study of carbon compounds and, in particular, with the stereochemistry of carbon compounds respecting the three dimensional structure of their molecules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Isomers are compounds whose molecules consist of the same number and kind of atoms but differ in their structure or arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Material that rotates the plane of polarised light is said to be optically active.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The means of identifying compounds which have that property is by shining the plane of polarised light through a sample of the compound dissolved in an appropriate solvent then measuring the extent of the rotation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">7 If the compound displays optical activity, this indicates that the chemical structure of the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That property is called "chirality" and the molecule is described as "chiral".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">An organic compound is said to have a chiral centre if it includes a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">If the structure of a molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image, the mirror image must be a different molecule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In each case of optical activity of a pure compound there are two, and only two, isomers called enantiomers, which differ in structure such that the arrangements of their atoms in space are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties except in two important respects: they rotate the plane of polarised light in opposite directions, though in equal amounts; and they interact in different ways with other chiral compounds, including reacting with them at different rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The isomer which rotates the plane of polarised light to the left (counter clockwise) is called the levo isomer, or levo-rotatory or L- enantiomer, and is designated (-), while the one that rotates the plane of polarised light to the right (clockwise) is called the dextro isomer, or dextro-rotatory or D - enantiomer, and is designated (+).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">8 Although a pure compound is always optically active if it is composed of chiral molecules, a mixture of equal amounts of enantiomers are optically inactive since the equal and opposite rotations cancel each other out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">A mixture which is comprised of equal amounts of two enantiomers is often designated by the prefix (+/-).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Such mixtures are called racemic mixtures or racemates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The separation of a racemic mixture into its two optically active enantiomers is called a resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The racemate has the same chemical formula as each enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">9 There is a debate as to the common general knowledge as to resolving the enantiomers of a racemic mixture in Australia at the priority date of the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I shall return to that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 In broad terms, the salt of a chemical compound can be formed by combining an acid with a base --- an acidic compound is characterised by its ability to donate a proton to its surroundings whereas a basic compound is characterised by its ability to accept a proton from its surroundings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Salts may form a crystalline compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 Issues that are critical in relation to pharmaceutical drugs include efficacy, tolerance and toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">These refer to the pharmacological properties of a compound, ie, the operation of the compound in vivo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This invention is applied to biological systems which are composed of chiral molecules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Because enantiomers interact with other chiral molecules in different ways, they will often behave differently in biological systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">This can result in their having different physiological effects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">An enantiomer may also undergo racemization (that is, convert to a 1:1 mixture of both enantiomers) in vivo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Patent in suit 
 
12 The body of the specification commences as follows:
 "The compound of the invention corresponds to the following formula (I): 
 
 
 in which the C* is an asymmetric carbon atom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In fact, this formula represents both the dextro-rotatory molecule claimed as well as its levo-rotatory enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The racemic mixture corresponding to this formula [PCR 4099] was described in the French patent application published under the No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">2 530 247.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Hereafter the dextro-rotatory enantiomer claimed according to the invention will be designated by Id and the levo-rotatory enantiomer by Il.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is known that the optical rotatory power of a compound depends on the solvent in which it is measured and on its concentration in this solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The optical rotatory power of the dextro-rotatory isomer according to the invention is positive in methanolic solution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In an unexpected manner only the dextro-rotatory enantiomer Id exhibits a platelet aggregation inhibiting activity, the levo-rotatory enantiomer Il being inactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Moreover, the inactive levo-rotatary enantiomer Il is the less well tolerated of the two enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The invention also relates to the addition salts of the compounds of formula (Id) with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">" 
13 The specification then outlines in detail the production of certain salts of the compound, methods of separating the enantiomers, converting them to salt and then the determination of the enantiomic purity of each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Discussion of a pharmacological study follows, introduced thus:
 "The platelet aggregation inhibiting activity and the toxicity of these new compounds was compared to those of the racemic mixture described in the French patent No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">82.12599 (Publication No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">2 530 247) [PCR 4099].</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">A description will now be given of the results of this study which demonstrates another advantage of the invention, namely that the salts of the dextro-rotatory isomer have a better therapeutic index than the salt of the racemic mixture; in fact, the levo-rotatory isomer exhibits almost no platelet aggregation inhibiting activity and its toxicity is markedly higher than that of its dextro-rotatory homologue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">) 
14 The conclusions included the following:
 "The results obtained for the aggregation with ADP for the hydrochloride of the racemic mixture (PCR 4099), the hydrogen sulfates of the dextro-rotatory (SR 25990 C) and levo-rotatory (SR 25989 C) isomers on the one hand, and for PCR 4099 and the hydrochlorides of the dextro-rotatory (SR 25990 A) and levo-rotatory (SR 25989 A) on the other, are shown in Table 1; they demonstrate that the levo-rotatory isomer is inactive and that the dextro-rotatory isomer is at least as active as the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">" "For the aggregation with collagen, the percentage of inhibition is the difference of the slopes of the curves representing the variation of the optical density as a function of time for the control and the product to be tested divided by the slope for the control multiplied by 100.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The results shown in Table II demonstrate again that only the dextro-rotatory isomer is active whereas the salts have comparable activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">" "The results which are presented in Table III show that the levo-rotatory isomer is inactive in this test, in contrast to the dextro-rotatory isomer and the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">" "The number of dead animals was determined 14 days after the administration of the compound under study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The lethal doses thus determined, expressed in weight of the salt administered, are presented in Table IV; these results show on the one hand that the toxicity of the racemic mixture is similar to that of the levo-rotatory isomer whereas the dextro-rotatory isomer is markedly less toxic, and, on the other hand, that the toxicity depends on the nature of the acid used to form the salt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">" "The pharmacological study just presented has demonstrated the interesting inhibitory properties towards platelet aggregation of the compound Id and the absence of any activity of its isomer Il.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">" "On account of its interesting inhibitory properties towards platelet aggregation and its interference in the mechanism of formation of arterial and venous thromboses, the medicine of the invention can be usefully administered in the treatment and prevention of platelet disorders due to extracorporeal blood circuits or the consequence of complications in atheroma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">" 
15 The significant claims for this case are:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Dextro-rotatory isomer of methyl alpha-5 (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro (3,2-c) thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
... 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Hydrogen sulfate of the dextro-rotatory isomer of methyl alpha-5 (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro (3,2-c) thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl) -acetate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
... 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Process for the preparation of the compound according to Claim 1, comprising the formation of a salt of racemic methyl alpha-5 (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro (3,2-c) thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl)-acetate with an optically active acid in a solvent, repeated recrystallizations of the salt are carried out until a product of constant optical rotatory power is obtained, then the dextro-rotatory isomer is liberated from its salt by a base and, if necessary, salt formation is carried out with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">" 
 
 French patent and development of clopidogrel 
 
16 The French patent application referred to in the specification in suit was filed in July 1982 by Sanofi-Aventis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Its title was "New derivatives of thieno (3,2-c) pyridine, process for their preparation and their therapeutic application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The specification commenced as follows:
 "This invention relates to new thieno [3,2-c] pyridines, to a process for their preparation and to their therapeutic applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The new derivatives of this invention have the following general formula: in which: Y represents the OH group or an OR group in which R is a straight or branched lower alkyl radical, or Y represents a group in which R1 and R2 are each independently of each other hydrogen or a straight or branched lower alkyl group; or RI and R2 form together and with the nitrogen to which they are attached a heterocycle which may include a second heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, wherein the latter may be substituted by a lower alkyl or benzyl radical which may be substituted; and X represents hydrogen, a halogen or a lower alkyl radical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">These compounds having an asymmetrical carbon may exist in the form of two enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The invention relates both to each enantiomer and their mixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">) 
Example number 1 (said to be non-limiting) was given, amongst others, to illustrate the invention as follows:
 "Methyl &#945; - [4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno [3,2-c]-5-pyridyl]-o. chlorophenylacetate (R1 = -CH3;X = 2-Cl) derivative No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">" 
A method of preparing that compound is then set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">17 After giving other examples, the specification went on:
 "The results of pharmacological and toxicological tests reported below demonstrate the properties of the derivatives of the invention both in terms of toxicity and tolerance, and the activity levels of the derivatives, especially their inhibiting action on blood-platelet aggregation and anti-thrombotic activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Thus, the invention also relates to a therapeutic composition having in particular an inhibiting action on blood-platelet aggregation and anti-thrombotic action, wherein the active ingredient is a derivative of the formula (I) or an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acid if Y represents the groups OR or 
18 and with a mineral base if Y is OH.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">"
 

 
 
Various investigations were then reported (including in relation to derivative 1) and it was said:
 "The toxicological and pharmacological investigations reported above demonstrate the low toxicity of the compounds of the invention, as well as their excellent tolerance and their inhibiting properties on blood-platelet aggregation, and their anti-thrombotic activity, which make them very useful in medical therapeutic applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">" 
19 Claims 1, 8 and 14 were as follows:
 "1 --- Compounds having the formula: in which Y represents the OH group or an OR group in which R is a straight or branched lower alkyl radical, or Y represents a group in which RI and R2 are each independently of each other hydrogen or a straight or branched lower alkyl group; or R1 and R2 form together and with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a heterocycle which may include a second heteroatom such as oxygen or nitrogen, wherein the latter may be substituted by a lower alkyl or benzyl radical which may be substituted; and X represents hydrogen, a halogen or a lower alkyl radical; and their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable or organic acids if Y represents OR groups or or with mineral bases if Y represents OH, as well as the two enantiomers or their mixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">... 8 --- Methyl &#945; (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno (3,2-c)-5-pyridyl)-0. chlorophenyl-acetate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">(derivative ndeg.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">... 14 --- Therapeutic composition having blood-platelet aggregation inhibiting activities and anti-thrombotic activities containing as active ingredient a derivative of the formula (I) as claimed in Claim 1, or an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acid or with mineral bases, as well as one of the two enantiomers or their mixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">) 
20 Example 1 or derivative 1, the subject of claim 8, corresponds with the formula in the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The racemic mixture was known internally at Sanofi-Aventis as PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Patents corresponding to the French patent were also granted in Canada (Canadian Patent No 1,194,875 (the Canadian patent), Australia (Australian Patent No 554358 (the '358 patent) and the United States (US Patent No 4,529,596 (the US patent)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">These four patents are relied upon as the prior art patents in these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">21 A brief chronology of the development of clopidogrel is as follows:
 
(1) In 1972 Sanofi-Aventis commenced research on thienopyridines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">(2) Sanofi-Aventis was granted various patents around the world, including Australian patent 473141 with a priority date 1 February 1973, for compounds which included ticlopidine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Ticlopidine was launched in France in 1978 and in Australia in 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Subsequent to launch, Sanofi-Aventis became aware of reports of rare but potentially fatal side effects in some patients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">(3) After the discovery of ticlopidine in 1972, Sanofi-Aventis continued to research other potentially valuable thienopyridines in the hope of finding a compound with better platelet aggregation inhibiting properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">(4) In 1975, Sanofi-Aventis synthesised a thienopyridine compound which it identified as PCR 1033.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Unlike ticlopidine, PCR 1033 was a racemic compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Testing of the racemic compound PCR 1033 indicated that it was a more active platelet aggregation inhibitor than ticlopidine but that it caused trembling, convulsions and even deaths in test animals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">(5) In March 1978, Mr Badorc, an employee of Sanofi-Aventis under the direction of Dr Maffrand, succeeded in separating the enantiomers of PCR 1033.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The levo-rotatory enantiomer was named PCR 3071 and the dextro-rotatory enantiomer was named PCR 3072.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">(6) The results of animal testing of the enantiomers of PCR 1033 indicated that PCR 3071 had anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic activity while PCR 3072 was inactive, but that PCR 3071 was too toxic to be tested in humans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In early 1981, further work on PCR 3071 was abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">(7) In about 1978, Sanofi-Aventis synthesised another racemic thienopyridine compound identified as PCR 3549.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It was very similar in structure to PCR 1033.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Testing of the racemic compound PCR 3549 demonstrated platelet inhibiting activity and tolerance which was better than PCR 1033, but not as favourable as ticlopidine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">A decision was made to separate the enantiomers of PCR 3549.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Mr Badorc undertook the exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">(8) Mr Badorc's attempts to separate the enantiomers by the diastereomeric salt formation technique failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He ultimately obtained the enantiomers by means of the asymmetric synthesis process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The enantiomers were named PCR 3620 and PCR 3621 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Testing of those enantiomers indicated that the activity of each enantiomer was similar to that of the racemate and indicated no advantage over the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">(9) From about 1976, Sanofi-Aventis commenced synthesising compounds with a more complicated functional group than PCR 1033 and PCR 3549.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">A series of such compounds was synthesised and tested and ultimately, in July 1980, Sanofi-Aventis synthesised the racemic compound PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Test results indicated that PCR 4099 was better tolerated and more effective than ticlopidine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In total, 21 compounds of the same formula were synthesised by Sanofi-Aventis, all of which were referred to as examples in the Canadian patent and the Australian '358 patent (as well as the other prior art patents).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">(10) The test results for the compounds as reported in the prior art patents indicated no toxicity problems and effectiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">In 1982 Sanofi-Aventis determined to develop PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The prior art patents were obtained, in the case of the Australian '358 patent, with a priority date of 13 July 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">PCR 4099 is the compound identified in Example 1 of the prior art patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(11) PCR 4099 underwent development and testing in and after 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Between 1983 and 1985 there were reports of side effects in some animals and, in particular, convulsions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Between 1983 and 1987, acute and long term toxicity tests of PCR 4099 were undertaken in rats, mice and baboons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Phase I studies in human volunteers had been carried out as a precursor to obtaining regulatory approval to permit the sale of PCR 4099 as a therapeutic compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">(12) In or about November 1985, Dr Maffrand decided that Sanofi-Aventis should attempt to obtain the enantiomers of PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">This decision was made in the light of the adverse side effects which test results for PCR 4099 were reporting by that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">(13) Between November 1985 and February 1986 Mr Badorc unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the separate enantiomers of PCR 4099 by means of asymmetric synthesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">(14) Mr Badorc then attempted diastereomeric salt formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">There is debate about the precise order of events but, on 21 March 1986, Mr Badorc carried out an experiment in which he added 9.95 g (0.0397 mole) of dextro-rotatory camphor-l0-sulfonic acid to a solution of 32 g (0.0994 mole) of PCR 4099 in a solution of 150 ml of acetone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Crystals appeared within 48 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The concentration of PCR 4099 to solvent in that experiment was significantly higher than in all of the earlier experiments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">(15) Subsequent analysis demonstrated that that experiment produced the levo-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">On 8 April 1986 Mr Badorc obtained the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 after making levo-rotatory camphor-10-sulfonic acid and using that as the chiral resolving agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">(16) The method for obtaining the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 (later named clopidogrel) specified in the patent in suit is the method employed on 21 March 1986 described above, with the exception that the patent specifies the use of levo-rotatory camphor-10-sulfonic acid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">(17) The preliminary tests of clopidogrel were performed using the form of its hydrochloride salt as obtained by Mr Badorc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">This salt was suitable for testing but was unstable and difficult to formulate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In particular, it was hygroscopic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">(18) Subsequently, the hydrobromide, hydrogen sulfate and taurochlorate salts of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">(19) The enantiomers were then tested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">A review of the test results indicated to Dr Maffrand that the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 had all of the activity and the levo-rotatory enantiomer had no activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The initial pharmacology tests indicated that the levo-rotatory enantiomer was less well tolerated than the dextro-rotatory enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The dextro-rotatory enantiomer was named clopidogrel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Subsequent acute toxicology testing indicated that the inactive enantiomer was more than twice as toxic as the active enantiomer and caused convulsions in test animals which the active enantiomer did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">(20) Application was made for the international versions of the patent in suit on 17 February 1987 and a convention application for the patent in suit was made on 4 February 1988 with the international filing date priority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">(21) In mid to late 1987, further toxicological testing was undertaken in respect of PCR 4099, its levo-rotatory enantiomer and clopidogrel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">This testing provided further confirmation that PCR 4099 and the levo-rotatory enantiomer caused convulsions but clopidogrel did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In about April 1987 it was decided to abandon further development work on PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">(22) Phase I human testing of clopidogrel commenced in December 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">After obtaining regulatory approval, it was launched in 1998 under the name Plavix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Common general knowledge 
 
22 The common general knowledge relevant to these cases encompasses, in broad terms, that which was known by 1987 in relation to the following aspects of organic chemistry by the hypothetical skilled but not inventive worker in the field in Australia:
 
(1) The fundamental principles of stereochemistry;
 
(2) Methods for obtaining individual enantiomers from a racemate;
 
(3) The formation of salts of stereochemical compounds for pharmaceutical purposes;
 
(4) The biological/pharmacological activity and toxicity of stereochemical compounds and the ability to predict same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">23 Several expert witnesses gave evidence relevant to the assessment of the state of the common general knowledge.</sentence>

<sentence id="s163">27 Before commencing that analysis, it should be noted in relation to issue 1 that the fundamentals of stereochemistry were outlined at the hearing through two tutorials, one prepared by Dr Watson for the applicants, the other by Professor Easton for Sanofi-Aventis, the latter including comments on the applicants' tutorial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Despite the areas of disagreement identified in those comments, the fundamental principles of stereochemistry were not relevantly in dispute between the parties.</sentence>

28 Dr Watson obtained a Bachelor of Science with Honours in chemistry from Monash University in 1969.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">He obtained a PhD in chemistry from Monash University in 1973.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Between 1973 and 1977, Dr Watson occupied postdoctoral positions in chemistry at Imperial College in London and the CSIRO in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">His postdoctoral work involved chemical synthesis of derivatives of natural product molecules for testing in biological systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Between 1977 and 1986, Dr Watson worked as a Research Officer, and later Senior Research Officer, and from 1987 (to 1991) as Senior Principal Research Scientist, at ICI Australia Central Research Laboratories, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Dr Watson's work at ICI focused on the development and commercialisation of selective herbicides, and a drug to treat heart disease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">These appointments had involved the application of synthetic organic chemistry to the preparation of small molecules with biological activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Dr Watson's experience up to 1987 had principally been in the area of herbicides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Since 1972, Dr Watson has attended conferences, in Australia and overseas, relevant to his field of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Dr Watson has also regularly read books and journals relevant to the field of stereochemistry during his career.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In 1987, Dr Watson was approximately 40 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">(1) Dr Watson was taught the fundamentals of stereochemistry during undergraduate studies in the 1960s, hence those underlying concepts were well known to Dr Watson before 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Prior to 1987, Dr Watson had a good working knowledge of the principles of stereochemistry and (relevant also to issue 2) of techniques for resolving racemates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">There have been no significant changes in the science of stereochemistry since 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 
 (2) (i) Prior to 1987, Dr Watson was aware of several techniques for obtaining single enantiomers from racemates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Diastereomeric salt formation (including of the kind undertaken by Mr Badorc in relation to PCR 4099) was in 1987 and is today a well known and routine technique for obtaining enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">That technique had been described in the chemical literature well before 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Dr Watson could have performed the technique of diastereomeric salt formation prior to 1987, and had done so in 1976, though only on that one occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">(ii) Dr Watson would have used diastereomeric salt formation as the first technique for obtaining enantiomers as it was the simplest approach, and would have expected a yield sufficient for analytical testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Dr Watson did indicate that during his work in relation to herbicides, synthesis of the relevant active enantiomer had been the preferred method given the large commercial quantities required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Dr Watson distanced himself, however, both from the suggestion that asymmetric synthesis is a "separation" technique as such, and from the view that diastereomeric salt formation would be difficult and impractical on an industrial scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Dr Watson compared the two methods by saying that, while limited methods for an asymmetric synthesis were available prior to 1987, at that stage diastereomeric salt formation was a tried and true method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">A risk of racemisation of the order seen in relation to PCR 4099 would not have dissuaded Dr Watson from using diastereomeric salt formation in relation to that compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">All of that said, the respondent did highlight certain comments made by Dr Watson during cross-examination that appeared to cast some doubt on his enthusiasm in relation to the process of diastereomeric salt formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">(iii) Prior to 1987, when determining which chiral acid/amine and which solvent to use as part of the diastereomeric salt formation process, Dr Watson would have begun by consulting the literature for those used previously for resolving similar compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Had no useful information been available, Dr Watson would have consulted a list of standard readily available chiral acids/amines and run parallel experiments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Parallel experimentation was a common salt formation procedure prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The use of camphor-10-sulfonic acid for resolution was not new in 1987; rather, it was well known and had been described in chemical literature before that time, which literature was in Dr Watson's personal library.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Further, acetone was a well known, widely used and readily available solvent for resolution prior to 1987, and the choice to use it as part of the diastereomeric salt formation process was not new in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">(iv) Dr Watson considered resolution to be generally a relatively fast process, and that one would be able to determine fairly quickly whether the reaction had succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">As to the timeframe required for obtaining a yield, Dr Watson deposed variously that hours or days at most, rather than months or years, would be required, and that obtaining small quantities of enantiomers usually takes no more than several weeks, with industrial quantities perhaps requiring several months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The latter reference to several weeks was said by the respondent to cast doubt on the former estimate of hours or days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The latter estimate was sought to be explained by Apotex as being a response only to an estimate by Mr Badorc of the time required for the "whole process" rather than the time for "reactions", which may take hours or days only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Dr Watson stated that, if crystals had not developed within a few days for a particular experiment, he would have tried another experiment (in parallel) with a different chiral acid/amine and solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Dr Watson considered that one would expect to succeed with perseverance with the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">
 

(3) Hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, which are likely to lead to the formation of good hydrochloric and hydrogen sulfate salt crystals respectively, are the most common acids found in chemistry laboratories and are used routinely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Their salts were very commonly made before 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 (4) (i) Approximately a two-fold increase in activity from racemate to enantiomer would have been expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">That was sufficiently significant to have compelled the separation and testing of the single enantiomers of a racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">One would expect one enantiomer to have most or all of the activity and the other to have little or no activity, and examples of compounds displaying such properties were to be found in the literature prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Dr Watson would have obtained and tested the single enantiomers rather than investigating other compounds in the class of compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">(ii) Dr Watson considered that, absent literature information about a particular compound, it is impossible to predict the toxicity of enantiomers before testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">A more physiologically active compound would not necessarily be more toxic, physiological activity not necessarily being related to toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">(iii) Dr Watson considered pharmacological testing of enantiomers to be a more accurate method for determining their characteristics than a theoretical approach based on molecular modelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Dr Watson did consider, however, that the properties of salts of racemates can be a useful guide to the properties of enantiomers.</sentence>

 Professor Banwell 
 
29 Professor Banwell obtained a Bachelor of Science with Honours from The Victoria University, Wellington in 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">He obtained a PhD in organic chemistry from The Victoria University, Wellington in 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Between 1979 and 1987, Professor Banwell held academic appointments in organic chemistry at universities in Australia and overseas, including the Ohio State University, the University of Adelaide, the University of Auckland and the University of Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">These appointments involved lecturing, student research supervision and Professor Banwell's own research into the synthesis of novel organic molecules, including biologically active molecules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">During this period, Professor Banwell was also involved with asymmetric synthesis, including supervision of PhD students in that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Prior to and after 1987, Professor Banwell would consult scientific literature, attend conferences and meetings, and review patent literature in order to remain familiar with development in the relevant field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In 1987, Professor Banwell was approximately 33 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">(1) Professor Banwell was taught the fundamental principles of stereochemistry as an undergraduate student in the 1970s and possessed at that time copies of leading stereochemistry texts used to teach undergraduate students.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">There have been no significant changes in the science of stereochemistry since 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">
 
 (2) (i) Professor Banwell considered that, from 1982 onwards (during his period of teaching), undergraduate and postgraduate chemistry students were well aware of many of the available methods for separating racemates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Professor Banwell had supervised upper level undergraduate and honours students in undertaking separations on multiple occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Professor Banwell was himself capable, prior to 1987, of applying his knowledge of resolution techniques in a laboratory setting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">(ii) Prior to 1987, Professor Banwell would have employed the diastereomeric salt formation technique to separate out the enantiomers of a racemic mixture that displayed relevant functionality, but the identity of the active enantiomer of which he did not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The process of diastereomeric salt formation was a relatively straightforward method and was described in leading chemistry textbooks prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">He understood at that time that diastereomeric salt formation was an efficient process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Professor Banwell also queried whether asymmetric synthesis was a technique for "separation" of enantiomers as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">(iii) When resolving a chiral base, Professor Banwell would have selected the chiral acid by consulting the literature in relation to acids previously used to resolve similar compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Professor Banwell was familiar with camphor-10-sulfonic acid prior to 1987 and considered it to be a "classic acid".</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">He expected that both of its enantiomeric forms would have been commercially available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Professor Banwell would have known how to prepare a chiral form of camphor-10-sulfonic acid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Professor Banwell would have consulted the literature in relation to the choice of solvent when undertaking diastereomeric salt formation; while the selection would hinge on the compound to be resolved, Professor Banwell commonly used ethanol, methanol, acetone and water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Professor Banwell would have run various experiments in parallel, that being a straightforward approach with which he had experience prior to 1987 and which would have taken less than an hour to set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">(iv) Results from diastereomeric salt formation would have been expected within minutes or, at most, days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Had Professor Banwell sought to obtain the enantiomers by reacting the diastereomeric salts with a strong (mineral) base and undertaking repeated crystallisations until the desired enantiomeric purity had been reached, that technique (also well developed prior to 1987) would have yielded an outcome in days or weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 

(3) If attempting to formulate a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an amine that was in the form of an oil, Professor Banwell would have consulted the literature for commonly used acids for salt formation of similar compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Prior to 1987, the salts described in claims 2---5 of the patent in suit were well known to Professor Banwell and the acids required to produce them were readily available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">(4) By 1974 or 1975, Professor Banwell well understood that enantiomers often exhibit different biological activity, including therapeutic activity and toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Professor Banwell cited the example of thalidomide as representing the potentially different activity of enantiomers, and taught undergraduate students from 1982 onwards about the thalidomide example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It became clear during cross-examination of Professor Banwell that the thalidomide example was not in fact supportive of the general proposition that one enantiomer of a pair may have all the activity and the other may be completely inactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The thalidomide example in fact demonstrated simply that each enantiomer of a pair may exhibit substantially different activity; in the case of thalidomide, one enantiomer was found to possess the bulk of the therapeutic sedative effects, while the other possessed all of the negative teratogenic effects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">By 1979, Professor Banwell understood that no direct relationship exists between desired biological activity of each of a pair of enantiomers and their toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It would have been no surprise to Professor Banwell at that time if most of the desired activity was present in one enantiomer and most of the toxicity in the other.</sentence>

<sentence id="s248">Between 1974 and 1984, Professor Jarrott worked as Senior Lecturer, and in 1984 was appointed a Reader, in the Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutic Unit in the Department of Medicine of the Austin Hospital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">From 1978 to 1992, Professor Jarrott was involved in research at the University of Melbourne concerning the mechanisms of action of drugs that block the binding of transmitters to receptors in arteries, heart muscle and the brain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">From 1976 to 1990, he was part of a research team working on the development of beta-blockers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Professor Jarrott's research into cardiovascular hypertension required regular analysis and testing of the biological properties of chiral compounds, including the pharmacological properties of individual enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Professor Jarrott stated that his involvement with drug development work would begin after chemists had isolated a compound or compounds with interesting biological activity in relation to a therapeutic target, and after preliminary in vitro testing for activity and toxicity had been conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Professor Jarrott was involved in selecting the most active compounds for further investigation, and thereafter in producing sufficient efficacy data to enable registration of the compound with the Therapeutic Goods Administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In 1987, Professor Jarrott was approximately 44 years of age.</sentence>

<sentence id="s259">Professor Jarrott was aware of the technique of diastereomeric salt formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">It was a known, well developed and fairly routine separation method prior to 1987 that was often taught to undergraduate science students.</sentence>

<sentence id="s263">
 
 (4) (i) Professor Jarrott has well understood since he was an undergraduate student in the 1960s that enantiomers can exhibit different biological activity (therapeutic activity and toxicity).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Prior to 1987, Professor Jarrott would have expected different pharmacological activity from each enantiomer in relation to the relevant receptor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Professor Jarrott understood prior to 1987 that similar activity in each of a pair of enantiomers is quite unusual and that, more commonly, one enantiomer will be more active than the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">According to Professor Jarrott, the difference in activity would quite commonly be two-fold, and that approximately that difference would have been expected, however at one point Professor Jarrott stated that he would have expected at least a 10-fold difference in activity between the enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It would have been unexpected to him had two enantiomers of the same compound displayed the same activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Equally, it was Professor Jarrott's understanding prior to 1987 that the less active enantiomer generally exhibits some activity and is rarely completely inactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">(ii) Professor Jarrott deposed that, while the level of toxicity of an enantiomer is difficult to predict before separation and testing, toxicity is no more likely in the pharmacologically active enantiomer than the inactive enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Prior to 1987, Professor Jarrott would have expected toxicity levels to differ between enantiomers.</sentence>

<sentence id="s290">Resolution techniques were well known and proven prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Professor Rae deposed that by 1987, it was not necessary to conduct extensive experimentation to undertake diastereomeric salt formation, as there were well known and established protocols for the process, which a chemist could work through and apply in a routine manner.</sentence>

<sentence id="s295">(iii) Professor Rae would have used diastereomeric salt formation as a means of obtaining enantiomers, consulting the literature when choosing the resolving acid and being likely in that regard to opt for the cheapest acids readily available to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Choices of resolving acid (or base) could readily be assisted by relevant literature, which was owned by Professor Rae prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">When using diastereomeric salt formation, Professor Rae would have expected a yield sufficient to allow activity analysis of the enantiomer obtained.</sentence>

(3) Professor Rae variously deposed that a yield could be expected to be known within a few days, and that it would generally take up to a few weeks to obtain a particular enantiomer by resolution, but not months or years.</sentence>

<sentence id="s330">(ii) At the publication dates of the prior art patents, Professor Scammells would not necessarily have attempted to obtain the individual enantiomers of a racemate in an effort to increase activity, but rather would have opted for a wider structure-activity study of the relevant class of compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">(iii) The choice of chiral acid/base and solvent in diastereomeric salt formation was in 1987 and is now a matter of trial and error, with the price and ease of obtaining any acid being relevant factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Camphor-10-sulfonic acid was one acid among many that might be suitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Likewise, acetone is a common solvent but there is a range of other common solvents, as well as certain solvent mixtures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">(iv) There is a spectrum of difficulty in obtaining single enantiomers of racemates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">An attempt to obtain the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 in 1987 would have been a matter of trial and error, with no ability to predict success using any particular method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The process of diastereomeric salt formation would not have a fixed likely duration and could encompass a first-time success, a process lasting weeks and a complete lack of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">
 

(3) Professor Scammells did not appear to direct comments relevantly to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">
 
 (4) (i) At the publication dates of the prior art patents, it was known that one enantiomer of a pair may be more therapeutically active than the other, but it was not possible to predict activity without testing, except by knowledge of the structure of the intended receptor, which knowledge was and is scarce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Even knowledge of the intended receptor in the present cases would not necessarily have enabled predictions to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">(ii) Professor Scammells stated that, if one enantiomer has all the therapeutic activity, the greatest increase in activity to be achieved by its separation from the racemate would be two-fold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">A greater increase would be fairly surprising but could be possible where one enantiomer is blocking the activity of the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">It may also be that each enantiomer will display therapeutic activity, but that the activity will differ in nature between the enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">(iii) Prior to 1987, it was known that one enantiomer may be more toxic than the other, though that may not necessarily be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">It was not possible to predict toxicity, including on the basis of therapeutic activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">
 
 Summary 
 
34 The differences between the witnesses on the state of common general knowledge are not great, and to an extent arise from their different qualifications and experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">I am satisfied that a synthesis of their evidence gives a sound idea of the state of relevant knowledge in Australia in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">At that time, the relevant knowledge was principally academic as there was little evidence as to local pharmaceutical drug development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I am satisfied that these witnesses represent a fair cross-section of the knowledge that was available at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">I am also satisfied that the common features of their evidence are at a reasonably basic level, albeit in a complex field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">35 On the basis of the foregoing, the following emerges as indicative of the state of the common general knowledge in the relevant field in Australia by 1987 in relation to each of the four issues:
 
(1) The principles of stereochemistry were well known prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">They, as well as information concerning techniques for obtaining enantiomers, were taught to undergraduate students, and university students more generally, from the 1960s through to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">There have been no significant changes in the science of stereochemistry since 1987, though certain advances have been made in the understanding and application of certain techniques for obtaining enantiomers, asymmetric synthesis being an example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">
 
 (2) (i) A range of techniques for obtaining enantiomers from a racemate was well known prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Information concerning those techniques, and in particular diastereomeric salt formation, were taught to undergraduate students from the 1960s, though this may not always have involved practical experimentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Asymmetric synthesis was also a known technique, though query whether it was to be understood as a "separation" technique.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">(ii) Prior to 1987, diastereomeric salt formation was a well developed method, which was straightforward and routine, though involving choices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Those choices included choices of chiral resolving agent (acid or base as required) and solvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The variety of choices in that regard, as well as certain other factors, meant that the process may well involve trial and error experimentation carrying no guarantee of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">That was, however, not such as to take the process beyond routine experimentation, including in respect of parallel experimentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Though a choice certainly existed in the drug development process as to whether to obtain enantiomers by diastereomeric salt formation or, say, asymmetric synthesis instead, or indeed simply to undertake a wider structure-activity study in the relevant class of compounds, diastereomeric salt formation was certainly a prominent, widely used and well developed technique prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">It is clear that many would have elected to use that technique as a first step, though there was obvious disagreement on that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Though not without certain difficulties, the process had been known and reported to yield results, though not necessarily in relation to thienopyridine compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">(iii) As to the resolving acid or base, and solvent, there were clearly choices to be made in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Guidance could be gained from the literature, though principally, it would appear, where similar compounds had already been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Lists of standard chiral acids and amines were also available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Camphor-10-sulfonic acid was known as a chiral resolving agent prior to 1987 and its use was not new.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Its commercial availability in both enantiomeric forms was perhaps not certain, though it was possible to prepare a chiral form of the acid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Acetone was a well known and commonly used solvent prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Further variables such as the temperature at which the experiment was conducted, the sealing and shape of the reaction vessel, the concentration of racemate to reagent and solvent respectively, the amount of solvent present and the room temperature, were variables to be dealt with as part of the normal experimentation process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">As Apotex alluded to in its submissions, details as to those variables did not appear to warrant particular focus in the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">(iv) The time that might be expected to elapse before obtaining a yield from the diastereomeric salt formation process, was a matter of some difference of opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">What appears to emerge is that there is no fixed likely duration for such a process and, indeed, no ability to predict with certainty whether one will be successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">The process may involve immediate success (most likely meaning days) or may be drawn out over weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Months or years would not be expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The process may also be without success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The process involves trial and error and may require perseverance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Yields may be obtained that are sufficient for analysis of the activity of an enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">
 

(3) The formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of both racemates and enantiomers, including those in the form of an oil, was a common process prior to 1987, the techniques for which were known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">There was a choice to be made in relation to which salt would be made, that process involving trial and error, and hence a choice in terms of acid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Hydrochloric and sulfuric acids were, however, common laboratory acids and were used to make pharmaceutical salts prior to 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">
 
 (4) (i) It was well understood prior to 1987 that enantiomers can exhibit different biological activity and toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The thalidomide example had clearly provided a cautionary tale in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">It was not possible without separation and testing to predict with certainty the activity or toxicity of an enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Some prediction might be made based on knowledge of the intended receptor or the properties of salt of the relevant racemate, but that knowledge, where it was available, still could not ensure certainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">(ii) There was and is a range of potential difference in activity between enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">At the extremes, activity may be the same, or one enantiomer might have all the activity and the other none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Those two extremes were, however, less likely and would have been less expected than a result in the intermediate range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">It was not unusual for one enantiomer to display most of the activity and the other little.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">The difference between the activity of the racemate and that of the active enantiomer could be expected to be about two-fold, though that difference might increase where the inactive enantiomer served to inhibit the activity of the active enantiomer when both were present in the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">(iii) The toxicity of an enantiomer is not related to its physiological activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">
 

36 Another issue was the state of knowledge in Australia as at 1987 concerning the possibility that various regulatory authorities overseas would compel testing the enantiomers of a racemic mix proposed for registration as a pharmaceutical drug.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">I am satisfied that this possibility was generally recognised at that time by those in the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidelines were issued in early 1987 and recommended that course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">There is little doubt that there would have been widespread knowledge of those guidelines in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">There is evidence of similar views in Europe and Japan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">REVOCATION 
 
37 Before turning to examine the grounds of revocation, it is necessary to notice an oddity about the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">The patent was granted pursuant to the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) (the 1952 Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">The grounds for revocation were set out in s 100 of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">The 1990 Act, when enacted, repealed the 1952 Act and contained the transitional and savings provisions in Ch 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Section 233 is as follows:
 
 
 " 233 Patents granted under 1952 Act 
 (1) Subject to this Chapter and the regulations, this Act applies in relation to a standard patent or a petty patent granted under the 1952 Act as if the patent had been granted under this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">(2) A patent mentioned in subsection (1) does not have effect in any place in which it did not have effect immediately before the commencing day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">(3) Chapter 9 of this Act does not apply in relation to a patent mentioned in subsection (1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">(4) Objection cannot be taken to a patent mentioned in subsection (1), and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the patent under the 1952 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">" 
 
 
38 The validity of patents is dealt with in Pt 3 of Ch 2 of the 1990 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">The revocation of patents is (relevantly) dealt with by s 138 of the 1990 Act, the grounds being set out in s 138(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Those grounds are similar to, but have important differences from, those which were provided for by s 100 of the 1952 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">39 Section 233 of the 1990 Act has been applied on the basis that a 1952 Act patent can now only be revoked on a ground provided for by the 1990 Act but as if it corresponds with the similar ground available under the 1952 Act (eg NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 404 ; (1993) 44 FCR 239 per Lockhart J at 250---254 (agreed in by Northrop J at 241 and Burchett J at 268); ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at [22] ---[23]; and Abbott Laboratories v Corbridge Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 314 , (2002) 57 IPR 432 at [81] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">This is a somewhat strange result as the grounds do not correspond, particularly in relation to lack of novelty and obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Uninstructed by authority, I should have thought that the intention was to maintain the status quo in relation to revocation for 1952 Act patents with time to run under the 1990 Act --- in other words, the grounds for revocation would be those set out in s 100(1) of the 1952 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">That would maintain the status quo and neither advantage nor disadvantage the 1952 Act patentee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">However, that approach is not reflected in the authorities and has not been contended for by either party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Lack of novelty 
 
40 Section 100(1)(f) and (g) of the 1952 Act were as follows:
 
 
 "(1) A standard patent may be revoked, either wholly or in so far as it relates to any claim of the complete specification, and a petty patent may be revoked, on one or more of the following grounds, but on no other ground:
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (f) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification or in the claim of the petty patent specification, as the case may be, is the subject of a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete specification of a standard patent or in the petty patent specification of a petty patent;
 
 (g) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification or in the claim of the petty patent specification, as the case may be, was not novel in Australia on the priority date of that claim;" 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Prior claiming is not a ground available in this case because of the received wisdom as to the application of s 233 of the 1990 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">41 The applicants rely upon the following publications prior to the priority date of the claims in suit:
 
 
 "(a) Australian Patent No.</sentence>

42 Each is a version of the French patent in slightly different language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Relevant portions of the French patent have been set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Particular reference has been made by the applicants to the following claims of the Canadian patent which are more detailed than in the French patent: 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">A process for the preparation of derivatives of general formula (I): in which Y may represent either a hydroxyl radical or an -OR group radical, in which R is a straight or branched lower alkyl radical, or Y represents a radical of the formula: in which either R1 and R2, identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom or a straight or branched lower alkyl group; or R1 and R2 form together and with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a heterocycle which may or may not include a second heteroatom chosen from the group containing oxygen and nitrogen, wherein the latter may be substituted by a lower alkyl or benzyl radical which may or may not be substituted; and X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom, or a lower alkyl radical; and their the addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids if Y represents a radical of the -OR formula or of the ---NR1R2 formula; R, R1 and R2 having the above-defined meanings, or with mineral bases if Y represents a hydroxyl radical; as well as the 2 enantiomers or their mixture of these compounds of formula (I); wherein: - either, in order to prepare the esters of formula (I), in which Y represents a radical of the -OR formula, in which R has the above-defined meaning, and X has the above-defined meaning, the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-thieno[3,2-c]pyridine of formula (II) is condensed: on a &#945;-chlorophenylacetate of formula (III): in which R and X have the above-defined meanings, then the derivative sought is obtained, which is isolated and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by mineral or organic acid action; - or, in order to prepare the acid of formula (I) in which Y represents a hydroxyl radical and X has the above-defined meaning, the ester of formula (I), in which Y represents a radical of the -OR formula in which R and X have the above-defined meanings, is saponified, then the derivative sought is obtained, which is isolated and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by mineral or organic acid action; - or, in order to prepare the compounds of formula (I), in which X has the above-defined meaning and Y represents a radical of the -OR formula, in which R has the above-defined meaning, or a radical of the -NR1R2 formula, in which R1 and R2 have the above-defined meanings, the acid of formula (I), in which X has the above-defined meaning and Y represents a hydroxyl radical, may or may not be activated, is reacted with either an alcohol of the H-OR formula, in which R has the above-defined meaning, or with an amine of the H-NR1R2 formula, in which R1 and R2 have the above-defined meanings, then the corresponding derivative sought is obtained, which is isolated and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified by mineral or organic acid action.</sentence>

<sentence id="s432">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">) 
43 The phrase in s 100(1)(g) of the 1952 Act, "was not novel in Australia", is similar in substance to the phrase in s 7(1) of the 1990 Act "not novel in the light of" various kinds of information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">To say that the claim of a patent is not novel in that sense is to say that it adds nothing new to that with which it is compared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In the case of a paper anticipation, it assumes that the product described is made or the process outlined is followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Each integer of the claimed invention must be disclosed in the prior publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The reverse infringement test is a practical way of detecting whether that is so in most cases ( Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 235).</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">44 The patent in suit claims a chemical compound with a specific property --- namely, the capacity to rotate plane-polarised light to the right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">That property distinguishes it both from the racemate and from the levo-rotatory enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The dextro-rotatory enantiomer is not expressly identified as such in the French patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submits that it is not possible from the face of the earlier specifications to say which enantiomer is the levo-rotatory and which is the dextro-rotatory --- the most that can be said is that both are in the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Furthermore, it is said that that difference is significant so far as pharmacological efficacy and toxicity were concerned as disclosed in the complete specification of the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Thus, the patentee's contention is that this is something new and different --- novel --- in form and in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">45 On the other hand, the formula identified as derivative 1 or example 1 in the French patent and corresponding patents (PCR 4099) has the identical formula to the enantiomer in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">I am satisfied that the skilled but not inventive reader of the French and corresponding patents would understand that the derivative in question (in common with all of the derivatives) was the racemate and that all of the technical explanations as to the means of obtaining that (and other) derivatives and as to the testing of them related only to the racemate and not to any individual enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">There is no express suggestion that either enantiomer had in fact been separately obtained or tested for efficacy or toxicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">That said, it was commonly known, and was spelled out in the French patent, that the compound in question was a racemate with one chiral centre and two enantiomers --- one dextro and the other levo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">There were express references to the enantiomers in both the body of the specification and in the claims of the French and corresponding patents, with the detail most clearly spelled out in the Canadian patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The express references to the enantiomers in the French and corresponding patents (particularly the Canadian patent) plainly carry the claim that the enantiomers are within the compounds disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">46 The relevant phrases in the French and Canadian patents --- in the specification: "The invention relates both to each enantiomer and their mixture" (French patent) and "The invention also concerns each of the enantiomers and their mixture" (Canadian patent); in claim 1: "as well as the 2 [two] enantiomers or their mixture ..." (French and Canadian patents); "and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated and/or it is salified" (Canadian patent); and in claim 14: "as well as one of the two enantiomers or their mixture" (French patent) and "as well as the 2 enantiomers or their mixture" (Canadian patent) --- are consistent only with a disclosure of, and a claim to, each enantiomer (dextro and levo) separate from the racemate and from each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I should say that the attempts by the witnesses for the patentee to deny that the claims of these patents encompassed each of the separated single enantiomers were, to say the least, not impressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">47 The basis of the French and corresponding patents is that all compounds of the class claimed (whether exemplified or not) displayed useful inhibiting action on platelet aggregation and anti-thrombotic activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The precise effect differed as between the various examples discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Although the compounds tested were racemates, no distinction as to pharmacological properties was drawn between the racemate and each of the single enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">It follows that the patentee was asserting that the relevant qualities of each enantiomer were not to be relevantly distinguished from any particular racemate or the other enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">48 The claims for the separate enantiomers could be described as bare claims for efficacy without any foundation being shown for them in any part of the complete specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">There is no basis for knowing what, if any, efficacy or toxicity would apply to either enantiomer of any particular racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">It is now known, of course, that one of the enantiomers of PCR 4099 was not only almost completely ineffective but was significantly more toxic than the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">That may have been exorbitant or covetous claiming (cf Mullard Radio Valve Co Ltd v Philco Radio &amp; Television Corporation of Great Britain Ltd [1936] 2 All ER 920, (1936) 53 RPC 323 at 349).</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">No doubt, if only the racemate were claimed, there would be a large risk that this would not protect against competition from a drug with one of the enantiomers as the active ingredient, which might be as efficacious as, and perhaps more efficacious than, the racemate as an active ingredient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The covetous nature of the claim does not advance Sanofi-Aventis' position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">The dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 was identified as a compound with useful qualities concerning platelet aggregation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The truth or falsity of the claimed advantage is not relevant for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">49 Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] ---[161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase "enabling disclosure" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was "supported" by the earlier specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">That is a concept similar to, but narrower than, whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law (cf F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274).</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">It may be accepted that, in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula, in order to be valid, the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured (s 40).</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 , to which I shall return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but, in my opinion, has little, if any, relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">Indeed, it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">For a product claim, the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it ( May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 at 281---282).</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">By the same token, a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">50 The usual starting point in discussion of anticipation is the judgment of Lord Westbury LC in Hill v Evans (1862) 1A IPR 1 , (1862) 4 De GF &amp; J 288, (1862) 31 LJ Ch 457 , (1862) 6 LT 90, (1862) 45 ER 1195 , particularly the following (1A IPR 1 at 6---7):
 "the antecedent statement must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive, understand, and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the useful application of the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">There is not, I think, any other general answer that can be given to this question than this: that the information as to the alleged invention given by the prior publication must, for the purposes of practical utility, be equal to that given by the subsequent patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The invention must be shewn to have been before made known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Whatever, therefore, is essential to the invention must be read out of the prior publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">If specific details are necessary for the practical working and real utility of the alleged invention, they must be found substantially in the prior publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">" 
None of the reports set out the particulars of the plaintiff's patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">For those details it is necessary to go to the related case of Hills v London Gaslight Co 5 H and N 312, referred to by Lord Westbury LC in Hill v Evans (1862) 1A IPR 1 at 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">The description of the invention was "an improved mode of compressing peat and of manufacturing gas and of obtaining certain substances applicable to purifying the same".</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">It consisted of passing gas through a mixture with the object of purifying the gas and then renovating the purifying material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Each of the specifications cited against Hill's patent was also process or method patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Heard's was a patent for the application of lime in the purification of gas, croll's patent was directed to an improved method of purifying coal gas from ammonia and Laming's patent also dealt with the process of purification of gas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">The general statements by Lord Westbury LC need to be understood in the context of the facts of that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">With a qualification to be mentioned, the principle was established that all integers of an invention must be in the prior specification if novelty is to be defeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">In the case of a process or method, that means each integer of the process or method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">51 The qualification is expressed in various places including by Lord Reid in C Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Ltd [1963] RPC 61 at 71:
 "But Lord Westbury must have meant experiments with a view to discovering something not disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">He cannot have meant to refer to the ordinary methods of trial and error which involve no inventive step and are generally necessary in applying any discovery to produce a practical result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">" 
In that case, the question was whether a skilled reader would infer from photographs of a machine in magazine articles that the rake wheels of the alleged anticipating machine were ground driven rather than gear driven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">It is interesting that Lord Reid went on to say ([1963] RPC 61 at 72):
 "The appellants' first argument is that it is not enough that the photograph should disclose a probability that the wheels were ground driven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">There cannot be anticipation, they say, unless this is shown clearly and unmistakably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I cannot accept that argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">I would agree that the anticipating material must be as good for practical purposes as the material in the appellants' specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">But I can see no practical difference between a definite statement of fact and material from which the skilled man would clearly infer its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">So the question is whether the typical skilled man would infer ground drive from the photograph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It would not be enough that a quick-witted man would guess that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">But in this case I think that it is proved that the ordinary skilled man would have had good grounds for reaching the conclusion that these wheels were ground driven.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">He could not have been certain, but practical men act on something less than absolute certainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">" 
52 The reference by Lord Reid to "clearly and unmistakably" no doubt refers to the same source as lay behind the well-known passage from the later Court of Appeal judgment in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1972] RPC 457 at 485---486:
 
 "If the prior inventor's publication contains a clear description of, or clear instructions to do or make , something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty, that is to say, it will have been anticipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">The prior inventor, however, and the patentee may have approached the same device from different starting points and may for this reason, or it may be for other reasons, have so described their devices that it cannot be immediately discerned from a reading of the language which they have respectively used that they have discovered in truth the same device; but if carrying out the directions contained in the prior inventor's publication will inevitably result in something being made or done which, if the patentee's patent were valid, would constitute an infringement of the patentee's claim, this circumstance demonstrates that the patentee's claim has in fact been anticipated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">If, on the other hand, the prior publication contains a direction which is capable of being carried out in a manner which would infringe the patentee's claim, but would be at least as likely to be carried out in a way which would not do so, the patentee's claim will not have been anticipated, although it may fail on the ground of obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">To anticipate the patentee's claim the prior publication must contain clear and unmistakeable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented : Flour Oxidizing Co. Ltd. v. Carr &amp; Co. Ltd. ((1908) 25 R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">428 at 457, line 34, approved in B.T.H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Co Ltd v Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. Ltd. (1928) 45 R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">1 at 24, line 1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">A signpost, however clear, upon the road to the patentee's invention will not suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">The prior inventor must be clearly shown to have planted his flag at the precise destination before the patentee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">[Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">] 
 
53 The source, Flour Oxidizing Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 428 , concerned an invention for "[i]mprovements in conditioning or improving the quality of recently ground flour, semolina, or the like", one of the claims of the relevant patent being for a "process of conditioning flour and the like, passing the same with full exposure through an atmosphere containing a gaseous oxide of nitrogen or chlorine or bromine oxidising agent in the gaseous or vapourised state".</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">The alleged anticipation being discussed by Parker J in the relevant passage ( Flour Oxidizing Co Ltd 25 RPC 428 at 457) was entitled "[i]mprovements in and relating to the treatment of alimentary substances and beverages" essentially by subjecting the substances to the action of electricity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">54 The patent in suit in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co [1972] RPC 457 was for a process for making a compound suitable for tyre treads by mixing synthetic rubber with oil and carbon black and for the compound thus made (at 470).</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">The issue in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co [1972] RPC 457 , as appears from the general treatment of anticipation from 486---497, focussed upon the method or process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The references to a signpost and a flag, which have excited later imaginations, deal with a situation in which the language and the directions given as to process or method were equivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The main principle is that, if the prior inventor's publication contains a clear description of something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Alternatively, if the prior inventor's publication contains clear instructions to do or make something that would infringe the patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, the patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">55 The first case to which I have referred that suggested that disclosure of a chemical compound by formula was not disclosure for the purposes of anticipation was the decision of Falconer J in Re Genentech Inc's (Human Growth Hormone) Patent [1989] RPC 613, in which it was held that, for a disclosure of a chemical compound in a prior document to anticipate a later claim to that compound, the cited document must contain sufficient directions to enable the compound to be made ([1989] RPC at 629---635).</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">56 Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 concerned the 1977 United Kingdom Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Counsel for the Comptroller of Patents neatly, and, in my opinion correctly, summed up the law as it previously stood in the following way ([1991] RPC at 520):
 "Novelty is a fundamental of patent law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Prior to the Act of 1977 it was settled law in the U.K. that "if the prior inventor's publication contains a clear description of, or clear instruction to do or make, something that would infringe that patentee's claim if carried out after the grant of the patentee's patent, that patentee's claim will have been shown to lack the necessary novelty", see: General Tire v. Firestone [1972] R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">457 at p 485.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Accordingly under the Act of 1949 a claim to a chemical compound has been held to be anticipated by a statement that it has been prepared (Gyogyszeripari [1958] R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">51) or with a method for preparation which does not work (SKF [1968] R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">415).</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">The latter cases were consistent with General Tire being instances where the prior documentation contained a description of the invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">" 
The House of Lords upheld the contrary view of Falconer J in Re Genentech Inc's (Human Growth Hormone) Patent [1989] RPC 613.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">The 1977 Act, in s 2(2), included the words "made available to the public".</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Counsel in Asahi [1991] RPC 485 suggested this may have made a difference to the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Falconer J's reasoning did not appear to depend upon that distinction, although he did refer to a decision of the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office supporting his position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Falconer J expressly declined to follow decisions of the Patents Appeal Tribunal in Gyogyszeripara Kurato Interzet's Application [1958] RPC 51 and Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories' Application [1968] RPC 415 and the established practice of the Comptroller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Counsel for the petitioner for revocation in that case submitted that this was a departure from the long standing law in the United Kingdom as to anticipation and I agree with that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">57 Lord Hoffman's speech in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323 spells out the current United Kingdom position with clarity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Under the 1977 United Kingdom Act "disclosure" and "enablement" are separate concepts and are cumulative requirements for anticipation, although there may be circumstances where disclosure will also satisfy enablement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">In my opinion, at least in relation to product claims and claims for chemical compounds by formula, this is a departure from the law of Australia and from English law as it was applied up to 1977.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">I would respectfully suggest that it creates an anomalous relationship between anticipation and infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">58 In the present case, the earlier patent gave Sanofi-Aventis a monopoly in relation to the making and using of PCR 4099 and its enantiomers, together or separate, even though there was no description of a method of resolving the enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">59 I venture the view that the claimed symmetry between the disclosure requirements for validity of the earlier patent and disclosure for anticipation purposes does not exist or is anomalous in the case of a chemical compound described (adequately) by formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">60 Nonetheless, Lord Hoffman's speech is useful in other respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">So far as the immediate point is concerned, in dealing with disclosure, he said ( SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323 at 337, [34]---[35]):
 "Did the Synthon application disclose an invention which, if performed, would infringe the SB patent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Because it covered a class of chemicals defined by reference to a formula, it disclosed a myriad of compounds, each of which may be regarded as an invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">But that does not matter if one of those inventions was the crystalline PMS claimed in the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">There seems to me no doubt that the application disclosed the existence of PMS crystals of 98 per cent purity and claimed that they could be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">Whether in fact they could be made is the question of enablement which I shall come to in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">But their existence and their advantages for pharmaceutical use were clearly disclosed in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">And on the basis of the judge's finding of monomorphism, a PMS crystal of 98 per cent purity must necessarily have all the characteristics of the crystals claimed in the patent, including the IR and XRD spectra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">" 
At 334 ([22]) he said:
 "It follows that, whether or not it would be apparent to anyone at the time, whenever subject-matter described in the prior disclosure is capable of being performed and is such that, if performed, it must result in the patent being infringed, the disclosure condition is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The flag has been planted, even though the author or maker of the prior art was not aware that he was doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">" 
Then, at 336 ([32]):
 "In the case of disclosure, when the matter relied upon as prior art consists (as in this case) of a written description, the skilled person is taken to be trying to understand what the author of the description meant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">His common general knowledge forms the background to an exercise in construction of the kind recently discussed by this House in Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd [2004] UKHL 46 ; [2005] R.P.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">And of course the patent itself must be construed on similar principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">But once the meanings of the prior disclosure and the patent have been determined, the disclosure is either of an invention which, if performed, would infringe the patent, or it is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The person skilled in the art has no further part to play.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">" 
61 The applicants contend that, in any event, the methods of resolving the enantiomers were part of the common knowledge of skilled persons in Australia at the priority date and would be applied as a matter of routine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">
 
62 It was submitted on behalf of Sanofi-Aventis that neither PCR 4099 nor either of the enantiomers of that compound were "taught" in the sense of recommended by the French patent, citing Bristol-Myers Squibb Co v FH Faulding &amp; Co Ltd [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 at [67] per Black CJ and Lehane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">That case concerned a method of administration of a naturally occurring drug to a patient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">The full passage is as follows:
 "What all those authorities contemplate, in our view, is that a prior publication, if it is to destroy novelty, must give a direction or make a recommendation or suggestion which will result, if the skilled reader follows it, in the claimed invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">A direction, recommendation or suggestion may often, of course, be implicit in what is described and commonly the only question may be whether the publication describes with sufficient clarity the claimed invention or, in the case of a combination, each integer of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">" 
63 That language is quite conventional in relation to a dose regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">The actual decision in the case was that there was anticipation of the dosage regime claimed in the patent in suit by the earlier publication which included the following ( Bristol-Myers Squibb Co [2000] FCA 316 ; 97 FCR 524 at [71] ):
 "Further studies to evaluate the feasibility of shorter infusion time, 3 hours versus 24 hours and a lower 135mg/m2 versus a maximum tolerated dose of 175mg/m2 are now in progress in relapsing ovarian cancer patients both in Canada and in Europe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">Already more than 200 patients have been entered into this four-arm randomized, NCIC guided international study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Indeed, the 3 hours infusion time administration schedule proved to be feasible, if given concomitantly to profylactic [sic] measures as high dose dexamethasone, cimetidine and difenhydramine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">This makes even outpatient treatment with this first available representative of this new class of antitumor agents possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">" 
(cf Merck &amp; Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2006] FCAFC 91 ; (2006) 154 FCR 31 at 60).</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">In any event, the problem does not arise in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">The invention disclosed and claimed by the French patent necessarily carried the implication of a direction, recommendation or suggestion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">That is the consideration for which the monopoly was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">64 Something was sought to be made of the fact that PCR 4099 or derivative 1 was not unmistakably pointed to as the best of the compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">There was competing evidence from the experts related to that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">In my view, that was a red herring as far as novelty is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">On any view, it was expressly disclosed as one of the most promising of the compounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The invention was not limited to the most effective or most promising example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">The invention was a broad class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">As Lord Hoffmann lucidly explained in Biogen Inc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 at 48---49, 36 IPR 438 at 455:
 "If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application, the claims may be in correspondingly general terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">The patentee need not show that he has proved its application in every individual instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">On the other hand, if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products, the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Thus if the patentee has hit upon a new product which has a beneficial effect but cannot demonstrate that there is a common principle by which that effect will be shared by other products of the same class, he will be entitled to a patent for that product but not for the class, even though some may subsequently turn out to have the same beneficial effect: see May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd [1950] RPC 23 at 50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">On the other hand, if he has disclosed a beneficial property which is common to the class, he will be entitled to a patent for all products of that class (assuming them to be new) even though he has not himself made more than one or two of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">" 
65 In other words, examples are used to show the utility of the invention as a whole by providing a basis for generalising from them to the balance of the class claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The invention of the French and corresponding patents is not described by reference to a particular result as to efficacy or toxicity and the claims are not so limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">In my opinion, it is clear that the formula of PCR 4099 was expressly disclosed as having the claimed advantage and that the same claim was made in relation to each enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The same can be said of each of the specific examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">66 The patent in suit identifies the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of example 1 as having all of the activity and the levo-rotatory enantiomer none, with efficacy at least as good as the racemate but less toxicity than the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">However, the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 was clearly enough within the compounds claimed by the French and corresponding patents as having the beneficial effect illustrated by the result of testing of PCR 4099 and the other examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">That disclosure anticipates claim 1 of the patent in suit unless it can be viewed as a selection patent --- a somewhat controversial topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Before considering it, I should digress to some other authorities concerning racemates, including the two recent cases to which I referred earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">67 Lindgren J dealt with a somewhat similar situation in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 although, in that case, there was no express reference to, or claim to, the enantiomers of the racemate in the alleged anticipation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">His Honour had construed the relevant claims of the patent in suit as relating only to the (+)- or dextro-rotatory enantiomer of citalopram, having a separate existence, not being an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">His reasoning included the following ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [118] ---[119]):
 "The only context that I take into account in arriving at this conclusion is that it was part of common general knowledge: 
 
 &#8226; that racemates contained in equal parts (+) and (---) enantiomers;
 &#8226; that the enantiomers of a racemate were potentially separable, and it was a possibility that an enantiomer might have a stable existence as a compound distinct from being part of the racemate;
 &#8226; that some racemates had in fact been resolved into their separate enantiomers; and
 &#8226; that racemates were commonly represented by the symbol (+/-) to indicate the presence of both enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">
 
 It is not that the (+)-citalopram compound does not exist when it is part of the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The skilled addressee would understand that it exists whether a part of the racemate or apart from it, and that the purpose of the (+) symbol is only to distinguish it from the (---)-enantiomer and from its being merely part of the racemate or of some other mixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The (+) or (---) symbol, devoid of any context suggesting otherwise, implies distinctness from the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">" 
In Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Professor Martin Banwell was called by the applicant for revocation, as he was in these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">68 After referring to the well-known passage from General Tire &amp; Rubber Co [1972] RPC 457 at 485---486 and citing various other cases, his Honour said ( Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 at [161] ):
 "What does "enabling disclosure" mean in the context of a product claim?</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">It means that the earlier disclosure must point unmistakeably to the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram, as distinct from the racemate, as a drug desirable to obtain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">" 
I take "as distinct from" to mean "separately from" not "instead of" or "as opposed to".</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">This does not include any separate requirement of enablement in accordance with SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323 and is consistent with my opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">69 It was alleged that the product claims of the patent in suit in that case were anticipated by the Australian Citalopram Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">His Honour rejected the argument on the following basis ( Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [171] ---[173]):
 "The Australian Citalopram Patent did not refer to "enantiomers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">It did not expressly or by implication otherwise disclose the individual enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">It disclosed the racemate and enabled the obtaining of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Whether this anticipated the present invention turns on my construction of the Patent --- see Section C above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The skilled but non-inventive addressee reading the Australian Citalopram Patent would have understood that (+/-)-citalopram consisted of the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram and the (-)-enantiomer, each as to 50%, and would have been able to identify the formulae for the S and R enantiomers, but would not have known, in the absence of experimentation, which was (+) and which was (-).</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">These facts would not, however, point specifically to the independent existence of the enantiomers which is, according to my construction of the Patent specification, of the essence of claim 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">If I had construed claim 1 as referring to (+)-citalopram when present in the unresolved racemate, the Australian Citalopram Patent would have been an anticipation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">But because of my construction outlined at Section C above, a person taught by the Australian Citalopram Patent, although taught to desire to obtain the racemate, would not be taught to desire to obtain the specific (+)-enantiomer in its own right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">Similarly, the Australian Citalopram Patent's citalopram formula did not disclose the independently existing (+)-enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">I note that if In re Adamson (1960) 275 F2d 952 is authority for the proposition that a patent for a racemate necessarily anticipates a claimed invention of either of its enantiomers, I respectfully disagree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">" 
70 A little earlier than the decision in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 , Young J had considered a similar issue in Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd v Warner-Lambert Co LLC (No 2) [2006] FCA 1787 , (2006) 71 IPR 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">One question was whether the formula in claim 1 of the relevant patent claimed only the racemate and not the enantiomers separate from the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The patentee, Warner-Lambert, called, amongst other witnesses, Professor Christopher Easton and Professor Peter Scammells, who gave evidence for Sanofi-Aventis in these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The applicant for revocation, Ranbaxy, called, inter alia, Dr Keith Watson, who was called by Apotex, one of the applicants, in these cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">His Honour's findings about common general knowledge (so far as is relevant) were as follows ( Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 at [113] ):
 
 
 "(7) The biological activity of a racemate in a biological system can be quite different from that of a single enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">The physical and biological properties of a racemate differ from that of an individual enantiomer in various respects: for example, there may be differences in solubility between the racemate and its enantiomers and differences in pharmacological properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">(8) The normal expectation is that there would be one enantiomer that is approximately twice as active as the racemate in terms of its operation in the target biological system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">(9) Before 30 May 1986, the skilled team would expect that the R enantiomer was very likely to be the active, or more active, enantiomer, but this could not be known with certainty without isolating and testing the enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">(10) Conversely, it was very likely to be the case that the S enantiomer was inactive, or substantially less active, than the R enantiomer, but this could not be known with certainty until the enantiomers had been isolated and tested.</sentence>

71 His Honour found that the formula did include claims for the enantiomers as such, notwithstanding that there was no reference to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">An important part of his reasoning was as follows ( Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 at [121] ---[122] and [128]---[129]): 
 "Perhaps the most important background consideration against which the claims of the 981 Patent must be construed is that the skilled addressee would know that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as the class of compounds referred to in claim 1, are enantiomeric and that one enantiomer is very likely to be more active than the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">The skilled addressee would also know that the biological activity of a racemate will be different from that of the single enantiomers, and that the active or more active enantiomer will be approximately twice as active as the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">In these circumstances, confronted by a structural formula in claim 1 that shows relative stereochemistry, the skilled reader would consider that the structural formula was intended to claim both enantiomers, as well as racemic mixtures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">I do not think that the skilled addressee would read the structural formula as one that was intended to exclude the more active enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">Reading the specification as a whole, the skilled addressee would discern that the patentee had not isolated the individual enantiomers and that the absolute stereochemistry of the more active enantiomer, and that of the less active enantiomer, had not been defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">The skilled addressee would also know that, while it had not yet been done by the patentee, it was a routine step to obtain the individual enantiomers by resolving the racemic mixture, and that it was also possible to make the individual enantiomers by chiral synthesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">In those circumstances, the skilled addressee would expect, in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, that claim 1 of the patent was intended to include the more active enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">In these circumstances, in the absence of any clear indication or language to the contrary, the skilled addressee as at May 1986 would read claim 1 as encompassing both individual enantiomers, as well as mixtures of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">As Warner-Lambert submitted, it would make no sense to exclude patent protection for the more active enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">The point was well made by Professor Easton in the course of his affidavit evidence when he said that to confine the subject of the 981 Patent to racemic mixtures would exclude the thing (the active or more active enantiomer) that he, and any person working in the field as at May 1986, would know to be the key to the useful activity of the compounds disclosed by the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">It is not in dispute that structural formula I would be construed by the skilled addressee as including a trans racemate of the compounds of the formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">But there is no reason why the skilled reader would construe the formula as meaning only the trans racemate, thereby excluding both the R-trans and the S-trans enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">In the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, it offends common sense to construe structural formula I in that way.</sentence>

<sentence id="s644">73 Although the decisions in Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 and Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 turned in large measure upon the evidence in each case, a difference in approach can be detected on the question involving the disclosure of enantiomers, with Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 favourable to the applicants on this issue, and Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 being neutral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">In neither case was there the express reference to enantiomers such as there is in the French and corresponding patents here.</sentence>

<sentence id="s647">In Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 , the priority date of the broader patent was 30 May 1986 and that of the enantiomer patent 21 July 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">In the case of Alphapharm [2008] FCA 559 the Australian Citalopram Patent had a priority date of 14 January 1976 and the enantiomer patent 14 June 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">The common general knowledge found by Lindgren J to relate to the enantiomer patent and by Young J to relate to the broader patent was very much in the same time band as that relevant to construction of the patent in suit here.</sentence>

 "So it is that you may have first the scientist who discovers and discloses the whole range and who may obtain patent protection for the subject-matter of his discovery or the means of manufacturing them --- what Maugham, J. called the "originating patent".</sentence>

 "[s]election patents may require special attention, but that is a matter for another day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">" 
As I said earlier, the decision of Falconer J appeared to be and, in my opinion, was, a departure from the manner in which the law of anticipation had been understood in the United Kingdom and in Australia up to that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">79 It seems to me that it is too late in the day to find that the principles explained by Maugham J in IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 are not relevant to the question of anticipation under the 1952 Act (and the 1990 Act, for that matter).</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">That is not to recognise a special class of patents --- the reference to a selection patent is a convenient shorthand to pick up the relevant principles concerning anticipation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">I approach the United Kingdom cases from and including EI Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303 with caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">I must also endeavour to keep separate questions of anticipation, on the one hand, and obviousness, on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">The distinction is not always easy to discern in the authorities on this topic, including the seminal judgment of Maugham J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">80 There is a question as to whether the selection patent principles apply to a compound specifically identified in the early specification as a member of the larger class (eg as an example or derivative) or whether it is restricted to the express identification (for the first time) of a particular member of the larger class with the special characteristic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">The latter was conceded by the patentee in EI Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">In the Court of Appeal, Buckley LJ had favoured the view that the concession was necessary (395) but, in the House of Lords, Lord Simon preferred to leave the point open ([1982] FSR 303 at 315).</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">I favour the view of Buckley LJ as more in accordance with the rationale as explained by Maugham J and with his description of the class as follows ( IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC at 321):
 "The second class comprises patents (the so-called selection patents) based on a selection of related compounds such as the homologues and substitution derivatives of the original compounds which presumably have been described in general terms and claimed in the originating patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">" 
81 If that view is correct, then the patent in suit is not a selection patent in the ordinary sense as PCR 4099 and each of the enantiomers were expressly disclosed and claimed in the earlier patents and are expressly referred to in the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">In one sense, the dextro-rotatory enantiomer is selected from that sub-class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">There is authority to suggest that selection can be from a small class (per Buckley LJ in Beecham Group Ltd's (Amoxycillin) Application, Re [1980] RPC 261 at 292; EI Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303 per Lord Wilberforce at 310; but, cf Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147 at 154, [1972] RPC 364).</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">I will therefore assume, contrary to my own opinion, that the principle can apply to the present case on that basis if the requirements are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">82 It is convenient to state once again the summary of those requirements from the Full Court decision in Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 at [105] :
 
 
 "&#8226; there must be some substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the selected members;
 &#8226; the whole of the selected members must possess the advantage in question;
 &#8226; the selection must be in respect of a quality of a special character, which can fairly be said to be peculiar to the group; and
 &#8226; the advantage possessed by the selected members must be clearly disclosed in the specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">"
 
 

83 There is a substantial advantage to be secured by the use of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099 as compared with use of either the racemic mixture or the levo-rotatory enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">It is better tolerated or less toxic than either and as effective as the racemate with a lesser concentration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">That proved to be the difference between success as a pharmaceutical drug and otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">In that sense, the first of the criteria is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">The second and fourth criteria are also, obviously, satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">84 However, is the selection in respect of a quality of a special character?</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">It will be recalled that the complete specification of the French patent, and corresponding patents, described the advantages of the invention as follows:
 "The toxicological and pharmacological investigations reported above demonstrate the low toxicity of the compounds of the invention, as well as their excellent tolerance and their inhibiting properties on blood-platelet aggregation, and their anti-thrombotic activity, which make them very useful in medical therapeutic applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">" 
The claims were not limited to any particular result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">In my opinion, that is a good description of the performance of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">It was obvious from the specification of the French and corresponding patents that it was not claimed that each compound within the class would have equal qualities --- indeed, the report of the tests demonstrated that that was not so --- the advantages were described very generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">85 The third proposition was explained by Maugham J in IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 as follows (at 323):
 "If there are five thousand possible members of the group, and a hundred have been selected as possessing some new and definite advantage, it is not intended to assert that such a selection patent would be bad if it were shown as the result of further research that there existed another hundred members possessing the same advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">If, on the other hand, it were to be established that there were a thousand unselected members which possessed the same advantage, I doubt very much whether the patent could be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">The quality must be of a special character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">It must not be one which those skilled in the art will expect to find in a large number of the members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">It would be rash to attempt a closer definition, for the question is ultimately one of appreciation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Returning to the same old fashioned metaphor I would say that the citadel must be defended, and that there is no reward if the gates have been opened at the first blast of the trumpet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">I will summarise the conclusion at which I have arrived by saying that in a selection patent the inventive step lies in the selection for a useful and special property or characteristic adequately defined; and this is the proposition which has to be kept in mind in considering the application to amend and the Petition for revocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">" 
86 The phrase in In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co's Application (Shell) [1960] RPC 35 at 53 was "advantages peculiar to themselves" or, as Lord Wilberforce put it in EI Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303 at 309 "unrecognised advantages".</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">Buckley LJ said in Beecham Group Ltd's (Amoxycillin) Application, Re [1980] RPC 261 at 292:
 "... the substance must be truly new and the advantage to be gained from its selection must be the inventor's own discovery as opposed to mere verification by him of previous predictions or of what was previously predictable; in other words, it must be unexpected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">" 
 
 
 

The specification in question here was, no doubt, drawn with this concept in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">However, the advantages here are not different in kind from those described and predicted in the earlier patent specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">Even if such an advantage could be satisfied by a quantum leap in relation to an earlier claimed advantage, the results here are by no means out of the range of results predictable from the tests done on the examples in the earlier specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">87 There was debate between the experts as to whether it was "unexpected" that the differences between the enantiomers in their performance would be as great as were ascertained by testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">In my view, for present purposes, that was a false issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">The question is whether the advantages of the characteristics of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer were unexpected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">For the same reason, the question is not which of the three possibilities --- the racemate and each of the enantiomers --- was best, either as against themselves or compared with other members of the wider class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">88 I therefore conclude that claim 1 cannot be defended as a valid selection and was anticipated by each of the cited specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">This conclusion also affects claims 10 and 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">89 Claim 3 then requires consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">There is no disclosure of the precise formula of claim 3 in any of the cited specifications (or of claims 2, 4 and 5 either).</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">The closest that the specifications of the prior art patents come is the reference to "and their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids".</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">It is contended that the choice of acid and the making of the salt of a compound was routine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">The specifications most naturally refer to salts of the racemate rather than of the enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">In any event, once there is a choice of acid to be made, then it cannot be said that there is the necessary disclosure to anticipate any particular claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">There is not a clear description of the salt described in claim 3 or clear instructions to do or make that particular salt in the earlier specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">The attack on the novelty of claim 3 fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">90 Claim 6 then needs to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">None of the cited prior art specifications contain a description of a process which accords with claim 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Claim 6 is the process for the separation of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer plus salt formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">The earlier specifications in question do not rise above the statement in the claims of the Canadian patent "and, if desired, its enantiomers are separated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">The evidence is that more than one method of resolving or separating the enantiomers of a racemic compound of this kind was known as at the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">Therefore, a choice was involved and the same reasoning applies here as applied in relation to claim 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">The challenge to novelty in relation to claim 6 fails.</sentence>

<sentence id="s758">It is pointed out that the statutory phrase is "what was known or used in Australia", before the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">It is well-established that that phrase refers to common general knowledge in the relevant field in Australia, that is to say, "the background knowledge and experience which is available to all in the trade in considering the making of new products, or the making of improvements in old" ( Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Aust) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 292).</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">97 The applicants seek to sidestep this considerable obstacle by relying upon the description of the inventive step in the complete specification which makes it clear that the step was to go from the racemic mixture corresponding to the formula methyl alpha-5 (4,5,6,7-tetrahydro (3,2-c) thieno pyridyl) (2-chlorophenyl) acetate, described as derivative 1 in the French patent, to the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of that racemic mixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The inventiveness of that step would then be judged according to Australian common general knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">It was submitted that this approach is consistent with that of the majority of the High Court in Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [41] and [52]---[53].</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">That was consistent with the way in which that case had been conducted below ( Aktiebolaget H&auml;ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1303 , (2000) 51 IPR 375 at [15] ---[24] and [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">98 An inventive step does not require any particular process of invention such as a flash of genius.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">However, there must be a step from one thing to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">In the case of a seminal invention, it may be from very little to something.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">The same might be said of any original invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Where an inventor describes the step by reference to the starting point or base line and an end point or result, it is the inventiveness of that step that is to be judged, not, for example, the inventiveness of the base line or starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">In making that judgment, the standard test is:
 "whether the hypothetical addressee faced with the same problem would have taken as a matter of routine whatever steps might have led from the prior art to the invention, whether they be the steps of the inventor or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">" 
( Wellcome Foundation Ltd v VR Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 12 ; (1981) 148 CLR 262 per Aickin J at 286).</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">99 Aktiebolaget [2002] HCA 59 ; 212 CLR 411 provides a good example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">The compound, known as omeprazole, which undoubtedly involved an inventive step, was not easily formulated into a satisfactory pharmaceutical composition, and solving a problem in the administration of the drug by formulation was required, that being the gist of the inventive step claimed in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">Obviousness was not judged on the basis that omeprazole had not been discovered simply because it had not passed into Australian common general knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">By analogy in the present case, the only invention described in the specification is moving from the particular racemic compound to the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of that compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">It would be the obviousness, or otherwise, of that step which would be tested, not the obviousness of formulating clopidogrel or any of the other compounds encompassed by the French patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">100 On this basis, the state of Australian common general knowledge would still have an important part to play in judging inventiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">It is easy to imagine that there would be technical fields where there is little Australian common general knowledge so that, for example, what may be routine in the laboratories of Switzerland would be inventive by Australian standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">On the other hand, there may be other fields where the relevant Australian knowledge was in advance of the country where the claimed invention took place, leading to the opposite conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">101 It is difficult to see how this patent could have been valid without disclosing the starting point or the master patent in the specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">To do so would have amounted to obtaining the patent on a false suggestion or representation within the meaning of s 100(1)(k) of the 1952 Act or be in breach of s 40(1)(a) of that Act by not describing the invention (see Sami S Svendsen Inc v Independent Products Canada Ltd [1968] HCA 65 ; (1968) 119 CLR 156 at 159 and 164---165).</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">The same applies under the 1990 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Hence the necessity to spell out that step and the advantage in the complete specification ( Re IG Farbenindustrie AG's Patents (1930) 47 RPC 289 at 323; Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147 at 154, [1972] RPC 364).</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">The specification of the patent in suit is drafted consistently with that obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">The cases on selection patents discuss both novelty and obviousness by reference to the nature of the selection from the earlier patent specification to the later claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">102 This submission was described as heretical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">I, therefore, carefully reread the analysis of s 100(1)(e) of the 1952 Act by Aickin J in Minnesota Mining [1980] HCA 9 ; 144 CLR 253 , particularly at 287---295.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">That analysis is not directed to the question that arises here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">There is no indication in that case that any of the patent specifications relied upon were cited in the patent in suit, that they had any connection with the patentee or that the patentee was aware of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">It was not a selection patent in any sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">103 The position established in Minnesota Mining [1980] HCA 9 ; 144 CLR 253 was of relatively short duration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">Until then, the wider view of Williams J in HPM Industries Pty Ltd v Gerard Industries Ltd [1957] HCA 47 ; (1957) 98 CLR 424 had applied (see Graham Hart (1971) Pty Ltd v SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 61 ; (1978) 141 CLR 305 per Aickin J at 329---330).</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">The 1990 Act widens the prior art base, but does not change the nature of the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">Leaving aside Aktiebolaget [2002] HCA 59 ; 212 CLR 411 , the principal survey of the topic by the High Court since Minnesota Mining [1980] HCA 9 ; 144 CLR 253 was in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 235 ALR 202 , (2007) 81 ALJR 1070 , particularly at [31]---[66].</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">That case did not involve the problem that arises here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">It is noteworthy that the Court said of the 1990 provisions (at [127]): 
 "As stated above, by enlarging the prior art base through including relevant prior disclosures beyond those disclosures proven to be part of the common general knowledge, these provisions raise the threshold for inventiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">However, the idea remains that the prior disclosures to be taken into account, even as enlarged by s 7(3), are being considered for a particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">That purpose is the purpose of looking forward from the prior art base to see what a person skilled in the relevant art is likely to have done when faced with a similar problem which the patentee claims to have solved with the invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">) 
(cf Firebelt Pty Ltd v Brambles Australia Ltd [2002] HCA 21 ; (2002) 188 ALR 280 , (2002) 76 ALJR 816 at [33] as to combination patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">) The applicants do not seek to utilise the contents of the prior specification as an admission as to common general knowledge (cf Lockwood Security Products [2007] HCA 21 ; 235 ALR 202 , 81 ALJR 1070 at [105] ---[109]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">Rather, it is a statement of the nature of the inventive step that is claimed (cf in another context, Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1959] HCA 71 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232).</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">104 The submission by the patentee would have the consequence that, pursuant to the 1952 Act, a person (including a foreign patentee) could take a foreign patent published in Australia some time ago that was not widely known, make sufficient changes to avoid anticipation and could seek a patent without having to run the gauntlet of obviousness, even if the changes were routine for those in the field in Australia at the time, but taking care to disclose the existence of the foreign patent to avoid any charge of false suggestion or representation and to describe the invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">That patent would have a term commencing again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">That result is counter-intuitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">105 The patentee's argument is not easily reconcilable with the existence of Pt VII of the 1952 Act dealing with patents of addition for "improvement in or modification of" the main invention, particularly with s 76, which was as follows:
 "Objection shall not be taken to an application for a patent of addition, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim of the complete specification, and a patent of addition, so far as the invention is so claimed, is not invalid, on the ground only that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, is obvious and does not involve an inventive step, having regard to- 
 
 (a) the publication of the main invention before the priority date of that claim but after the priority date of the claim of the specification of the main invention defining the invention the improvement in which, or the modification of which, is the subject of the first-mentioned claim, or, if there are two or more claims defining that invention, after the priority date of whichever of those claims has the earlier or earliest priority date; or
 (b) the use of the main invention during that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">" 
 
 
A patent of addition expired with the original patent (s 75) (cf Ch 7 of the 1990 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">) It will be observed that the section protected against invalidity on the ground of obviousness not novelty, and did so regardless of the state of common general knowledge in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">(For an interesting example of patents of addition in a similar context see Beecham Group Ltd's (Amoxycillin) Application, Re [1980] RPC 261.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">) 
 
106 On the other hand, if the starting point or baseline is not known to those in the field in Australia, then the selected compound may be seen as a large advance or inventive step in one leap and may be a valuable contribution to the relevant field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">It may, as in this case, provide a useful product for the public, thus justifying patent protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">107 The applicants' contention cannot be rejected out of hand, particularly in the case of a selection patent where the prior publication is a patent specification published or issued in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">If that contention is wrong, then this objection to the validity of claim 1 fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">I will consider the position if the contention were accepted and on the basis that the starting point for analysis of the inventive step was the racemic compound of PCR 4099 as disclosed in the French patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">The starting point of the invention identified in the complete specification in suit is the racemic mixture of derivative 1 as described in the French patent application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">There is no claim of invention in selecting that racemic mixture out of the others disclosed in the French patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">The invention claimed was ascertaining that only the dextro-rotatory enantiomer exhibited platelet aggregation inhibiting activity, the levo-rotatory enantiomer being inactive and being the less well tolerated of the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">It is, thus, expressed to be a selection patent only in that limited respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">108 The specification in suit does not explain in express terms the reason or motivation for separating and testing the enantiomers and comparing the results with those for the racemic mix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">It is assumed that the enantiomers might be separated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">The reason for that course is not disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">There is no statement, for example, of the problems concerning tolerance and toxicity which are now known to have affected the racemic mix and to have led to the search for a better alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">The inventive step claimed, in relation to the product claim for the dextro-rotatory enantiomer, was the unexpected nature of the result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">It is as if, in the course of an investigation, an unexpected result occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">That can be sufficient to provide subject matter (as it used to be called) for an invention in appropriate circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">The references to the French patent in the complete specification of the patent in suit are sufficient to permit reference to the French specification but only to understand the context of the disclosure of the particular racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">The discussion by Gummow J (agreed with by Jenkinson J) in Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd 91 ALR 513 at 532---539 is apposite, although directed to novelty in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">109 The applicants submit that it would also be appropriate to inform the skilled addressee of the results of the testing of the formulations of PCR 4099 which had taken place up to November 1985 when the decision was made to attempt to obtain the enantiomers of PCR 4099.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">In particular, that between 1983 and 1985 there were reports of side effects and, in particular, convulsions and death in some animals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">I cannot reconcile that submission with the narrow basis upon which inventive step is being considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">It is also questionable as to whether that would be consistent with the limited use to which evidence of what the inventor knows and does can be put (cf Wellcome Foundation Ltd [1981] HCA 12 ; 148 CLR 262 per Aickin J at 268---288).</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">The patentee chose to omit those matters from the specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">110 The result which might be described as unexpected in the light of the French specification was not so much the characteristics of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer (which were within the expected broad range) but rather the characteristics of the levo-rotatory enantiomer --- in particular, that it was inactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">It was common general knowledge among skilled workers in the field in Australia at the priority date that one of the two enantiomers might contain all of the activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">In my opinion, the discovery of that characteristic in this case was not so unexpected as to amount to an inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Therefore, if, contrary to my opinion, claim 1 was novel and if it is to be considered in the light of the complete specification, then it was obvious and did not involve an inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">111 It then becomes necessary to consider claims 2---5, which I do consider novel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">The specification in suit refers to the finding of salts among the mineral and organic acid salts of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer, "which crystallize easily, are not hygroscopic and are sufficiently water-soluble as to make their use as active medicinal principals particularly advantageous".</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">Three salts in particular are identified: hydrogen sulfate, the taurocholate and the hydrobromide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">The hydrochloride had been identified as of use because it was in powder form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">These compounds are the subject of claims 2, 3, 4 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">The conversion of the pure enantiomer to any of the salts was not suggested to have any particular difficulties --- that was described as being achieved "in standard manner" and "by means of standard methods".</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">The specification in suit does not claim any inventive step in the method of obtaining the salts once clopidogrel was known --- the claims rest on the properties of the salts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">Again, the critical issue is the correct starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">If it is only common general knowledge in Australia at the priority date, then the ground of invalidity must fail, as clopidogrel was not part of that common general knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">On the other hand, if the starting point is that which is recounted in the specification of the patent in suit, including the racemic mix PCR 4099 disclosed in the French patent and the dextro-rotatory enantiomer, then there is at least substance in the contention that each of the claims was obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">112 In my view, the inventive step is not to be judged on the basis that either PCR 4099 or the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of it is the starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">It may seem anomalous that the major compound might be obvious because of the statements in the specification in suit but that salts of it are not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">However, the salts are novel without any special consideration as selection patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">To take the specification in suit into account in this way to judge the obviousness of these claims would have to be based upon a general principle, not restricted to selection patents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">There is much to be said for the view that a patentee should be held to the advance in the art identified in the specification for the purposes of judging whether there is an inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">Put another way, the contents of the specification in suit would be taken into account in identifying the inventive step for the purposes of judging obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">However, no authority was cited that directly establishes such a principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Even application of it to selection patents is doubtful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">A similar issue arose in the recent Full Court decision in Insta Image Pty Ltd v KD Kanopy Australasia Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 139 in connection with a mechanical invention under the 1990 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">To the extent that the decision has any application to these cases, it tends against the applicants' contention as to the use that can be made of statements in the specification in suit as to the inventive step, although the reasoning is not altogether clear (see Insta Image Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 139 at [38] ---[61] and [80]---[115]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">The applicants' contention is a step too far for a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">It follows that claims 2---5 do represent an inventive step compared with common general knowledge in Australia at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">113 If the inventive step were identified as having the single enantiomer of clopidogrel as the starting point, I would have held that each salt claimed was obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">It was known that a pharmaceutically acceptable salt was useful for administration of an active compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">It was known how to prepare such salts using known mineral or organic acids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">The acids chosen here --- hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid and taurocholic acid --- were conventional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">They were (with the exception of taurocholic acid) the acids utilised in relation to the salts of PCR 4099 in the French patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">Standard methods of preparation of the salts were known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">114 Claim 6 is the principal process claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">It describes in a general way the process of liberating the dextro-rotatory enantiomer from the racemic compound PCR 4099 by means of diastereomeric salt formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">The desire to obtain the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of the racemic compound is taken for granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">The claim does not relate to that choice; it relates only to the means of doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">Novelty lies in the fact that no prior art discloses the use of that process in relation to that particular compound to obtain that particular enantiomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">That method was well-known in the field in Australia at the priority date as a classic means of obtaining the enantiomers of a racemic compound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">What the specification in suit discloses is that the classic method worked in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">The patentee sought to establish, principally through Mr Badorc, firstly, that the method did not always work in relation to particular compounds and, secondly, that the application of the method in this case required choices to be made in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of carrying it out that were not standard, and were not obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">A number of other methods of obtaining the enantiomers of a racemic compound were known at the priority date and it was also contended that the choice of one over the other was not obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">115 None of those contentions detract from the fact that claim 6 represents a classic process being applied to a known compound to produce the desired result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">The relevance of Mr Badorc's evidence to the issue is doubtful at least.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">Even if admissible, in my opinion, the particular application of the method by Mr Badorc did not involve any inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">Mr Badorc's evidence of the steps he took by way of diastereomeric salt formation, leading to the successful experiment on 21 March 1986, was challenged in various respects, principally because of apparent discrepancies between that evidence and the contemporaneous records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">His explanations were far from convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">Even if his evidence is accepted, the steps he took were typical of the trial and error that was necessarily involved with the use of such a technique.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Even if there were an inventive step in the particular application by Mr Badorc, claim 6 is not so limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">Each of the additional integers in claims 7, 8 and 9 was well-known in the field in Australia at the priority date and were available as part of the ordinary process of trial and error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">They do not reflect any particular inventive step identified by Mr Badorc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">116 The fact that a process may not always work in particular circumstances and that there were other available alternatives does not establish that it was inventive to choose to use it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">The choice of one known process over other known processes may be inventive in some circumstances --- perhaps where the received wisdom would point in the other direction or the result was unexpected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">There were no such circumstances here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">For the sake of completeness, I should say that there was no inventive step involved (or claimed) in ascertaining the pharmacological characteristics of the respective enantiomers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">117 Given the racemate, and given the desire to obtain the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of it, the processes described in claims 6, 7, 8 and 9 were obvious and the claims invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">Manner of new manufacture 
 
118 It is contended by the applicants that the claims in suit do not represent an invention because they are not a manner of new manufacture --- s 100(1)(d) of the 1952 Act combined with the definition of "invention" in s 6; s 18(1) of the 1990 Act together with the definition of "invention" in the dictionary in Sch 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">The most illuminating discussion of that which is encompassed by "a manner of manufacture" is that by the High Court in National Research Development Corp v Commissioner of Patents (NRDC Case) [1959] HCA 67 ; (1959) 102 CLR 252 where the extended meaning of the phrase in accordance with principles which were developed for the application of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies was explained by reference to the authorities up to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">In my opinion, it could not be suggested that the subject matter of the present claims is outside that extended notion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">The claims are for compounds and processes in a field of useful pharmacological application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">119 That decision was delivered several months after the decision of another Full Court of the High Court in Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1959] HCA 71 ; 102 CLR 232.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">In that case it was held that the specification did not disclose a patentable invention --- the headnote succinctly summarises the gist of the decision as follows: 
 "It is not an inventive idea for which a monopoly can be claimed to take a substance which is known and used for the making of various articles and make out of it an article for which its known properties make it suitable, although it has not in fact been used to make that article before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">" 
In NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655 at 664 the High Court quoted with approval the following passage from the NRDC Case [1959] HCA 67 ; 102 CLR 252 at 261---262 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ: 
 "the Commissioner may properly reject a claim for a process which is not within the concept of a "manufacture".</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">But the case cited [ie Microcell] shows also that even if the process is within the concept the Commissioner is not bound to accept the allegation of the applicant that it is new, if it is apparent on the face of the specification, when properly construed, that the allegation is unfounded".</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">120 The latter decision has subsequently been discussed by the High Court in Advanced Building Systems Pty Ltd v Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 19 ; (1998) 194 CLR 171 , particularly at [36]---[40] per Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ and in Lockwood Security Products [2007] HCA 21 ; 235 ALR 202 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1070 at [106] ---[107].</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">It is made clear that external evidence cannot be relied upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">The same ground of invalidity was examined in some detail by the Full Court in Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCAFC 91 ; 154 FCR 31 at [20] ---[75] (cf at first instance Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Merck &amp; Co Inc (2004) 213 ALR 182 , (2004) 63 IPR 85 at [80]---[97]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">The true scope of this ground of invalidity is difficult to discern in a case such as the present where the claims are for conventional products (albeit defined by chemical formula) and processes for the manufacture of products compared, say, with Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCAFC 91 ; 154 FCR 31 which dealt with a variation of a dosage regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">It is clear that the grounds of novelty and obviousness must be considered as such rather than through this prism ( CCOM Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; 51 FCR 260 at 295---295).</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">121 In my opinion, it cannot be said that the patent in suit claims an invention that is not new on the face of the specification without regard to what may be described as external evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">Indeed, the specification has been drawn in a fashion which is designed to ensure that the claims are new if the contents of the specification are accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">I do not agree that the French specification is incorporated by reference as a whole and for all purposes into the specification in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">It is incorporated sufficiently to understand the reference to the racemic compound in the specification in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">Even if that be wrong, and it is incorporated as a whole (as appeared to be the case with some prior documents in the Full Court decision in Merck &amp; Co Inc [2006] FCAFC 91 ; 154 FCR 31) , it would take the matter no further than the decision to which I have come on novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">False suggestion or representation 
 
122 The next ground to be considered is that the patent was obtained on a false suggestion or representation (1952 Act, s 100(1)(k); 1990 Act, s 138(3)(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">The first false and misleading representation alleged was the statement:
 "in an unexpected manner only the dextro-rotatory enantiomer Id exhibits a platelet aggregation inhibiting activity, the levo-rotatory enantiomer Il being inactive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">(Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">) 
It is accepted that the statement as to the relative activity is accurate but it is alleged that it was not "unexpected".</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">This was linked with the following representation:
 "The pharmacological study just presented has demonstrated the interesting inhibitory properties towards platelet aggregation of the compound Id and the absence of any activity of its isomer Il.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">" (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">) 
123 Those statements were obviously designed to support the claim to novelty for the dextro-rotatory enantiomer --- to counter any suggestion that this was merely another use for a known substance and, in particular, to support a claim for novelty based upon selection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">124 The other representation was the statement:
 "The racemic mixture corresponding to this formula was described in the French patent application published under the No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">2 530 247.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">" 
It was suggested that the use of the expression "racemic mixture" impliedly represented that the French patent did not describe or disclose the enantiomers of the compound referred to in that patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">That representation would again go to the question of novelty of claim 1 and dependent claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">Furthermore, it would only be established if the earlier specification did disclose the enantiomer in a way that would destroy novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">In Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd 213 ALR 182 , 63 IPR 85 I had to consider a similar argument based upon what was said to the office about an article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">I said (213 ALR 182, 63 IPR 85 at [120]):
 "This is a difficult ground to establish where the statement that is attacked purports to be a conclusion drawn from a published article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">The patent office and others with an interest are all able to read the article and form independent judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">" 
The same point would apply here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">125 As I have found that claim 1 and dependent claims lack novelty, this ground adds nothing to that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">The 1990 Act contemplates revocation claim by claim (s 138(3)); the 1952 Act ground is "that the patent was obtained on a false suggestion or representation" (s 100(1)(k)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Nonetheless, the Full Court in ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corp Inc [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at [93] held that the opening words of s 100(1) of the 1952 Act contemplated claim by claim revocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">126 It was submitted for the patentee that the descriptions "unexpected" and "interesting" are expressions of opinion and can only be falsified or made misleading by establishing that they were not genuinely held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">That distinction is well-known in the fields of misrepresentation, misleading conduct contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and defamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">There is a good deal to commend the approach in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">There is material in the internal documents of Sanofi-Aventis that would provide some support for such a case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">However, it was pointed out on behalf of Sanofi-Aventis that such a case had not been pleaded or presented by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Further, that does not appear to be the way in which the issue was approached by the Full Court in Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 at [131] ---[141] where it was considered objectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">The decision of the Full Court in ICI Chemicals [2000] FCA 1349 ; 106 FCR 214 may support an objective approach as it was held that a false suggestion or representation may be made in good faith --- although the false statement in that case could possibly be regarded as a statement of fact not a statement of opinion (see ICI Chemicals [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at [88] ---[91]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">127 Viewed in an objective fashion, if the question is asked, "'surprising' and 'unexpected' to whom?</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">", presumably the answer would be, "to a notional person skilled in the art in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">On that basis I would not conclude that the statements were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">At the priority date, it was known to those in the field in Australia that at one end of the spectrum each enantiomer would contribute equally to the activity of the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">At the other end of the spectrum, one would have all of the activity and the other none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">Both of those results were known to be possible, but the usual result would be somewhere between the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">Prediction, without testing, was not regarded as reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">To say that a possible result at one end of the spectrum, even if unlikely, was unexpected cannot be categorised as false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">The statement that the result was "interesting" is even more difficult to falsify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">128 Even if the statements were false, it must be asked whether the suggestion or representation was "a material inducing factor which led to the grant" ( ICI Chemicals [2000] FCA 1349 ; (2000) 106 FCR 214 at [88] citing Prestige Group (Aust) Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1990) 26 FCR 197 at 201 per Lockhart J and 218 per Gummow J, with whom Northrop J agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">129 In Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 it was said (at [135]---[138]):
 "The ground of false suggestion or misrepresentation must involve some misleading or deception of the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate, being the person who makes the grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">To establish the ground, there must be a finding that the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate was in some way misled or deceived by the suggestion or representation in question and that being so misled or deceived contributed to or caused the decision to grant the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">The Commissioner was a party to the proceeding but took no substantive part in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">The Commissioner may have taken the view that Ranbaxy was prosecuting the alleged grounds of invalidity with sufficient vigour for the Commissioner not to be involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">Ranbaxy adduced no evidence as to the way in which the alleged false suggestions or misrepresentations operated on the decision making process of the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">Where it is alleged that a patent was obtained on or by false suggestion or misrepresentation, it is relevant, although not decisive, that the Commissioner has made no complaint about being misled or deceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">In the absence of an allegation of fraud, which involves an examination of the state of mind of the patent applicant, it is not sufficient to make out the ground of false suggestion or misrepresentation to prove simply that a false or misleading statement was made and nothing else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">That is to say, even if a suggestion or representation is shown to be false or misleading, that, of itself, is not sufficient reason to draw an inference that the suggestion or representation contributed to the decision to grant the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">In the present case, there was no explicit evidence to the effect that, if there had been no assertion that the effectiveness of the relevant compounds was surprising and unexpected, the Enantiomer Patent would not have been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">While inferences can be drawn, in the absence of any evidence concerning the Commissioner's decision making process, the inferences must be reasonably cogent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">" (Original emphasis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">) 
In that case the examiner had questioned the patentability of the claim to the enantiomer where the racemate had previously been published.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">The statements which were found to be false were made on behalf of the patentee in order to overcome the examiner's objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">In those circumstances, the Full Court agreed with the conclusion of the primary judge that the necessary element of causation was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">130 However, in the present case the Patent Office file shows no indication that the examiner was conscious of any potential problem or raised one with the patentee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">That being so, the approach of the Full Court in Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 would require a negative answer to the question as to whether the false statements did materially induce the decision (see also ICI Chemicals [2000] FCA 1349 ; 106 FCR 214 at [92] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">In any event, I would be inclined to think that by the time this application was being considered, patent officers would have regarded the description of a finding as "unexpected" or "interesting" in the field of selection patents as likely to be a patent attorney's "puff" rather than a serious statement of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">Inutility 
 
131 The last ground of invalidity to be considered is that the alleged invention is not useful (1952 Act s 100(1)(h); 1990 Act s 138(3)(b), together with the definition of "patentable invention" provided by Sch 1 and s 18 cumulatively).</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">The particulars pressed at the hearing were as follows:
 
 
 "5.1 The alleged invention does not achieve, or is not capable of achieving, the results promised for it in the Specification, in that, in light of the Common General Knowledge: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of the Compound does not exhibit activity in an "unexpected" manner as suggested at page 1a, line 25 of the Specification; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the inhibitory properties of the dextro-rotatory enantiomer of the Compound referred to at page 20, lines 1---2 of the Specification were not "interesting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">" " 
 
 
 
That way of putting the ground can hardly rise higher than the false representation case and fails for the same reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">That relieves me from deciding whether, in any event, the objection is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">My inclination is to think that it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">132 "Utility" in this sense "depends upon whether, by following the teaching of the complete specification, the result claimed is produced" ( Advanced Building Systems [1998] HCA 19 ; 194 CLR 171 at [24] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">The result claimed may cover two aspects --- one is physically producing a result and the other is producing a result that is useful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Useful in this sense does not mean commercially successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">Put another way, Gummow J in Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 96 approved the following statement of general principle:
 "If an invention does what it is intended by the patentee to do, and the end attained is itself useful, the invention is a useful invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">" 
133 Here, there is no suggestion that any of the process claims do not work in that sense and there is no suggestion that the compounds claimed do not usefully inhibit platelet aggregation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Indeed, it has not been contended that the compounds claimed are not better in that respect than the racemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">I do not see that the claims that the properties were "unexpected" or "surprising" have anything to do with that concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">The decision of Young J in Ranbaxy [2006] FCA 1787 , 71 IPR 46 must have been based upon the view that the specification there was construed as promising a particular level of result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">The correctness of the decision on this point was left open in the Full Court ( Ranbaxy [2008] FCAFC 82 at [142] ---[144]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">CONCLUSION 
 
134 Claim 1 is invalid on the ground of lack of novelty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">Claims 10 and 11 as presently framed fall with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Claims 6---9 inclusive are invalid on the ground of lack of inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">All other grounds of invalidity are dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">135 The proceeding will stand over for a limited period for orders to be made, either by agreement or after argument, including orders for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">The parties should also consider whether any necessary issue has been overlooked in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-five (135) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
