1 This proceeding concerns an appeal against the rejection of a proof of debt by the administrator of Federation Health Limited ("Federation Health").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It was instituted in this Court in reliance on reg 5.6.54 of the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth) ("the Regulations ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I will need to return to the applicability of this regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">FACTS AND ISSUES 
 
2 The plaintiff is a firm of accountants which performed accountancy services for Federation Health from 22 June 2004 until approximately 8 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The invoice for this work has been partly paid by the administrator of Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The disputed proof of debt relates to the unpaid balance of the invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The relevant work was performed on behalf of the plaintiff by Glenn Anthony Crisp ("Crisp"), a partner, and Terrence Joseph Sandy ("Sandy"), a senior manager who worked directly under Crisp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The initial engagement occurred at about midday on 22 June 2004 during the course of a telephone conversation between Sandy and David Dawson ("Dawson") of Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Sandy and Dawson had previously worked together at another accountancy firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Dawson told Sandy that Federation Health was experiencing financial difficulties and its directors wanted representatives of the plaintiff to attend a board meeting in Moe that evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The focus of concern was the financial state of Yallourn Friendly Society ("YFS"), a subsidiary of Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 Sandy and Crisp left Melbourne almost immediately to attend the premises of Federation Health at Moe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On arrival, they carried out a preliminary investigation of the financial position of YFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They both attended a meeting of the board of directors of Federation Health ("the Board") that evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 At the meeting, Crisp advised the directors that, in his opinion, the best option for Federation Health would be to cease funding the operations of YFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Crisp declined an offer of appointment as administrator of YFS until the position of that company had been fully reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The directors asked Crisp and Sandy to prepare an urgent written report for the acting Chief Executive Officer of Federation Health ("the acting CEO") and the Board advising on what action they should take in relation to YFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 On 28 June 2004, Sandy prepared a letter of engagement in consultation with Crisp ("the letter of engagement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The letter of engagement stated:
 
 "Dear Sir 
 
 Re: Federation Health &amp; Controlled Entities 
 
 We refer to the visit of Mr Glenn Crisp and Mr Terry Sandy to the abovenamed company on 22 June, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 Following that meeting the association would like to engage Birdanco Practice Trust trading as RSM Bird Cameron to undertake the following work: 
 
 
 &#61912; Attend company premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 &#61912; Review company records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 &#61912; Liaise with employees, management and directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 In order to compile a brief draft report to be submitted to Federation Health on Wednesday 30 June, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The report should cover the following: 
 
 
 &#61912; Current financial position of Yallourn Friendly Society ('YFS') 
 &#61912; The estimated financial position if YFS is placed into administration and the operations closed compared to the estimated outcome if YFS is traded on and sole as a going concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 &#61912; The estimated impact upon Federation Health of the closure and administration of YFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 &#61912; Any other relevant matter arising from the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 &#61912; If required to investigate the financial position of Federation Health, in a time frame to be agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 
 We understand that Mr Glenn Crisp will be responsible for the assignment and Mr Terry Sandy will be attending the premises on 29 June, 2004 in his stead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Crisp has also agreed to attend Federation Health on Wednesday 30 June, 2004 and meet with members of the PHIAC at that time and as required after that date.</sentence>

 Should you have any queries do not hesitate to Mr David Dawson at this office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">" 
 

Sandy emailed the letter of engagement to Dawson on 28 June 2004, and requested that Dawson put the engagement letter on the letterhead of Federation Health and return the signed letter to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">8 There was a substantial amount of work involved in the preparation of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Sandy attended Federation Health on 29 and 30 June and 1 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The drafting of the report was undertaken by Sandy but it was reviewed and approved by Crisp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">9 The report was delivered to Federation Health on 8 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It was accompanied by a letter dated 8 July 2004 from the plaintiff to Mrs Wendy Robinson ("Robinson"), the acting CEO from October 2002 to 17 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">This letter made several references to a letter of instruction dated 28 June 2004 from Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">10 On 23 July 2004, the plaintiff sent Federation Health an invoice for the work it had performed requiring payment of $27,734.04 including GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Federation Health paid the sum of $11,000 on 14 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Crisp became aware of this part payment in early November 2004 when he reviewed the debtor's ledger as at 31 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Subsequently, Federation Health paid a further sum of $927.14 in respect of out of pocket expenses incurred by the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The invoice remains unpaid to the extent of $15,806.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">11 The defendant, Peter James Hedge, was appointed administrator of Federation Health on 14 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The appointment was made by the Private Health Insurance Administration Council ("PHIAC") pursuant to s 82XD of the National Health Act 1953 (Cth) ("the NH Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Federation Health is a registered organisation for the purposes of the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">12 There is no dispute between the parties that the plaintiff performed accountancy services for Federation Health between 22 June and 8 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The only issue is whether it was a term of the engagement of the plaintiff by Federation Health that the plaintiff would cap its fees at $10,000 plus GST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The plaintiff contends that it never agreed to the imposition of this cap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">13 In oral evidence given at the hearing of the appeal, Sandy said that he received a telephone call from Dawson early in July 2004 during which Dawson said words to the effect that the plaintiff should agree to cap its fees at a figure, which Sandy thinks may have been $10,000 or a similar figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Sandy said he responded that the firm had already expended more than the specified sum in the work it had already done and would not agree to the suggested cap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Sandy did not raise the cap proposal with Crisp at this time because he immediately formed the view that it was not something the firm would agree to and he had told Dawson so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">There was no other evidence concerning this conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Dawson did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The defendant tendered an affidavit, without objection, that said that Dawson was unwilling to give evidence to assist the defendant with whom he was in dispute about other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">14 The defendant relies upon an unsigned copy of a revised engagement letter dated 28 June 2004 that was obtained from the records of Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This letter is in similar terms to the letter of engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">However, it includes the additional statement that '[y]our fees for this stage of the assignment will be capped at $10,000 plus GST and expenses' ("the revised engagement letter").</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">15 The defendant did not adduce any evidence concerning the dispatch or other communication of the revised engagement letter to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Both Sandy and Crisp said that they did not receive the revised engagement letter at the time they were dealing with Federation Health in June and July 2004, or indeed at any time prior to their invoice being disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">THE PROOF OF DEBT PROCEDURE 
 
16 The proof of debt procedure came about as a result of a scheme of arrangement between Federation Health and LaTrobe Health Services Inc ("LaTrobe").</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">LaTrobe is another registered organisation under the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">17 On 2 March 2005, the defendant recommended to PHIAC that, subject to Court approval, Federation Health and LaTrobe should merge by means of a scheme of arrangement which provided for the transfer to LaTrobe of the health fund conducted by Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">18 On 23 June 2005, Emmett J ordered that a scheme of arrangement between Federation Health and LaTrobe be approved pursuant to s 82XZE of the NH Act , and that it be implemented in accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement Deed between Federation Health, LaTrobe and the defendant ("the Deed").</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">19 The Deed provides that certain assets and liabilities will be transferred from Federation Health to LaTrobe, and that outstanding liabilities of Federation Health not being transferred to LaTrobe will be satisfied by the defendant in accordance with the procedures set out in sch 4 to the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In summary, sch 4 requires the defendant to place advertisements requesting creditors to submit claims, and provides that the defendant will make a determination whether submitted claims should be admitted or rejected, in whole or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">20 Schedule 4 of the Deed also contains provisions under which a creditor can appeal against the defendant's rejection of a proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Clauses 2.10, 2.11, 2.13 and 2.14 provide as follows:
 
 "2.10 Declaration of Court 
 
 
 
 A Creditor who receives notice from the Administrator under paragraph 2.9 may, within 21 days of the date of the notice or any further time the Court allows, in a court of competent jurisdiction: 
 
 
 (a) if s.1321 of the Corporations Act applies to the Scheme, appeal against the Administrator's decision under that section as applied; or 
 (b) commence a proceeding disputing the Administrator's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 
 Unless the Creditor commences a proceeding under this paragraph within that 21 day period, or any further period the Court allows, the Administrator's decision is final.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 
 
 
 2.11 Entry on Admitted List after Court Order or Correction 
 
 
 
 The Administrator must, on or after the later of: 
 
 
 (a) the 21 st day after the date of a notice served in accordance with paragraph 2.9; or 
 (b) the date of the order of the court in a proceeding commenced under paragraph 2.10, 
 
 
 enter a Claim on, or amend the Admitted List, as appropriate, in accordance with the notice or any order of the Court, as the case may require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 2.13 Application of Corporations Regulations 
 
 Regulations 5.6.40 to 5.6.47 and 5.6.49 of the Corporations Regulations will, except where inconsistent with the express terms of the Scheme, apply to the Scheme as if the references to the liquidator were references to the Administrator, references to winding up were references to the Scheme and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.14 Application of Corporations Act provisions 
 
 Subdivisions A, B, C and E of Division 6 of Part 5.6 of the Corporations Act apply to Claims made under the Scheme as if the references to the liquidator were references to the Administrator, references to winding up were references to the Scheme, and with such other modifications as are necessary to give effect to the Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" 
 
 
 

21 Both parties submitted that the defendant was acting under these provisions when he called for, received, and then partially rejected the plaintiff's proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION 
 
22 It is helpful to commence with a discussion of Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 ("the Act "), which contains provisions relating to voluntary administrations and deeds of company arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">23 Most deeds of company arrangement contain provisions under which the administrator of the deed is required to adjudicate upon proofs of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Section 444A(5) provides that the deed is taken to include the prescribed provisions, except so far as it provides otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Regulation 5.3A.06 says that the prescribed provisions are set out in sch 8A to the Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Clause 8 of sch 8A provides that sub-divisions A, B, C and E of Div 6 of Pt 5.6 of the Act apply to claims made under the deed as if the references to the liquidator in those sub-divisions were references to the administrator of the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">These sub-divisions include ss 553 to 554J and ss 563B to 564 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">24 As the Act applies in this way, relevant regulations concerning proofs of debt will also apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Those regulations include reg 5.6.54 which provides: 
 
 
 "(1) Within 7 days after the liquidator has rejected all or part of a formal proof of debt or claim, the liquidator must: 
 
 
 (a) notify the creditor of the grounds for that rejection in accordance with Form 537; and 
 (b) give notice to the creditor at the same time: 
 (i) that the creditor may appeal to the Court against the rejection within the time specified in the notice, being not less than 14 days after service of the notice, or such further period as the Court allows; and 
 (ii) that unless the creditor appeals in accordance with subparagraph (i), the amount of his or her debt or claim will be assessed in accordance with the liquidator's endorsement on the creditor's proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 
 
 (2) A person may appeal against the rejection of a formal proof of debt or claim within: 
 
 
 (a) the time specified in the notice of the grounds of rejection; or 
 (b) if the Court allows -- any further period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 
 
 (3) The Court may extend the time for filing an appeal under subregulation (2), even if the period specified in the notice has expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 (4) If the liquidator has admitted a formal proof of debt or claim, the notice of dividend is sufficient notice of the admission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">" 
 
 
 

25 Decisions of an administrator under a deed of company arrangement entered into pursuant to Pt 5.3A can be the subject of an appeal to the Court under s 1321 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It provides:
 
 "A person aggrieved by any act, omission or decision of: 
 
 (a) a person administering a compromise, arrangement or scheme referred to in Part 5.1 ; or 
 (b) a receiver, or a receiver and manager, of property of a corporation; or 
 (c) an administrator of a company; or 
 (ca) an administrator of a deed of company arrangement executed by a company; or 
 (d) a liquidator or provisional liquidator of a company; 
 
 may appeal to the Court in respect of the act, omission or decision and the Court may confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision, or remedy the omission, as the case may be, and make such orders and give such directions as it thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">" 
 

26 The Court's jurisdiction to entertain this appeal arises in a more circuitous way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Here, there is no deed of company arrangement that would attract the prescribed provisions of cl 8 of sch 8A of the Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The NH Act does not directly apply Div 6 of Pt 5.6 to administrations conducted under the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Section 82XB of the NH Act does not assist because it only applies Div 7A of Pt 5.6 to such administrations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">27 In proposing the scheme of arrangement between Federation Health and LaTrobe, the defendant was acting under s 82XZC(8) of the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Subject to Court order, this sub-section allows an administrator to recommend the implementation of a scheme of arrangement concerning the business of the fund or organisation under administration, if the administrator is of the opinion that the scheme is in the best interests of contributors to the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Section 82XZC(9) goes on to provide that the scheme may make provision for the transfer to another registered organisation of the fund under administration or the fund conducted by the organisation under administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The scheme in question fits this description and was approved by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">28 Under s 82XZE(3) of the NH Act , the order of the Court approving the scheme of arrangement is binding on all persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">This provisions is reinforced by s 82ZA which provides, inter alia , that an order of the Court relating to the implementation of a scheme of arrangement prepared by the administrator is binding on all persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">29 As I have already noted, the Deed contains provisions requiring the defendant to adjudicate upon proofs of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Those provisions specifically applied sub-divisions A, B, C and E of Div 6 of Pt 5.6 of the Act to claims made under the Deed as if the references to the liquidator in those sections were references to the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Sections 553 and 553D of the Act therefore apply to this administration as do those regulations which deal with the proofs of debt, their adjudication and the lodging of an appeal to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Under Pt 9.12 of the Act , the Regulations apply of their own force so as to facilitate the operation of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Consequently, reg 5.6.54 applies to this administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">30 In my opinion, jurisdiction to entertain this appeal is conferred on this Court by the combined effect of the orders of Emmett J, the Deed and the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In particular, reg 5.6.54 applies by force of Commonwealth law, and that suffices to give this Court jurisdiction to dispose of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Section 82ZE of the NH Act gives this Court jurisdiction to hear and determine applications under Pt VIA of the NH Act and to make any necessary orders in respect of those applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In my opinion, this appeal falls within s 82ZE; it is an application that arises under the Deed that has legal force and effect by virtue of Pt VIA of the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">I also consider that in hearing and determining this appeal this Court is exercising jurisdiction in a matter arising under laws made by the Commonwealth Parliament: see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">31 Clause 2.10 of sch 4 of the Deed reflects some doubt whether s 1321 of the Act applies to decisions made by the defendant under the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I have not been directed to, and I have not found, any provision stating that s 1321 can be read as if it applies to decisions of a person who is an administrator of a registered organisation under the NH Act , where those decisions are made in the course of administering a scheme of arrangement pursuant to ss 82XZC and 82XZE of the NH Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The parties in this case argued that, as sub-divisions A, B, C and E of Div 6 of Pt 5.6 and reg 5.6.54 apply to this administration, s 1321 should be construed so that it applies to the defendant's decision to reject the proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The immediate difficulty confronting this argument is that s 1321 specifically lists the cases in which it is to apply, and none of them arise here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The parties attempted to meet this point by arguing that the defendant is deemed by s 82XB of the NH Act to be 'an administrator of a deed of company arrangement' within the meaning of ss 9 and 1321 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">More particularly, this deeming was said to be effected by s 82XB(2)(b) of the NH Act , insofar as it provides that Div 10 of Pt 5.3A of the Act regulates the administration of registered organisations such as Federation Health, and Div 10 contains s 444B(6) which provides for the execution of deeds of company arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">I have serious reservations whether s 82XB effects a deeming of the kind asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">However, it is unnecessary for me to express a final view about the application of s 1321 , as I am satisfied that reg 5.6.54 applies by force of the NH Act , and that it confers jurisdiction on this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">THE NATURE OF THIS APPEAL 
 
32 In hearing an application under s 1321 and/or reg 5.6.54, the Court conducts a hearing de novo : see Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 ( "Tanning Research" ) per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 339 and 341; Re North Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (2000) 34 ACSR 630 per Bryson J at 631 [3]; and Brodyn Pty Ltd v Dasein Constructions Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1230 ( "Brodyn" ) per Young CJ at [29]---[33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">33 In Tanning Research , Brennan and Dawson JJ said that the principles which determine the enforceability of a liability to which a proof of debt relates are, in the main, the same as the principles which would be applied in an action brought directly against the company to enforce that liability (at 339).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Their Honours went on to explain the role played by a liquidator or administrator in an appeal brought under s 1321 or reg 5.6.54 (at 341): 
 
 "In such a proceeding, a liquidator who defends his decision to reject a proof of debt is no longer acting in a quasi-judicial capacity; he is cast in the role of an adversary, defending the assets available for distribution against a liability which, according to the view he formed when acting quasi-judicially, is not legally enforceable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The liquidator may defend those assets against the creditor's claim on any ground on which the company might have defended the claim had it been sued by the creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If the liquidator relies on those special defences which allow him to go behind a judgment, an account stated, a covenant or an estoppel in order to ascertain the true liability of the company, he is none the less in the role of an adversary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The issue in the proceeding is whether the liability referred to in the proof of debt is a true liability of the company enforceable against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The issue is contested between the putative creditor on the one hand and the liquidator on the other; the liquidator is a party litigant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">And none the less so though the liquidator is required to act fairly in conducting the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">" 
 

34 In a hearing de novo , the Court will act on the evidence that is placed before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">However, the onus remains with the party who challenges the decision to reject the proof of debt: see Westpac Bank Incorporation v Totterdell (1997) 25 ACSR 769 per Templeman J at 772 and 774.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">There is, however, no rule or practice whereby material that was placed before the liquidator or administrator is automatically material before the Court on the hearing of such an appeal: see Brodyn at [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">35 In determining the appeal, the Court can confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision of the liquidator or administrator and may make such orders and give such directions as it thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Where the Court forms the view that the claimed debt has been established, the usual form of order would be that the administrator or liquidator should admit the claim in the relevant sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">36 In my view, these principles apply to this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">THE DEBT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED 
 
37 The evidence is clear that the plaintiff was contractually retained by Federation Health on 22 June 2004 to perform accountancy services for Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The plaintiff's assistance was required urgently, and Crisp and Sandy commenced work immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">38 There was no discussion of fees at the time that the plaintiff was first retained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">A reasonable bystander would infer that the plaintiff was retained to provide accountancy services in accordance with its standard fee schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">39 When Crisp and Sandy attended Federation Health's premises in Moe on 23 June 2004, there was no discussion of fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">At the meeting that evening, Crisp and Sandy were asked to prepare a report for the Board as a matter of urgency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Again, a reasonable bystander would infer that the parties agreed that the work on the report would be carried out in accordance with the plaintiff's standard fee schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">40 In these circumstances, the crucial question is whether the plaintiff subsequently agreed to cap its fees at $10,000 plus GST and out of pocket expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">There is no evidence that it did; the only evidence before me of any communication concerning the capping of fees is the evidence given by Sandy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He said that he rejected Dawson's proposal that a cap should apply to the plaintiff's fees when the matter was raised by Dawson in the course of their telephone conversation in early July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">41 The defendant relied on the following grounds to reject the plaintiff's proof of debt:
 
 &#8226; "The letter of engagement issued by Federation Health on 28 June 2004 placed a cap of $10,000 plus GST and expenses on the work undertaken; 
 &#8226; The company further evidenced this arrangement when it paid $11,000.00 on receipt of your invoice; 
 &#8226; RSM Bird Cameron evidenced its receipt of the letter of engagement of 28 June 2004 as it was referred to in the report dated 8 July 2004; 
 &#8226; RSM Bird Cameron has been unable to provide any written evidence requested in my notice dated 25 August 2005 that would contradict the records of Federation Health regarding the terms of the engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">" 
 
 

42 There is no evidence that Federation Health sent the revised engagement letter to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The only evidence before me is that an unsigned copy of the revised engagement letter was found in the records of Federation Health, and that a copy of it was sent to the plaintiff by a representative of the defendant after the defendant had refused to pay the invoice in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">43 There was no evidence establishing that the revised engagement letter was in fact sent to Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The defendant relied upon Robinson's affidavit, which exhibited a copy of the revised engagement letter, but said nothing about its dispatch to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The affidavit went on to depose to a conversation which took place between Dawson and Robinson, internally within Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The evidence, which was not objected to, was that they discussed between themselves that they only agreed to pay the plaintiff $10,000, and that Dawson would speak to the plaintiff about the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In my opinion, this evidence goes nowhere near establishing that agreement was reached with the plaintiff that the plaintiff would accept a cap of $10,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">44 As I have already mentioned, Sandy gave evidence that Dawson raised the question of a cap on the plaintiff's fees with him in a telephone conversation early in July 2004, and that Sandy had immediately rejected the suggested cap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">45 In my opinion, Crisp and Sandy were honest and credible witnesses and I accept their evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">There was no contrary evidence; Dawson did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Furthermore, it is inherently probable that Sandy would have immediately rejected any suggestion of a cap when it was raised early in July 2004, given the amount of urgent work that had already been undertaken by the plaintiff to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">It is also improbable that the plaintiff would have agreed to a cap of $10,000 and then submitted an invoice which disregarded the cap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">46 On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied that there was never any communication, whether written or oral, by which the plaintiff agreed to cap its fees at $10,000 plus GST and out of pocket expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In my view, Federation Health is liable for the full amount of the plaintiff's invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It follows that the balance of the invoice, namely $15,806.90, is due and payable by Federation Health to the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">47 For the sake of completeness, I will deal briefly with the other grounds relied on by the defendant to reject the proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The defendant relied on the fact that the plaintiff's letter of 8 July 2004 expressly refers to a letter of instruction from Federation Health dated 28 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Sandy explained this reference in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">He said he drafted the report on the assumption that the letter of engagement would be returned by Federation Health in the form in which he had submitted it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I accept this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">48 There is no substance in the third ground relied upon by the defendant to reject the proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The fact that Federation Health only paid $11,000 of the invoiced sum does not afford any evidence that there was any agreement as to the cap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It simply indicates that in September and October 2004, Federation Health may have acted upon an assumption that the cap proposal had been communicated to the plaintiff and accepted by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">So far as the plaintiff's position is concerned, Crisp gave evidence that he complained about the partial payment of the invoice as soon as he noticed the discrepancy in his debtor's ledger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">49 In the course of the hearing, counsel for the defendant acknowledged that there was no evidence to support the fourth ground on which the defendant had rejected the proof of debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In particular, there was no evidence that the plaintiff had ever received a request for the provision of further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">CONCLUSION AND ORDERS 
 
50 In my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled to an order setting aside the defendant's decision to reject the plaintiff's proof of debt and an order that the defendant admit the plaintiff's outstanding claim in the sum of $15,806.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">COSTS 
 
51 It remains to deal with the costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff is entitled to the taxed costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">However, the plaintiff seeks an order that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">52 The application for indemnity costs is founded on two considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">First, the plaintiff submits that the defendant acted unreasonably in rejecting the proof of debt and in contesting this proceeding, as there was never any evidence to establish the defendant's contention that the plaintiff had agreed to cap its fees at $10,000 plus GST and out of pocket expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The second ground is that the defendant acted unreasonably by rejecting settlement proposals that were put forward by the plaintiff in November and December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The settlement proposals were tendered in evidence, without any objection from the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">53 The submissions are not without substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The defendant has relied almost entirely upon the fact that the revised letter of engagement was found in the records of Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">There is no evidence that the defendant was ever in a position to establish that the revised letter was communicated to, or accepted by, the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It appears that several considerations affected the defendant's course of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">First, the defendant attached some weight to the plaintiff's letter dated 8 July 2004 which referred to a letter of engagement from Federation Health dated 28 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Secondly, he may have been influenced by Robinson's belief, based on her conversation with Dawson, that a cap of $10,000 had been agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Thirdly, it would seem that the defendant did not have the benefit of any evidence from Dawson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Lastly, the plaintiff did not file an affidavit by Sandy and, until Sandy gave oral evidence at the hearing before me, the plaintiff had never disclosed the conversation that took place between Sandy and Dawson in early July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">54 Weighing up all of these considerations, I have decided not to order the defendant to pay costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">In the absence of an affidavit from Sandy, I consider that it was not unreasonable for the defendant to take the view that it would put the plaintiff to its proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Accordingly, the order of the Court will be that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">55 The question was raised at the hearing whether the defendant should be ordered to pay costs personally rather than being permitted to obtain an indemnity for his costs out of the funds under his administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I do not think it is necessary that I address this issue to dispose of the plaintiff's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In any event, this is not a normal administration situation where the burden of the costs order would fall upon other creditors if not paid by the defendant personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The defendant is simply paying all proper liabilities of Federation Health that were not transferred to LaTrobe pursuant to the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I was informed by counsel for the defendant that the defendant is in a position to recoup his costs out of funds provided by Federation Health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In these circumstances I do not propose to make any further order concerning costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">56 There is one outstanding procedural matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The proceeding has been commenced by naming the plaintiff as 'RSM Bird Cameron'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">This is in fact a firm or business name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The more usual course would have been to commence the proceeding in the name of 'Birdanco Nominees Pty Ltd' which practices as RSM Bird Cameron.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">While no issue was taken about the identification of the plaintiff, it may be appropriate to regularise the position by an amendment that corrects the misnomer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">I would be prepared to grant the necessary leave to amend the name of the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>
