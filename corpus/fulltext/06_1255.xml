<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 The applicant (Mr Conley) applies for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal from a judgment of a judge of the Court on 4 July 2006 that a sequestration order be made against his estate ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Conley, in the matter of Conley [2006] FCA 1011).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr Conley needs an extension of time to appeal as he did not file a notice of appeal within 21 days after the date of his Honour's judgment (O 52 r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The application was filed on 14 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 Delay 
 
 2 Mr Conley has filed an affidavit in support of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Nothing in his affidavit explains the delay in filing a notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">There does, however, appear to be some explanation for Mr Conley's delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">His Honour delivered judgment ex tempore on 4 July 2006 but his Honour's written reasons are dated 3 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr Conley, who appears in person, informs the Court that he did not wish to file his appeal until he received the written reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He also says that he relied on a Court brochure explaining that he could apply to obtain an extension of time to file a notice of appeal if the time to appeal had expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Although this provides some explanation for Mr Conley's delay, it should be noted that his Honour put Mr Conley on notice of the need to file an appeal within time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Before the lunch recess and after delivering ex tempore reasons his Honour said: 
 
 ' Mr Conley, if you want to make any application for the matter to be stayed for 21 days, if you want to consider appealing or anything like that, you had better consider your position over that period as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">' 
 
 
 3 Mr Conley replied: 
 
 ' All right, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Thank you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">'
 
 
 4 His Honour continued: 
 
 ' I am not suggesting that you should, or that I would make such an order, but that is a matter for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">' 
 
 
 5 When the matter resumed no application for a stay was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 Even if the period of time between his Honour's judgment and the publication of written reasons is sufficient to explain the delay, it is necessary to look at the merits of the proposed appeal to determine whether or not special reasons have been shown as to why there should be an extension of time ( N1202/01A v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2002) 68 ALD 21 at [13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 Grounds of appeal 
 
 7 No draft notice of appeal has been prepared by Mr Conley and he does not seek an adjournment of this application in order to prepare that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In the absence of any draft notice of appeal, I repeatedly asked Mr Conley to identify the proposed grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In response, Mr Conley consistently raised the same ground of appeal, that he had filed substantial material before his Honour and that his Honour had not and could not have read all of the material in detail in the time available to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 The consequence of that alleged failure was said to be that his Honour did not consider the evidence in the filed material and its relationship to the ground there pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The contention before his Honour was that the proceedings in this Court ('the bankruptcy proceedings') were commenced and continued by the respondent ('the Bank') as an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 Abuse of process 
 
 9 The abuse of process is said to be the issuing of the bankruptcy proceedings by the Bank for the purpose of delaying indefinitely proceedings that Mr Conley had commenced against the Bank in the New South Wales Supreme Court ('the Supreme Court proceedings').</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Supreme Court proceedings concern the manner in which the Bank, as mortgagee, exercised a power of sale over Mr Conley's home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 When asked to identify any evidence in the material tendered before his Honour directly probative of that assertion, Mr Conley was unable to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In fact, he conceded that there was no direct evidence of that nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">11 The evidence that was tendered, which included the statement of claim filed in the Supreme Court proceedings, concerned the matters in dispute in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mr Conley's submission is that his Honour should have inferred from the whole of that evidence that the bankruptcy proceedings in this Court were an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Some difficulty arises in substantiating that allegation of abuse of process because the Supreme Court proceedings were commenced on 26 June 2006, almost 5 months after the issue of the bankruptcy notice founding the proceedings in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is hard to understand how the bankruptcy proceedings could have been commenced with a view to delaying indefinitely Supreme Court proceedings which had not yet been commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">However, Mr Conley asserts that the Bank would have been aware from previous proceedings against it in the District Court of New South Wales ('the District Court proceedings') that he intended to commence the Supreme Court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">12 This matter has a complex litigation history which need not be set out here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The primary judge in his reasons set out that history in some detail, referring to the District Court proceedings, proceedings in the Local Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court proceedings (at [1] to [9]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">While his Honour did not refer in detail to the evidence before him, he was satisfied that there ' is a bona fide dispute that Mr Conley could raise in litigation to contest the exercise of the power of sale ' (at [5]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">His Honour was also satisfied that the statement of claim in the Supreme Court proceedings discloses a bona fide cause of action which was not colourable as an abuse of process (at [11]) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">His Honour noted that it was for the trustee in bankruptcy to decide whether to prosecute the Supreme Court proceedings if a sequestration order were made (at [20]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">13 The primary judge, having been presented with an admission by Mr Conley that he was insolvent, considered his task to be an inquiry as to whether Mr Conley had shown sufficient cause why a sequestration order ought not to be made pursuant to s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (at [13] to [14]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">His Honour had regard to the public interest and concluded that he was not so satisfied (at [20] to [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">14 Although Mr Conley submits that the primary judge should have inferred from the whole of the evidence before him that the bankruptcy proceedings in this Court were an abuse of process, no allegation of an abuse of process was clearly presented to his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mr Conley refers me to the first ground in his notice of grounds of opposition to the creditor's petition filed in this Court before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Ground 1 in that notice states: 
 
 ' The Applicant is manipulating the Court System to avoid or make it as difficult as possible for the Respondent to progress an ongoing claim against the Applicant in future court proceedings involving the fraudulent mortgagee sale by the Applicant of a property previously owned by the Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">' 


 
 15 By reference to the transcript before the primary judge, it is apparent that this ground was not pressed or dealt with in any detail before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The only reference to a possible abuse of process that the parties identified in the transcript of the proceedings before his Honour is a statement made by Mr Conley in the context of a discussion of the effect of the bankruptcy on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Conley submitted that the bankruptcy proceedings were intrusive, that he was unable because of personal reasons to pursue his proceedings and that: 
 
 '[i] t is a very curious matter, because it is only doing this to make it as difficult as possible for me to proceed in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">' 


 
 16 That submission, in the absence of any evidence, was insufficient to raise for consideration an allegation as serious as an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It did not provide sufficient support to ground 1 in the notice of opposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">17 An affidavit was tendered before his Honour which had been filed in the Federal Magistrates Court by Mr Conley on 6 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It annexed a number of medical reports on which Mr Conley relied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That affidavit included a paragraph stating in general terms that the respondent was attempting to prevent Mr Conley from pursuing further claims in the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">His Honour's attention was not drawn to the paragraph which, in any event, is cast in an inadmissible form and has the difficulties referred to at 11 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">18 In the affidavit in support of his application for an extension of time, Mr Conley recites a conversation which he says he overheard between solicitor and Counsel for the Bank during the District Court proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The substance of that conversation relates to the creation by the Bank of ' an indefinite delay through [the issue of] bankruptcy proceedings ' against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The conversation is denied and evidence of it was not before the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">No explanation was given why it was not adduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It would constitute new evidence on the appeal and a grant of leave to rely on it would be prejudicial to the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">This is a circumstance that argues against the proposed ground being argued on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">A sequestration order should not be refused if, apart from that alleged motive, the Bank is entitled to the order sought ( In re King; Ex parte the Commercial Bank of Australia (No 2) [1920] VLR 490 at 510; Bride v KMG Hungerfords [1998] FCA 412 at 9) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">His Honour found that to be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 The District Court transcript 
 
 19 Mr Conley also asserts that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the detail of the District Court proceedings and the fact that there was no transcript of those proceedings available, despite repeated requests having been made by Mr Conley to obtain the transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">No application for adjournment was, however, made to his Honour to delay the bankruptcy proceedings pending the receipt of any such transcript from the District Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is difficult to see how his Honour was in error in failing to take account of a transcript that was not before him or of the fact that that transcript was not yet available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 Conclusion 
 
 20 As the primary judge noted, Mr Conley has commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court and it is a matter for the trustee in bankruptcy whether or not to continue with those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">21 Even accepting that Mr Conley waited until the written reasons were available, he has not shown special reasons why an extension of time to file a notice of appeal should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He relies upon a ground of appeal not clearly raised below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That ground would need to be supported by new evidence and prejudice would be suffered by the Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">There is no demonstrable error by the primary judge, who gave detailed reasons for his decision, by reference to the evidence before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It has not been established that his Honour failed to consider any matter relevant to the decision before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">There is little prospect of success in the appeal on this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">22 In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that special reasons have been shown as to why an extension of time for filing a notice of appeal should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The application should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The applicant should pay the respondent's costs of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
