 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate quashing a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal affirming a decision of a delegate of the appellant refusing to grant a Partner (Migrant) (Class BC) visa to the first respondent (the respondent).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Pursuant to s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 the appeal is heard by a single judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The respondent is a citizen of Cambodia who first entered Australia on 25 May 2003 as the holder of a Spouse (Provisional) subclass 309 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 20 December 2002 she married Mr Makara Heng, an Australian citizen, at a ceremony in Cambodia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 On 26 February 2003 the respondent applied for her partner visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">This request was refused by the delegate on the ground that the respondent did not satisfy clause 100.221 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 , namely that she was in a spousal relationship with Mr Heng (her sponsor).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It appears that a significant reason for this refusal arose from a visit by Departmental officers to the respondent's home early in February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The officers noted that Mr Heng was absent from the house at the time of the visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">While in the house they telephoned him and asked for his whereabouts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Heng attempted to mislead the officers by insisting that he was at home with his wife, unaware that the officers were in fact calling from that very house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Upon further inspection of the house, the officers made a number of observations which led them to conclude that Mr Heng did not reside with the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The delegate's decision states:
 
 Ms You obliged the case officers by showing them through the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The case officers did not sight sufficient evidence to indicate that Mr Heng was also residing there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The evidence sighted, however, was consistent with Ms You's statement that she resides at the house with her aunt's family (consisting of her aunt, uncle and their two children).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 

4 The delegate's suspicion that Mr Heng did not reside at the respondent's address was supported by the abovementioned telephone conversation with Mr Heng.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">MIGRATION REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
 5 On 15 March 2006 the respondent applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The respondent and Mr Heng gave oral evidence and produced a number of documents in support of their claim to be in a spousal relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The Tribunal dealt with the evidence and documents at pages 7 and 8 as follows:
 
 The Tribunal gave weight to the fact that there was a paucity of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">While the Tribunal accepts that both the visa applicant and the sponsor may not be well educated and may not be able to communicate well they are required to produce basic evidence to support the assertion of a genuine spousal relationship, especially in view of the adverse material associated with the home visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The evidence produced [to] the Tribunal was very recent, and was not in itself substantial or convincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">For example while there was a joint bank account opened, it was only opened in May 2005, there was an opening balance of $20, no activity and a closing balance of $15.00 on 29 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The situation in regard to the motor vehicle was also puzzling, as an apparently poor couple were able to pay cash for a car, spending something in the area of $17,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The visa applicant indicated that the money had come from Cambodia, but the details of this were not made clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Centrelink correspondence does not provide evidence of a spousal relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The existence of joint names on the rental agreement was not in itself evidence that they cohabit at that address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">There was no supporting evidence, statements from friends, family or neighbours to indicate that they were living at that address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The photographic evidence was very limited and only showed four situations with the couple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There was no substantial evidence of social activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It was hard to ascertain a strong feeling of commitment between the couple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 

7 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on the ground that it was not satisfied the respondent and Mr Heng had a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others, and that the relationship was genuine and continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
 8 On 16 August 2006 the respondent sought judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">One of the grounds of review was that the Tribunal breached s 359A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) in failing to advise her in writing that a reason for the decision would arise from the home visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">9 The Magistrate noted that information to be disclosed pursuant to s 359A of the Act ought to include all information forming part of the reason for decision, not just the central reason (citing SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 ( SZEEU )).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Having found that the home visit formed a significant part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision, his Honour held that the Tribunal was obliged to disclose its concerns in a s 359A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Failure to do so was found to amount to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Magistrate said at [27]:
 
 In this case it appears to me that a fair reading of Section G of the application form is that its purpose is to identify the particular decision that the applicant is challenging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It would not be said that this indicates that the applicant was relying upon the information about the home visit simply because she was seeking to appeal from the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The decision of the delegate was attached for the purpose of identifying it as a decision to be appealed from, not to rely upon the evidence referred to in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The whole purpose of the application form is to challenge the very decision the Minister says the applicant should be taken to be relying upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 

The Magistrate rejected the other grounds of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">SECTION 359A 
 
10 So far as presently relevant s 359A(1)(a) requires the Tribunal to
 
 give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review .... 
 

By sub-s (4)(b) the section "does not apply to information ... that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
 
11 The notice of appeal challenges the Magistrate's decision on the grounds that his Honour erred in:
 
(a) failing to find that s 359A(4)(b) of the Act applies to all information included in the delegate's decision because the respondent gave that information to the Tribunal for the purpose of her application to the Tribunal; 
 
(b) concluding that the respondent did not "give" the information contained within the delegate's decision to the Tribunal as she did not rely upon it; and
 
(c) finding that the Tribunal was required to comply with s 359A in relation to information concerning the home visit, "because the information was relied on by the delegate, and s 359A has no application to information that was integral to the decision under review".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">First and second grounds 
 
12 These grounds can be considered together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In order to understand them, it should be recorded that the Application for Review Form to be completed by an applicant contains Section G which is headed Decision to be reviewed .</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The respondent was required to tick one of two boxes, the first of which was "I have attached a copy of the DIMIA decision and covering letter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">This box was ticked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The covering letter informed the respondent that her application had been refused, and that the reasons for decision are contained in the attached decision record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The decision record contained details of the home visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">13 Information provided to the Tribunal by someone other than the applicant has been treated as having been given by the applicant for the purposes of an application where it has been adopted by him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">See SZEEU (2006) 150 FCR at [91] and SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [36] ( SZDPY ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Similarly, it has been held that an applicant can incorporate material by reference so that it becomes part of the information given by him or her for the purpose of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">See for example SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 and VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 The Magistrate referred to some of these authorities before announcing his conclusion set out at [9].</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They may explain his Honour's reference to whether the respondent relied on the home visit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">15 The word used in s 359A(4)(b) is "gave" not "relied on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The "adoption" and "incorporation" cases ultimately proceed on the basis that because the applicant invited the Tribunal to take particular material into account, he or she can be taken to have given it to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">See, for example, M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] , SZEEU (2006) 150 FCR at [91] and [179] and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [51] ( NBKT ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">16 The present case is not one of incorporation or adoption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The respondent attached the delegate's decision (containing the home visit material) to his application to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Cf SZDPY [2006] FCA at [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Doubtless the respondent did not rely on the home visit material in the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Nevertheless he "gave" the Tribunal the delegate's decision and thus gave it the information contained in the delegate's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">An applicant's purpose or intention that the Tribunal take some information into account may explain why information not directly given to it is taken to have been given to it by him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Resort to an applicant's purpose or intention has no application to a case such as the present where information is physically handed over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Adoption or incorporation cases cannot justify reading down the word "gave" so that it means "relied on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">17 Assistance in understanding the meaning of the expression "information ... that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application" in s 359A(4)(b) is found in the two preceding sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Section 358(1) provides:
 
 An applicant for review by the Tribunal may give the Tribunal: 
 
 (a) a written statement in relation to any matter of fact that the applicant wishes the Tribunal to consider; and 
 (b) written arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 

18 Section 359 provides in part:
 
 
 (1) In conducting the review, the Tribunal may get any information that it considers relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However, if the Tribunal gets such information, the Tribunal must have regard to that information in making the decision on the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Tribunal may invite a person to give additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 

19 Section 358(1)(a) relates to information "the applicant wishes the Tribunal to consider".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">That will usually be information the applicant thinks will advance his or her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Section 359(2) on the other hand is not confined to such information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">An applicant who has given the Tribunal a written statement under s 358(1)(a) may be invited to give additional information under s 359(1) or (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That information, if supplied, will not necessarily be information the applicant thinks will assist his or her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Tribunal may seek to elicit information particularising some general assertions made in the information supplied under s 358(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The response may be that the applicant is unable to provide those particulars or the response may simply not contain adequate particularisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Thus the response may not advance the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">But it is nevertheless information the applicant has given to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Similarly with s 347(1)(a) , which provides that any application for review must "be made in the approved form".</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The form may require the applicant to provide information on which he or she does not wish to rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Any such information provided in the form is nevertheless given to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">20 Information need not be "volunteered" in order to be "given" for the purposes of s 359A(4)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It can be given in response to a question from the Tribunal rather than propounded by an applicant ab initio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FCA 851 ; (2006) 154 FCR 302 at [48] - [50] Heerey J said:
 
 
 48.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">For no apparent reason, almost all the discussion of s 424A(3)(b) in the cases proceeds on the basis that the provision uses the word 'provide'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The subsection in fact uses the verb 'to give', which simply conveys the notion of delivering or handing over (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">If this matter were free from authority, there would be much to be said for the view that an applicant 'gave' information for the purpose of the Tribunal review application if the information was delivered to the Tribunal by the applicant, whether in answer to a question asked by the Tribunal or whether volunteered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Either way, the information is conveyed from applicant to Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">If we were to read or hear 'At the trial, A gave information about fact X to the court', we would take that as equally comprehending the possibility of A giving evidence about X in chief, or in cross-examination, or in answer to a question from the judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Likewise, if an applicant says to the Tribunal 'What I said in my visa application is true' and that application contains fact X, the normal meaning conveyed would be that the applicant is giving the information constituted by fact X to the Tribunal, as well as the further fact that fact X had been asserted by the applicant when he made the visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Such a reading of s 424A(1) and (3)(b) would be consistent with common law concepts of natural justice which require the decision-maker to give the person affected notice of relevant information obtained from another source but not, generally speaking, to invite comment on the evaluation of material submitted by the person himself: see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592 and the cases there cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">
 
 
 

21 In NBKT (2006) 156 FCR at [53] the Full Court approved the above passage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Justice Heerey's reference to earlier authority ("free from authority") is to NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 357 ( NAZY ), which was put forward by the unsuccessful appellant in NBKT as authority for the proposition that information must be put to the Tribunal "in chief", rather than being elicited by the Tribunal's own questions, in order to fall within the exemption in sub-s (4)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Full Court rejected this proposition at [61] and said at [52] that NAZY was a special case and did not support a proposition of such generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">22 The word "information" in s 359A(4)(b) is thus not confined to information the applicant thinks will advance his or her case, or information upon which the applicant relies in support of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">If what is given to the Tribunal is information, it is covered by s 359A(4)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">23 After the Magistrate had reserved his decision the respondent filed a supplementary submission drawing attention to the existence of an undated file note headed Record of Home Visit prepared by the officers who conducted the visit (the Record).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Magistrate described the Record as "more expansive" than the material in the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">His Honour said at [25]:
 
 Whilst there is no specific evidence as to whether or not the Tribunal member had regard to this document, it was part of the file referred to in the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Whether it is part of the reasons for the conclusions reached by the Tribunal is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">There is a clear inference that the Tribunal member had regard to this material, as the Tribunal member formed the view that the sponsor was attempting to mislead departmental officers, whereas the delegate had taken the view that there was only a misunderstanding in the telephone conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 

24 The second and third sentences of the passage quoted at [29] do not sit happily together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">At one and the same time it is unclear whether the file note was part of the Tribunal's reasons, though there is a clear inference that it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In any event, the reason the Magistrate gives for drawing the inference, if that is what he did, is unsound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">There is nothing in the file note that could have led the Tribunal to conclude that the sponsor was attempting to mislead the officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Indeed, in the respondent's written submissions before the Magistrate it is conceded that "The record does not purport to reach a conclusion on this latter aspect" (ie whether the sponsor was attempting to mislead the officers).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Accordingly I do not draw the inference the Magistrate may have drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">25 If the Magistrate drew the inference, his Honour did not make anything of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">That is to say, his Honour decided the case (as appears at [9]) simply on the basis that the attachment of the delegate's decision to the form did not show that the appellant was relying on the information about the home visit contained in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">There is no finding of breach of s 359A on the basis of the file note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">26 On the assumption that the Magistrate did draw the inference, and that it was properly drawn, the respondent contends that even if the appellant succeeds on the first and second grounds of appeal there has been a breach of s 359A because the Tribunal did not bring the file note to her attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">This must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The information that would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review, namely the home visit, had been given to the Tribunal by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The information in the file note was the same information as that contained in the delegate's decision, though somewhat amplified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The file note is not itself a reason or a separate issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">27 The first and second grounds of appeal are made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It is not necessary to deal with the third.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The appeal is allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The order of the Magistrates Court is set aside and in lieu thereof it is ordered that the application for review be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.</sentence>
