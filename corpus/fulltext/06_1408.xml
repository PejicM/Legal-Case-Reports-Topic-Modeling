<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 The applicant applies for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith ( SZGRH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 138).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant is a national of Mongolia who speaks little or no English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">She appeared in person assisted by an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 Explanation for the delay 
 
 2 The application was filed approximately 3 weeks outside the 21 day time limit prescribed by the Federal Court Rules (O 52 r 15(1)(a)(i)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">No explanation for the delay is given, other than an assertion by the applicant that she believed that the time limit had not expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That explanation does not constitute special reasons for the grant of an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider the merits of the appeal in determining whether leave should be granted ( NBBD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1029 at [12] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 Decision of the Federal Magistrate 
 
 3 Federal Magistrate Smith set out the history of this matter in his decision at [4] to [14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In summary, the applicant lodged an application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That application was refused by a delegate of the Minister and the applicant sought review of the Minister's decision before the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The application form to the Tribunal included an authority for a migration agent (Mr Mollah) to act for the applicant in relation to her application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The form indicated that correspondence was to be sent to the applicant's residential address and that her agent was authorised to receive correspondence in connection with the review by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The form explained that, if such a person was nominated, all correspondence would be sent to that person, identified by the form as the "authorised recipient".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 Letters addressed to the applicant were sent to Mr Mollah regarding the Tribunal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">One such letter informed the applicant that the Tribunal had considered the material before it but was unable to make a decision in her favour and invited her to attend a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Smith FM summarised the steps taken by the Tribunal to notify the applicant of the hearing date through Mr Mollah (at [10] to [14]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 Prior to its attempts to contact the authorised recipient, the Tribunal was aware that the signature on the application form to the Tribunal did not match the signature on the Department's file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There is no evidence that the Tribunal was on notice that the signature on the application, while not that of the applicant, had been placed there without her authorisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 When the Tribunal received no reply to its correspondence, it made numerous attempts to contact the authorised recipient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It encountered an answering machine and left messages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">There was no response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal called the applicant on her mobile phone and left contact details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There was no response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The steps taken by the Tribunal demonstrate that the Tribunal was aware that the migration agent was not responding to its attempts to notify the applicant of the pending hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 The Tribunal noted in its reasons that the applicant did not appear and the Tribunal made a decision pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') without taking any further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">As noted by Smith FM, the application for a protection visa ' was completed with only cursory information in support of a claim for protection ' (at [4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The application to the Tribunal contained no additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal concluded that the applicant's claims were very general and lacking in useful detail and was not satisfied that she was a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">8 The applicant made unsworn claims of misconduct by her migration agent before the Federal Magistrate, specifically that she had been informed of the proposed Tribunal hearing by Mr Mollah but advised by him that she did not need to be present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">As his Honour noted, Mr Mollah's registration has since been cancelled (at [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, even accepting the assertions of misconduct to be true, his Honour was correct in finding that they do not give rise to any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal (at [27]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">9 Federal Magistrate Smith held that notice to an authorised recipient had been given in compliance with s 441G(1) of the Act and, by reason of s 441G(2) , the Tribunal was taken to have given notice to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">For that reason, his Honour held that the Tribunal had power to proceed under s 426A(1) of the Act and no jurisdictional error was established (at [23]) and [27]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 Affidavit and draft notice of appeal 
 
 10 In her affidavit in support of this application, the applicant says that she had no knowledge of the hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The applicant relies in the affidavit on the fact that the migration agent ' was not doing his job ' and that she had been unable to contact him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">She asserts that the Tribunal should have written to her because her address was also provided as an address for correspondence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">She says that this was required for a ' fair decision to be made according to law ' and that the Federal Magistrate failed to properly consider and apply s 494D of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 Consistent with her affidavit, the grounds in the draft notice of appeal assert a failure on behalf of the Federal Magistrate to apply s 494D of the Act and to consider the circumstances which led to the applicant not receiving the hearing invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">That section is not applicable to the applicant's complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">As his Honour noted, the relevant section in respect of service by the Tribunal on an applicant by his or her authorised recipient is s 441G (at [20]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">12 The remaining matters raised in the application to the Federal Magistrates Court were noted by Smith FM to give only a list of general heads of jurisdictional error without any sufficient particulars or substance (at [17]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">None of those matters are raised in the draft notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 Evidence on the application for leave 
 
 13 The applicant, in unsworn evidence, informed the Court that she had given all of her documents to Mr Mollah and that he did not notify her of the Tribunal hearing, that he was not a responsible person and had been suspended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">14 Her attention was drawn to a file entry by the Tribunal recording that the signature on the application to the Tribunal does not match that on the Department file, the latter being, presumably, the signature on the application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">A cursory examination of the two signatures confirms that notation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">15 This raised the question of the validity of the application to the Tribunal and the authority given to the migration agent to complete the form for the purposes of s 441G of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Section 441G(1) provides that the Tribunal must give the authorised recipient, instead of the applicant, any document that it would otherwise have given to the applicant if ' the applicant gives the Tribunal written notice of the name and address of another person (the authorised recipient ) authorised by the applicant to do things on behalf of the applicant that consist of, or include, receiving documents in connection with the review '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">16 The applicant was offered the option of giving evidence orally or, with an adjournment, preparing evidence in writing as to the signature and the instructions, if any, given to the migration agent with respect to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The applicant chose to give evidence orally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">17 The applicant confirmed her signature on the application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">She also confirmed she received the letter from the Department, sent to her residential address, notifying her of the Minister's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">She said that she realised that she needed to apply for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Every time that she went to her migration agent he told her not to worry and that he would take care everything, including the review proceeding before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">18 The applicant's evidence about the application to the Tribunal was not clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">She said that she thought that she would be called to attend the Tribunal hearing but did not know if the agent had lodged the application for her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">When asked how she expected to come before the Tribunal to explain her case, she responded that, by giving the documentation to her agent, she would receive a reply and attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">She said that she gave her materials to Mr Mollah and that he acted on her behalf and submitted all matters on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 The applicant's evidence was ' I just gave all my materials, all my documents to [the agent] and he acted on my behalf ' and ' I asked him to convey my, to submit my application saying all the matters on my behalf '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicant said that she had not seen her application form before and that it was not her signature on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She did not receive any letters from the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">When referred to the Tribunal file note to the effect that the Tribunal had left a message on her phone, she denied having received it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 Consideration 
 
 20 It is theoretically possible that the migration agent's authority was limited and extended to lodging the application for review but not to completing the details of the application, including signing the application and authorising the agent to receive documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, no such assertion was made by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">There is no evidence that the applicant did not intend her instructions to extend to the signing of the application on her behalf or to authorise the agent to receive correspondence on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">21 To the contrary, in the ordinary course, the instruction to the agent to submit "all the matters on my behalf" would include the completion of the application form and lodgement of the application with the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Similar instructions have been found to give rise to an authority to sign a protection visa application ( SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 at [7] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">On the basis of the evidence before me, and in circumstances where the applicant gave that general authority and expected it to result in an appearance before the Tribunal, I am satisfied that the agent's authority extended to an authorisation to sign the application form on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">22 I am also satisfied, in the circumstances, that the agent's authority extended to an authority for Mr Mollah to receive correspondence in relation to the review by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">That is, the applicant authorised the agent to give the Tribunal written notice of his own name and address as the person authorised by the applicant to receive documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Such notice was given by Mr Mollah when he completed and sent the application form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">He became an "authorised recipient" within the meaning of s 441G(1)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">23 An application to the Tribunal for review must be in the approved form (s 412(1)(a) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Accepting the applicant's evidence that the signature on the application form was not hers, a question arises as to the status of the application to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It may be that an application must be signed personally by an applicant to be in approved form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">If the application was defective for this reason, the applicant had not applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Tribunal then had no jurisdiction to hear the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It would follow that an appeal to this Court alleging a failure by the Tribunal to give notice of the hearing and failure by the Federal Magistrate to make that finding does not arise and the application for an extension of time to appeal should be refused ( SZGJO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 393 at [4] to [5]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">24 If an application form need not be signed by an applicant personally, the application for review by the Tribunal was validly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">However, as I have noted, notice was given to the Tribunal that Mr Mollah was the "authorised recipient" for the purposes of s 441G of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Where the Tribunal gives a document to the authorised recipient, the Tribunal is taken to have given the document to the applicant (s 441G(2) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Indeed, the Tribunal is required to give documents to the authorised recipient (s 441G(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Accordingly, in corresponding with the agent alone, the Tribunal did not deny the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">If the application was valid the Tribunal was entitled to proceed pursuant to s 426A of the Act and no jurisdictional error has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">25 The parties did not make submissions on whether an application to the Tribunal must be signed personally by an applicant in order to be in approved form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In any event, the proposed appeal must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It cannot be established that there has been any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">26 The application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">27 In the circumstances, the applicant may wish to seek the exercise by the Minister of her power under s 48B of the Act, thereby permitting the applicant to make a second application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
