<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 27 August 2009, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed the decisions of the first respondent's delegate not to grant the appellant a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">For the following reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">By way of background to this appeal, I note that the Tribunal accepted that the appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He arrived in Australia on 4 November 2000 as the holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, and has since held various other student visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">His most recent student visa was granted on 22 March 2005 and expired on 15 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Tribunal's reasons record that, on 14 March 2007, the appellant applied for a further Student (Temporary)(Class TU) visa making claims against subclass 572.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The delegate refused this application on 12 December 2007, upon the basis that the appellant had not satisfied the criteria for a student 572 visa, there being no evidence that: (1) overseas student health cover had been paid; (2) English proficiency requirements had been met; or (3) there were funds for support and payment of tuition fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 3 January 2008, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Tribunal subsequently affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant filed an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court, which was dismissed on 27 August 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the English proficiency requirement and had sufficient health insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Specifically: The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of subclause 572.223(2)(a)(i)(A) as contained in Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (' Migration Regulations ') because there was no evidence that the appellant completed an IELTS test pursuant to Items 5A407(a) or (b) in Schedule 5A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Further, the Tribunal also found that the appellant had not provided evidence that he met the exceptions in Items 5A407(c) to (f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of clause 572.225 as contained in Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations since the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had provided evidence of adequate arrangements for health insurance for the period of the appellant's intended stay in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">As to the lack of evidence that he met the English proficiency requirement, the Tribunal noted: 
 
 At the hearing of the Tribunal on 3 September 2008, the visa applicant claimed that he had the evidence of meeting the English language requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In his response to the Tribunal's letter, sent pursuant to section 359A, the visa applicant failed to provide evidence of having met the English language requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He clearly did not have the relevant evidence when he attended the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal is not required to delay making a decision on the prospect that the visa applicant may in the future provide evidence of having met the English language requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 In the same vein, the Tribunal said, in relation to the health cover requirement, that: 
 
 At the hearing of the Tribunal on 3 September 2008, the visa applicant claimed that he had the evidence of the necessary health insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He subsequently provided a letter dated 28 September 2008 from Medibank Private.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He clearly did not have this letter when he attended the hearing and has given no other evidence that he met the requirements for the health insurance prior to 28 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 

 The Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant met the financial requirements in clause 572.223 of Schedule 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In the Federal Magistrates Court, according to the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment, the appellant raised four grounds, namely: The Tribunal failed to accept the appellant's evidence about his proficiency in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal failed to accept the appellant's evidence about his health cover in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Tribunal failed to deal with the appellant's evidence about his finances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal failed to give sufficient time to produce the documentation that the appellant has now produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
Each of these grounds was said to amount to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Federal Magistrate rejected all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal had correctly determined that the appellant did not meet the English proficiency requirement because he neither provided evidence of an IELTS test pursuant to Items 5A407(a) or (b); nor did he meet the exceptions in Items 5A407(c), (d), (e) or (f).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Federal Magistrate also held that the Tribunal's finding that the appellant did not satisfy the health insurance requirement was also "plainly correct".</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's third ground on the basis that, having made two findings, each of which was fatal to the application, the Tribunal was not obliged to consider the appellant's finances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Finally, the Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal did not relevantly err in failing to allow the appellant further time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellant's judicial review application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The appellant appeals against his Honour's judgment on three grounds: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Federal Magistrate Court [failed] to take all relevant evidence [into account];
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">[The] appellant had provided all documents at hearing; and 
 
 [The] appellant was granted leave to enter [this] country on [a] student visa and later rules change[d].</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant and the first respondent relied on and augmented their written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Counsel for the appellant emphasized that the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Kamal [2009] FCAFC 98 was inconsistent with a part of the reasons for judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The appellant's counsel noted that the appellant had been living in Australia for nearly a decade and his position had altered because of changes in the criteria for student visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The appellant's counsel indicated that there had been some miscommunication with the Tribunal and that the appellant's former legal advisers had, or might have, given the appellant inadequate, even wrong, advice about what he need to do to obtain a student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The appellant's counsel appealed to a discretion (which I do not have) to relieve the appellant of the consequences of what he termed any technical non-compliance with the 572 visa requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">CONSIDERATION 
 Clause 572.223 of Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations sets out some of the criteria for a 572 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Specifically, at the relevant time, clause 572.223 provided in part as follows: 
 
 (1) The Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a genuine applicant for entry and stay as a student because the applicant meets the requirements of subclause (2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">(2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:
 (a) for an applicant who is not a person designated under regulation 2.07AO: 
 (i) the applicant gives to the Minister evidence, in accordance with the requirements mentioned in Schedule 5A for Subclass 572 and the assessment level to which the applicant is subject, in relation to:
 (A) the applicant's English language proficiency for the purposes of each course of study that the applicant proposes to undertake; and
 (B) the financial capacity of the applicant to undertake each of those courses of study without contravening any condition of the visa relating to work; and
 (C) other requirements under Schedule 5A ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 It is common ground that the appellant was not a person designated under regulation 2.07AO and therefore subclause 572.223(2) was applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Thus, as at the date of the decision, the appellant was required to satisfy the Minister (or the Minister's delegate) that he met the requirements of subclause 572.223(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">One of those requirements, contained in paragraph 572.223(2)(a)(i), was that he gave evidence in relation to his English language proficiency for the purposes of each course of study that he was proposing to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The evidence was to be given in accordance with the requirements mentioned in Schedule 5A and the assessment level to which he was subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The term "assessment level" was defined in regulation 1.03 to mean, in relation to a 572 visa, "the level of assessment (being level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) specified under Division 1.8 for a kind of eligible passport, within the meaning of regulation 1.40 , and for an education sector".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Division 1.8 of the Regulations, which consisted of regs 1.40 to 1.44, contained special provisions for student visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Regulation 1.41(1) provided that the Minister must specify, in relation to each subclass of student visa, an assessment level to which an applicant for a student visa would be subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Under Regulation 1.44(1), an applicant for a student visa was required to give evidence about the applicant's English language proficiency in accordance with the requirements set out in Schedule 5A for the relevant subclass of visa and the assessment level to which the applicant was subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In accordance with the Regulations, the Minister specified in a Gazette Notice that a Bangladesh passport was one to which assessment level 3 applied, for applications for 572 visas lodged on or after 1 November 2004: see Commonwealth of Australia Gazette Notice GN 42, 26 October 2005 "Specification of Assessment Levels for Kinds of Eligible Passport In Relation to Subclasses of Student Visa for the Purposes of Regulation 1.41 of the Migration Regulations 1994 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The requirements for assessment at level 3 appeared in a number of items, but, for present purposes, it is enough to refer to Item 5A407.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Item 5A407 contemplated various possibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">One possibility was that contained in Item 5A407(a), which provided, relevantly, that an applicant must give evidence that the applicant: 
 
 (i) will not undertake an ELICOS before commencing his or her principal course; and
 (ii) achieved, in an IELTS test that was taken less than 2 years before the date of the application, an Overall Band Score of at least 5.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 

Another possibility was that contained in Item 5A407(b), which provided, relevantly, that an applicant must give evidence that the applicant:
 
 
 (&#953;) will undertake an ELICOS of no more than 30 weeks duration before commencing his or her principal course; and
 (ii) achieved, in an IELTS test that was taken less than 2 years before the date of the application, an Overall Band Score of at least 4.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 

An ELICOS is a registered English language intensive course for overseas students.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">An IELTS test is the International English Language Testing System test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Thus, Item 5A407 contemplated that, by the time of the decision, an applicant might or might not have achieved an appropriate level of proficiency in English, as evidenced by the result of an IELTS test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">If the applicant had not achieved the relevant level of proficiency, he or she had to undertake an ELICOS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">If the applicant had achieved the relevant level of proficiency, he or she did not need to undertake further tuition, such as an ELICOS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Item 5A407 contemplated other possibilities but it is unnecessary to set them out here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">For the purposes of this case, the other relevant criterion was that contained in clause 572.225 of Schedule 2, which required that the appellant gave the Minister (or Minister's delegate) "evidence of adequate arrangements in Australia for health insurance during the period of [his] intended stay in Australia".</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">As noted above, at the hearing before the Tribunal, the appellant told the Tribunal that he had evidence of English language capacity, health insurance cover, and sufficient funds, but had not brought this material with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Tribunal subsequently sent the appellant a letter (dated 3 September 2008), in which the Tribunal invited him to provide this further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The letter clearly stated that the Tribunal required this material by 1 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The letter warned that "[i]f the Tribunal does not receive your comments or response within the period allowed or as extended, it may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain your views on the information".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Apparently in response, the appellant provided, without any covering explanation: A letter from Medibank Private which showed that the appellant had health insurance from 24 September 2008 to 24 December 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Tribunal erroneously substituted "28 September 2008" for "24 September 2008", but nothing turns on this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">A receipt dated 1 October 2008 for an IELTS test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Certificate of completion of an English language course in Dhaka in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Certificate of completion of an ELICOS course in January 2001 with a score of 2 in each of the four test components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">A letter dated 30 January 2008 from a bank in Bangladesh stating that a bank account in a certain sum was held by two people, whom the appellant claimed at the hearing claimed were his father and his late grandfather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">A bank statement of M/S Alam International from 1 January 2007 to 30 December 2007 with various balances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
At the hearing on 3 September 2008, the appellant had previously provided items numbered 5 and 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">As we have seen the Tribunal found that, notwithstanding this evidence, the appellant had not provided evidence of having met the requirement for English language proficiency or health insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Tribunal handed down its decision on 3 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">At the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant sought to tender two documents: (1) an IELTS test report form of a test apparently conducted on 17 January 2009; and (2) a letter dated 28 May 2009 from Medibank Private, confirming that the appellant had health cover from 24 September 2008 to 24 March 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The Federal Magistrate held that neither of these documents was admissible as they "were plainly not before the Tribunal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">On the appeal, by ground 1 set out earlier, the appellant challenges his Honour's ruling as to admissibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">For the reasons that follow, I would reject this challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">First, it must be borne in mind that, on a judicial review application, it was not open to his Honour to engage in a re-examination of the findings of facts made by the Tribunal, or in a reassessment of the evidence relating to those facts: see, for example, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41-2 per Mason J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Since it was not open to the Federal Magistrate to re-examine the Tribunal's findings of fact, evidence sought to be led for this purpose was irrelevant on the judicial review application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It is clear enough that the appellant wanted to have these additional documents admitted into evidence in order to contradict the factual findings made by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This could not be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Put another way, a ground advanced before the learned Federal Magistrate on a judicial review application was relevant only in so far as it raised the possibility of jurisdictional error on the Tribunal's part: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351 per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The material in question was irrelevant to any possibility of jurisdictional error of the kind the appellant raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The material could not have affected the questions whether (as the appellant alleged) the Tribunal erred (in any jurisdictional sense) in failing to accept the appellant's proficiency in English, sufficiency of health insurance, or adequacy of finances because none of the material in question was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Tribunal was bound to decide the matters before it on the basis of whatever material was before it at the time it made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">There could be no jurisdictional error in failing to consider material that was not before the Tribunal at that time (and, indeed, came into existence at a later date).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Nor, in the circumstances, could this material have affected the question whether the Tribunal failed to give the appellant sufficient time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">This is because the proposition that the Tribunal was, for some unascertained reason, obliged to delay its decision from a date shortly after its stated deadline of 1 October 2008 (see its letter of 3 September 2008) until some date after 28 May 2009 (see the Medibank letter) or 17 January 2009 (see IELTS test form) was patently untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Further, whilst a failure on a Tribunal's part to allow an applicant additional time to lead evidence can, in some circumstances, amount to a lack of procedural fairness and constitute jurisdictional error, this was not the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In its letter of 3 September 2008, the Tribunal advised the appellant that he could ask the Tribunal for more time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Had the appellant, made this request, the Tribunal would have been obliged to give due consideration to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The appellant did not, however, make any such request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The importance of this material was evident from the Tribunal's letter and had been discussed with the appellant at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">As the Federal Magistrate found, there was no procedural unfairness in the Tribunal making its decision on the basis of the material before it, without delaying its decision further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The appellant's second ground that he "provided all documents at hearing" would appear to be no more than a re-statement of the first ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The appellant's third ground --- that he "was granted leave to enter [this] country on [a] student visa and later rules change[d]" --- does not disclose any possibility of jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The appellant's student visa application was refused because he did not satisfy the decision maker that he met the prevailing and applicable criteria for the grant of a student visa at the relevant times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It is irrelevant that the appellant had previously been granted a student visa and that some visa criteria may have changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">For these reasons, the grounds that the appellant raised by his notice of appeal must fail as disclosing no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Moreover, consideration of the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate indicates that his Honour reached the correct result if only because the Tribunal's finding that he failed to satisfy the English language proficiency requirement was unimpeachable --- at least on the basis of the material before the Tribunal at the time it made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In the Federal Magistrate's Court, the appellant claimed that the Tribunal did not correctly assess the English proficiency requirement on two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">First, he claimed to have met Item 5A407(a) or (b) because he provided a receipt dated 1 October 2008 for an IELTS test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">This was not, however, enough to satisfy this requirement, because Items 5A407(a) and (b) required evidence that the results of an IELTS test met the requisite Overall Band Score.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In the absence of any results, the Tribunal could not be satisfied the appellant met the relevant visa criterion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Secondly, the appellant contended that he met the requirements of Item 5A407(c) because he provided evidence that he completed an ELICOS course, that he is fully funded, and that he has a level of English language proficiency that satisfied his education provider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">His Honour also correctly rejected this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Whilst the appellant gave the Tribunal material that showed that he had completed an ELICOS course in January 2001, there was no evidence that the appellant was fully funded in the relevant sense: see Items 5A101 and 5A103.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Nor was there any evidence that his education provider was satisfied with his English language proficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">As noted above, the appellant argued that the judgment of the Federal Magistrate disclosed appellable error for another reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">This point concerned the effect of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Kamal [2009] FCAFC 98 (' Kamal ') --- the reasons for judgment being delivered on 21 August 2009, some days after the delivery of judgment by the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Whilst I accept that, having regard to Kamal , the Federal Magistrate's reasoning was partially incorrect, I reject the proposition that the judgment of the Federal Magistrate is, for this reason, to be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The reasons of the Federal Magistrate on the relevant point were plainly obiter dictum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In Kamal , a Full Court held that the phrase "[a test] taken less than two years before the date of the application" in Item 5A404(a) in Schedule 5A to the Regulations should be construed as meaning that the test must have been taken no earlier than two years before the date of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This meant that the Item should be construed to include an IELTS test as at the date of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Item 5A407(a) contains the same phrase as Item 5A404(a), and can be taken to bear the same meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">As a consequence, the first respondent accepted that the Federal Magistrate's observation at paragraph [29] of his reasons for judgment cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">At paragraphs [28] --- [29] of Huda v Minister for Immigration [2009] FMCA 659 , the Federal Magistrate said: 
 
 Even if the documentation were admissible, it would not overcome the difficulties the Tribunal identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 

 
 
 The IELTS test result plainly took place well after the Tribunal's decision and a very long time after the application made in 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The terms of clause 5A407, read sensibly, require the test to have been taken within a period from two years before the date of the application and the date of the application itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It does not contemplate an IELTS test taken after the date of application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Accordingly, the test taken by the applicant in January 2009 was never capable of satisfying the clause in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">
 

These observations are not borne out by the Full Court in Kamal and must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">They were, however, clearly obiter dictum because his Honour had already correctly determined that the IELTS test result from 17 January 2009 was inadmissible in the judicial review proceeding before him for the reasons explained above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Since the comments were obiter and do not affect his Honour's core reasons for decision, the comments do not vitiate his Honour's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant also claimed that the Tribunal disregarded the evidence concerning his student health insurance, although the appellant made no submission about this point at the hearing of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Before the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate, the appellant relied on evidence as to his insurance cover from 24 (or 28) September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It is plain enough that the Tribunal did not disregard this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On the contrary, the Tribunal acknowledged this evidence, but held that the appellant nonetheless failed to meet the relevant visa criterion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">This was because, so the Tribunal said, the appellant was required to provide proof of health insurance from 16 March 2007, since his previous visa expired on 15 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The Federal Magistrate apparently accepted this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">On the hearing of this appeal, the first respondent argued that his Honour was correct to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Minds might differ on this point of construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">As noted, however, the appellant did not challenge this aspect of his Honour's reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Since the appellant failed to satisfy the English language proficiency criterion, it is unnecessary to decide in this case whether or not this approach to construction should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The appellant's failure to satisfy the English language proficiency requirement meant that he could not satisfy at least one essential requirement for a 572 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">As I sought to explain to counsel for the appellant, it is not open to the Court on this appeal to consider the discretionary considerations of the kind he mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I would dismiss the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The appellant should pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
