<sentence id="s28">There is some debate in the authorities about the emphasis to be given to the nine factor test in applying the essential test the Court must address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">However, the essential question is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made by the group members who will be bound by the settlement in the context of the facts pleaded; the prospects of success in the principal proceeding; the likelihood of group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement distribution; the likely duration and cost of proceedings; and the weaknesses, substantial or procedural, in the case advanced by the group members and whether the settlement sum falls within a realistic range of likely outcomes.</sentence>
