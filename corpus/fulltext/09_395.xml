<sentence id="s0">
 The defendants, Narnia Investments Pty Ltd ("Narnia") and Simon Charles Clarke have pleaded guilty to charges laid against them by the prosecutor, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Narnia has pleaded guilty to knowingly furnishing false information contrary to s 155(5)(b) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mr Clarke has pleaded guilty to procuring the commission of that offence by Narnia, thereby contravening s 11.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Background Facts
 In August 2004, Narnia conducted business in Hobart as the franchisee of Advanced Hair Studios (Franchising) Pty Ltd. Its business included the supply to customers of hair replacement products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr Clarke was and is the sole director of Narnia, which for practical purposes, is his alter ego.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">During August 2004, Mr Andrew Hack entered into an agreement with Narnia to acquire a hairpiece for $15,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He did so shortly after being discharged from a psychiatric ward of the Royal Hobart Hospital, where he had been treated for depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Narnia agreed to Mr Hack providing a deposit of $3,000 and paying the balance in instalments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It was agreed that once the $3,000 deposit had been paid, Narnia would order the hairpiece to be made up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Importantly, cl 3 of the agreement permitted Mr Hack to terminate the agreement, without penalty and with the return of his deposit, if the order had not been placed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It provided: 
 This contract may be terminated by the customer for any reason before or at the time of fitting the program [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">If this contract is terminated after manufacturing has commenced, an amount equal to the amount expended by AHS in order to supply the custom designed hair replacement shall be deducted from the amount paid by the customer, and the remainder of any deposit and balance paid shall be refunded to the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 Mr Hack paid $1,800, in instalments, towards the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">When his mother discovered that he had done so, she questioned him about the agreement, given that his only source of income was a disability pension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Hack asked his mother to terminate the agreement and get his $1,800 back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Mrs Hack contacted Mr Clarke, who asked her to set out in writing why Mr Hack should be released from his agreement and have his $1800 returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">At this time no order had been placed for Mr Hack's hairpiece and cl 3 entitled Mr Hack to terminate the agreement without reason and without penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mrs Hack wrote to Mr Clarke who did not respond to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mrs Hack engaged a solicitor to act on behalf of Mr Hack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The solicitor was informed by Mr Clarke that he had advanced the deposit to the franchisor on Mr Hack's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Clarke said he was $1,950 out of pocket which he demanded to be paid within 30 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mrs Hack then complained to ACCC about Advanced Hair Studios and Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">ACCC commenced an investigation as to whether Narnia had induced Mr Hack to enter the agreement due to unconscionable and/or misleading and deceptive conduct and whether there had been false and misleading representations made to Mr Hack about his rights under cl 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On or about 5 April 2007, ACCC issued a notice to Narnia under sub-ss 155(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The notice, amongst other things, stated that the Chairman of ACCC believed that Narnia was capable of furnishing information and producing documents relating to the matters that may constitute contravention of ss 51AB, 52 and 53 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Amongst the information that ACCC required Narnia to furnish were the details of its customer complaint handling procedures, including details of how the complaint by Mrs Hack, on behalf of her son, concerning Advanced Hair Studios and/or Mr Clarke was dealt with by Narnia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">ACCC suspected that Narnia and Mr Clarke had not followed Narnia's franchisee obligations in dealing with the complaint because the franchisor had informed ACCC that had those procedures been followed it would have directed Narnia to release Mr Hack from the agreement and refunded his deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">ACCC suspected that Narnia and Mr Clarke did not follow the complaints handling procedure so that they could mislead Mr Hack into believing that he was not entitled to get his $1,800 back and that he should pay a further $1,950 before he would be released from the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In response to ACCC's request to furnish the details of the complaint procedures and details of how the Hacks' complaint was dealt with, Mr Clarke responded: 
 The complaint was notified to Mr Scott Walsh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Walsh notified Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Clarke contacted Mrs Hack (Mr Hack's mother) and discussed the complaint with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Clarke invoked clause 3 of the contract between Mr Hack and Advanced Hair Studios.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That is that he notified Mr Hack that the monies paid by him to date would be sufficient to cover administrative costs and expenses by the Franchisee and that Mr Hack was discharged from the contract and had no further obligation to the Franchisee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 That response was false in that Mr Clarke never invoked cl 3 of the agreement and never notified Mr Hack that the $1,800 payment would be sufficient to cover the administrative costs and expenses of ordering and procuring the hairpiece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Also, Mr Clarke did not tell Mr Hack that he would be discharged from the agreement without further obligation to the franchisee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">During Mr Clarke's examination pursuant to s 155(1)(c) of the Act, he admitted that his answer set out at [13] above was false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The answer also conflicted with the text of demands made by him by facsimile transmission to Mr Hack's lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The parties acknowledge that ACCC has been put to additional time and expense as a result of the false information which went to the heart of its investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The false information, which conflicted with other information from Mr Hack, his mother and their lawyer, led ACCC to engage in a costly and time consuming examination process under s 155(1)(c), in which Mr Clarke was examined on 23 and 24 July 2007 for in excess of a day and a half.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Maximum penalties
 The maximum penalty for a contravention of s 155(5)(b) of the Act is $2,200 (20 penalty units) or 12 month's imprisonment for an individual and $11,000 for a company; see s 155(6A) of the Act and Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s 4B(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The maximum penalty for breach of s 11.2 of the Criminal Code by Mr Clarke is the same as that for breach of s 155(5)(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Section 11.2(1) provides: 
 A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
Therefore, Mr Clarke is to be assessed as if he had breached s 155(5)(b) of the Act in addition to the breach by Narnia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment reflects Parliament's view that "the provision of false information in response to a s 155 notice is a serious offence"; see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v GIA Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1298 at [19] per Heerey J, see also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rana [2008] FCA 374 at [50] per North J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Considerations relevant to penalty
 Under s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act , the Court must impose sentences in the current proceeding "of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Pursuant to s 17A of the Crimes Act the Court is not to pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, "after having considered all other available sentences", it considers that "no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In GIA , Heerey J considered that a mid-range penalty was appropriate because the relevant conduct was "more a matter of minimisation and evasion than denial or the laying of a false trail"; at [19].</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In the current case, the conduct was in the nature of denial and the laying of a false trail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The nature and circumstances of each offence make it a serious transgression for Narnia and Mr Clarke respectively; see s 16A(2)(a) of the Crimes Act which requires the Court to take into account the "nature and circumstances of the offence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On the face of the conduct, the offence by each defendant should attract a high range monetary penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I accept that it would not be appropriate in all the circumstances to imprison Mr Clarke, especially given that he has pleaded guilty and has no prior convictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The applicable considerations in amelioration of penalty in the current circumstances include the following: The factors referred to in the preceding paragraph weigh in favour of a reduction in penalty from the high range to a range in excess of a mid-range penalty but below that of a high range penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">However, as Lindgren J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Neville [2007] FCA 1583 at [43] : 
 an important purpose of the penalty to be imposed in the present case is that of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It is most important that persons furnishing information or giving evidence in response to a notice issued by the ACCC under s 155 of the TP Act do so frankly and honestly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It serves the public interest that the ACCC be enabled to carry out its investigations efficiently and effectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Section 155 of the TP Act is directed to that end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">If a person who is required to give evidence under s 155(1)(c) of the TP Act gives false or misleading evidence, not only does this have the immediate effect of obstructing and delaying the particular investigation: it also has the potential to direct the ACCC away from other sources of information and to draw human and financial resources away from its other work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The general public should know that conduct of that kind will be treated seriously by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 Specific deterrence is not a central consideration as I am confident that Mr Clarke will not re-offend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Having regard to the importance of general deterrence, as stressed by Lindgren J in Neville , and the ameliorating factors referred to at [22] above, I consider that a monetary penalty between mid-range and high range should be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The charge is too serious to warrant the imposition of a conditional discharge under s 19B(1) of the Crimes Act in respect of Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">To do so would be inconsistent with the approach adopted by this Court in Neville, GIA and Rana .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The disqualification of Mr Clarke from managing another corporation under s 206B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is a matter which Mr Clarke should have had regard to before committing the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Accordingly, a fine of $5,600 will be imposed on Narnia and fine of $1,400 will be imposed on Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">I would have ordinarily imposed a penalty of $7,000 on Narnia but have reduced that amount by $1,400 to reflect the penalty imposed on Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I have done so given that Narnia was, in practical terms, Mr Clarke's alter ego.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">One must be careful to avoid what is, in effect, double punishment of a sole director of a company; see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349 at [27] ---[29] per Heerey J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The penalties are to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund on or before 20 May 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is agreed that the defendants should pay the prosecutor's costs of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
