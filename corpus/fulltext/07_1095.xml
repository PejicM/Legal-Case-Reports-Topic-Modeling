1 This is an appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones FM of 22 December 2005 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') handed down 7 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Minister') to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant who claims to be a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('the PRC') arrived in Australia on 9 April 2002 holding a Preferential Relative (Migrant) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 11 May 2004 the visa was cancelled by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Department') on the grounds that the appellant had provided false information in support of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant sought judicial review of such decision and on 19 December 2003 the Migration Review Tribunal ('the MRT') affirmed the Department's decision to cancel the appellant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 On 10 February 2004 the appellant lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa which was refused by the Department on 11 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The appellant applied for review of such decision to the Tribunal on 2 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The appellant claimed to have a well founded fear of persecution based on his political opinions and involvement in a pro-democracy movement in the PRC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant claimed that he joined the Chinese Alliance for Democracy ('the CAD') in 1994, that his brother was an important political dissident in the PRC, and that the Chinese National Security Bureau had requested the appellant to obtain information for it about his brother and his friends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant claimed that he had engaged in pro-democracy activities since arriving in Australia and that it was only since his arrival that he has overtly expressed his political views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">DECISION OF TRIBUNAL 
 
5 The appellant attended an oral hearing before the Tribunal on 20 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Evidence of a witness called by the appellant was not completed at the Tribunal by reason of time constraints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Rather than adjourning the hearing the Tribunal gave the witness the opportunity to lodge further evidence in the form of a written statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The witness subsequently provided such statement to the Tribunal within the time specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The Tribunal considered the issues raised by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It was not satisfied that the appellant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention and upheld the Minister's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">FEDERAL MAGISTRATES DECISION 
 
7 On 3 November 2004 the appellant lodged an application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">A Further Amended Application dated 14 November 2005 raised seven grounds of review summarised as follows:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal erred in not considering the claims of the appellant to fear harm as a result of imputed political opinion arising from the political activities and opinions of the appellant's brother;
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal erred in its reliance on findings of the MRT dated 19 December 2003 at a time when such decision was under review and which has subsequently been set aside;
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Tribunal erred in that it failed to provide the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present all of the relevant evidence and acted contrary to the rules of natural justice;
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal erred in that it failed to inform the appellant that it had questioned the impartiality of a witness and the appellant was precluded from calling other impartial witnesses to prove his involvement in political activities in Australia;
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal erred in finding that it was highly unlikely that the wife of the appellant did not tell him anything about her interview on 7 May 2003 and that he only found out in June 2003 that such interview had taken place;
 
6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Tribunal erred in applying s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') in that it considered that the appellant could have applied for a Preferential Relative (Migrant) visa rather than a protection visa; and
 
7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal erred in that it failed to provide the appellant a proper opportunity to present his case to the Tribunal and the Tribunal thereby failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 Lloyd-Jones FM was satisfied that the Tribunal had expressly dealt with the claim of imputed political opinion as set out in the first ground of the Amended Application and that it was open to the Tribunal to reject such claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 Lloyd-Jones FM found that the Tribunal had satisfied its obligations pursuant to s 424A of the Act in relation to its consideration of the MRT decision by inviting the appellant to comment on the findings of the MRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Although the appellant alleged that the Tribunal had acted in breach of s 420 of the Act, his Honour found that there were no particulars advanced to support such contention and that it could not be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">10 In relation to the third ground Lloyd-Jones FM acknowledged that the interpreter service was withdrawn which did not allow the completion of evidence of the appellant's last witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">However it was found that the Tribunal did make alternate arrangements for the witness to provide information in the form of written evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">His Honour noted that the witness accepted the invitation and provided addtional written information within the time specified by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the appellant's witness was prevented from giving evidence and his Honour considered that this ground of review could not be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 The fourth ground of appeal contended that the Tribunal breached its obligation to hear and determine the application and had breached s 424A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The appellant relied upon the transcript of the Tribunal hearing, noting in particular that the Tribunal questioned a witness relating to his impartiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The appellant claimed that the issue of impartiality was not translated by the interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">His Honour found that there was no evidence to support such claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">His Honour referred to Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 in finding that the Tribunal's view of the impartiality of a witness is part of the Tribunal's reasoning process and does not constitute information within the meaning of s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">His Honour found that there was no obligation to provide the appellant with particulars of its opinion of the impartiality of a witness and dismissed this ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">12 The fifth ground of review arises out of an interview which was held between Australian officials in Beijing and the appellant's wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The appellant had claimed that he was not married when he obtained his Preferential Relative (Migrant) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However, such claim was shown to be false during the subsequent interview with his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Tribunal drew the inference that the details of such interview would have been conveyed to the appellant by the wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The appellant challenged the drawing of such inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">13 Lloyd-Jones FM accepted that the Tribunal could draw the inference contained in the fifth ground of review, and that such inference was reasonably open to the Tribunal on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There was no need for direct evidence of specific communication before such an inference could have been drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">14 As to the sixth ground of appeal Lloyd-Jones FM considered that the Tribunal applied the correct interpretation of s 91R(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Accordingly his Honour found no breach of the section as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">15 The seventh ground was rejected for the reason that it constituted a repetition of ground three.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">His Honour was satisfied that the Act had been complied with in relation to the evidence of the appellant's brother and although it may have been preferable to obtain the evidence orally at hearing there was no requirement that the evidence be obtained in this manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal was entitled to take evidence in the form of written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">16 The decision of the Tribunal was found to be without error and Lloyd-Jones FM accordingly dismissed the application for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 
17 By Amended Notice of Appeal the appellant appeals from the whole of the decision of Lloyd-Jones FM on three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Firstly the appellant claims that his Honour erred in failing to hold that the Tribunal erred in failing to provide the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present all of the relevant evidence that he had available and thereby acted contrary to the rules of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Secondly the appellant claims that Lloyd-Jones FM erred in failing to hold that the Tribunal had erred by incorrectly construing s 91R(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Thirdly, the appellant claims that Lloyd-Jones FM erred in failing to find that the finding of the Tribunal that 'it is highly unlikely that the Applicant's wife did not tell him anything about her interview on 07 May 2004 [sic] and he only found out in June 2003' was not open to it on the evidence and was merely speculation rather than permissible inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Denial of Natural Justice 
 
18 The appellant claims that the Tribunal failed to adjourn the hearing and that the time allowed for the lodgement of further written evidence was inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The appellant also claimed that he would have called additional witnesses had he been informed that the Tribunal did not regard the witnesses called by the appellant as impartial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">19 The transcript records the fact that the interpreter was required to leave the hearing early on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Tribunal member stated:
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">I think you need the interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Let's try and see if I can finish in 15 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">If I can't, I'm going to have to adjourn our evidence to a later date because the interpreter must go by 3 o'clock .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">

20 Questioning thereafter continued during which the witness ('Mike') answered numerous questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Thereafter the following exchange occurred:
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">What do you want to tell the tribunal today?</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Let me think.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">What I'm happy for you to- -
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Maybe you can leave, I talk- -
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I don't want you to struggle to talk because that's not fair to you, and I don't want you to say something that you're not comfortable in saying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I'm happy for you to write a statement and send it to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Maybe better way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Yes, but I can't give you too much time, that's all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I'm happy to give you till the end of the week to write something and I will decide if I need to ask you any further questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">

21 It is acknowledged by the Minister that after the words ' let me think' the interpreter stated in Mandarin ' Hurry up ' but that these words were not transcribed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">22 Later the Tribunal member, having obtained a history of Mike's involvement in the CAD continued:
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 A. Yeah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">This book, brochure, introduce roughly for the CAD, but I got some --- yes, want to say something about the hearing, but maybe I had better writing down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Please do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Unless you can say it in two minutes in the presence of the interpreter, but I really would like- -
 A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">That's why I think, very hurry, you know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Perhaps I cannot correct express what I want to - -
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">No that's not fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">That's not right, and I don't want you to say things in a rushed manner either, because it may not be right for you to say that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">But I'm happy to receive a statement from you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Thank you for the chance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">By the end of the week, please, if I could have it by Friday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">What about next week, because I got schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I will leave for .</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">(not transcribable) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">in the evening and come back Sunday, but I can .</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">(not transcribable) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">It doesn't have to be a lengthy statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I just need to know what you really want to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">All right, okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Understand, fax it to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">By Monday afternoon, please.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Yeah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">

23 As Lloyd-Jones FM observed, it was unfortunate that the hearing could not conclude that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Nevertheless, consistent with the obligation of the Tribunal to provide a quick decision, asking the witness to present his further evidence in a written statement was a course that was open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The provision of the written statement by Mike on 26 July 2004 provided ample opportunity for him to complete the evidence he wished to present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">24 The Tribunal is not required to conduct the proceedings as if they were a Court hearing: see SZAYW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 49 ; (2006) 229 ALR 423 at 425 per Gleeson CJ, delivering the decision of the High Court of Australia said:
 
 The procedure of review is inquisitorial, and does not involve an adversarial trial, at which evidence is adduced and tested, and issues are debated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">There are no parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The tribunal investigates an applicant's claims in a process of administrative merits review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">

For similar observations see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152 at 164 [40]; Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at [52] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">25 In the present circumstances, the Tribunal was entitled to gather evidence in the manner it considered appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Tribunal had complied with its obligations under s 425 of the Act to provide the appellant with an opportunity to give evidence and make submissions at a hearing and there was no obligation on the Tribunal to take evidence orally from a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">By directing that the balance of the evidence from Mike be provided by a written statement, the Tribunal complied with its obligation to give the appellant the opportunity to present his case: see s 429A(c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mike did not complain that there was insufficient time to provide the statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Further the transcript records that Mike agreed to provide the statement during the following week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">26 The procedure suggested by the Tribunal did not prevent further witnesses from giving evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The only witnesses the appellant had indicated that he proposed to call on the Response to Hearing Invitation form were those that were called by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The evidence of the appellant and of another witness had been heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">There was no entitlement for the appellant to call further witnesses if he formed the view that the witnesses already called were not to be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">27 Mike swore an affidavit on 10 November 2005 which was before Lloyd-Jones FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It claimed that he said to the interpreter in Mandarin 'I wonder if what I am saying here is effective or not, otherwise I will provide another witness to you' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He claimed that the interpreter did not interpret the last words of his alleged statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The transcript of the Tribunal hearing does not reveal any such words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The following exchange is recorded:
 
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">What do you want to ask me?</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">So I want to first, do you give the --- do you actually give --- endorse my witness, the evidence today, because I'm his brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Do you endorse?</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">I don't understand what you're asking me, sorry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">So like, Qin Jin is a close friend of mine and he gives evidence about my brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">You were thinking whether it's - -
 Q.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">So you have discussed the evidence that the witness gave this morning with him, have you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">No, no .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">

28 The assessment of the credibility of a witness is a matter entirely for the determination of the Tribunal: see Tin [2000] FCA 1109 and does not form information for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The provisions of the Act are an exhaustive statement of the principles of natural justice and there is no scope for the application of any residue common law principles: see s 422B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">29 There is no error as claimed, and Lloyd-Jones FM was correct in his conclusion that there was no denial of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Construction of s 91R(3) of the Act 
 
30 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant engaged in some political activities in Australia but found that any such activities were engaged in for the purpose of enhancing his refugee claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Tribunal would pay no regard to such activities because they were activities which were excluded pursuant to s 91R(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The appellant submits that s 91R(3) does not exclude the possibility that an applicant may act with more than one purpose, so that if he or she engages in conduct to which s 91R(3) applies, there may be another purpose which has resulted in the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">It is alleged that the Tribunal failed to exclude such possibility of more than one purpose in its determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">31 Section 91R(3) of the Act relevantly provides that in determining whether the person has a well founded fear of being persecuted for one of the reasons mentioned in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention, the Court may:
 
 disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless: 
 
 (b) the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">

32 The Tribunal found that the appellant engaged in the conduct for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">As such, s 91R(3) of the Act applies and the Tribunal was entitled, having made such findings of fact, to determine that the conduct was not bona fide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The factual findings of the Tribunal thus operate to exclude the hypothesis proposed by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Further, s 91R(3) of the Act creates a reversal of onus of proof, which the appellant did not discharge: see NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1536 at [26] which was approved in SBCC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 129 at [39] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">33 The process by which the Tribunal reached its conclusions was the same as that considered by Mansfield J in SAAS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 726 ; (2002) 124 FCR 182 at [52] - [57] which was later upheld on appeal: see SAAS of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 340 at [15] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Court can find no error in the findings of Lloyd- Jones FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Claim of no evidence to support finding / finding was speculation rather than permissible inference 
 
34 The Tribunal found that the appellant became aware in June 2003 of the possibility of the cancellation of his visa having received the letter of 2 June 2003 from the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The Tribunal found, that upon close analysis of the appellant's activities, the activities in which he was engaged prior to June 2003 ' were essentially those activities in which his brother had been involved' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It continued:
 
 The applicant has in a calculating and careful manner associated himself with activities concerning his brother in order to support his own claim of involvement in political activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">On the basis of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal cannot accept that the applicant on 4 June 2002 took part in a pro-democracy activity in Sydney, nor can the Tribunal accept that in mid August 2002 he assisted his brother and friends to arrange a visit to Australia of Mr W J Kingsheng and that in early 2003, he assisted his brother to organise the "Yellow Ribbon" activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">

35 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant did not know of the interview on 7 May 2003 between Australian Embassy officials in Beijing and the appellant's wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Lloyd-Jones FM noted the evidence upon which the Tribunal could reach such conclusion, which included the sponsorship of the wife and child by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Contrary to the claim of the appellant, there was sufficient factual circumstances to warrant the inference by the Tribunal in making such finding: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi (2001) 65 ALD 141 at [34]-[35]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 232-233, 236, 240 and 259; VAAW of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 202 at [33] - [35] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Further, the Court accepts the submissions of the Minister that such finding does not bear on the Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant's political activities in Australia were not bona fide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">36 Lloyd-Jones FM did not err in his findings and it follows that this appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">37 The Minister has sought an order for costs in the sum of $5000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">As this is within a reasonable range for costs in the circumstances the Court will make the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy.</sentence>
