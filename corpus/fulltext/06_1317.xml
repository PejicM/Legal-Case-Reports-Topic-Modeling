 JUDGE : TRACEY J DATE: 6 OCTOBER 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 RULING 
 
 1 This proceeding commenced in this court as an application for leave to appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate handed down on 27 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The learned Magistrate had before him an application for judicial review of the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") that it could not entertain the appellant's application because it had been lodged outside the time prescribed for the purposes of s 347(1)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That time was prescribed by reg 4.10(1)(a) of the Migration Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It came on for hearing before me in Sydney on 11 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The application was listed before a single judge pursuant to s 25(1AA)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Leave to appeal was needed because the Magistrate's decision had been interlocutory in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant was represented by Counsel, who, I was informed, had only recently been briefed in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He indicated that the appellant wished to abandon the grounds of appeal which appeared in the Notice of Appeal and to substitute alternative grounds which had not been argued in the Federal Magistrates' Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Counsel for the Minister consented to leave being granted to appeal and for an amended Notice of Appeal to be filed and I so ordered: c.f.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 ; (2006) 150 FCR 448.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I directed that the parties file and serve written submissions on the issues raised by the new grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">That has now been done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">2 A directions hearing was held on 5 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The parties were agreed that I should not now proceed to determine the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The appellant's preference was that the matter should be remitted to the Federal Magistrates' Court so that the issues raised by the new grounds could be argued and ruled on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Counsel for the Minister sought an order referring the matter to a Full Court for hearing and indicated that the Minister would not have consented to leave being granted to amend the appeal grounds had the appellant then intimated that she wished to have the matter remitted to the Federal Magistrates' Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Both parties were agreed that there was no dispute as to relevant facts and that the only matters to be agitated on the appeal were questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">3 Having considered the matter I have determined that the appropriate course is for the appeal to be dealt with by a Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">One of the new grounds of appeal is that reg 4.10(1)(a) of the Migration Regulations is ultra vires the Migration Act 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">So far as I am aware this is the first time that a challenge has been made to the validity of that regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I say no more than that the appellant's contention, as developed in her written submissions is, at least, fairly arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is now almost a year since the decision of the Tribunal was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Were the matter to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates' Court there would, inevitably, be a delay in the hearing and determination of the application and the strong prospect, regardless of outcome, that the matter would return to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In these circumstances, the preferable course, in my opinion, is that the appeal should be heard and determined, as soon as practicable, by a Full Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The consequence of the opinion which I have formed is that the appeal will be heard by a Full Court: see s 25(1AA)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
