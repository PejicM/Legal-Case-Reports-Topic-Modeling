 Background 
 
3 The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who arrived in Australia on 26 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 23 September 2005 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 31 October 2005 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">A previously constituted Tribunal in a decision dated 30 January 2006 had earlier affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister refusing to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Federal Magistrate's Court in a decision dated 19 September 2006 allowed an appeal against that decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The matter before this Court concerns a subsequent decision of the Tribunal dated 8 February 2007, concerning the same appellant for a protection visa, where the Tribunal has again affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">4 The appellant claimed to have well-founded fear of persecution because she belonged to a particular social group and because of her political opinion or imputed political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant claimed she was the wife of a Royal Nepalese army soldier and worked in the media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appellant claimed that Maoist rebels constantly came into her home threatening her and her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The appellant claimed she was told by Maoists that she would be punished or killed if her husband did not leave the army.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She claimed that her husband was unable to leave the army as he would face persecution from authorities if he did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The appellant further claimed that she was involved in making a documentary that the Maoist rebels did not want made, and that as a result she had received threatening letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Decision of the Tribunal 
 
5 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was a wife of a Nepalese army soldier and that she worked in the media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Tribunal also accepted that the appellant and her husband had been threatened by Maoist rebels prior to the implementation of the peace accord.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">However the Tribunal found that since the accord, neither the appellant nor her husband had suffered serious harm amounting to persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal noted that the appellant's husband had continued to work after the threats without anyone suffering any problems as a result, and the appellant did not leave Nepal for over two years after she was able to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">6 Having considered the evidence, the Tribunal found it could not be satisfied that the appellant was a member of a particular social group of internally displaced people or that she had a political or imputed political profile in Nepal due to her work in the media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was under Maoist rebel surveillance or that they would try to kill her for leaving Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">7 Finally the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Grounds before Cameron FM 
 
8 On 19 March 2007 the appellant applied for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">There were seven grounds raised in the amended application filed on 26 June 2007 but only the following two grounds were pressed before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal failed to consider whether the appellant had a well founded fear after finding there may be some "future incidents" of violence; and
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal breached s 424A Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Migration Act ) in respect of information that the appellant could have gone to India immediately upon receiving her passport in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Decision of Cameron FM 
 
9 The Federal Magistrate considered the grounds in light of the Tribunal's decision but found no jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In relation to the first ground, his Honour held that, notwithstanding occasional further incidents of persecution in Nepal, these incidents did not justify the applicant having a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The key findings of his Honour in relation to this ground were at [15]-[16] where his Honour said:
 
 15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">What the Tribunal was saying was that notwithstanding occasional further incidents of persecution in Nepal, these did not justify the applicant having a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It was not necessary for the Tribunal to "consider the nature of such further incidents and whether the applicant might be the recipient of further incidents" as alleged in the application, as this suggests that the Tribunal had an obligation either to speculate or to make inquiries when, in fact, it was the applicant's task to make out her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">It was for the Tribunal to determine, based on the facts before it, whether there was a real chance of the claimed persecution occurring and thus whether the applicant's claimed fear was a well-founded one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Based on the evidence before it, in a decision which was open to it, the Tribunal concluded that the peace accord would last, that the chance of harm from the Maoists was at that time extremely remote and it did not accept that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in the changed circumstances in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal applied the correct test and no jurisdictional error is demonstrated in relation to this asserted ground of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

10 In relation to the second ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that the following passage from the Tribunal's decision relied on information which should have been supplied to the applicant in accordance with s 424A(1) , but was not:
 
 "In short, the Tribunal is satisfied that if for any reason the Applicant had a well founded fear of serious harm from the Maoists or from any other source, she would have immediately left Nepal when she was issued with her passport and would have gone to another country such as India in order to seek international protection and either sought protection in that country or would have applied for a visa to a third country from this position of safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">"
 

11 Cameron FM dismissed this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">His Honour found in particular at [19] that:
 
 19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There is more than one answer to this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">First, information regarding Nepalese subjects not needing to obtain a visa to travel to India would be information falling within the s.424A(3)(a) exception to s.424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Secondly, what the applicant characterises as information is, in reality, a conclusion of the Tribunal that had she really feared persecution she would have used her passport to escape even if she did not have a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The Tribunal's conclusions and thought processes are not "information" as that term is understood by s.424A: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Thirdly, the information which underlay the conclusion, namely the dates of the passport and departure from Nepal, were put to the applicant in the Tribunal' s s.424A letter dated 17 January 2007 (CB 178) and it was in her response to that letter, by way of her statutory declaration made 29 January 2007, that the applicant said she could not leave Nepal during that period as she lacked a visa (CB 190).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

12 Accordingly, in his Honour's view no breach of s 424A was disclosed in respect of this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In addition to this, his Honour found that the information which underlay the Tribunal's conclusion, namely the dates of the passport and departure from Nepal, were put to the appellant in the Tribunal's s 424A letter dated 17 January 2007 and it was in her response to that letter, by way of her statutory declaration made 29 January 2007, that the appellant said she could not leave Nepal during that period as she lacked a visa (at [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">13 Finally, his Honour considered the submission of the first respondent that, in any event and notwithstanding matters raised by the appellant, the Tribunal's decision could be sustained on another ground, namely that the appellant was disbelieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In finding for the first respondent in relation to this issue, his Honour said:
 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The first respondent submitted that, notwithstanding the matters raised by the applicant, the Tribunal's decision can be sustained on another ground, namely that the applicant was disbelieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The first respondent pointed out that the Tribunal's decision could be divided into two separate parts, the first dealing with the claims which the applicant made to fear persecution on the basis of prior events, in respect of which the Tribunal concluded against the applicant at the end of the first paragraph at CB 244 and the second part which dealt with the changed circumstances in Nepal which led the Tribunal to the conclusion that the applicant had no well-founded fear of persecution in the new political environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The Tribunal's principal conclusion, which was based on the applicant's experiences prior to the change of political situation in Nepal, was that she had embellished her claim and had no well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In essence, she was disbelieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">This was a conclusion which was open to the Tribunal on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">This conclusion provides a basis for the Tribunal's decision independent of its second and logically secondary conclusion regarding the applicant's lack of a well-founded fear of persecution in Nepal in the new political environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">

14 His Honour was therefore unable to discern any jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Appeal to this Court 
 
15 Both parties filed written submissions prior to the hearing, and both parties were represented by Counsel at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">16 The notice of appeal to the Federal Court filed by the appellant on 6 September 2007 raises the following grounds:
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the Second Respondent had failed to complete its jurisdictional task by considering whether the Appellant was at risk in relation to incidents of violence which the Second Respondent found had occurred and by inference were likely to recur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the Second Respondent breached s 424A of the Migration Act, 1958 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Federal Magistrate erred by finding: 
 
 i. that information that the Appellant could have travelled to India immediately she was issued with a passport fell within the s 424A(3)(a) exception to s 424A(1) 
 ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">that such information was the thought process of the Second Respondent and not information
 iii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">that the underlying information had been put to the Appellant in the s 424A letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">"
 

17 Grounds of appeal 2 and 3 relate to the same issue, and I intend to consider them together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">18 At the hearing Mr Young for the appellant sought the leave of the Court to raise a fourth ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">This was not opposed by Ms Clegg for the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I gave the appellant leave to raise this fourth ground, and the appellant filed an amended notice of appeal on 16 November 2007 with an additional ground of appeal as follows:
 
 "4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The Federal Magistrate erred by finding at [22] and [23] that there was no independent basis of the decision of the Second Respondent, being 'in essence (the Appellant) was not believed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" 
 
 

19 I shall now consider each of these grounds of appeal in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Ground of appeal 1: The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the second respondent had failed to complete its jurisdictional task by considering whether the appellant was at risk in relation to incidents of violence which the second respondent found had occurred and by inference were likely to recur 
 
20 Mr Young for the appellant submitted, in essence, that once it was accepted by the Tribunal that in a country where acts of persecution by the Maoists had been widespread, further incidents would occur notwithstanding the commencement of the peace accord, then the peace accord cannot be a complete answer to a claim of persecution at the hands of the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Counsel submitted further that where the Tribunal found that there were some occasional acts of persecution to occur, it was bound to consider whether these might affect the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">21 In my view, however, the comments of Cameron FM in this respect at [15]-[16] of his Honour's judgment are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">I agree with his Honour that it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the nature of such further incidents of violence and whether the appellant might be the recipient of further incidents as alleged, as this suggests that the Tribunal had an obligation either to speculate or to make inquiries when it was the appellant's task to make out her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In any event, in my view it is clear that the Tribunal had completed its task in considering whether, because of the accord, the appellant continued to have a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">As Ms Clegg submitted, the majority of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v QAAH of 2004 [2006] HCA 53 ; (2006) 231 ALR 340, in particular at [43]-[50], held that it is open to the Tribunal to take into account changed country circumstances in order to conclude that the appellant was not a refugee at the time the Tribunal's decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Further, as Gleeson CJ and Hayne and Heydon JJ observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 at 11 in relation to relevant random and uncoordinated acts of violence in that case,
 
 "No country can guarantee that its citizens will at all times, and in all circumstances, be safe from violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Day by day, Australian courts deal with criminal cases involving violent attacks on person or property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Some of them may occur for reasons of racial or religious intolerance..."
 

22 In this case, in considering the claims of the appellant and the independent country information before it, the Tribunal considered that the peace accord in Nepal was holding, and that both sides remained fully committed to it, and assessed the chance of harm from the Maoists at that time as extremely remote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Accordingly, the Tribunal did properly complete the task before it in relation to assessing whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">In my view, the first ground of appeal cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Grounds of appeal 2 and 3: The Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the second respondent breached section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 , and by finding that information that the appellant could have travelled to India immediately she was issued with a passport fell within the section 424A(3)(a) exception to section 424A(1) , that such information was the thought process of the second respondent and not information, and that the underlying information had been put to the appellant in the section 424A letter 
 
23 These grounds of appeal require consideration of s 424A Migration Act , a provision which frequently arises for consideration in the context of review of decisions of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It is not in contention that breach of this section by the Tribunal constitutes jurisdictional error: SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">24 Section 424A provides as follows:
 
 (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must:
 (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and
 (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and
 (c) invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">(2) The information and invitation must be given to the applicant:
 (a) except where paragraph (b) applies--by one of the methods specified in section 441A ; or
 (b) if the applicant is in immigration detention--by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving documents to such a person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">(2A) The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant, nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under section 424AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">(3) This section does not apply to information:
 (a) that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member; or
 (b) that the applicant for review gave for the purpose of the application; or
 (ba) that the applicant gave during the process that led to the decision that is under review, other than such information that was provided orally by the applicant to the Department; or
 (c) that is non-disclosable information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">

25 In relation to these grounds of appeal, the submissions of the appellant can be summarised as follows:
 
&#8226; the information relied on by the Tribunal was that the appellant could have gone to India immediately upon receiving her passport in 2003 without obtaining a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This appeared in response to the appellant's statement in a statutory declaration that she did not have a visa to depart Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The information upon which the Tribunal relied, namely that she could leave Nepal without a visa, was not merely the conclusion or thought processes of the Tribunal
 
&#8226; it is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that this information undermined the appellant's claim that Australia owed her protection obligations, and accordingly it was within s 424A as considered by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 as it was not information which fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) 
 
&#8226; information the Tribunal had with respect to Nepalese citizens entering India was limited to information the Tribunal had concerning whether it is possible to fly directly from Australia to India with a Nepalese passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The relevant information upon which the Tribunal relied did not deal with circumstances in which a Nepalese person could enter India from Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">26 In response, the respondent submitted in summary:
 
&#8226; the statements of the Tribunal with respect to the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal with her passport was not "information" within the meaning of s 424A(1) , but rather the subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations of the Tribunal: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 476, SZBYR 235 ALR at 616
 
&#8226; if these statements, including with respect to the ability of the appellant to go to India, were "information", it was information within s 424A(3)(a) 
 
&#8226; even if the statements were "information" within the meaning of s 424A(1) the Tribunal did not act in breach of the section in that it brought to the appellant's attention the fact that she could have left Nepal when she received her passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Did the Tribunal rely on "information" within the meaning of section 424A(1)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
27 The sequence of events upon which the appellant relies, and which is not in contention, is so far as relevant as follows:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In a letter from the Tribunal to the appellant dated 17 January 2007, the Tribunal stated, inter alia :
 
 "...</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In your protection visa application you claim that you were legally issued with a Nepalese passport on 28 May 2003 and this passport was sighted at the second hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">However, you also claim in your protection visa application and at the second hearing that you did not depart from Nepal until 25 August 2005, well over two years after you were issued with your passport and were therefore able to leave Nepal..." 
 
 

2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In response to this letter, on 29 January 2007 the appellant signed a statutory declaration wherein she declared, inter alia :
 
 ".I accept that I obtained my passport in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">I say that it is not a big deal to obtain a passport in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The main reason for obtaining passport was to save my life by fleeing Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">I also accept that I departed Nepal in August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I had been unable to depart Nepal as soon as I obtained my passport because I did not have visa and other means to depart Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Although I was trying to depart Nepal seriously as soon as I got the passport, I could not arrange my departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">I could not take chance just to flee anywhere because I was conscious that I had been under Maoists surveillance and if they knew that I was trying to flee Nepal, they would kill me as they knew my presence and perpetual pressure might compel my husband to quit Army and join them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">I departed in August 2005 only because I got the visa to enter Australia....</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If I had visa and other means to depart Nepal, I would have departed on the day I got my passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">" 
 
 

3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In its decision of 8 February 2007 the Tribunal stated, inter alia :
 
 "In short, the Tribunal is satisfied that if for any reason the Applicant had a well founded fear of serious harm from the Maoists or from any other source, she would have immediately left Nepal when she was issued with her passport and would have gone to another country such as India in order to seek international protection and either sought protection in that country or would have applied for a visa to a third country from this position of safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">"
 

28 The term "information" within s 424A(1) was considered by the Full Court in VAF 206 ALR at 476 and defined by Finn and Stone JJ in that case to refer to:
 
 "...knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 at [3] , irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at [19] --- [22].</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">"
 

29 The factual basis of "information" was reiterated by the majority of the High Court in SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 where their Honours said in relation to "information" in s 424A(1): 
 
 "However broadly 'information' be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">"
 

30 It is not in dispute that "information" for the purposes of s 424A(1) does not include "subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations" of the Tribunal: SZBYR 235 ALR 609.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">"Subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations" include for example:
 
&#8226; the Tribunal's disbelief of an applicant's evidence arising from inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence ( SZBYR 235 ALR at 616, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 , VAF 206 ALR at 476, WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276)
 
&#8226; a determination by the Tribunal that the applicant's account is or may not be credible ( Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 , Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 428)
 
&#8226; a determination of the Tribunal that the information provided by the applicant in the original application lacks specificity and detail: VAAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 
 
&#8226; a view taken by the Tribunal as to the unsatisfactory nature of answers provided by an applicant: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">31 The statements of the Tribunal in this case with respect to the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal and go to another country such as India without a visa appear to refer to "information" upon which the Tribunal was relying, rather than constituting "subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">" The Tribunal was relying on what it understood to be a fact - namely that it was legally possible for the appellant to have left Nepal once she obtained her passport, and, irrespective of having a visa, gone immediately to another country such as India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In my view this was clearly "knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances" as explained by the Full Court in VAF 206 ALR 471, not a view taken by the Tribunal based on facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The conclusion which was reached by the Tribunal, based on what it understood to be the fact that the appellant was entitled to leave Nepal and, without needing a visa, go to India, was that because the appellant had not done so she did not have a well-founded fear of serious harm from the Maoists or from any other source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">32 Accordingly, the Tribunal was relying on "information" for the purposes of s 424A(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Did the information upon which the Tribunal relied fall within the exception in section 424A(3)(a)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
33 The first respondent submitted that, if the findings of the Tribunal were based on "information", it was information falling within s 424A(3)(b) in that it was information not specifically about the applicant or another person, but was about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person was a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">34 The background to the enactment of s 424A(3)(b) was considered at length by Merkel and Hely JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572.</sentence>

<sentence id="s133">The further reference to information that is "just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member" is not a second criterion to be met, but is designed to underline the specificity required by precluding any argument that reference to a class could be taken as reference to all individuals (including, for example, an applicant) falling in it ( NAMW 140 FCR at 599-600).</sentence>

37 I do not accept the submission of Mr Young that the relevant information upon which the Tribunal was relying in its decision of 8 February 2007 pertained only to whether people could fly directly from Australia to India if they were in possession of a valid Nepalese passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">From the material I have set out above it is clear that there exists information in the public domain concerning the lack of restriction on persons holding Nepalese passports to enter India, and although not identified as such as it was in the decision of the Tribunal as first constituted, it was upon this information that the Tribunal was clearly relying in both its letter to the appellant and its decision of 8 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">This was information not specifically about the appellant or another person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It concerned a class of persons, of which the appellant was a member, namely all Nepalese citizens with passports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Although not specifically identified as such, it was information akin to country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">It is at least analogous to the information the subject of the decision in WAJW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; 140 FCR 572.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">38 Accordingly, this information fell within the exception to s 424A(1) in s 424A(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The second and third grounds of appeal of the appellant cannot be substantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In these circumstances it is unnecessary for me to consider the additional submission of Ms Clegg that even if the Tribunal had relied on information within the meaning of s 424A(1), the section was not breached because the Tribunal brought to the appellant's attention the fact that she could have left Nepal when she received her passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Ground of appeal 4: The Federal Magistrate erred by finding at [22] and [23] that there was no independent basis of the decision of the Second Respondent, being "in essence (the Appellant) was not believed" 
 
39 In relation to this ground of appeal, I first observe that I consider there is a typographical error in the amended notice of appeal, and that the word "no" in the fourth ground of appeal should be read as "an".</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Otherwise, from the appellant's perspective the ground of appeal makes little sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">40 On behalf of the appellant, Mr Young submitted in relation to this ground of appeal that the findings of the Tribunal as to the credibility of the appellant were inextricably linked with the finding of the Tribunal as to whether the appellant could have left Nepal for India in May 2003 without a visa, and that it was impossible to describe those findings as "independent" (TS p 11 ll 11-45).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">41 In response, Ms Clegg submitted that:
 
&#8226; while the Tribunal accepted some aspects of the appellant's factual claims, it found that she had "embellished her claims in order to enhance her claim for a protection visa".</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">This finding is fatal to the appeal as it demonstrates that the appellant was not believed by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The issue of credit is a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal
 
&#8226; in relation to the second and third grounds of appeal, which were directed to his Honour's conclusions at [19], his Honour correctly concluded that there are a number of answers to the assertion that s 424A(1) obligations were invoked in this case
 
&#8226; even if there were errors in the way the Tribunal dealt with s 424A, there is an independent basis for decision of the Tribunal, namely that the Tribunal considered events in Nepal at the time of the decision and the reasonably foreseeable future and decided, in substance, that not only the appellant but any person would not have any fear of harm in Nepal because of the peace agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">42 In the circumstances, the appellant cannot be successful on this ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">If the findings of the Tribunal are inextricably linked to the information upon which the Tribunal relied concerning the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal (as submitted by Mr Young) so as not to constitute an independent basis of the Tribunal's decision, I have found in any event that such information is exempted from the obligations of the Tribunal under s 424A(1) by s 424A(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">If the findings do constitute an independent basis of the Tribunal's decision, I accept the submissions of Ms Clegg that issues of credit are matters for the Tribunal, and the correctness of the decision of his Honour at [22]-[23] of his Honour's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">43 Accordingly, this ground of appeal also cannot be substantiated.</sentence>

 1.</sentence>
