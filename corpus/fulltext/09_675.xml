<sentence id="s8">BACKGROUND 
 Relevant Parties
 At all material times, the first applicant ("Forbes Asia") was a company incorporated in Singapore, and a subsidiary of Teamsphere Ltd which was also a Singapore-based company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Poh Kiat, who gave evidence on behalf of the applicants at the hearing of this matter, and who was a key witness in these proceedings for the applicants, was at all material times Managing Director of both Forbes Asia and Teamsphere Ltd. The second applicant ("Forbes Australia") was, at all material times, a company incorporated in Australia which carried on business both within and outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Prior to September 1997, Forbes Australia was a specialised company based in Brisbane which provided services to the concrete industry, notably in relation to establishment of plants and the construction of equipment for transportation of concrete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">After the sale of shares of Forbes Australia in September 1997 the company continued to carry on business in the same industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Until September 1997 the owners of the shares in Forbes Australia were two companies, Pearlbunch Pty Ltd ("Pearlbunch") and Talrate Pty Ltd ("Talrate"), both of which were controlled by the first respondent, Mr Forbes, as sole director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Forbes was sole shareholder of Pearlbunch, and was also the sole director and (with Mrs Forbes) a shareholder of another company, Forbes Screens Pty Ltd ("Forbes Screens").</sentence>

<sentence id="s19">On 22 September 1997 Forbes Screens entered into a lease of Lot 9 with Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Share Sale Agreement
 The shares in Forbes Australia were transferred to Forbes Asia on 22 September 1997 for a purchase price of $3.9 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The share sale agreement took place following what appear to be extensive negotiations during July, August and September 1997 between the parties.</sentence>

<sentence id="s23">Formal discussions in the period prior to execution of the share sale agreement involved the parties' legal representatives (including Mr Steven Grant for Mr Forbes and the vendors and Mr Freddy Chan for the purchasers) and accounting advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I shall return to consider these negotiations later in this judgment, because findings in respect of the negotiations are important in relation to a number of the applicants' claims in this case.</sentence>

 (The guarantees referred to in cl 3.3 were referred to throughout the proceedings, and shall be referred to in this judgment, as "the profit guarantees".</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">) Annexure 1 to which cl 3.3 referred provided: 
 Clause 3.3: Formula for calculating the audited Profit before tax of the Company:-

<sentence id="s33">Side Letters Containing Written Indemnity and Guarantee Agreement

<sentence id="s67">

 I have described the guarantees executed by Forbes Screens for completeness, because the existence of these agreements is pleaded by the applicants in paras 15, 16, 17 and 18 of amended statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However the respondents plead that, as no relief is sought against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd, the matters pleaded in those paragraphs are irrelevant and embarrassing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I consider that this pleading of the respondents has merit - indeed no relief is sought by the applicants against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd. New Directors
 After execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters on 22 September 1997, Forbes Asia appointed two new directors to Forbes Australia to serve on the board of Forbes Australia with Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">These directors, Mr Freddy Chan (appointed September 1997) and Mr Norman Lee (appointed July 1998) were associates of Mr Poh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Variations to Share Sale Agreement
 The parties to the share sale agreement executed a number of deeds of variation to that agreement (according to undisputed evidence of Mr Poh --- five separate deeds: affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 15 March 2006 para 11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">For the purposes of these proceedings the relevant deeds were the second, third and fourth deeds of variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The second deed of variation was executed on 12 January 1998 by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia, Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Screens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The deed provided that it was effective to vary the share sale agreement as from 22 September 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The second deed recited that Forbes Asia, Pearlbunch and Talrate had entered into the share sale agreement, that Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Asia had entered into a "Letter of Indemnity" on 22 September 1997, and that Forbes Asia and Forbes Screens had entered into a "Letter of Indemnity" on 22 September 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">(It is clear that the "Letters of Indemnity" to which the deed refers are the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Screens Guarantee respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">) The deed recited further that an error had been discovered in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and cll 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the Letters of Indemnity (Forbes Guarantee and Forbes Screens Guarantee).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The deed continued:

<sentence id="s90">The fourth deed of variation executed by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia and Mr Poh on 23 March 1998 acknowledged the earlier variations of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">So far as is relevant, the parties in this deed of variation varied the share sale agreement to enable the provision of 1,800,000 ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd referred to in cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement to be satisfied by the transfer of 180,000 shares in Teamsphere Ltd. Acquisition of Favco
 In October 1998 an opportunity arose for Forbes Australia to acquire the business of Hood Favco Pty Ltd ("Favco"), a Sydney-based business operating in the same field as Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Correspondence took place between Mr Forbes and Mr Poh in relation to, inter alia , the terms upon which the acquisition of Favco was to take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Liquidity Problems
 It appears that subsequent to the acquisition of Favco, Forbes Australia experienced liquidity problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Indeed there is some evidence before the Court that at one point Forbes Australia was subject to voluntary administration under Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act (affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 18 December 2006 para 4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Demand
 On 6 April 2001 the applicants demanded the respondents pay to Forbes Australia the amounts of $127,284 and $1,691,284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">These sums represented profit shortfalls alleged by the applicants to have been experienced by Forbes Australia in the years ending 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The applicants' demands were made pursuant to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and as stated in the letter of demand "the relevant side letters".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">CLAIMS OF THE APPLICANT 
 As I observed at the commencement of this judgment, it appears that the applicants have abandoned claims against Mr Forbes in respect of breach of director's duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The remaining claims of the applicants as found in the amended statement of claim are: Forbes Asia therefore claimed the following relief: 
(a) a declaration that Forbes Asia is entitled to have the Forbes Guarantee specifically performed and carried into execution; and
 
(b) an order that the respondents specifically perform and carry into effect the Forbes Guarantee by paying Forbes Australia the amount of $1,818,568.00;
 
(c) alternatively, an indemnity pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee for loss and damage;
 
(d) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth);
 
(e) costs; and
 
(f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Forbes Australia claimed the following relief: 
(a) damages in the amount of $1,818,568.00;
 
(b) alternatively, damages in the amount of $265,974.16 for breach of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee;
 
(c) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth);
 
(d) alternatively interest from 12 April 2001 pursuant to the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee;
 
(e) costs; and
 
(f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">DEFENCE 
 The respondents filed a third further amended defence on 13 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The respondents conceded that cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was in the nature of a guarantee of performance by the vendors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Notwithstanding this concession, in substance the respondents plead as follows: The share sale agreement did not permit any calculation, ascertainment or proof of the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia by: the mere fact of preparation of a document or documents (including documents styled as audited financial statements) in purported conformity with cl 3.3; or the presentation or delivery of such document or documents; 
by Forbes Asia to any person who might be liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 (para 4B(ba)(i)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The share sale agreement upon its proper construction permitted the parties who were potentially liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 to undertake their own assessment, and challenge any assertion as to, inter alia , the profit earned by Forbes Australia in each of the 1997, 1998, and 1999 calendar years (para 4B (ba)(ii)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The guarantee under cl 3.3 was, upon its proper construction, premised on the continuation of certain matters set out in cl 3.1 of the share sale agreement, namely that the vendors were and remained entitled to control the make up of the board of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This did not occur --- instead Forbes Asia controlled the make-up of the board of Forbes Australia and appointed new directors as and when it saw fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Accordingly, the guarantee under cl 3.3 was discharged (para 4B(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Alternatively, prior to the formation of the share sale agreement, Mr Forbes provided profit forecasts to Forbes Asia in respect of Forbes Australia's business as it then was, namely based entirely in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Forbes Asia knew that the profit forecasts were based upon Forbes Australia's Brisbane-based business as it then was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement were based on the Brisbane-based business of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In 1999 Forbes Australia's business was altered significantly and substantially by the acquisition of Favco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The acquisition of Favco rendered the profit forecasts originally provided by Mr Forbes inapplicable to Forbes Australia's business after the acquisition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Accordingly, the acquisition of Favco was a fundamental alteration to the transaction guaranteed by the respondents and discharged the respondents from any liability under the profit guarantees (para 4B(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The respondents deny that they incurred any liability under the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee; alternatively that there was no valid consideration for it and accordingly it was void (para 4D).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">While the respondents admit the existence of the deeds of variation to the share sale agreement: the third deed of variation replaced the existing cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement with an entirely new and materially different clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Neither of the respondents agreed to extend any existing guarantee or indemnity provided by them to Forbes Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Forbes Guarantee was discharged by the third deed of variation or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(d)); alternatively, the fourth deed of variation substantially amended cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement which meant that the Forbes Guarantee was discharged or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(e)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In defence of the entire claim the respondents say that the applicants' cause of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of the claim and is thereby statute barred (para 12 --- see also TS p 16 and p 17).</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Alternatively, the respondents say that Forbes Asia is estopped from relying on the profit guarantees in circumstances where: on or about 15 or 16 September 1997, prior to the execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters in respect of Lot 8 and Lot 9, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia said to Mr Forbes that the profit guarantees would never be enforced by Forbes Asia and were just matters necessary to be included to satisfy the demands of its parent company Teamsphere Ltd; in reliance on this representation Mr Forbes executed the documents; subsequent to the execution of the documents, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia has repeated to the respondents that it would not enforce the Profit Guarantee thereby maintaining the representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">ISSUES FOR DECISION 
 It is important as a threshold point to note that Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Screens are not parties to these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The proceedings do not involve an attempt by Forbes Asia to enforce the terms of the share sale agreement against the vendors of shares in Forbes Australia, nor do the applicants seek any relief from Forbes Screens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Accordingly, relief sought by the applicants in the amended application for damages for breach of the share sale agreement is without foundation, because the vendors of the shares who were parties to the share sale agreement are not named as respondents to this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The key issues in these proceedings relate to the enforceability or otherwise of guarantees given by Mr and Mrs Forbes in terms of the profit guarantees in the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr and Mrs Forbes were parties to the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In my view, the following issues require decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Was the effect of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the financial year ending 31 December 1999 was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Was the change of control of Forbes Australia from the vendors to Forbes Asia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Did the third and fourth deeds of variation to the share sale agreement result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Did the transaction resulting in the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors under the Forbes Guarantee?</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Even if the vendors' profit guarantees as articulated in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are valid, are the applicants estopped from relying on them because of the alleged representations of Mr Poh as pleaded in para 13 of the respondents' defence?</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Was the applicants' cause of action statute barred?</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Was the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee enforceable?</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">What are appropriate rulings in relation to the notice of motion filed 12 September 2007?</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">I now turn to each of these issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">So far as concerns the 1998 financial year the applicants submit in their Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as follows: The respondents submitted in summary: Mr Forbes agreed with Mr Poh that the agreed profit shortfall for the 1998 calendar year was $127,284 but the agreement was founded upon a misapprehension on the part of Mr Forbes that there had been a proper accounting of all of Forbes Australia's sales for the 1998 calendar year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Forbes Australia had failed to record approximately $241,000 in sales, which sales had occurred in 1998 rather than 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Although invoices were issued in November and December 1997, Forbes Asia asked for invoices to be re-issued to suit Forbes Asia, and therefore new invoices were issued in respect of the same goods in February 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Forbes Asia, by its request for the issuing of credit notes in respect of those sales, knew that the sales had occurred in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Had those sales been taken up on Forbes Australia's accounts for the 1998 calendar year, there would have been no profit shortfall that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The respondents submit that those sales should have been recorded in Forbes Australia's 1998 calendar year accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Notwithstanding statements of Mr Brauer and Mr Poh in relation to the accruals accounting basis of Forbes Australia: there is no evidence as to whether Forbes Asia treated the sales as having occurred in 1997 or 1998; the re-issued invoices state that title to the goods does not pass until payment for the goods is received (affidavit of Terrence Brauer filed 18 January 2008 exhibit "TB 5" invoices 23295 and 232396); Mr Lytras' evidence, which was not tested or challenged, its that on the face of the relevant invoice documents it is not possible to tell without access to Forbes Australia's books and records whether the sales should properly be attributed to the 1997 or 1998 calendar years (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008 para 4 and para 5).</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Accordingly, it would be unconscionable to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement formed on 14 January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In any event, the agreement formed on 14 January 1999 did not involve, and was not binding upon, Mrs Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Further and alternatively, it is an abuse of process to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement of 14 January 1999 because Forbes Australia has failed to maintain its financial records, meaning that the respondents cannot reasonably and properly identify Forbes Australia's correct sales for the 1998 calendar year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Consideration
 For the moment placing to one side the issue of whether the basis on which the agreement was reached was flawed --- it is clear from the evidence before the Court that an agreement was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes at a meeting held on or about 14 January 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The agreement was to the effect that Forbes Australia had suffered a profit shortfall of $127,284 for the financial year ending 31 December 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It appears that this profit shortfall was calculated by Mr Brauer, the accountant for Forbes Australia, and Mr Kang Ching Hong, the internal auditor for Teamsphere Ltd, and accepted by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It also appears that at that meeting the parties discussed the method by which the profit shortfall would be remedied by Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Subsequently Forbes Australia recorded the sum of $127,294 as a prepayment of rent payable under the Lot 8 lease in the books of account of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">A clear inference may be drawn that this action was in accordance with both the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee which as already noted provided respectively that Mr and Mrs Forbes guaranteed certain profits and that any profit shortfall would be met by way of waiving lease payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The fact that the oral agreement between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes did not result in a written amendment to the Forbes Guarantee does in my view detract from the validity of the agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall so far as concerns Mr Forbes, where the agreement was implemented by reference to journal entries in the accounts of Forbes Australia (cf Koenigsblatt v Sweet [1923] 2 Ch 314).</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Notwithstanding the agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes however, it also appears clear that despite the relevant journal entry Forbes Australia continued to pay Mr Forbes rent in respect of the Lot 8 lease (TS p 302 ll 9-11).</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Subsequently a journal entry reversing the prepayment was entered in Forbes Australia's general ledger on 30 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The fact that this event occurred does not appear to be in doubt (for example evidence that it occurred was given by Mr Brauer in his affidavit sworn 25 January 2006 para 28).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Prima facie on these facts, it follows that if the 1998 profit shortfall agreed by the parties on 14 January 1999 is enforceable, not only is that amount ($127,284) outstanding from the respondents, but because Forbes Australia continued to pay rent of Lot 8 and Lot 9 and any purported prepayment of rent was reversed in the accounts, the applicants have substantiated their claims that: However despite the agreement of 14 January 1999, the respondents contend that it should not be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Three relevant issues arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The first issue is whether any finding as to a profit shortfall or otherwise can be made in the absence of the books and records of Forbes Australia for 1998, which books and records are no longer available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The second issue concerns the claim by the respondents that in fact the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was based on a false assumption as to the value of sales which took place in 1997, but which in fact should have been accounted as having taken place in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The third issue concerns the position of Mrs Forbes, which I will consider later in the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Absence of source financial documentation
 The history of these proceedings reflects the steps taken by the respondents to obtain source financial documentation of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It became clear prior to the trial of the substantive proceedings that the second applicant simply had not retained source financial documentation relating to its affairs in the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Further, it appears that notwithstanding an order of this Court for third party discovery, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (which conducted an audit of the accounts of Forbes Australia for the calendar year ending 31 December 1999) did not have this documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">I accept the submissions by the applicants that the respondents had not asked for source financial documentation until October 2006, which is after the seven year retention period in relation to the documents had elapsed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">There is no suggestion that source documentation had been deliberately destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In my view no adverse inferences can be drawn in relation to the absence of the relevant source financial documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The courts have recognised the importance of access to source financial documentation in the face of conflicting financial evidence (for example, Hamilhall Pty Ltd v AT Phillips Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1446 ; (1994) 54 FCR 173 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">However the fact that source financial documentation is not available does not mean that the Court is unable to make a determination on a question of financial position (for example, David Towney v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for NSW [1997] FCA 656 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In this case, notwithstanding that the books and records of Forbes Australia from the 1998 financial year are not available, the evidence is clear that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes, assisted by informed accounting advisors, agreed on 14 January 1999 that on available figures the profit shortfall for 1998 would be $127,284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">I do not consider that the absence in these proceedings of the source financial documents of Forbes Australia from 1998 undermines the existence of that agreement or in any way gives rise to an abuse of process with respect to this aspect of the claim (an issue to which I will return later in the judgment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">As to the lack of an audit for that period, I note that Mr Poh deposed in his affidavit affirmed 5 January 2008 as follows: 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">I refer to paragraphs 5 to 9 of my First Affidavit affirmed on 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Following what Mr Forbes had said during that meeting, I understood that there had been agreement between Mr Forbes and myself that the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall was $127,284 for the purposes of the Profit Guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Consequently, I did not arrange for Forbes Australia to have its accounts audited by the company auditor (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) for the year ended 31 December 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Because I understood that there was an agreement as to the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall and expected it to be honoured, I considered the cost of an audit to be unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">

 In my view this evidence is consistent with the fact that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes agreed as to the profit shortfall of Forbes Australia for 1998, leaving an audit unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Were Forbes Australia's sales for 1998 actually understated by $240,866.42?</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Of greater concern is the possibility that information which came to the parties' attention after 1998 demonstrated that in fact the agreement of 14 January 1999 was based on inaccurate data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Mr Forbes in his affidavits deposes as to this belief --- in particular in paras 29-32 of his affidavit of 18 January 2008 wherein he deposes as follows: 
 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">I refer to paragraph 34 of Kiat's 2nd Affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In paragraph 35 of my First Affidavit, I say that I verily believe that the profit figure for the year ended 31 December 1998 exceeded the Profit Guarantee figure of $1.4 million by $151,156.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">My belief was based on calculations made by Forbes Australia's staff that were provided to my (sic) early in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The calculations were given to me in the form of a handwritten note, a true copy of which is Exhibit "MF-9" to this Affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">My recollection is that at or shortly after the time I received this note I referred them to Terry Brauer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">

 
 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">I have since been informed by Terry Brauer that he no longer holds the view that the 1998 sales were understated by the sum of $418,000.00 and that the credit notes issued by Forbes Australia at the direction of the First Applicant all appear valid to the extent that the sales recorded in the invoices to which the credit notes relate are recorded elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">

 
 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I have since reviewed the relevant invoices and credit notes myself and say that: 

 
 (a) the sales recorded in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998) are the same as those recorded in invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 (all dated 20 November 1997) and 23451 and 23452 (both dated 8 December 1997); 

 
 (b) the credit notes issued in 1998 in respect of invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 should have been issued in respect of invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 inclusive and invoices numbered 23451 and 23452, because the sales were not actually made until 1998 as indicated in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998).</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">

 
 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In the circumstances, Forbes Australia's profit for the 1998 calendar year was understated by $240,866.42 (not $418,000.00 as I indicated in my First Affidavit) when account is taken of the fact that credit notes were issued, at the request of the First Applicant, in respect of sales that actually took place in 1998 rather than the end of 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">

 Mr Forbes' evidence was supported by evidence of Mr Brauer who deposed that the understated profit for the 1998 was the result of the sale of various concrete mixers by Forbes Australia to the Asian subsidiaries of Teamsphere Ltd, and that following an examination of Forbes Australia's accounts he discovered that these sales had been reversed and were not treated as income in the accounts of Forbes Australia (affidavit of Terrence Brauer affirmed 25 January 2006 para 32 and para 33).</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Indeed Mr Forbes in his affidavit deposed that sales in 1998 had been understated by $240,866.42, which is the sum total of the sales referred to in Invoices 21701 and 23702.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Invoice 23702 refers to the same mixer serial numbers as those supplied pursuant to Invoice 23701, however Invoice 23702 is an invoice for the labour to assemble those mixers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">These invoices are exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Brauer sworn 18 January 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">However it became clear during cross-examination of Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer that the sales which the respondents claimed should have been credited to the 1998 year actually took place in 1997, and were properly accounted as 1997 sales, as claimed by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In fact, the sales which took place in 1997 were, as the applicants claimed, simply reinvoiced in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I note in particular Counsel's cross-examination of Mr Forbes (TS p 284 et seq) with respect to Invoice 21701, (dated 20 February 1998) which Invoice referred to the supply of ten hydraulic mixers and the serial numbers of mixers, and which on the face of the invoice totalled $140,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">As Mr Jones' cross-examination demonstrated, Invoice 23701, dated 20 February 1998, merely reflected sales that were invoiced and shipped in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Further, I note that Mr Brauer conceded during cross-examination that the sales referred to in Invoice 23701 actually took place in 1997 (TS p 327 ll 21-24).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Mr Poh deposed that the two invoices 23701 and 23702 were not actual sales but repeat billings for the sales made in November and December 1997, and the Credit Notes 485 and 549 exhibited on pp 36 and 37 of exhibit TB5 to Mr Brauer's affidavit sworn 18 January 2006 were correctly issued to reverse those repeat billings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In my view this evidence correctly represents the position with respect to the sales referred to in those invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">I note further that the expert evidence in relation to the existence (or otherwise) of a Forbes Australia profit shortfall for 1998 is conflicting and of marginal assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Expert evidence tendered by both parties was qualified by the absence of audited financial statements for 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The expert report prepared by Mr Blackwood for the applicants and dated 18 September 2006 calculated a profit shortfall for the year ended 31 December 1998 as either $195,397 or $171,096, depending on a number of variables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Mr Lytras in giving expert evidence for the respondents deposed that from the information available and given the multiple invoices, it was not possible for him to definitively determine the calendar year in which the sales of hydraulic mixers the subject of invoices 23701 and 23702 took place (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008).</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">However I consider that Mr Lytras' evidence in relation to this issue is of little value in light of the concessions made by both Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer during cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">On this basis, contrary to evidence of Mr Forbes and affidavit evidence of Mr Brauer, I do not accept that that the profits of Forbes Australia were understated by $240,886.42 in 1998, or that the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes on 14 January 1999 as to the profit shortfall experienced by Forbes Australia in 1998 was based on inaccurate data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Conclusion
 The law is clear that contractual provisions in a guarantee are to be construed strictly, and, in relation to provisions for the benefit of the principal, contra proferentum : Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Aust) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 561; Apple Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Mekrizis [2003] NSWSC 126 at [127] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In relation to the 1998 profit shortfall however, it is clear that the fact and amount of a profit shortfall for 1998 were agreed, on an informed basis, by Mr Poh on behalf of both applicants and Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Failing other reasons which have been advanced by the respondents, and to which I shall turn shortly, in my view the amount of $127,284 represents the profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1998 for the purposes of cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and is recoverable from Mr Forbes by the applicants pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee.</sentence>

<sentence id="s216">What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Notwithstanding any findings by the Court in relation to the position of Mr Forbes, the respondents deny that Mrs Forbes is bound to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall amount of $127,284 on the basis that she was not present during discussions about this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The respondents claim further that Mrs Forbes cannot be bound by any agreement of Mr Forbes to the 1998 profit shortfall amount because Mr Forbes had no authority to act on behalf of Mrs Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">This is because: Specifically, the respondents point to Mr Poh's evidence as deposed in para 8 of his affidavit affirmed 25 October 2005 which is as follows: 
 I recall having a conversation at the meeting with Mr Forbes to the following effect: 

 
 Poh Kiat: "Do you accept the figures by the accountants?</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">" 

 
 Mr Forbes did not deny any responsibility for paying the 1998 profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">

 
 Poh Kiat: "When are you going to pay the shortfall?</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "I don't have the cash available to pay the debt at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "Forbes Australia could raise a pre-payment of rent in its financial accounts in relation to Forbes Australia's leases of its Brisbane premises [leased from Mark Forbes, Karen Forbes (the Second Respondent) and Forbes Screens Pty Ltd].</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The pre-payment of rent could be used to pay Forbes Australia's rent on the leases of Lots 8 and 9 for the next seven months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "I can't accept your proposal because I have separated from my wife [Karen Forbes] and do not know what property settlement will be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "I will accept a repayment schedule from you setting out how the pre-payment of rent will be applied against rent as it becomes due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">" 

 
 By this arrangement I meant that only a portion of the rent falling due each month would be paid by application of the pre-payment of rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">

 
 Mark Forbes: "I accept that arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">But if Forbes Australia achieves a profit over and above the 1999 profit target, I will use my entitlement of 10% of that profit to pay the 1998 shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "I accept your proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">" 

 Further, the respondents point to evidence of Mr Poh in his affidavit affirmed 5 February 2008 where Mr Poh deposed at para 28: 
 I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">

 The respondents submit that the effect of any such agreements between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was that any obligation of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 calendar year was replaced by an obligation upon Mr Forbes' alone to pay, by some form of gradual repayment over time, the sum of $127,284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had allowed Mr Forbes to carry out all of the dealings in respect of these transactions, including the contractual negotiations, and in those circumstances she clothed him with ostensible authority to reach the agreed 1998 profit shortfall on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Consideration
 In my view the submissions of the respondents concerning the liability of Mrs Forbes for the agreed 1998 profit shortfall have merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The Forbes Guarantee specifically referred to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and the formula in Annexure 1 to that agreement, both of which in turn referred to the machinery for calculating audited profits before tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The agreement reached between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes as to the 1998 profit shortfall, clearly in substitution of the machinery of calculation provided in the share sale agreement, was a material alteration to the terms of the Forbes Guarantee with respect to the 1998 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Mr Poh has submitted that it is binding, and, as I have already found, it is binding on Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The position is, however, different with respect to Mrs Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It is not in dispute that Mrs Forbes was not present at the meeting of 14 January 1999 when the agreement as to the 1998 profit shortfall was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Indeed in this case there is no evidence of any contact between either applicant and Mrs Forbes in relation to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall (or any other matter), and certainly no actual agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Principles of actual and ostensible authority in agency law are well-known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">A succinct explanation was given by Diplock LJ in Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 at 502: 
 An "actual" authority is a legal relationship between principal and agent created by a consensual agreement to which they alone are parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Its scope is to be ascertained by applying ordinary principles of construction of contracts, including any proper implications from the express words used, the usages of trade, or the course of business between the parties ... 

 
 An "apparent" or "ostensible" authority, on the other hand, is a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a representation, made by the principal to the contractor, intended to be and in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the "apparent" authority, so as to render the principal liable to perform any obligations imposed upon him by such a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">

 
 We have already indicated that actual authority may be implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It is, however, important to emphasise that the authority impliedly granted by the principal to the agent must be such as could be validly granted by express agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">

 These principles represent the law in Australia ( Crabtree-Vickers Pty Ltd v Australian Direct Mail Advertising &amp; Addressing Co Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 49 ; (1975) 133 CLR 72 , Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146 , Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; [2004] 218 CLR 451).</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had clothed Mr Forbes with authority to conclude such an agreement on her behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">However the only evidence before the Court relevant to Mrs Forbes in the context of the meeting of 14 January 1999 and the agreement there reached is that the applicants were aware that Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes had separated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In the absence of evidence to the contrary (of which there is none before me) such circumstances run counter to any claimed representation that Mr Forbes had authority to bind Mrs Forbes to an agreement with the applicants in any respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Further, I agree with the respondents that the agreement concluded between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall was couched only in terms of Mr Forbes' obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">It is settled law that a surety will be discharged from his or her obligations where there is a fundamental alteration to the guaranteed obligations to which the surety has not consented: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 , Wallace-Smith v Thiess Infraco (Swanston) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 49 at [302] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">As the majority said in Ankar (1987) 162 CLR 546 after discussing a number of English cases: 
 These statements of principle ... indicate that the principle is the by-product, not so much of the general law of contract, as of the special relationship between creditor and surety arising out of the suretyship contract upon which equity fastened to protect the surety when the creditor's conduct affected the surety's liability: Holme v Brunskill .</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">According to the English cases, the principle applies so as to discharge the surety when conduct on the part of the creditor has the effect of altering the surety's rights, unless the alteration is unsubstantial and not prejudicial to the surety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The rule does not permit the courts to inquire into the effect of the alteration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The consequence is that, to hold the surety to its bargain, the creditor must show that the nature of the alteration can be beneficial to the surety only or that by its nature it cannot in any circumstances increase the surety's risk, e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">a reduction in the debtor's debt or in the interest payable by the surety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The mere possibility of detriment is enough to bring about the discharge of the surety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">(at 559-560) 

 In Holme v Brunskill [1877] 3 QBD 495 Cotton LJ (Thesiger LJ concurring) said: 
 The true rule in my opinion is, that if there is any agreement between the principals with reference to the contract guaranteed, the surety ought to be consulted, and that if he has not consented to the alteration, although in cases where it is without inquiry evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or that it cannot be otherwise than beneficial to the surety, the surety may not be discharged; yet, that if it is not self-evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or one which cannot be prejudicial to the surety, the Court, will not, in an action against the surety, go into an inquiry as to the effect of the alteration, or allow the question, whether the surety is discharged or not, to be determined by the finding of a jury as to the materiality of the alteration or on the question whether it is to the prejudice of the surety, but will hold that in such a case the surety himself must be the sole judge whether or not he will consent to remain liable notwithstanding the alteration, and that if he has not so consented he will be discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">(at 505-506) 

 In my view Mrs Forbes is not bound by the agreement reached by Mr Poh on behalf of the applicants and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Further, the substituted agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall represented a material alteration to the calculation of that shortfall, the terms of the principal agreement and in particular the liability of the guarantors with respect to the amount guaranteed for the year ending 31 December 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">It is not claimed, and there is no evidence, that this alteration in any way benefited Mrs Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Accordingly, any liability of Mrs Forbes in relation to a profit shortfall for the calendar year ending 31 December 1998 pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee and cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was discharged in light of the substituted agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in respect of that year, and to which she has not consented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Was the effect of clause 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the 1999 financial year was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In relation to the year ending 31 December 1999 the applicants submit that Forbes Australia recorded an audited loss before tax, calculated by reference to the Formula in Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement, of $341,284.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">This loss, recorded in Forbes Australia's audited financial report for that year prepared by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, together with the failure of Forbes Australia to reach the guaranteed profit of $1,350,000 (being 90% of $1,500,000 in accordance with cl 3.3.3 of the share sale agreement as varied) resulted in Forbes Australia experiencing a profit shortfall for that year of $1,691,284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The applicants submit further that the fact that the loss was recorded following an audit in accordance with Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement means that it is conclusive evidence of that loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The applicants refer to the decision of the High Court in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 as authority for this proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The applicants' case in relation to the claimed 1999 shortfall was helpfully summarised by Counsel in closing submissions, as follows: 
 Mr Jones: Your Honour, the applicant's case is very straight forward, and that is the terms of the share sale agreement, clause 3.3 says that the profit guarantee --- the amounts of the profit guarantee are to be referenced by the audited accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Now, in evidence is the only document which fits within that description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It's the audit by Deloittes, the company auditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">They are the audited accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">If they are not audited accounts, and if they are not audited accounts to which that clause refers, then, one may ask rhetorically what conceivably could possibly fit that description of audited accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">There's no suggestion, there's no pleading that that audit report, those accounts are in any way were fraudulently prepared or are not what they say they are...</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">There's much complaint raised that, "Oh, we can't test it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">" That's true to a point, insofar as that every single document which those auditors would have seen are no longer available, and there's the evidence, particularly, that the correspondence between the instructing solicitors explain why that is, and, namely, that the company went into a period of administration for a period of time, and lost control of all of its records, and when it came out of administration it never got those --- all of those records back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">And for some reason the accountants --- the administrators no longer have them, and unfortunately Deloittes no longer have everything either.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Now, but it's... And it's a novel proposition put by the respondent that the plaintiff, in particular a company can't rely on its own audited accounts, which is what we're seeking to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Now, if your Honour accepts that they are the audited accounts of the company for the period 31 December 1999, then, in our submission, that is the end of the story.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">They fit the description of the accounts referred to in the profit guarantee clause, and clearly on their face, they comply with the terms in the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">My friend, in his submissions, put to your Honour that they don't, they merely --- there's a further step that needed to be done, and that hasn't been done, is the effect of my friend's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">If you Honour will turn to exhibit 1A, at page 148, which is at the end of the audit report --- Deloittes audit report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">There it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">

 
 There it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">That's the calculation in accordance with clause 3.3 of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">So the applicant has done all it can conceivably, in terms of establishing what the profit was or --- and rather the loss was, and what the profit shortfall was, in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">And you have the subsequent to that report is the report of Ernst and Young which merely confirms the position of the Deloittes calculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">But your Honour need not, strictly speaking, rely on refer to it as the only report, because the Deloittes report is what it is, the audited reports of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">(TS pp 391-392) 

 The respondents' case with respect to the claimed loss in the 1999 calendar year falls into three parts --- namely an attack on the applicants' interpretation of cl 3.3 as a matter of law, submissions with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report itself, and submissions as to the admissibility of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">In relation to the applicants' interpretation of cl 3.3, the respondents submit that the applicants' claims with respect to the final and conclusive nature of an audit report allegedly produced in compliance with cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are unsustainable in light of ordinary principles of interpretation applicable to commercial contracts because: Further submissions of the respondents with respect to the authority of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report are in summary: The respondents submitted that, in light of these concerns with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, it should be ruled inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Consideration
 Is the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report like a "bankers certificate"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">It is not in contention that, following the resignation of Mr Forbes as chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, Mr Poh asked Mr Singh, the new chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, to ask Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to prepare audited financial statements for the 1999 financial year (TS p 215), and that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The applicants rely on that report as being final and conclusive evidence in relation to that aspect of their claim concerning the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">In Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 the bank brought an action against the appellant to recover the sum of &#8356;998 8s 7d pursuant to a guarantee signed by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">So far as material the instrument of guarantee provided: 
 ... 

 
 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">A certificate signed by the manager or acting manager for the time being of your head office or of any other office of your bank at which the banking account of the customer shall for the time being be kept stating the balance of principal and interest due to you by the customer shall be conclusive evidence of the indebtedness at such date of the customer to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">

 The appellant in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 submitted that the clause was invalid because it had the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the Court and was therefore contrary to public policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">More specifically the appellant submitted that: In finding for the bank the majority of the High Court observed (at 651): 
 This clause does not purport to impose upon the bank the necessity of obtaining the certificate it describes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It is not a qualification of the undertaking to pay contained in the first clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">It does not make a certificate a condition precedent to recovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The promise remains a promise to pay the amount owing; it does not become a promise to pay the amount owing if certified or a promise to pay only what is certified as owing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The bank could recover without the production of a certificate if, by ordinary legal evidence, it proved the actual indebtedness of the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">But the clause, if valid, enables the bank by producing a certificate to dispense with such proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">It means that, for the purpose of fixing the liability of a surety, the customer's indebtedness may be ascertained conclusively by a certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">It was contended, however, for the appellant that, upon its true construction, the clause did not make the certificate conclusive of the legal existence of the debt but only of the amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">It is not easy to see how the amount can be certified unless the certifier forms some conclusion as to what items ought to be taken into account, and such a conclusion goes to the existence of the indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">...(T)he manifest object of the clause was to provide a ready means of establishing the existence and amount of the guaranteed debt and avoiding an inquiry upon legal evidence into the debits going to make up the indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">The clause means what it says, that a certificate of the balance due to the bank by the customer shall be conclusive evidence of his indebtedness to (652) the bank... 

 
 Parties may contract with the intention of affecting their legal relations, but yet make the acquisition or rights under the contract dependent upon the arbitrament or discretionary judgment of an ascertained or ascertainable person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">

 The majority then considered issues relevant to arbitration and concluded: 
 There are many familiar kinds of contracts containing provisions which make the certificate of some person, or the issue of some document, conclusive of some possible question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The most conspicuous example, perhaps, is the certificate of the engineer or architect under contracts for the execution of works or the construction of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">

 
 For these reasons we think the certificate of the officer of the bank is conclusive upon the parties of the amount and existence of the customer's indebtedness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">

 The applicants contend that once audited financial statements are produced, not only does this satisfy the machinery of calculation prescribed in cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 to the share sale agreement, but that as Mr Jones contended during closing submissions, that is "the end of the story".</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">However, after considering the submissions of both parties I have concluded that the applicants have not substantiated their case in relation to alleged profit shortfall for the 1999 calendar year based on the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Although there is force in the submission of the applicants to the effect that, if the audited financial statements for 1999 prepared by the auditors of Forbes Australia did not contain information as to "audited profits before tax" of that company as described in cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement, one indeed might ask what else in the circumstances of this case could conceivably fit that description, I am not persuaded that the reasoning in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 applies in these circumstances for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Construction of clause 3.3
 As I have already observed, as a general proposition the law construes terms in guarantees contra proferentum in the surety's favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">It is clear that the profit guarantee under cl 3.3 exists solely for the benefit of Forbes Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Such a clause should be strictly construed ( Je Maintiendrai Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 38 SASR 70 at 71, Apple Computer [2003] NSWSC 126 at [127] , O'Donovan J &amp; Phillips J, The Modern Contract of Guarantee (4th ed, looseleaf) at 5.920).</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The legal principles emerging from Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 have been largely confined to circumstances where a banker's certificate has been issued as to the amount of indebtedness of a debtor to the bank (for example Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 , Je Maintiendrai Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 128 SASR 70, Campbell v National Australia Bank Ltd [1994] SASC 4526 , Equus Financial Services Limited v Sabri [1994] FCA 1331 , George Biritz v National Australia Bank Limited [1995] VSC 91 , Shomat v Rubenstein (1995) 124 FLR 284 , Thurwood v First for Finance Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 559 , Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking v Pan Foods Company Importers &amp; Distributors Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 346 , Jenkins v National Australia Bank Ltd [1999] VSCA 33 , State Bank v Lo [2000] NSWSC 1191 , State Bank of NSW v Kit Cheng Chia [2000] NSWSC 552 , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Dzienciol [2001] WASC 305 , Julong Pty Ltd v Fenn [2002] QCA 529 , Apple Computer [2003] NSWSC 126 , Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Bouwman [2003] WASC 205 , Timms v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2004] NSWSC 76 , Permanent Trustee Company Limited v Gulf Import and Export Company [2008] VSC 162).</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Since --- and possible because of --- Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 , bankers' certificates have become well-known in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">That is not to say that the principle articulated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has not been extended beyond the banker/customer/surety relationship, however circumstances in which the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principle is applicable are primarily confined to those involving the issue of a certificate as to the existence of a fact pursuant to legislation, or certain types of agreement, for example: As observed by McPherson J in Parker v QBSA [2000] QCA 422 at [13] , the provision concerning conclusiveness of certificate of title under the Torrens system of registration is perhaps the best known Australian legislative example of the issue of a certificate having a final effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">In this case it is clear that: Any clause which purports to specify how a particular issue will be determined so as to preclude the parties from subsequently ventilating that issue in court must be expressed in the clearest of terms ( Stylis v United Medical Protection Ltd [2007] NSWCA 109).</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Neither cl 3.3 (nor Annexure 1) clearly express such a limitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">While these provisions do purport to prescribe a method of calculation of profits, they do not purport to have the effect of finality as was the situation in many of the cases to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In the absence of such language the Court will be loath to impute such an effect: Permanent Trustee Company Ltd v Gulf Import and Export Company &amp; Emirates Trading Agency LLC [2008] VSC 162 at [38] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The preparation of an audit opinion in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, while usually undertaken by experts, is clearly not a banker's certificate as contemplated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 and the overwhelming majority of cases where the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principles have been applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Nor, in my view, is it akin to a banker's certificate, whereby a person nominated by the relevant bank certifies the existence of a fact appearing in bank records, namely the recorded amount of indebtedness of a customer to the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Further, in the sense that an audit report is produced, albeit in an expert fashion, but based upon information provided by the company itself, in my view it is not akin to a certificate given by an engineer, an architect or a builder, who certifies the existence of a state of affairs in relation to construction of a building which he or she has personal knowledge and control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Clause 3.3 can be contrasted with cll 3.4.2, 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 of the share sale agreement which do purport to prescribe certifications by third parties in a manner akin to cases where Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has been applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">These clauses refer to the retention and subsequent payment of the "Retention Sum" by the vendors' solicitors as follows:

<sentence id="s339">The existence of cl 17 and the fact that it applies to all disputes militates against an interpretation that audited financial statements were to be a final and conclusive determination of the profits of Forbes Australia within the meaning of cl 3.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Possible failure of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report to comply with Annexure 1
 Even assuming that the effect of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 is that an audit opinion is akin to a "Dobbs" certificate as submitted by the applicants, I do not accept that the position as to the audited profits before tax is so finally and conclusively determined by the tender of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu audit report that the respondents are not permitted to challenge the findings of the report on the basis that it does not comply with Annexure 1, which provided the machinery of calculation adverted to in cl 3.3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The High Court in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 accepted that a clause of this nature should not be interpreted as covering all grounds which go to the validity of the amount certified, for example illegality (at 651).</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Similarly, the Courts have found that a certificate can be challenged on such grounds as fraud and obvious error ( Permanent Trustee Company Limited v Gulf Import and Export Company [2008] VSC 162) , although if the certificate is properly tendered the onus falls upon the defendant to demonstrate by acceptable evidence that the certificate is incorrect ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Oberdan [2000] SASC 428 at [14] , Concrete Constructions Group Pty Ltd v Coddlestone Pty Ltd [1995] ACTSC 332).</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">In this case cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 are not framed in such terms that an audit report is final and conclusive irrespective of any errors (whether manifest or otherwise) in calculations of the audited financial statements or failure of the audit report to comply with the prescribed formula in Annexure 1 (contrast for example State Bank of NSW v Chia [2000] NSWSC 552).</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Accordingly it could not be contended that the claimed profit shortfall of $1,691,284 as stated in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report would be final and conclusive even if the respondents were able to demonstrate flaws in the calculations which arrived at that figure, including failure to comply with the prescribed formula in Annexure 1 or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">The respondents submit that because of the absence of source financial documentation, they cannot test the accuracy of the report through cross-examination or other analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">In light of this submission I note the following: The expert accounting evidence tendered during the proceedings suggests deficiencies attendant upon the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report; The expert report of Mr Angus Blackwood dated 18 September 2006 for the applicants is of minimal assistance in relation to the report because Mr Blackwood's comments in relation to the 1999 profits are based upon the audited financial statements by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Mr Elia Lytras, an expert witness for the respondents, deposed that in order to determine the audit profit shortfall or excess for Forbes Australia for the year ended 31 December 1999 he required copies of all the instructions, working papers and files of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in relation to their audit of the Financial Reports of Forbes Australia (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 18 January 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">It is not in dispute that the documentation requested by Mr Lytras was not available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Mr Robert Edwards, a registered company auditor who gave expert evidence for the respondents, deposed that as at the date of his affidavit there was an absence of essential documentation necessary for him to prepare an audit of the accounts of Forbes Australia for 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">More significantly, Mr Edwards deposed that the lack of essential documentation provided by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in response to requests for information meant that he was unable to assess the quality of the 1999 audit of Forbes Australia undertaken by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (affidavit of Robert Edwards affirmed 21 September 2007).</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Annexure 1 requires that, in calculating the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia and its subsidiaries, the following were to be excluded: extraordinary items; abnormal items; gain or loss on disposal and/or revaluation of assets; expenses relating to research and development; provisions for long service leave; additional depreciation and amortisation resulting from the value of any item.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">
However as the respondents submitted, these were steps which were, in accordance with the formula, to be undertaken after the delivery of the audited accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The significance of these items is apparent from the undisputed evidence of Mr Lytras in his affidavits affirmed 11 September 2007 and 11 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">In his affidavit affirmed 11 September 2007, Mr Lytras stated that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was unable to provide any data which explained a $1,068,399 variance in their audited figures from the management accounts for the year ended 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">In a briefing note exhibited to his affidavit affirmed 11 February 2008 (exhibit 6), Mr Lytras stated that he believed that the variance arose due to a substantial and material write-down of trade debtors, accompanied by raising a significant bad debt provision, as at 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Mr Lytras also stated, inter alia , that:
 The material provided by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu contained no explanation for the reasons or basis for those write-downs or the additional bad debt provision --- accordingly it was not possible to form an opinion as to the reasonableness of the write-down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">At least one of the debts written off was more than twelve months prior to 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The nature of the Favco Australia amounts written off were unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The write-down causing the variance accords with the definition of "abnormals", was of significant size and had a significant impact upon the entity's trading performance for the subject period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In view of the lack of source financial documentation it was unclear whether the write-down was extraordinary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">In summary, Mr Lytras' evidence was that the possible treatment of extraordinary and abnormal items potentially affected the 1999 calendar year profit result, as stated in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In the absence of the source financial documentation, it is not possible to be confident that the accounts were produced in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards or that the formula in Annexure 1 had been followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">In my view this evidence demonstrates that there are grounds for inferring either errors in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, or that the report does not comply with Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">On this basis I do not consider that the audit statements in the report are reliable evidence of the profit position of Forbes Australia in the year ending 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Should the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report be ruled inadmissible?</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Finally, the respondents submit that the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report should be ruled inadmissible on the basis of both s 135 and s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The applicants concede that, if I were to so rule, there is a cascading effect in relation to the report prepared by Ernst &amp; Young dated 4 October 2001 (exhibited to Mr Poh's affidavit) based on the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Report, so that my decision in relation to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report will determine the fate of the Ernst and Young document (TS p 26 ll 9-13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">The Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Report is in the form of an expert opinion, however the applicants do not press for its admission on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Rather, the applicants submit that it falls within the exception to the hearsay rule for business records in accordance with s 69 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">To qualify as a business record the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report must satisfy the following criteria: 
 s 69.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">(1) ... a document that: 

(a) either:
 
(i) is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business; or
 
(ii) at any time was or formed part of such a record; and
 
(b) contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
 (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made: 

(a) by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact; or
 
(b) on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">
 ....
 (5) For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person's knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">Note 1: Sections 48 , 49 , 50 , 146 , 147 and subsection 150(1) are relevant to the mode of proof, and authentication, of business records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">

 
 Note 2: Section 182 gives this section a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">

 The purpose of the s 69 exception to the hearsay rule for business records was noted by Sperling J in Roach and Ors v Page and Ors (No 27) [2003] NSWSC 1046 at [11] : 
 The thinking behind the section is clear enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Things recorded or communicated in the course of the business and constituting or concerning business activities are likely to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">There is good reason for the courts to afford to such records the same kind of reliability as those engaged in business operations customarily do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The same is not true of publications made for wider dissemination, for entertainment, for advertising or for public relations purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Such publications are justifiably received with healthy scepticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">

 Essentially business records are prepared as internal records in the course of or for the purposes of the business (Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 at [212] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Business records can clearly include opinions ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 933) however as observed by Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417: 
 It is most unlikely that those expressing opinions in business records would attend to the requirements of s 78 or s 79 , let alone with the precision required by Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">It would not occur to the people creating those documents that they should set out to justify their opinions in the same way that an expert would do in preparing a written report for a court hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">In those circumstances, to apply the opinion rule to business records that meet the requirements of s 69 would be substantially to undermine, if not to negate, the implementation of the policy underlying the business records provisions, asserted so forcefully by Hope JA in Albrighton (at 548-549) and by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report on Evidence at [709].</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Courts would be prevented from having access to substantial components of the records of businesses so as to assess them for what they are, on the ground that they do not satisfy requirements which their authors would not have regarded as relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">As Brownie AJ remarked in a somewhat different context ( Linfox Transport (Aust) Pty Ltd v Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 261 at [23]), "it does not seem apt in this context to draw a lawyerly distinction between the way a witness might or might not be permitted to give opinion evidence in court with the way in which a company officer routinely reports to his superiors".</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">(at [212]) 

 While an expert audit report is clearly of a different character to "routine business records", in my view an auditor's report on the financial position of the company can fall within the description of forming "part of the records belonging to or kept by ... (an) organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">I have noted the absence of witnesses capable of giving evidence as to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, and the lack of opportunity of the respondents to test the contents of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">This is not, however, automatically fatal to the admissibility of a business record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">As Heerey J observed in Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 at [25] : 
 The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the "person" in question be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The policy behind the provision is clear enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)) , have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law's aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">

 The absence of the author of the report, or anyone who could explain it, as a witness in these proceedings is, however, an issue which goes to weight to be attributed to the evidence: Ringrow [2003] FCA 933 at [27] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Although the Deloittes Touche Tohmatsu report may be a "business record" for the purposes of s 69 of the Evidence Act and prima facie admissible, a balance must be struck between the probative and prejudicial value of the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Section 135 of the Evidence Act empowers the court to refuse to admit evidence its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or
 
(b) be misleading or confusing; or
 
(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In my view the prejudice likely to be suffered by the respondents from admission of the Deloittes Touche Tohmatsu report outweighs its probative value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">I form this view because as I have already explained, I consider that the evidence discloses grounds for serious concern as to the compliance of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu audit report with cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">This issue is compounded by the absence of the author of the report, any witness who could speak to the report, and the absence of source financial documentation, all of which mean that the contents of the report cannot be properly tested by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Accordingly I consider the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report should be ruled inadmissible pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">As I have also noted, the same fate applies to the Ernst &amp; Young report of 4 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Conclusion
 In light of these findings, it follows that the applicants have not substantiated their claim against the respondents with respect to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Was the change of control of Forbes Australia from the vendors to Forbes Asia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The respondents claim that, because of the alteration to the factual substratum brought about by the change in control of Forbes Australia's operations, the respondents were discharged from any liability in respect of the profit guarantee within cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and the side letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">In particular, the respondents point to cl 3.1 of the share sale agreement which provides as follows: 
 The Vendors hereby unequivocally admit and acknowledge that the Vendors being the only shareholders of the Company and who are entitled to appoint and appoint all the present directors of the Company are in control of and shall ensure that all covenants by the Vendors as regards causing the performance by the Company through the control of the present directors of the company can and shall be so effected by the Vendors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">

 The respondents submit in summary that following the execution of the share sale agreement: In relation to this contention, the applicants submit in summary that: The respondents' reliance on cl 3.1 is misconceived because the clause manifestly relates to the position of the vendors at the time of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">The clause cannot be reasonably construed in the manner sought, because once the vendors had sold their shares they inevitably lost their power to appoint the directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Clause 3.6 makes it clear that it was never intended that the respondents would be entitled to appoint directors at will and exercise complete control after execution of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Clause 3.6 provides: 
Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably be (sic) withheld), the Vendors shall not appoint any persons to hold the position as a director of the Company until the Completion Date and if the Purchaser shall so consent, to ensure that such person shall cause the Company to comply with the provisions herein and give effect to the purpose thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Additionally the Vendors shall ensure that the Company shall not change any of its mandate to operate the bank accounts of the Company or open new bank accounts without the written consent from the Purchaser if the mandate for such new accounts is not the same as that referred to in Clause 2.1.2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">In any event Mr Forbes' employment contract gave him control of Forbes Australia to the exclusion of Mr Poh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Consideration
 Provision of profit guarantees in circumstances where the guarantor or related entities have no control over decisions impacting upon profit potentially places the guarantor at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">This is not to say, however, that an agreement leading to this state of affairs is not enforceable by the principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In relation to this issue I accept the submissions of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Clause 3.1 clearly related to the position of the vendors at the time of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">It is a warranty one would typically expect to find in an agreement of this nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Further, as the applicants submit, the point of the share sale agreement was to transfer ownership of shares --- which generally carries with it the power to appoint directors --- from the vendors to Forbes Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">It is not surprising therefore that Forbes Asia, as owner of the shares in Forbes Australia, should have appointed Mr Chan and Mr Lee to the board of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Indeed as already observed, cl 3.6 --- which was another covenant of the vendors to the share sale agreement --- specifically prohibited the vendors of the shares appointing any person as a director of Forbes Australia after the execution of the share sale agreement without the prior written consent of Forbes Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">If the respondents' construction of cl 3.1 was valid, the profit guarantee contained in cl 3.3 would always be meaningless because once the vendors had sold their shares they lost all power to appoint the directors of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I do not accept the respondents' submission that they were discharged from any liability in respect of the profit guarantee within cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement because the vendors ceased to retain control over the board or indeed the company after execution of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">As an additional observation I note that pursuant to the Contract of Employment between Forbes Australia and Mr Forbes (pp 83-93 of exhibit PK1 to Poh's affidavit affirmed 25 October 2005) dated 22 September 1997 (the same date as the share sale agreement) Mr Forbes was appointed chief executive officer of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">The Schedule to the agreement defined the Mr Forbes' duties as "all operations of the company" and gave Mr Forbes significant authority in respect of entering into contracts on behalf of the company, signing cheques on behalf of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Further, cl 6 of the share sale agreement specifically gave Mr Forbes control over expenses related to the formula for calculating the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia, prescribed by cl 3.3 as the key determinant of the vendors' profit guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Clearly Mr Forbes remained subject to control by the Board --- and to some extent the views of Mr Poh as managing director of the parent of Forbes Australia --- however on a daily basis Mr Forbes clearly continued to retain control over a significant aspect of the operations of Forbes Australia after the sale of shares in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">In this light, and in addition to the views I have already expressed as to the respondents' claims concerning cl 3.1, I do not accept the respondents' contentions as to the justice of the case in respect of the vendors' liability for profit guarantees under cl 3.3 or the respondents liability in respect of those profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Accordingly, I consider that this aspect of the respondents' defence fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Did the third and fourth deeds of variation to the share sale agreement result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">In summary, the respondents submit: The applicants submit in summary: The third and fourth deeds of variation in no way touched on the profit guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The respondents have adduced no evidence to show that the deeds fundamentally altered the obligations regarding the profits of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Clause 4 of the Forbes Guarantee applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">The indemnity given by the respondents which the applicants seek to enforce in no way relates to the consideration paid or payable by Forbes Asia to the vendors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Consideration
 As I have already observed, a surety is discharged where there is a fundamental alteration to the guaranteed obligations to which the surety has not consented unless the alteration is unsubstantial and not prejudicial to the surety: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 ; Wallace-Smith [2005] FCAFC 49.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The parties to the third deed of variation executed on 16 February 1998 were Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Asia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The primary amendment to the share sale agreement effected by this deed was in respect of cl 2.3 and the nature of the final cash injection under the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In summary, the final cash payment of $1,099,999 to the vendors was altered to $599,999 in cash and the balance by way of 1.8 million ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd. The parties to the fourth deed of variation executed on 23 March 1998 were Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia and Mr Poh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">This deed had the effect of altering new provisions inserted by the third deed of variation in respect of the final cash injection under the share sale agreement --- the 1.8 million ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd were amended to instead be 180,000 shares in Teamsphere Ltd. An examination of the deeds of variation indicates that there were numerous other amendments made to the share sale agreement, and upon which the respondents have elected not to rely, presumably on the basis that those other amendments were either unsubstantial or did not cause prejudice to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Although Mr Forbes was not personally a party to either deed of variation, I note that Mr Forbes was actually the sole director of both vendors who were parties to the deeds of variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Presumably Mr Forbes had personal knowledge of the reasons for the variations to the share sale agreement, notwithstanding that he personally was not a party to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">In any event, the amendments to the share sale agreement in the third and fourth deeds of variation upon which the respondents rely relate only to the form of consideration payable by Forbes Asia to the vendors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">In no way do these amendments impact upon the covenants of the vendors under the share sale agreement, which are guaranteed by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">In no way do the amendments increase the liabilities of the vendors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">In no way do the amendments impact upon the rights of the respondents as sureties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Further, and of particular relevance to these proceedings, in no way is it apparent that the alteration in the form of consideration payable to the vendors would impact upon the profits of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">I also note that, as submitted by the applicants, the claims of the respondents that the vendors would suffer prejudice --- whether actual or potential --- by being required to accept shares in Teamsphere Ltd rather than cash as part payment of the third instalment under the share sale agreement were not supported by any evidence whatsoever.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The contentions of the respondents as to prejudice were, in my view, purely speculative and unsubstantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">In summary, in my view the amendments upon which the respondents rely do not affect the suretys' rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I am not satisfied that the amendments to the share sale agreement operated to discharge the obligations of the respondents as guarantors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The applicants also rely on cl 4 of the Forbes Guarantee, whereby the respondents covenanted as follows: 
 We hereby waive all our rights to defences available to in respect of the above guarantee and indemnity under the laws of Queensland, and shall pay to you on demand all monies, losses and damages and costs and expenses, suffered or incurred by you as a result of the Vendors' breach or failure to comply with the Vendors' obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">

 In relation to cl 4 the respondents submit that: I agree with the respondents that any ambiguity in relation to cl 4 ought be resolved in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Not likely do the Courts assume that a party to a contract gives up all defences available at law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">However in my view the respondents' defence with respect to the variations to the share sale agreement are not assisted by their submissions in respect of cl 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Unlike the situation as considered in Corumo Holdings (1991) 24 NSWLR 370 , variations to the share sale agreement in this case were not such as to impact on the obligations of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Prima facie , the respondents are bound by cl 4 of the Forbes Guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Was the transaction resulting in the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">In relation to this point the respondents submit in summary: The applicants submit in summary: The acquisition of Favco was Mr Forbes' idea alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The evidence of Mr Poh, which Mr Forbes did not dispute in his evidence in chief, was that Mr Poh expressly told Mr Forbes that it was his (that is, Mr Forbes') decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Mr Forbes, as chief executive officer, had exclusive control over such expenses of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The acquisition of Favco, being Mr Forbes' own decision, cannot alleviate him of his responsibility under the profit guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Consideration
 In my opinion the submissions of the respondent in respect of this aspect of their Defence cannot be substantiated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">I form this view for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">First, the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia was clearly the result of decisions made in the course of management of Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The managing director and chief executive officer at the time of the acquisition was Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">During cross-examination, Mr Forbes gave evidence to the effect that the decision to acquire Favco was that of Mr Poh: 
 The truth is it was in the prospectus and the Teamsphere release that Forbes Australia expand throughout Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Now, it was Poh Kiat's plan, and it would certainly never be my plan if I owned Forbes Engineering myself, prior to the takeover, I would never be buying Favco because I wouldn't have had the funds to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">

 
 Okay?---Nor the manpower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">

 
 All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">That's what you say; that's your evidence?---That's what I'm saying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">(TS p 312 ll 1-9) 

 However Mr Poh's evidence-in-chief was as follows: 
 [38] In or about October 1998, Mr Forbes telephoned and subsequently wrote to me regarding a proposal to purchase the various assets of Favco (Australia) Pty Ltd ("Favco"), a competitor of Forbes Australia operating out of Wetherill Park, Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Under the proposal, Forbes Australia was to purchase certain fixed assets and manufacturing facilities of Favco in Wetherill Park, and in return, Favco would purchase from Forbes Australia certain quantity of completed units of concrete mixers and batching plants to set-off the purchase consideration of Favco's assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The purchase of Favco was strongly recommended by Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">I recall saying to Mr Forbes words of the following effect: 

 
Poh Kiat: "The decision to purchase Favco rests on you as you are the managing director of Forbes Australia, and especially because you are a guarantor on the profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">I am therefore not in a position to influence your decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">"
 
 
 [39] The purchase of Favco's certain fixed assets were concluded in February 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">A copy of the memorandum I received from Mr Forbes regarding the terms of the deal with Favco is at Exhibit PK2 at pages 116 to 121.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">

 An examination of the documents at pp 116-121 of exhibit PK2 to Mr Poh's affidavit affirmed 15 March 2006 shows that they appear as follows: In my view the proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence before the Court is as follows: Accordingly I consider that the acquisition of Favco, having Mr Forbes' concurrence if not the result of his own decision as chief executive officer, cannot alleviate him of his responsibility under the profit guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Second, in any event I consider the facts that the profit forecasts which formed the framework for negotiations and discussions in relation to the profit guarantee related only to the Brisbane-based business of Forbes Australia, and that there was no suggestion prior to 22 September 1997 that Forbes would undergo any radical expansion in its operations, are of no moment in relation to the liabilities of the respondents as guarantors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">I take this view because I consider that the acquisition of Favco in the circumstances I have outlined was actually, to paraphrase comments of Phillips J in City of London v New Hampshire Insurance Company (unreported, Phillips J Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court) 18 January 1991), discussed in Butterworth's Journal of International Banking and Financial Law , March 1991, pp 144-5 and cited in Duffy Bros Fruit Market (Campbelltown) v Gumland Property Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 7 at [220] ) an event "arising out of a contemplated course of dealing" and as such it remained within the scope of the guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">No provision of the share sale agreement or the guarantees signed by the respondents limited the activities of Forbes Australia following execution of the share sale agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">The expansion of the business of Forbes Australia under the control of Mr Forbes as chief executive officer by the acquisition of Favco was not an event which could be considered as outside the terms of either the share sale agreement or the relevant guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">There was no covenant in any relevant agreement that, for example, Forbes Australia would continue to operate a business based only in Brisbane (contrast for example Spencer, Turner and Boldero v Lotz (1916) 32 TLR 373 where the Court held that the intention of the parties was that the guarantee should only be in respect of goods supplied in a certain location and not otherwise).</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Third, even if contrary to my view as to the weight of evidence before the Court the acquisition of Favco was not the decision of Mr Forbes, the acquisition of Favco was not an event which caused a material variation to the terms of the share sale agreement: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 559.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">It could not be said, for example, that the acquisition of Favco involved conduct on the part of the creditor (Forbes Asia) having the effect of altering the suretys' rights: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 559.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Finally, the respondents cannot point to any provision in the terms of the guarantee side letters as executed by the respondents which support the proposition that the acquisition of Favco involved a departure from the terms as agreed in the guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">In this respect the events of which the respondents complain can be contrasted with, for example, the facts of Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 itself, where the High Court held that the surety had been discharged from liability because, inter alia : Accordingly, I consider that this aspect of the respondents' defence fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Even if the vendors' profit guarantee as articulated in clause 3.3 of the share sale agreement is valid, are the applicants estopped from relying on it because of the alleged representations of Mr Poh as pleaded in paragraph 13 of the respondents' defence?</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">In relation to this issue, the respondents submit in summary: The applicants submit in summary that: Mr Poh denies ever telling Mr Forbes that he would not call on the profit guarantees Even if there is a factual basis for the estoppel in relation to the alleged promise not to enforce the profit guarantees, the estoppel cannot be enforced by the respondents because cl 13 of the share sale agreement expressly provides that the written contract is the entire agreement and the estoppel is inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous terms of the guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Consideration
 Mr Forbes deposed in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 that, at a meeting of 21-22 September 1997 during negotiations for the sale of shares in Forbes Australia, he walked out of the meeting and was chased by Mr Poh who had a private conversation with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Mr Forbes deposed that Mr Poh said words to the effect that "the profit guarantees would never be enforced by him and were just something that he needed to have in the documentation for the other directors of Teamsphere Ltd" (para 15).</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">He deposed further that at the conclusion of a meeting on 14 January 1999 he spoke with Mr Poh and said words to the following effect "Your representation to me was that the profit guarantees would never be enforced", in response to which Mr Poh agreed that he would not enforce the profit guarantees (para 22 and para 24).</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Finally, Mr Forbes deposed that after the release of the prospectus for Teamsphere Ltd on 27 March 1999, he attended a press conference in Singapore during which Mr Poh responded to a specific question from a member of the press in relation to Forbes Australia and the profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">He recalled that Mr Poh responded to the question with words to the effect that "The profit guarantees are no longer relevant" (para 28).</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">In his affidavit affirmed 15 March 2006 Mr Poh denied that he had made any representations alleged by Mr Forbes, at either meetings with Mr Forbes or at the press conference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Mr Poh gave a different account of the events at the meeting of 21-22 September 1997, in which Mr Forbes did not walk out of the meeting, but rather Mr Poh approached Mr Forbes in the room to have a private discussion with him away from the professional advisers, and in which Mr Poh did not say that he would not enforce the profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">On the evidence before me I do not accept that Mr Poh gave an assurance to Mr Forbes that profit guarantees would never be enforced by him, as claimed by Mr Forbes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">I form this view for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">First, Mr Poh was adamant during cross-examination that he had never promised not to enforce the profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">I was impressed by Mr Poh's demeanour as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Second, Mr Forbes deposed in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 at para 23 that, in relation to his failure to raise the issue of the promise not to enforce the guarantee with Mr Poh at the meeting of 14 January 1999, "I did not raise my concern referred to in Paragraph 23 during the meeting due to MR KANG'S presence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">(I presume that the reference to para 23 should actually be a reference to para 22, where Mr Forbes deposed: 
At the conclusion of the meeting, I spoke to POH KIAT and said words to the following effect:
 
 
Your representation to me was that the profit guarantees would never be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">)
 
 No explanation is given by Mr Forbes as to why he was unwilling to raise the representation allegedly given by Mr Poh in front of a third party in Mr Poh's presence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">One obvious inference which can be drawn from his reluctance is that Mr Forbes was not confident as to the veracity of any such alleged representation, and believed that Mr Poh would refute its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Third, as became clear during cross-examination, the only person Mr Forbes recalled telling about Mr Poh's alleged representation was Mr Grant, on the basis that Mr Grant was "more like a confidante, a trusted friend, a family friend, that I had had for years and years, and he's been my solicitor, and I confided in him in most of the business dealings I had had" (TS p 293 ll 38-40).</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Mr Grant's evidence was that Mr Forbes told him during a break from negotiations for the terms of the share sale agreement that Mr Forbes had told him that Mr Poh had said Forbes Australia would never rely on the profit guarantees (affidavit of Steven Grant affirmed 23 January 2008 para 14).</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">However even assuming that this communication did take place, Mr Forbes' --- and presumably Mr Grant's --- apparent lack of confidence in the existence of this representation is reflected in the fact that no steps were taken to commit the representation to writing in any way, including reflected in any agreement between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Notwithstanding this alleged representation, no provision was even made to qualify the right of Forbes Asia to enforce the profit guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">This is particularly important in light of the fact that cl 13 of the share sale agreement provides that the agreement was an entire agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Presumably Mr Grant as Mr Forbes' solicitor was aware of these issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Fourth, Mr Brauer claimed during cross-examination that Mr Forbes had told him about Mr Poh's promise after completion of the negotiations (TS p 325 ll 41-45) however it appears from both Mr Forbes' evidence-in-chief and his evidence under cross-examination that Mr Forbes had no such recollection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">In my view Mr Brauer's evidence is of no weight as evidence of the occurrence of the alleged representation by Mr Poh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">Fifth, as became clear during cross-examination of Mr Forbes, Mr Forbes never mentioned the alleged promise of Mr Poh not to enforce the profit guarantees during board meetings of Forbes Australia when the profit guarantees were discussed (TS p 303 ll 14-18).</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Sixth, any alleged promise of Mr Poh not to enforce profit guarantees runs counter to the fact that the profit guarantees were clearly an important aspect of the sale of shares in Forbes Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The importance of the profit guarantees is reflected not only by cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 to the share sale agreement, but also by the provisions of the guarantees given by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Finally, the alleged representation of Mr Poh is inconsistent with Mr Poh's concern that Mr Forbes comply with his guarantee obligations in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">While on the evidence before me it appears that, in light of the launch of the Teamsphere Ltd IPO in early 1999, Mr Poh did not wish to publicise the existence of the 1998 Forbes Australia profit shortfall or the obligation of the respondents to make up that shortfall, relevant events including journal entries and reversal of journal entries which I have already described in my view make it clear that the obligation of the respondents in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall was never waived by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">This aspect of the respondents' defence is not substantiated on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Was the applicants' cause of action statute barred?</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The respondents claimed in defence of the applicants' entire claim that the applicants' cause of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of the claim and is therefore statute barred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">This aspect of the defence was not pressed at the hearing by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">In my view it is clear that the respondents' claim in this respect is not substantiated, because: Accordingly, this aspect of the respondents' defence fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Was the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee enforceable?</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The terms of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee are as follows: 
 Re: (1) Lease of all that piece of land held under Title Reference 17447194 for Lot 8 on RP 229240 in the County of Stanley, Parish of Toombul, Queensland, Australia ("Land") by us to FEH pursuant to a Lease Agreement dated 22 September 1997 ("Lease") which Land represent the land whereupon the main factory and offices of FEH is located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">____________________________________________________________________ 

 
 In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">

 
 Dated: 22 September 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">

 The document was addressed to Forbes Australia, and signed by Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes in the presence of witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">It is not in dispute that Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes entered into a lease of Lot 8 with Forbes Australia on 17 September 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">The respondents admit the existence of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, but deny that the respondents incurred any liability to the applicant under the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">As the purported consideration for the agreement was the respondents' agreement to enter into the Lot 8 Lease --- a past event --- the respondents also plead that the agreement is not supported by valid consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Further, the respondents contend: It does not appear that the applicants rely upon the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claim in relation to either the alleged 1998 profit shortfall or the alleged 1999 profit shortfall; and In any event, it is plain that only past consideration was given in relation to the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, rendering it unenforceable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Consideration
 The applicants plead the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in both the Amended Statement of Claim and the Reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Paragraph 13 and para 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim provides: 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">On or about 22 September 1997 Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes entered into a written agreement with Forbes Australia in respect of the Lot 8 Lease (the "Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee") 

 
 Particulars 

 
Agreement dated 22 September 1997 (also known as "Lot 8 side letter 2")
 
 
 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee included the following express terms: 

 
(a) Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes were obligated to Forbes Australia to effect the adjustments of rent as provided in clauses 3.1 and 3.3 of the Forbes Guarantee; and
 
 
(b) In the event that Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes are required to refund to Forbes Australia such portion of the rent as has been paid, Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes shall pay to Forbes Australia on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">In relation to the respondents' contention with respect to lack of consideration, the applicants plead in para 1 of the Reply: 
 (a) Forbes Australia expected that the Respondents would be bound by the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">

 
 Particulars 

 
The basis for the expectation are the facts pleaded at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim
 
 
 (b) The Respondents induced Forbes Australia's expectation pleaded at paragraph 1(a) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">

 
 Particulars 

 
The Plaintiff repeats paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim
 
 
 (c) In reliance on the expectation pleaded at paragraph 1 (a) above Forbes Australia did not insist on the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee being in the form of a Deed 

 
 (d) In the circumstances the Respondents knew and intended that Forbes Australia would rely on the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee 

 
 (e) Forbes Australia will suffer detriment if the Respondents do not honour the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.</sentence>

 (f) The Respondents have failed to avoid the detriment to Forbes Australia by refusing or failing to honour the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">

 
 (g) In the circumstances pleaded at paragraphs 1 (a) to (f) above the Respondents are estopped from relying on the defence pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">

 The respondents are in error in submitting that the applicants do not rely upon the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claim in relation to either the alleged 1998 profit shortfall or the alleged 1999 profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">In para 30 of the amended statement of claim, the applicants plead: 
 In breach of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee: 

 
 (a) Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes failed to refund to Forbes Australia in respect of the Lot 8 Lease: 

 
i.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">For the year ending 31 December 1999 - $127,284.00;
 
ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">For the year ending 31 December 2000 - $138,690.16 (being all of the rent paid in that year).</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">As I have already found, a journal entry was made in the books of Forbes Australia whereby the agreed profit shortfall for 1998 was treated as a pre-payment of Forbes Australia's rent in respect of the Lot 8 Lease (presumably in accordance with the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee) but this journal entry was subsequently reversed on 30 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">The evidence is clear that Forbes Australia continued to pay the respondents rent in 1999 notwithstanding the agreed existence of the 1998 profit shortfall and the terms of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, and that the respondents did not refund the rent notwithstanding the agreed 1998 profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">It does not appear to be in contention that Forbes Australia paid the respondents rent in 2000 in the amount of $138,690.16 although having made this observation I note that the applicants claim no relief referable to the year ending 31 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The applicants plead that, by reason of the alleged breaches of both the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, both applicants suffered loss and damage (amended statement of claim para 31 and para 32).</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">It is clear that the amounts in respect of loss and damage which the applicants claim arise from the breaches of the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee are alternative, not cumulative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Accordingly, I do not accept the respondents' contention that the applicants do not rely on the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claims (although clearly more reliance is placed on the terms of the Forbes Guarantee).</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">Of more substance is the claim by the respondents that, because the nominated consideration for the respondents entering the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee was the previous agreement of Forbes Australia to enter into the Lot 8 Lease with the respondents, the consideration for this agreement is past consideration and invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Of particular moment is the fact that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is not in the form of a deed, where consideration would have been unnecessary ( Morley v Boothby [1825] EngR 575 ; (1825) 3 Bing 107 ; 130 ER 455).</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">It is trite law that past consideration is no consideration ( Eastwood v Kenyon [1840] EngR 80 ; (1840) 11 A &amp; E 438 , 113 ER 482 , Roscorla v Thomas [1842] EngR 70 ; (1842) 3 QB 234 , 114 ER 496, and see the discussion in such learned texts as Chitty on Contracts (30th ed, Vol 1, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) at 270 et seq and Carter JW, Carter on Contract (Vol 1 looseleaf, Butterworths, 2002) at [06-230] et seq).</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">However where the giving of the consideration and the making of the promise are substantially one transaction, the exact order of events is not decisive and the consideration is treated as executed consideration rather than past consideration (Carter JW, Carter on Contract (Vol 1 looseleaf, Butterworths, 2002) at [06-250], Chitty on Contracts (30th ed, Vol 1, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) at 271).</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">So, for example, a contract to erect buildings on land and a contract to grant of lease of land were in fact one transaction, notwithstanding that the lease was not entered until the relevant buildings were completed: Westminster City Council v Duke of Westminster [1991] 4 All ER 136 , discussed in Chitty at 271).</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Further, executed consideration is good consideration in circumstances where an act is done at the request of the promisor, it is understood that payment would be made, and the payment is legally recoverable ( re Casey's Patents [1892] 1 Ch 104 , Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1979] UKPC 2 ; [1980] AC 614 at 629).</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">In this case I consider that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is enforceable, for the following reasons: To the extent that the respondents claim that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is unenforceable I consider that the respondents' defence fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">The Notice of Motion filed 12 September 2007

<sentence id="s575">

 The notice of motion came before Tracey J on 26 September 2007 however his Honour ordered that the hearing of the notice of motion be adjourned to the trial of the substantive proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Abuse of process
 As was clear from the respondents' submissions, their case for permanent stay of the proceedings was founded on the absence of the financial records of Forbes Australia for the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">In summary, the respondents claimed that these documents were critical to properly investigating: It was not in contention between the parties that the source financial documents were missing and unavailable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">I have already considered this issue in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">The respondents submit that: The orders sought by the respondents were pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Prior to amendments on 25 July 2007 O 20 r 2 empowered the Court to permanently stay a proceeding where the proceeding was frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of process of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Since that date O 20 r 2 has applied to proceedings commenced before 1 December 2005 and allows the Court to give summary judgment where the respondent to a proceeding has, inter alia , no defence to a claim or the defence discloses no answer to the claim .</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">It is now s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which allows the Court to give summary judgment against a party where, inter alia , the Court is satisfied that a party has no reasonable prospects in relation to their case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The notice of motion was filed on 12 September 2007 and is not couched in the language of O 20 r 2 following the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">However placing to one side apparent procedural irregularities with respect to the respondents' notice of motion and the basis of the order they seek, I find in any event that the respondents have not substantiated their claim that the applicants' claims were in any way an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">As Dixon J observed in Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 720, the jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the respondents which could be avoided without risk of injustice to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">His Honour also said that a litigant is entitled to submit a claim for determination notwithstanding that its foundation may be slender; and 
 It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction, or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">(at 720) 

 Abuses of procedure usually fall into one of three categories: In these proceedings, in summary: In relation to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1998 an agreement was reached by Mr Poh on behalf of the applicants and Mr Forbes as to the agreed profit shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">The absence of source financial documentation was, as I have already found, irrelevant in relation to the validity and enforcement of that agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">In relation to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999, while I consider that the absence of source financial documentation was a key issue for reasons I have already explained, I do not consider that the applicants' claim with respect to alleged profit shortfall for that year was in any fashion an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">The applicants pleaded, inter alia , that the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report satisfied the requirements of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement akin to a certificate as discussed in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">In my view this was a legitimate claim, notwithstanding that this aspect of the applicants' claim was unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Admissibility of documents and section 135 and section 136 of the Evidence Act 
 The respondents have also sought exclusion of the material in: In relation to these documents: For the reasons I gave earlier in this judgment, the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report is inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">It follows that the Ernst &amp; Young report dated 4 October 2001 and the letter from Freehills on behalf of the applicants to Mr Grant dated 6 April 2001 are also inadmissible pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">In the interests of completeness however I note that even had I not considered the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report inadmissible in accordance with s 135 I would have made such an order in respect of the Ernst &amp; Young report dated 4 October 2001 on the basis that: While there is evidence that the original instructions from Mr Poh to Ernst &amp; Young to prepare to the report were given in 2000 (and possibly prior to contemplation of litigation), evidence also demonstrates that 19 months passed before the report was delivered to the applicants during which time letters had been exchanged between the legal representatives of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">Further, in the covering letter dated 4 October 2001 from Ernst &amp; Young to Mr Poh delivering the report, the author notes "... the procedures were performed solely to assist you in determining the quantum and importance of certain financial issues to be raised with the previous Managing Director, Mr Mark Forbes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">
I consider an inference can be drawn from the surrounding circumstances that the Ernst &amp; Young report was "a document prepared for or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, a proceeding" and accordingly excluded from the definition of "business record" by s 69(3)(a) of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">I do not consider that an order pursuant to either s 135 or s 136 of the Evidence Act should be made in relation to para 34 and para 35 of, and pp 13-54 of annexure "PK2" to, the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 15 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">I take this view because: Mr Poh's evidence directly answered evidence of Mr Forbes in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 and Mr Brauer in his affidavit sworn 25 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">A letter from Marsh &amp; Partners to the directors of Forbes Group Australia dated 16 February 2000 and a letter from Marsh &amp; Partners to Mr Forbes dated 14 March 2000, both of which are exhibited to Mr Poh's affidavit (and found within pp 13-54 of Annexure "PK2" to which the respondents object) are also exhibited to Mr Forbes' affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 as Annexure "MF-4".</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Accordingly, it is clear that the respondents were relying on some of the same material they now seek to impugn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">The material is relevant to both the applicants' claims concerning the 1998 profit shortfall and the respondents' defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">I do not consider that an order pursuant to either s 135 or s 136 of the Evidence Act should be made in relation to Mr Blackwood's expert report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">In my view no grounds have been substantiated by the respondents' to support such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">CONCLUSION 
 The application is successful in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">I consider that the applicants are entitled to recover the agreed 1998 profit shortfall under the share sale agreement and the Forbes Guarantee as damages from Mr Forbes, being the sum of $127,284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">The applicants have also sought interest "pursuant to a share sale agreement" or pursuant to s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">The parties have not directed my attention to any interest rate specified in the share sale agreement the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">However s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act provides: 
 (1) In any proceedings for the recovery of any money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods) in respect of a cause of action that arises after the commencement of this section, the Court or a Judge shall, upon application, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, either: 

 
(a) order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as the Court or the Judge, as the case may be, thinks fit on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered; or
 
 
(b) without proceeding to calculate interest in accordance with paragraph (a), order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given a lump sum in lieu of any such interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">The usual practice in the Federal Court is to adopt the rates of interest applied in the Supreme Court of the State in which the application is commenced unless there is evidence that the rates are penal or not commercial: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 at [7] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">The current rate of interest prescribed under s 48 of the Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld) is 10% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">No submissions were made by the parties as to an appropriate rate of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">I consider that the rate of interest of 10% per annum should be applied in respect of the sum of $127,284 to which the applicants are entitled from the date the applicants' cause of action arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">Accordingly, the appropriate orders are as follows: In relation to the amended application filed 31 March 2006: 
(a) the applicants are entitled to damages as against the first respondent for breach of the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in the amount of $127,284;
 
(b) the first respondent is pay the applicants interest at the annual rate of 10% on the sum ordered to be paid in sub-paragraph 1(a) herein pursuant to section 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to be calculated from the date the applicants' cause of action arose;
 
(c) the application is otherwise dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">In relation to the notice of motion filed 12 September 2007: 
(a) pursuant to section 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) pages 130-192 of annexure "PK1" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed on 25 October 2005 are excluded from evidence admitted, or to be admitted, in this proceeding;
 
(b) the notice of motion is otherwise dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">In view of the mixed outcome in the case I consider it appropriate to invite the parties to make submissions as to costs orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Accordingly I also make the following directions:
 The applicants are to file and serve submissions as to costs, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 6 July 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">The respondents are to file and serve submissions as to costs, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 20 July 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">The applicants are to file and serve submissions as to costs in reply, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 27 July 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">The issue of costs is to be decided on written submissions without the necessity for a hearing unless either party should contact my chambers and the other party by 4.00 pm on 30 July 2009 and request a hearing or unless the Court schedules a hearing to hear oral submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">I certify that the preceding one hundred and eighty-eight (188) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.</sentence>
