 INTRODUCTION 
 This is an application by the cross-respondent (Adnunat) for summary dismissal of the cross-claimant's (ITW) claim pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Adnunat is the registered proprietor of Australian Patent No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">752353 (the Patent).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Patent concerns an invention of a concrete lifting anchor (the "Lifting System") that can be embedded into pre-cast concrete elements so as to hoist them into place in the construction of walls for both commercial and residential buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By its cross-claim, ITW seeks a declaration that the claims of the Patent are invalid and an order pursuant to s 138 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) revoking the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Adnunat contends that it has a complete defence to the cross-claim by virtue of an agreement it says is in place between it and ITW, a term of which is an undertaking by ITW not to challenge the validity of, or seek to revoke, any claim of the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Adnunat's current application turns on the existence, or otherwise, of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">If it exists, then it follows that ITW is in breach of the agreement in bringing the cross-claim and will be barred from so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">BACKGROUND 
 It is necessary to refer in some detail to the circumstances that have given rise to the current litigation and this application for summary judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I should emphasise that, in what follows, I make no findings of fact: see Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd [2008] FCA 1920 at [6] (Finkelstein J); Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3) [2003] 2 AC 1 at 282.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Rather, what follows is a summary of the evidence adduced by Adnunat, given by way of an affidavit of Mr Marco Olivetti, its General Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Aside from a short affidavit exhibiting a business name extract of the second applicant, ITW adduced no other evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Earlier proceedings
 In August 2003, Adnunat commenced proceedings against the second respondent, Reid Construction Systems Pty Ltd (Reid), seeking injunctive relief and damages for alleged infringements of the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Reid denied infringement and brought a cross-claim that the Patent was invalid for lack of novelty and lack of inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Following mediation in December 2003, Adnunat and Reid agreed to settle their dispute and executed a "Settlement Deed" on 23 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The parties to the Settlement Deed were Adnunat, Reid and a third company registered in New Zealand, Nylex (New Zealand) Limited, against whom Adnunat had threatened similar litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Relevantly for present purposes, the Settlement Deed contained the following terms: The relationship between Adnunat and the second applicant, Olivetti Concrete Lifting Systems Pty Ltd (Olivetti Concrete), and another entity, Olivetti Engineering Pty Ltd (Olivetti Engineering), was provided by Mr Olivetti: Each of Adnunat, Olivetti Concrete and Olivetti Engineering are family owned and operated companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Olivetti's parents are the sole directors and shareholders of Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">His father is the sole director and shareholder of Olivetti Engineering and he and his mother are the sole directors and shareholders of Olivetti Concrete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">At all relevant times, he has been responsible for the day to day control and management of all three companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">From about 1 August 2000, Olivetti Concrete has carried on the business of supplying concrete lifting anchors and associated building products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">From July 2003, Olivetti Concrete has held an exclusive licence from Adnunat to manufacture, advertise and sell 9 tonne anchors in accordance with the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Other than licencing the Patent, Adnunat does not carry on business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As the companies are family owned and operated, Mr Olivetti has tended not to "discriminate" as to which of the three corporate vehicles is used when conducting the family business, including its transactions with the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In particular, Olivetti Engineering (in addition to Olivetti Concrete) was permitted by Adnunat to manufacture, advertise and sell 9 tonne edge anchors made in accordance with the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Performance of the Settlement Deed
 During 2004, Adnunat and Reid complied substantially with the terms of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In particular: The licences granted to Reid under cl 3.1 of the Settlement Deed in respect of the Two Tonne and Five Tonne Products expired on 23 December 2004: cl 3.1(a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The licence for the Nine Tonne Product had earlier expired on 23 June 2004: cl 3.1(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In January 2005, Mr Olivetti revised the cost price he wished to charge Reid for the 9 tonne anchors up to $5.60 per anchor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">According to Mr Olivetti, Reid made a number of purchases in the early part of February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Three of these were evidenced by invoices issued by Olivetti Concrete to Reid, together with extracts from Olivetti Concrete's accounting system, showing payments received by Olivetti Concrete for the anchors in April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Two of the invoices refer to a price of $5.60 and the other, a price of $5.45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Olivetti said he has "no recollection as to why the price" in the third invoice was $5.45 rather than $5.60, but does not believe the reduction was intentional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">On about 1 March 2005, Adnunat received a letter from Ms Careen Lai, who described herself as "Financial Controller".</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The letter contained Reid's trademark in the header, was addressed to Adnunat and stated the following: 
 Dear Sir/Madam, 

 
 REID CONSTRUCTION SYSTEMS PTY LTD 

 
 Reid Construction Systems Pty Ltd is a member of the ITW group of companies in Australia, the ultimate holding company of which is Illinois Tool Works Inc, a company listed in the United States of America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">One of the main operating companies in the ITW group of companies in Australia is Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd, ABN 48 004 297 009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The legal entity name of which has been changed to ITW Ramset Australia Pty Ltd., effective 1 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">

 
 As an indication of the ITW Group's commitment to the Reid business in Australia, the Reid business is transferred to ITW Ramset Australia with effect from 1 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">From that date Reid will operate as a division of ITW Ramset Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This change reflects only a change in the legal ownership of the Reid business, our business will continue to operate as an autonomous business unit from the ITW Ramset Australia other division, Ramset Fasteners Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">

 
 From 1 March 2005, we will trade as Reid Construction Systems, a division of ITW Ramset Australia Pty Ltd, ABN 48 004 297 009.</sentence>

 We look forward to continuing our relationship with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 

ITW Ramset Australia Pty Ltd is the former name of the cross-claimant, ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Following Ms Lai's letter, Mr Olivetti says that ITW began to perform Reid's obligations under the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In particular: On 16 March 2005, an email was sent by Mr Brian Pleysier, who was described as "Supply Chain Manager --- Reid Construction Systems", complaining about apparent shortfalls in the number of anchors delivered by Adnunat so far that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Pleysier's email was preceded by an email from Mr Fithall to Bob Connell of Reid on 15 February 2005, which explained that Olivetti Engineering had been experiencing "major problems with [its] machines", was "now only getting back into normal production" and planned "to be able to service [Reid's] required levels as of March 1 st .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">" In Mr Pleysier's email, he stated: 
Further to our conversation this morning about obtaining from you further substantial delivery quantities of 9 tonne hairpin anchors in addition to a recovery plan detailing how you are going to service our immediate and ongoing needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">I have not yet heard from you despite having made it explicitly clear that we need your response urgently as we are in a very critical situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">You should be aware of the fact that we have received from you this year the following deliveries:
 
 
14/2 x 500
 
21/2 x 500
 
25/2 x 500
 
7/3 x 500
 
 
It was indicated by me in our conversation this morning that we need approx.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">5,000 per month to service our customer needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As your email below clearly suggests, we have not received anywhere near "normal production" quantities --- please indicate what you consider normal in your recovery plan?</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Neither have we received "increased amounts", nor have you serviced our "required levels" since March 1 st .</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">We currently have purchase orders outstanding with you for 19,000 anchors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">This is unacceptable in any terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">...
 On 1 April 2005, Ms Lai emailed Mr Fithall requesting details of the royalty amounts owing in respect of sales of the Five Tonne Product during the last three calendar months of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">This appears to have been preceded by an invoice for the royalties in the amount of $6,990.72 issued by Olivetti Concrete to "Reid Construction Systems P/L" on 31 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In her email, Ms Lai stated: 
Please email the royalty amount and your bank details so that we can process the payment into your account today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Please also [forward] your Tax Invoice attention to myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">From March to June 2005, ITW purchased a total of 18,700 9 tonne anchors from Olivetti Concrete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">These were typically delivered and paid for in tranches of 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Invoices for the purchases were issued by Olivetti Concrete and the anchors were paid for by ITW between May and August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Two matters should be observed about the invoices: 
(a) Out of the 16 invoices issued during this period, only two refer to a price of $5.60; the other 14 record a price of $5.45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Olivetti was unable to explain the price difference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">(b) Each of the invoices was addressed to "Reid Constructions Systems Pty Ltd" but included at the bottom ITW's ABN (48 004 297 009) as the "Customer ABN".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Transfer of Reid's business to ITW
 It is apparent from the pleadings and documents discovered by the respondents that the shares in Reid were acquired by a company named ITW Reid Holdings Pty Ltd following a share sale agreement entered into on 24 December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Adnunat referred to several documents, including the share sale agreement, a transfer of business agreement and company extracts obtained from ASIC's company database: see the exhibits to the affidavit of Graeme Scott, Adnunat's solicitor, sworn 7 November 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">It is apparent from these documents that ITW and ITW Reid Holdings Pty Ltd are both members of the ITW group of companies, the ultimate holding company being a US company, Illinois Tool Works Inc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The share sale agreement and the relevant ASIC company extract disclose that ITW Reid Holdings Pty Ltd acquired the shares in Reid on 30 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Accordingly, ITW and Reid became related companies from that date onwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Subsequently, on 13 May 2005, Reid entered into a "Transfer of Business Agreement" (Business Agreement) with ITW (named ITW Ramset Australia Pty Ltd at the time) pursuant to which Reid agreed to transfer to ITW its entire business of "manufacturing and supplying concrete fasteners, concrete reinforcing and concrete lifting systems".</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Business Agreement provided for ITW to acquire all of Reid's assets (including all of its "contracts" and "goodwill") and assume all of its liabilities: see cll 1, 2 and 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities was to have effect on and from 1 March 2005: see cl 1, definition of "Effective Date".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The ASIC company extracts exhibited to Mr Scott's affidavit disclose that Messrs Michael Davies, Allan Sutherland, Bela Hargitay and David Speer were directors of both Reid and ITW at the time of the transfer of Reid's business to ITW in March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In relation to Reid's contracts, cl 6.1 provided: 
 [Reid] and [ITW] will use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that all of the Contracts ... are novated, or failing novation, assigned, to [ITW] as soon as practicable after the Effective Date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">

"Contracts" meant "all written and unwritten contracts entered into by or on behalf of [Reid] in the course of the Business ...": see cl 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Clauses 6.2 and 6.3 should also be noted: 
 Liability on assignment 

 
 6.2 Any novation or assignment of a Contract ... is on the basis that, as between [Reid] and [ITW]:
 
 (a) [Reid] is responsible for complying with its obligations under the assigned document that must be complied with on or before the Closing Date [ie 28 February 2005] and indemnifies [ITW] against liability or loss arising from, and costs incurred in connection with, [Reid] failing to do so; and 

 
 (b) [ITW] is responsible for complying with [Reid's] obligations under the assigned document that must be complied with after the Closing Date and indemnifies [Reid] against liability or loss arising from, and costs incurred in connection with, [ITW] failing to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">

 
 Obligations pending assignment 

 
 6.3 After the Closing Date and until each Contract ... is novated or assigned in accordance with clause 6.1, [ITW]: 

 
 (a) must comply with all of [Reid's] obligations under each Contract ... which it lawfully can; and 

 
 (b) may request [Reid] to comply with any obligation or exercise any right of [Reid] under a Contract ... if [ITW] cannot lawfully comply with the obligation or exercise the right and the request is reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">[Reid] must comply with such a request to the extent it lawfully can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 It was common ground that, despite the intention evidenced by clause 6.1 of the Business Agreement, the Settlement Deed between Reid, Adnunat and Nylex (New Zealand) Limited has never been novated or assigned to ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Current proceedings
 In September 2007, the applicants commenced proceedings against ITW and Reid seeking, amongst other things: A statement of claim, a defence and cross-claim by ITW (amended on 22 August 2008), and a reply and defence to the cross-claim have been filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The applicants' allegations in the proceeding may be summarised as follows: Adnunat is the proprietor and Olivetti Concrete is the exclusive licensee of the Patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The respondents have infringed the Patent by, among other things, manufacturing and selling two products, the Swiftlift Jaws Ultra (Swiftlift Anchor) and Hair Pin Lift Edge Anchors, models 5HPA and 10HPA (HP Anchors).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Reid has acted in breach of the Patent Infringement Term of the Settlement Deed (see [4] above) by engaging in the infringing conduct and failing or refusing to ensure that ITW (as a Related Body Corporate) does not engage in the infringing conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In relation to ITW: 
(a) it became a Related Body Corporate of Reid on 30 January 2004 for the purposes of the Patent Infringement Term and No Challenge Term of the Settlement Deed (cl 4 and cl 4.1 --- see [4] above);
 
(b) the transfer of Reid's business to ITW "included a transfer of the [Settlement Deed]" and had the effect that ITW became a "successor" of Reid for the purposes of cl 17 of the Settlement Deed;
 
(c) from 1 March 2005, ITW has performed the obligations of Reid to Adnunat under the Settlement Deed and accordingly has become a party to the Settlement Deed; and
 
(d) consequently, ITW's infringing conduct also constitutes a breach by it of the Patent Infringement Term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Both respondents deny infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Reid alleges further that the Patent Infringement Term is void by operation of subss 144(1) and (1A) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) and the No Challenge Term is void and unenforceable as an unlawful restraint of trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">ITW denies that it is a party to the Settlement Deed or in any other way bound by its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">ITW has brought a cross-claim against Adnunat seeking a declaration that the Patent is invalid and an order that it be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In response, Adnunat denies invalidity, maintains that ITW is bound by the terms of the Settlement Deed, and alleges that ITW is in breach of the No Challenge Term by bringing the cross-claim and is barred from doing so by cl 14, which provides: 
 This Deed may be pleaded and tendered by any party as an absolute bar and defence to any proceeding brought or made by the other party in breach of the terms of this Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">

 NOTICE OF MOTION 
 By its notice of motion, Adnunant (as the cross-respondent) seeks an order pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Act that there be judgment for it against ITW in relation to the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Section 31A provides in part: 
 (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if:
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">

 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be:
 (a) hopeless; or
 (b) bound to fail;
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">

 Put simply, Adnunat says it has a complete defence to the cross-claim because ITW is bound by the Settlement Deed, in particular the No Challenge Term, and is barred from making the cross-claim that the Patent is invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Accordingly, it says that ITW has no reasonable prospect of prosecuting the cross-claim and judgment should be given in its favour dismissing the cross-claim with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As referred to at [17], Adnunat's claim that ITW is bound by the Settlement Deed, despite not having been an original party to it, is made with reference to cl 17 of the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Clause 17 provides: 
 The provisions of this Deed will enure for the benefit of and be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted substitutes and assigns and (where applicable) legal personal representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">

 Adnunat says that ITW was a "successor" to Reid for the purposes of cl 17 and bound itself to the terms of the Settlement Deed by reason of: The issue for determination on this application therefore is whether ITW has any reasonable prospect of refuting the claim that it is bound by the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">SUBMISSIONS 
 Adnunat
 As referred to at [15], Adnunat does not claim that there was an assignment of the rights under the Settlement Deed to ITW or a novation of the Settlement Deed between Adnunat, Reid and ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Its contention is that ITW is bound by the Settlement Deed because the parties' conduct demonstrates an agreement to be bound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Adnunat relied on the following evidentiary matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">First, prior to the transfer of business, both Reid and Adnunat had complied with the Settlement Deed, in particular the royalty and anchor supply terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The representative with which Adnunat corresponded was a Mr Bob Connell, who was at the same time both the General Manager of Reid and Marketing Manager of ITW, then named Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd. Second, by its letter dated 1 March 2005, ITW notifed Adnunat that Reid's business had been transferred to it, that the change reflected "only a change in the legal ownership of the Reid business", that ITW would thereafter be conducting the business under Reid's existing trading name, Reid Construction Systems, and Adnunat was to deal with ITW instead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Adnunat placed significance on the fact the letter was addressed to Adnunat, rather than Olivetti Concrete or Olivetti Engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">As it was those latter entities that had dealt with Reid on a day to day basis, Adnunat submitted that the only reasonable inference open was that the letter was directed towards and would be understood as a reference to the Settlement Deed and the existing relationship to which the Deed related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The letter, Adnunat said, demonstrated ITW's intention to assume Reid's existing third party contractual obligations and gave notice of that intention to Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Third, the Business Agreement makes clear that Reid and ITW intended that the entire business would be transferred and, in particular, all contracts --- including the Settlement Deed --- were to be novated or, failing novation, assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">In particular, by cl 6.3(a) of the Business Agreement, ITW was to perform Reid's obligations under the Settlement Deed pending novation: see [14] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Taking cl 6.3(a) together with ITW's conduct towards Adnunat after 1 March 2005 (including its provision of the letter dated 1 March 2005), Adnunat said it should be inferred that ITW intended to comply with, and be bound to Adnunat directly by, the terms of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Fourth, it is an admitted fact that from March 2005 Reid ceased to trade and ITW conducted business under the name "Reid Construction Systems" (see pars 3(iii) and 4(v) of the respondents' amended defence).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">From that date onwards, Adnunant says, ITW alone performed Reid's obligations under the Settlement Deed; as Adnunat put it, "ITW stood in [Reid's] shoes ... as successor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It did this by ordering and paying for 9 tonne anchors, pursuant to cl 3.4 of the Settlement Deed, as well as by paying Adnunat royalty amounts owing in respect of Reid's sales in the last three calendar months of 2004: see [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">In relation to the supply of 9 tonne anchors, Adnunat relied on Mr Pleysier's email dated 16 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The email was sent after 1 March 2005 (when Reid had ceased trading) and should be construed, according to Adnunat, as a "demand" by ITW for supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The demand was referable to, and indeed "consistent only with", the terms of the Settlement Deed which obliged Adnunat to supply (ie cl 3.4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">As to the royalty payments, Adnunat submitted that Ms Lai's email dated 1 April 2005 --- requesting details of "the royalty amount and ... bank details so that we can process the payment" --- could only be referable to cl 3.2 of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Accordingly the inference should be drawn that ITW considered itself bound to pay the royalty amount, which significantly was a debt that Reid owed for sales it had made prior to ITW acquiring the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Fifth, Adnunat itself understood that ITW was prepared to be bound by the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">At the time the Deed was executed (23 December 2003), cl 17 expressly contemplated that a successor of any original party would receive the benefit of and be bound by the terms of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">When Adnunat received notice of the transfer of Reid's business, it expected not only that ITW would be bound but that Adnunat itself was obliged to continue performing its obligations under the Settlement Deed in favour of ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Consistently with that understanding, Adnunat continued to conduct itself at all relevant times after 1 March 2005 as if the parties had an agreement in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">As evidence that it had turned its mind to the fact it was dealing with a different legal entity, Adnunat referred to the post 1 March 2005 invoices discussed at [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The inclusion of ITW's ABN in those invoices, so the argument went, demonstrated that Adnunat was cognisant of the fact it was transacting with ITW, albeit as part of a continuing course of trade established with the Reid business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">ITW
 ITW maintains that it is not bound by the No Challenge Term because it was not, and never has been, a party to the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Adnunat, it said, focuses on an irrelevant question when it claims that ITW is a "successor" of Reid for the purposes of cl 17 of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It is not to the point that the original parties to the Settlement Deed included an enurement clause in the terms of cl 17, purporting to bind any future "successors".</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The doctrine of privity mandates that a new party will only be bound by a contract if it intends to be bound or is otherwise bound by operation of law (for example, by way of a corporate merger).</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The relevant question here therefore is not whether ITW is properly described as a "successor" of Reid, but whether ITW in fact bound itself to a new contract with Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Relying on South Australia v Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co (unreported, Supreme Court of South Australia, Olsson J, 15 May 1997) at [158], ITW submitted that the concept of liability independently attaching to a "successor" of a business --- without its agreement in contract --- is not recognised in Australia, except to a limited extent where a corporate merger is undertaken (usually accompanied by court orders effecting the transfer of rights and liabilities to the merged entity).</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Instead, when a corporation acquires the assets (and thereby, the business) of another corporation, the general rule of separate legal personality applies and the acquiring corporation does not, by operation of law, take on the obligations of the transferring corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The acquiring corporation will only take on liabilities and obligations to third parties if it decides to contract itself with them, either directly or through novation of an existing agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">(The passage relied on by ITW in Peat Marwick at [158] is not reproduced in the report of the decision at (1997) 24 ACSR 231.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">) With that in mind, ITW contends that Adnunat has failed to adduce any, or any sufficient evidence, to demonstrate that Adnunat and ITW had by their correspondence or conduct intended to bind themselves to a new contract in the same terms as the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In "contract by conduct" cases, it said, it is necessary to show from the parties' conduct a "tacit understanding or agreement", where the conduct is such as to prove "all the essential elements of an express contract": see Giles JA, with whom Priestley JA and Meagher JA agreed, in Industrial Rollformers Pty Ltd v Ingersoll-Rand (Australia) Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 111 ; (2001) Aust Contract R 90-129 ( Industrial Rollformers ) at [137].</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">In particular, if a court is to hold that one party has bound itself in contract by its conduct, it must be able "to identify within the conduct of both parties the terms of the contract , and to be objectively satisfied that both parties agreed to be bound by those terms": see Giles JA at [138] (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Here, ITW submitted, its conduct in purchasing 9 tonne anchors points to nothing more than the existence of an agreement for the sale of those goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Adnunat failed to adduce evidence of any conduct or communications by ITW that are referable unequivocally to the express terms of the Settlement Deed, for example the grant of the licence (cl 3.1), the payment of royalties (cl 3.2), the undertaking not to infringe or challenge the validity of the Patent (cl 4 and cl 4.1), the release (cl 5.1) or indemnities (cl 5.3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Moreover, the lack of any such conduct is explicable said ITW, because: ITW then made the following submissions in response to the evidence put forward by Adnunat, summarised at [26]-[31]: ITW also relied on what it described as a number of "serious legal and factual questions" about Adnunat's case, which have a bearing on the terms of the Settlement Deed and which it said are properly determinable only at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Adnunat claims that since July 2003 it has had an exclusive licence agreement with Olivetti Concrete for Olivetti Concrete to manufacture, advertise and sell 9 tonne anchors (see par 8 of the applicants' statement of claim and exhibit MGO-1 to Mr Olivetti's affidavit).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">However, according to its ASIC company extract, Olivetti Concrete did not exist under that name in July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It was instead called Hatherford Pty Ltd until 29 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">While the business name "Olivetti Concrete Lifting Systems" had existed since August 2000, it was registered in the name of Olivetti Engineering until 30 September 2005, when it was transferred to Hatherford Pty Ltd and thereafter deregistered in July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">ITW submitted that the exclusive licence agreement was therefore either a forgery or the reference in it to Olivetti Concrete was an error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">If it were an error, then the validity of the licence agreement, the standing of the second applicant in the proceeding and par 8 of the applicants' statement of claim would all be in serious question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">However if, regardless of the identity of the licensee, the exclusive licence were held to be valid, then the licence granted to Reid under the Settlement Deed must be in serious question, because Adnunat would have retained no right to grant it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">In that event, ITW submitted that a major part of the consideration for the No Challenge Term would fail because Reid would not have received an effective licence from Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Absent a trial, it said, these important factual issues, which are at the heart of the applicants' claims, would not be the subject of proper findings and a determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">RESOLUTION 
 Principles applicable to summary judgment applications
 The principles governing the operation of s 31A of the Act were canvassed in detail by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 ( White Industries ) and Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ( Boston ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">In White Industries 160 FCR at [59], Lindgren J considered that a claim requires "real" as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects in order for it to have reasonable prospects of success as required by s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Justice Rares in Boston 236 ALR at [45] was of the view that, unless there are no real issues of fact --- such that "only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable" --- summary judgment (or dismissal) ought not be given pursuant to s 31A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Full Court has recently considered the summary judgment standard in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 (Finkelstein, Rares and Gordon JJ) ( Jefferson Ford ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Although different views were taken as to the precise operation of s 31A, the following principles appear to have been endorsed: Precisely how a claim is assessed will depend on the nature of the cause of action, as well as the identity of the parties, the pleaded facts and the evidence adduced: see Jefferson Ford 167 FCR at [126] (Gordon J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Although this application is for dismissal of ITW's cross-claim, the allegations to be assessed are not concerned with the claim of invalidity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">They concern the alleged existence of a separate and distinct agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">That agreement and its alleged terms arise in the first instance as part of Adnunat's primary claim: see pars 14---20, esp 17---19, of the applicants' statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">As a consequence, granting the relief sought by Adnunat on this application would have the effect of determining, summarily and in its favour, an important aspect of Adnunat's own claim, which it would otherwise have to prove at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">It is in that context that ITW advanced no substantive evidence in response to the matters deposed to by Mr Olivetti.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The thrust of ITW's submissions appeared to be that Adnunat, bearing the ultimate onus of proving that a binding agreement exists, failed to demonstrate even a prima facie case that ITW has no reasonable prospects of successfully proving otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Consideration
 Despite the lack of any direct written evidence of an agreement between Adnunat and ITW, Adnunat contends that one must be inferred from their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">A contract may in certain circumstances be inferred from conduct, even where no offer and acceptance can be identified: see Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 97326 ; Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 ( Vroon ); Industrial Rollformers [2001] NSWCA 111 ; (2001) Aust Contract R 90-129.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">However the existence or otherwise of an enforceable agreement depends ultimately on the manifest intention of the parties, objectively ascertained: see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 at 548-50 (Gleeson CJ) and his Honour's reference to Gissing v Gissing [1970] UKHL 3 ; [1971] AC 886 ; see also Cheshire &amp; Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th ed, LexisNexis, 2008) at [3.5] and [3.9].</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Where mutual promises are sought to be inferred, the conduct relied upon must, on an objective assessment, evince a tacit agreement with sufficiently clear terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It is not enough that the conduct is consistent with what are alleged to be the terms of a binding agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The evidence must positively indicate that both parties considered themselves bound by that agreement: Industrial Rollformers [2001] NSWCA 111 ; (2001) Aust Contract R 90-129 at [137] - [138] and [142]; Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 ( Pacific Brands ) at [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">As Finkelstein J observed in Pacific Brands [2005] FCA 288 , it will only be in very clear cases that the courts will infer a contract from conduct in the absence of written or oral communications that evidence the exchange of mutual promises: see [2005] FCA 288 at [45] and the cases there referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">In most instances, contract by conduct cases will involve a complex set of facts and require evidence from those who have played a role in the relationship between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Necessarily, where a contract is denied, the credibility of those involved on both sides may be crucial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">These considerations are in my view an obstacle to Adnunat obtaining summary relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">At its simplest, Adnunat's case consists of the following steps: In my view, Adnunat's motion confronts three initial problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">First, Adnunat has adduced no evidence that ITW communicated to Adnunat a preparedness, let alone an agreement, to perform Reid's obligations under the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">There is simply no evidence of any discussions between ITW and Adnunat concerning the terms of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The problem confronted by Adnunat is that, given it asserts ITW "bound itself to the provisions of the [Settlement Deed]", it must point to conduct that positively and unambiguously demonstrates an agreement to observe those provisions, in particular the No Challenge Term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">However there is no evidence that ITW considered itself bound by the No Challenge Term, either from its conduct or communications with Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Nor is there any evidence it agreed to the Patent Infringement Term or the indemnities given by the original contracting parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Secondly, Adnunat's reliance on cl 6.3 of the Business Agreement should be treated with some caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Business Agreement was between Reid and ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">ITW's promise to comply with Reid's obligations under existing contracts was a promise given to Reid for Reid's benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is true that cl 6.3 reveals an intention by ITW to perform Reid's existing contractual obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">However it makes no specific reference to Adnunat or the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">At best, it demonstrates that ITW was prepared to agree with Reid that it would perform Reid's contractual obligations and be accountable to Reid if it failed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The third related issue is that cl 6.3 of the Business Agreement in fact shows that Reid and ITW intended that existing contracts would be novated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">This suggests an intention by ITW to bind itself to third parties only where formal novation agreements were entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Adnunat does not contend that there was a novation of the Settlement Deed and there is no evidence that a novation was attempted or suggested to Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Adnunat instead claims that a new bilateral contract came into existence between it and ITW on the same terms as the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">However on the evidence on this application it is reasonable to infer that ITW did not intend to bind itself to the Settlement Deed, because the parties did not, as ITW and Reid contemplated, novate the terms of the Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Indeed, a reasonable inference to draw from the lack of a novation is that ITW considered there to be little benefit to it in rendering itself a party to the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">In the absence of any evidence of discussions about the terms of the Settlement Deed, it is difficult to see what consideration ITW would have understood it was receiving in agreeing to take on Reid's obligations, other than Adnunat's promise to supply anchors at "a reasonable market price" subject to alteration at any time by Adnunat "in its absolute discretion": see cl 3.4 of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The difficulty for Adnunat is that, without more, ITW's conduct appears to be equally consistent with an intention not to bind itself to the Settlement Deed but instead simply to purchase anchors that it knew Adnunat was in a position to supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In that regard, it should be noted that Mr Olivetti says he cannot explain why the price paid by ITW for anchors after it acquired the business was not the same as that which had been set previously with Reid: see [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The evidence seems to me at best ambiguous as to the basis upon which the parties were conducting themselves in relation to the supply of anchors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Adnunat sought to draw assistance from the decision of the House of Lords in Tolhurst v The Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900) Limited [1903] AC 414 ( Tolhurst ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Tolhurst involved a contract for the supply of chalk at a stipulated price over a 50 year period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In 1898, Alfred Tolhurst entered into a long term agreement with a cement manufacturer, the Imperial Portland Cement Company, to supply chalk on a weekly basis from the extensive chalk quarries located on his land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The long term arrangement was to both parties' benefit, securing a regular market for Mr Tolhurst and a regular source of supply for Imperial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Two years later in 1900, Imperial sold its cement business to another company, the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900) Limited, assigned the benefit of the chalk agreement to Associated and went into voluntary liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Mr Tolhurst, while prepared to supply to Associated, was unwilling to do so at the price stipulated in the chalk agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Nevertheless, he supplied chalk on credit and brought an action against Associated to recover a higher price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">He claimed that Imperial had by its conduct rescinded the chalk agreement and sought a declaration that he was not bound to supply to Associated, as the purported assignee, at the stipulated contract price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Associated and Imperial brought a separate action seeking declarations that the agreement was valid and subsisting and that Mr Tolhurst was bound to supply chalk to Associated at the contract price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">On appeal, the House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal's decision to grant the declarations sought by Imperial and Associated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The House of Lords considered that the terms of the chalk agreement, properly construed, permitted the benefit of the chalk agreement to be assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Lord Macnaghten, delivering the leading opinion, observed that contractual rights are not always assignable, for example where the contract involves an element of personal skill or confidence on the part of the original parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">However in the circumstances their Lordships held that the chalk agreement did not require personal performance by either Imperial or Tolhurst and the rights under it were assignable by Imperial, notwithstanding the absence of any express provision regarding assignment in the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Adnunat referred to two particular passages in Lord Macnaghten's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">At 419, his Lordship said: 
 [The chalk agreement] is expressed to be made between Alfred Tolhurst and the Imperial Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">They, and they only, are named as the persons to perform the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">From beginning to end of the instrument, if the contract be taken literally, there is not one word pointing to the continued existence of the contract in the hands of any other person, either by succession or substitution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">... And yet the contract is to endure for the period of fifty years, or if the supply of chalk in the quarries does not hold out so long, it is to last for thirty-five years at least.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Now, when it is borne in mind that the Imperial Company must have been induced to establish its works at Northfleet by the prospect of the advantages flowing from immediate connection with Tolhurst's quarries, and that the contract in substance amounts to a contract for the sale of all the chalk in those quarries by periodical deliveries (less what Tolhurst might sell elsewhere), it is plain that it could not have been within the contemplation of the parties that the company would lose the benefit of the contract if anything happened to Tolhurst, or that Tolhurst would lose the benefit of the market which the contract provided for him at his very door in the event of the company parting with its undertaking, as it was authorized to do by its memorandum .</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">(Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">) 

 Lord Macnaghten then continued at 420: 
 Something more is comprehended [by the chalk agreement] than the particular company and the individual Tolhurst.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It seems to me that the contract is to be read and construed as if it contained an interpretation clause saying that the expression "Tolhurst" should include Tolhurst and his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, owners and occupiers of the Northfleet quarries, that the expression "the company" should include the company and its successors and assigns, owners and occupiers of the Northfleet Cement Works, and that the words "his" and "their" should have a corresponding meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">That, I think, was the plain intention of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">

 In this case, Adnunat contended that the draftsperson of the Settlement Deed has made explicit (in the enurement clause (cl 17)) what Lord Macnaghten (at [47] above) considered to be the implicit intention of the parties in Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 , namely that the parties to the Settlement Deed were to include any successors of the original parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Adnunat acknowledged that, unlike this case, Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 was concerned with an action by an assignee to enforce the chalk agreement against an original party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">However, in reliance largely on the passage quoted at [46] above (in particular the last sentence), it said that this case was otherwise "on all fours with the facts in Tolhurst " and submitted that it was irrelevant, in determining whether there was a mutual intention to contract, which one of the two parties sought to enforce the agreement (ie the assignee or the original debtor).</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">This latter proposition requires some further explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Adnunat appeared to place significance on the fact that the House of Lords had made it a condition of the assignee's entitlement to the benefit of the agreement that it perform Imperial's obligations (ie to pay for the chalk): see [1903] AC 414 at 421 (Lord Macnaghten).</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This, said Adnunat, was significant because Imperial had been dissolved (and existed in name only) and the House of Lords, while observing that it is not possible to assign the burden of a contract without the original debtor's consent, was prepared in the circumstances to find that both Tolhurst and Associated had effectively consented to Associated taking the benefit, along with the burden, of the chalk agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">This conclusion was reached notwithstanding that Mr Tolhurst had never previously discussed or agreed terms with Associated directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Mr Tolhurst's consent arose from the terms of the chalk agreement, while Associated's consent was self-evident from the assignment and its preparedness to perform the agreement in place of Imperial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">This was an example, said Adnunat, of how a contractual burden may be transferred to a third party --- without there being a formal novation --- giving rise to new rights and obligations as between the original debtor (Tolhurst) and the new party assignee (Associated).</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Applying that result to this case, Adnunat contended that the necessary consent as between ITW and Adnunat should be found given the existence of the enurement clause and ITW's conduct in accepting both the benefit and burden of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In my view Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 provides little assistance in resolving the dispute in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The issue in Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 was whether the rights created by the chalk agreement were capable of assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Once it was decided that they were, it followed as a relatively straightforward matter that the party to whom the rights had been assigned was capable of enforcing them against the original debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">That is not this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Adnunat's case is not based on an assignment of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Adnunat seeks to enforce the terms of the Deed against a third party, ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Its ability to do so depends on there being a finding that a new bilateral contract exists between it and ITW, on the same or substantially the same terms as the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Rather than it being irrelevant, it is a critical difference here that there was no assignment of the relevant contractual benefit and ITW (unlike Mr Tolhurst) had nothing to do with the original negotiation and formation of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Here, the consent of the party against whom the alleged agreement is to be enforced does not turn on the construction of that agreement (or, more particularly, its assignability), as was the case in Tolhurst [1903] AC 414.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Instead, this case requires a detailed factual analysis of the parties' conduct, and correspondence, in order to determine whether ITW (a stranger to the original contract) truly made its consent manifest to Adnunat (as the original contracting party).</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">It is true that in Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 the House of Lords considered it unnecessary that the assignor (Imperial) be made a party to Associated's action and held in effect that the assignee itself was obliged to pay for the chalk, if it were to have the benefit of the chalk agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The question of necessary parties and the appropriate relief to be given to the assignee in Tolhurst [1903] AC 414 were dictated strongly by the particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Imperial was in liquidation, no longer had a board of directors and was deemed by the Companies Act 1862 (UK) to have been dissolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">In the absence of the assignor in all but name, the House of Lords considered it appropriate to grant a declaration that the assignee was entitled to the benefit of the agreement, but only so long as it was willing to pay for the chalk, in place of the assignor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In so doing, their Lordships recognised that in ordinary circumstances an assignor would need to be made a party by an assignee seeking to enforce an agreement: see [1903] AC 414 at 420 (Lord Macnaghten).</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">All of this seems to me to provide little assistance to Adnunat in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The House of Lords in imposing the payment condition on Associated was doing no more than fashioning relief, in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to ensure an equitable result in the circumstances of that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Given their Lordship's conclusion as to the assignability of the rights under the agreement, it followed that it would make no difference to Tolhurst if Imperial's obligation to pay for the chalk was performed, albeit vicariously, by Associated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">This was not to determine that a new contract existed between Tolhurst and Associated but rather that the original agreement subsisted and was capable of enforcement by Associated as assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Having dealt with what I consider are the main difficulties with Adnunat's motion, I turn to some of the key factual matters it relied on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">First, it will be recalled that the letter dated 1 March 2005 giving notice of the transfer of business was addressed to Adnunat (as the contracting entity) and stated that the sender was looking forward to "continuing our relationship with you".</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">It thus referred to an existing "relationship" and expressed a desire that that relationship would continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The letter also stated that the change "reflects only a change in the legal ownership of the Reid business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">That statement appears to have been made to explain that the new owner would operate the Reid business separately from its other business units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The letter makes no reference to the Settlement Deed or, significantly, to any possible novation of the Deed (a matter which, it might reasonably be inferred, was in the mind of the new owner, given the terms of the Business Agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Once all relevant evidence is in, one might conclude that the letter, viewed from the perspective of the reasonable observer and taking into account all of ITW's conduct after 1 March, demonstrates an intention to take on and perform the terms of the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">However at this stage I do not accept that that is the only reasonable conclusion to reach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It seems to me reasonably arguable that the import of the letter, which is apparently in a standard form, amounts to no more than putting each previous supplier to Reid on notice that Reid's business had been sold and would now be operated by a new entity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">A reasonable recipient of the letter might in that context wonder what effect that was to have on any existing contracts, rather than assume that the new owner would as a matter of course observe existing contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">In my opinion it is not so clear from the letter and the other relevant conduct that these arguments have no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Second, it is true that ITW continued to order 9 tonne anchors from Adnunat over a period spanning four months from March to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">However as I have said earlier, the parties' intentions as revealed by that conduct alone are not unequivocal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Taking into account the matters I have referred to at [41]-[43], it is reasonably arguable that the parties were simply content as a practical commercial matter to continue a pre-existing anchor purchase and supply relationship, without having directed their attention to whether ITW would be bound by the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">It is of some relevance in that regard that this is not a case in which the relevant conduct took place over a long period of time (cf Pacific Brands [2005] FCA 288 and Vroon [1994] 2 VR 32) but instead came to an apparently abrupt end after only four months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">It may be that ITW considered it commercially expedient to continue sourcing anchors from Adnunat rather than to challenge the Patent and manufacture the 9 tonne anchors it required itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">While that is speculation at this stage, it highlights the difficulty in finding that ITW has no reasonable prospects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Adnunat relied in particular on the email from Mr Pleysiar (see [10]) and contended that it was consistent only with a demand for supply pursuant to the Settlement Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">However the email makes no reference to the Settlement Deed and the insistence on supply might be said to have arisen just as much from the commercial exigencies ITW faced at the time, compounded by Adnunat's apparent inability to meet existing purchase orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Third, the fact that ITW paid Adnunat the final royalty amount owing by Reid does suggest an acceptance by ITW of an obligation to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The email dated 1 April 2005 reveals that Adnunat had sought sales information from Reid previously in January 2005 and that ITW would make the royalty payment previously due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It is not entirely clear, but it appears from the invoices adduced by Adnunat that the payment was made in about May 2005: see exhibit MGO-29 to Mr Olivetti's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">However even assuming the payment was made, evidence of how and why ITW came to make the payment is not at this stage before the Court and ITW in my opinion has reasonable prospects of rebutting the inference that it made the payment because the parties considered it was bound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">In Pacific Brands [2005] FCA 288 at [47] , Finkelstein J said: 
 If the conduct in question is consistent with an intention not to contract, for example, if the conduct is referable to some other obligation, a contract by conduct will not arise: Horrocks v Forray [1975] EWCA Civ 9 ; [1976] 1 WLR 230 , 238-239; The Aramis [1989] 1 Lloyd's Reps 213, 224.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">

 His Honour was there dealing with a long course of conduct lasting over two and a half years, which it was alleged had given rise to an implied novation of a sub-licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">In concluding there was no novation, Finkelstein J said (at [47]): 
 In this case, when viewed objectively by a person in Pacific Brands' position (as to the importance of this approach for the creation of a contract see Smith v Hughes (1871) 6 QB 597 , 607), Underworks' conduct may be explained as referable at least in part to an assignment of some of the rights under the sub-licence (for example the payment of royalties to Pacific Brands) and a belief (as asserted by Pacific Brands itself) that thereafter as a practical matter Underworks was required to deal with Pacific Brands rather than Sara Lee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">All in all, I think the applicants' claim for novation is hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">

 On this summary judgment application, the question is of course only whether ITW has reasonable prospects of ultimately showing that its conduct ought not be construed as giving rise to a binding agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In my view the fact that ITW made the royalty payment might be said at this stage to be just as consistent with a recognition that it would have to pay any old debts of the Reid business before it could expect to secure the further supply of anchors from Adnunat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Alternatively it is open to infer that ITW was doing no more than complying with cl 6.3 of the Business Agreement, ensuring that Reid was not in breach of its pre-existing contractual obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Either way, those contentions do not in my view lack reasonable prospects of succeeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Fourth, Adnunat's reliance on the fact that invoices from Olivetti Concrete included ITW's ABN need to be approached with some caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">ITW's ABN also appears on invoices dated earlier than 1 March 2005, the date on which, on Adnunat's case, it was first notified of the change of ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It is not clear whether this is easily explicable, because for example Adnunat's electronic accounting system has been updated subsequently (causing newly generated copies of old invoices to record the updated information).</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">It raises an important factual question however as to precisely when and in what circumstances Adnunat was first informed of the change of ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Finally, from the pleadings and Mr Olivetti's affidavit, Adnunat appears to rely on the fact that a number of individuals were employed by or associated with both Reid and ITW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">In particular: Adnunat however did not advance this matter in its submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">I am not in a position to draw inferences either way in relation to their knowledge or intentions in connection with the parties' relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">In contract by conduct cases, the key individuals involved will usually provide probative and helpful evidence, both in chief and in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">In this case, I am of the view that such evidence will be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">CONCLUSION 
 I do not consider that ITW has no reasonable prospects of defending Adnunat's claim that it is bound by the Settlement Deed and therefore prosecuting its cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">In so concluding, I have also taken into account the matters raised by ITW at [35]-[36] above, which will require some examination at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Accordingly, Adnunat's motion should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">In the result, it is not necessary that I deal with the additional submission made by ITW that the No Challenge Term is in any event invalid as an unlawful restraint of trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.</sentence>
