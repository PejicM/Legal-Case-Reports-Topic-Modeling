 HIS HONOUR: 
 Introduction 
 
1 This is a claim concerning allegedly unlawful termination of employment brought by the applicant against his former employer, John Holland Group Pty Ltd ('John Holland'), and its managing director, William Wild, alleging breach of contract and breaches of s 52 and s 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and s 42 and s 46 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">John Holland and one of its subsidiaries, GridComm Pty Ltd ('GridComm') cross claim against Mr Serventi alleging contraventions of s 181 and s 182 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and breaches of fiduciary and contractual duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 As was acknowledged at the hearing, the case boils down to whether Mr Serventi so misbehaved as to warrant his summary dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In my opinion he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Background 
 
3 The case centres on the conduct of Mr Serventi in 2003 in his capacity as a senior employee of John Holland, and as the General Manager and a director of GridComm, and his subsequent summary dismissal from that position without pay in lieu of notice or redundancy pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The alleged conduct in question, which is itself largely uncontroverted, comprised four kinds of alleged serious and wilful misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, as the case unfolded, it is sufficient to deal with only one of these, namely, Mr Serventi's taking of John Holland's vehicles for the private use of his son, Anthony, who was not an employee of John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Without prejudice to the major issue, Mr Serventi agreed to pay for reasonable loss incurred by John Holland in relation to those vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 In response to the alleged misconduct, John Holland summarily terminated Mr Serventi's employment, without payment in lieu of notice; however, other entitlements such as annual leave and superannuation were paid in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Serventi claims that he reasonably or at least actually believed that he was entitled to take the vehicles for his son's use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Relevant legal principles 
 
5 The law relevant to this case may be simply stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">6 An employer is entitled to summarily dismiss an employee for serious and wilful misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Such misconduct must be of a kind that, as a practical matter, is likely to make maintenance of the contract of employment impractical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Some employees have special obligations of conduct and confidence that are relevant to such a question of misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">A senior manager of a company who is also a director is an example.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Mr Serventi was that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 As Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ confirmed in Concut Pty Ltd v Worell (2000) 176 ALR 693 (at [25]), citing Blyth Chemicals Ltd v Bushnell [1933] HCA 8 ; (1933) 49 CLR 66 (at 81):
 
 'Conduct which in respect of important matters...is destructive of the necessary confidence between the employer and employee, is a ground of dismissal'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">


The respondents' case here is that, if a senior manager arranged significant private use by a relative of his employer's assets, knowing that he was not entitled to do so, then as Kirby J put it in Concut at [50]: 
 
 'Given the nature of an ordinary employment relationship, at least as here in the case of a senior employee serving as the Queensland Branch Manager of a private company with national operations, the result reached by the primary judge seems unsurprising and appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The notion that an employer, in such a case, does not enjoy a right summarily to terminate the relationship with such a senior employee, would appear to be an odd one: one out of step with common sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">To suggest that the common law would effectively insist that such parties continue in the personal, and often quite close and trusting, relationship of employment, as if nothing had happened, would seem remarkable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The effect of this would be to demand the employer put out of mind (as it were) the discovery of the misconduct, and continue to pay the employee under the supervening service agreement as if nothing had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This is a conclusion to which a court would need to be driven by clear legal authority or by singular factual circumstances of the case, so far undisclosed in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' (Footnotes omitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">)
 

8 The parties accepted that the employer had the onus of establishing serious and wilful misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 Dishonest misappropriation of his employer's assets was alleged against Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Such allegations are serious in the sense discussed in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">As Dixon J put it, '[they affect] the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained' by the Tribunal of fact: Briginshaw at 363.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In such cases, '"reasonable satisfaction" should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony or indirect inferences': Briginshaw at 362.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Long service in a company with a particular culture 
 
10 Mr Serventi had been employed by (or credited by Transfield Construction Pty Ltd ('Transfield') and John Holland) with service for Transfield since 1957.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On 1 February 2003 John Holland acquired Transfield's business and Mr Serventi and most other Transfield employees became employees of John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 At all relevant times Transfield was a privately owned company wholly owned by Transfield Holdings Pty Ltd ('Transfield Holdings').</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The corporate culture of Transfield was, in some respects, akin to a familial organisation and fairly described by a John Holland analyst in 2003 in the following terms:
 
 'The culture of the company is dominated in many ways by the history of its evolution --- a strong Italian founder who remained at the head of the private company, officially or unofficially for fifty years, and made it what it is today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 The culture is characterised by this legacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Forty percent of the staff employees and thirty three percent of the wages employees are more than fifty years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 The vast majority of these employees are of Italian descent and have lengths of service greater than fifteen years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 Their preference is for the old ways of doing things, both at a micro level and at a macro level eg: using your own plant and equipment with your own workforce in your own fabrication shop etc --- vertical integration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 They have had a "figure" to look up to as the "boss" and problems will emerge as this has now been displaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 Attempts have been made by the company in the recent years to break down the "silo" mentality that developed over the years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Small fiefdoms were built up with people protecting their own patch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Despite the restructure carried out there is still, from the older employees, a good deal of resistance to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It is well known that cultural change is difficult to achieve within such groups unless a structured approach is taken to the change management process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 ... 
 
 The main weakness is that of the dominant group outlined above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">This is summarised as: 
 
 
 &#8226; Resistance to change (systems, procedures, work methods, management, office location etc) 
 &#8226; Silo mentality --- protection of patch 
 &#8226; "Comfort zone" --- too long in one position with their attitude that the family will look after me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 &#8226; Poor safety record due to the domination of the old ways of doing things and resistance to change the attitudes towards safe working practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 
 

12 Mr Serventi originally commenced employment with Transfield as a mechanical engineer, but by the time of the events with which this decision is concerned, he had become one of that company's most senior and longest-serving managers, holding the position of Executive General Manager of a Transfield division, Transmission Systems and Telecommunications, which was involved in high voltage transmission and communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Indeed, there had been a time when only the founders of Transfield, Mr Guido Belgiorno-Nettis and Mr Salteri were more senior to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He rendered great service for Transfield and was highly valued by its founders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">13 At various times during his many years at Transfield, a number of benefits, beyond the usual, were conferred upon Mr Serventi, for example, a loan to assist in the purchase of a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">These benefits were conferred in an ethos at Transfield which, especially before the rigours of the Fringe Benefits Tax regime introduced in the mid 1980's, allowed senior managers a considerable amount of latitude and accorded them some informal perquisites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">For example, it was within the authority of managers to allow employees to make reasonable, modest use of Transfield equipment for private, non-work purposes, when the equipment was not at the time required for business purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">(The movement of the equipment into an employee's custody was however documented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">) 
 Transfield sold --- Mr Serventi joins John Holland 
 
14 In December 2002, Mr Belgiorno-Nettis, the managing director of Transfield Holdings, announced that Transfield was to be sold to John Holland, a subsidiary of Leighton Holdings Limited, a well-known public company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">At a staff meeting in December 2002, employees were addressed by Mr Belgiorno-Nettis and Mr Wild on the implications of the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Belgiorno-Nettis assured employees that John Holland had agreed to employ all Transfield employees on the same terms and conditions that had applied during their time at Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Mr Wild gave a similar assurance that 'as far as possible' employment with John Holland would be offered on the 'exact same terms and conditions' as those applicable at Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">15 Around this time, Mr Serventi had a meeting with Mr Wild.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The two men discussed several staff members within Mr Serventi's division, and also Mr Stephen Sasse, who was the General Manager of 'Human Resources and Industrial Relations' at Transfield, and later the General Manager of 'Human Resources, Industrial Relations and Safety' at John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Mr Serventi told Mr Wild that he did not use Mr Sasse in his division, and indicated his disapproval of Mr Sasse's approach to industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Mr Wild later repeated the substance of this conversation to Mr Sasse, although the timing of this disclosure was disputed: Mr Wild said that it occurred prior to Mr Serventi's employment being terminated, and that at that time he formed the opinion that neither Mr Serventi nor Mr Sasse 'was particularly fond of the other'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Mr Sasse asserted that he was not informed of Mr Serventi's views until after Mr Serventi had left GridComm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It does not matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I accept that Mr Sasse and Mr Serventi did not suit each other and that Mr Sasse would not have been sorry to see Mr Serventi in a position where he might be dismissed for misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">16 At Mr Serventi's suggestion, either Transfield or John Holland paid for Transfield employees in Mr Serventi's division who were considering contracts of employment with John Holland to have legal advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Around this same time, Mr Sasse had commenced monitoring the emails of an employee, Mr Jason Power, who worked under and reported to Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Power was then the General Manager of a Transfield subsidiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Mr Sasse explained the email surveillance (in a facsimile to John Holland's legal representatives with the subject heading 'Serventi') by reference to the view that 'we [John Holland] knew he [that is, Power] was being mischievous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">This is unattractive but does not impinge on Mr Sasse's credibility which, as to essential matters, I generally accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">17 In late December 2002, Mr Serventi made an unsuccessful proposal to Transfield for a 'management buyout' of his division of Transfield, and then unsuccessfully approached Mr Wild about a future management buyout from John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">18 In this context, Mr Serventi says that Mr Wild told him that if he commenced employment with John Holland, then: 
 
 '...we will set you up to run the division exactly as you have with Transfield, nothing is to change, only the sticker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">You'll remain in the same position and I want to ensure that all your key people are in the same position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">You will maintain all the existing systems in managing all the people with the same traditions and customs you had in Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I want you to keep the same culture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I want you to be totally comfortable'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 

Mr Wild acknowledged that John Holland had adopted an approach of 'minimum change/business as usual' during the course of the acquisitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">For this purpose, 'minimum change' and 'business as usual' had the meaning that 'people will generally continue to work in the same office for the same boss doing the same thing'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Mr Wild said that John Holland: 
 
 'hoped to achieve that objective by keeping the division intact and with the same management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">However, whilst we did want to keep the division intact and operating essentially as it had previously, this did not mean that we would compromise the governance requirements that dictated the behaviour of a public company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">' 
 
 

19 Mr Serventi was formally offered employment in the position of General Manager of GridComm on certain written terms and conditions on 6 January 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">There was some dispute about which letters in what form passed between whom, but that dispute does not bear on the outcome of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">20 On 31 January 2003, Mr Serventi signed the letter of offer in an amended form, having made deletions by hand to the letter of offer and the terms and conditions document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">A memorandum from Mr Serventi to Mr Sasse regarding the letter of offer was also provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">One week later Mr Serventi received a letter from Mr Wild setting out the terms of John Holland's retention bonus plan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">21 On 1 February 2003, John Holland formally acquired the business of Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">On 1 February 2003 Mr Serventi, and the vast majority of Transfield employees, were transferred to John Holland pursuant to the arrangements between John Holland and Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Mr Serventi commenced employment with John Holland as General Manager of Gridcomm and shortly thereafter became a director of GridComm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Gridcomm was a John Holland subsidiary and, at relevant times, its business included the design and construction of power transmission systems and telecommunications infrastructure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Serventi was given the privilege of naming GridComm --- a gesture on the part of Mr Wild intended to reassure Mr Serventi as to the level of control and direction he would have over the GridComm division as General Manager, or, in other words, to 'give him a feeling that he had his own empire, or the empire that he had [at Transfield] was to continue'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Suggestions of misconduct by Mr Serventi --- a John Holland conspiracy?</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
22 In August 2003, Mr Sasse commenced an investigation into Mr Serventi, apparently following a suggestion by an anonymous informant that Mr Serventi's bank accounts should be examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Among other things, Mr Sasse made inquiries of John Holland staff and retained PriceWaterhouseCoopers ('PWC') to conduct inquiries including a 'suspicious transactions analysis' and arrange covert surveillance of the Serventi family home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">As early as the engagement of PWC, Mr Sasse had as an objective to be 'rid of Serventi' if the evidence warranted it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">However, I reject the suggestion that either Mr Sasse or Mr Wild had no serious objection to Mr Serventi's giving his son the use of the vehicles and that they did not honestly believe that such warranted his dismissal for misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">I also do not believe that Mr Sasse acted out of mere general enmity towards or dislike of Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">23 Over the following couple of months, and in light of information obtained from the investigation into Mr Serventi's conduct, Mr Sasse, in consultation with Mr Wild, considered John Holland's options for dealing with what appeared to be the alleged misconduct Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">24 This process occurred against a background of John Holland's preparations for the restructure of GridComm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It was put by Mr Serventi that the reorganization would make him surplus and that the complaints by the John Holland executives about his arranging the use of the vehicles by his son was exaggerated and used as an excuse to avoid paying his compensation for redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">25 On 2 October 2003, Mr Serventi attended a meeting with Mr Wild and Mr Sasse during which Mr Wild said the several allegations relied on by John Holland to Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">According to Mr Serventi, when questioned about his conduct, he replied (relevantly as to the vehicle use):
 
 '... My... son... [Anthony was] employed on a project in Western Australia at Christmas with Transfield...</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">I've certainly let my son use a car if it's spare when his own car is broken down as I did at Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I have done this many times for others with Transfield'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">
 

26 According to Mr Wild (and Mr Sasse's account is similar), when Mr Serventi was challenged about his son's use of the car, he said words to the effect: 'there was a vehicle free and Anthony needed one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The company had vehicles for sale and I selected one of the these while it was sitting there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' The only claim that anything was justified by past practice at Transfield was made in relation to another John Holland complaint, namely Mr Serventi's use of company employees at his own home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Mr Serventi said that such use was occasional and 'It was done at Transfield in the old days'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Sasse's brief notes taken at the time of this interview record Mr Serventi as saying: 'number of cars for sale'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">27 Mr Wild and Mr Sasse acknowledge that, later in the conversation, after he was handed a letter terminating his services 'on the grounds of serious and wilful misconduct'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Mr Serventi said 'I can't accept it was wilful misconduct'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">When Mr Wild asked what else it was, Mr Serventi said 'it was allowed in Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Someone in my position gets those kinds of benefits in Transfield'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">28 It is fair to say in Mr Serventi's favour, that he was rather 'ambushed' by what seems to have been a torrent of questions and no warning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Nevertheless, this is not a case where the employer was obliged to accord procedural fairness of the kind that many public employees would have as their right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">(The statement of claim alleged that there was an implied term in the contract of employment to give Mr Serventi such a right but, not surprisingly, no more was heard of it in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">No particular circumstances were shown to warrant the implication, nor is such a term implied into employment contracts generally).</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">29 The upshot of the meeting was that Mr Wild forthwith terminated Mr Serventi's employment without payment in lieu of notice or for redundancy, although his leave entitlements were paid out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mr Serventi was informed by letter that his employment had been terminated on the basis of serious and wilful misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">30 Shortly after Mr Serventi's departure from John Holland, GridComm was restructured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Serventi's use of company vehicles for his son's private purposes 
 
31 It is now convenient to outline the impugned conduct in more detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">As mentioned earlier, the substance of this conduct was ultimately, as I understand it, admitted by Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It is the context and significance of such conduct and Mr Serventi's state of mind about it that remained in contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">32 It was a condition of Mr Serventi's contract of employment that John Holland would pay for him to have a privately owned motor vehicle for business and other use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The contract provided that Mr Serventi's 'Total Fixed Remuneration' would include the costs of meeting this requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The written contract contained no term that might entitle Mr Serventi to use any other John Holland or Gridcomm vehicle for private purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">33 In September 2002, Mr Serventi instructed a subordinate, Mr Frank Maggio, the 'Human Resources Coordinator' for Mr Serventi's Transmission division to make cars available to his son on several occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Mr Serventi asked Mr Maggio whether there was a four wheel drive vehicle (4WD) in good condition available for his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Maggio indicated there was such a vehicle available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">34 A day or so later Mr Serventi and Anthony came to pick up the vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Serventi rejected the one offered by Mr Maggio, saying that it was an old vehicle, not in good enough condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mr Maggio said it was the 'only 4WD ute available'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Mr Serventi instructed him to take another 4WD vehicle from another employee, Mr Rosato, who was on sick leave and give the latter another vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">35 Mr Rosato's vehicle had been allocated to him for several years in his capacity as a Transmission division supervisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The vehicle was not a 'pool' vehicle but part of Mr Rosato's remuneration package.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">As such there was no log book for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Maggio then gave Mr Rosato a substitute Toyota Corolla which was 'the office pool vehicle'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Mr Rosato was not happy about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Mr Maggio said in evidence:
 
 'I had concerns about the correctness of doing what Mr Serventi told me to do, but because I was under a direction from him, the General Manager, I did not question him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">I would ordinarily question an employee taking a Tool of Trade pool vehicle as to when the vehicle would be returned and what project it was needed for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">If it was for personal use, it had to be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">However, Mr Serventi was my boss and had an authoritarian style.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">If anyone else was to use a vehicle for personal use, they would have to get authorisation directly from Mr Serventi in his capacity as General Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Therefore I did what Mr Serventi told me to do without questioning him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

36 In May 2003 another supervisor had an urgent need for a 4WD vehicle and Mr Maggio asked Mr Serventi whether he could return the 4WD he and his son had taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Serventi agreed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It was returned in a damaged condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Mr Serventi asked whether there was another car available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Mr Maggio told him that the only one was a Toyota Corolla, the 'office pool vehicle'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">That vehicle was used for work errands by office staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Mr Serventi said 'It will have to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Give it to Anthony in exchange'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">This was done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The Corolla was delivered to Pymble (where Mr Serventi's home was) by another GridComm employee, Mr Northcroft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">37 In August 2003 Mr Serventi told Mr Maggio that the Corolla needed a service and instructed Mr Maggio to make another car available while the service was being carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Maggio arranged for a third vehicle, a Camry station wagon to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">On 12 September 2003, by arrangement between Mr Serventi and Mr Maggio, Anthony came in and exchanged the Camry for the Corolla.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">38 The second and third vehicles had company log books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mr Maggio logged the second car as having been delivered 'to Pymble' by Mr Northcroft and being used by Mr Serventi, during the three and a half months his son had it, for 'various T/systems' trips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">He made a similar entry in respect of the third vehicle, the Camry, when it was returned and Anthony again took the second vehicle, the Corolla.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Mr Serventi's case 
 
39 In evidence, Mr Serventi admitted to having taken cars from the pool, including in circumstances where 'it's spare [and] when [his son's] own car is broken down'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">He admitted to having instructed Mr Maggio to assign a spare pool car to his son and that it was used by the son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">However, Mr Serventi claimed an entitlement so to arrange matters, on the basis of a continuance of an alleged 'custom and practice' at Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Such continuance, he claimed, was a condition of his employment at John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In short, Mr Serventi claimed that John Holland had authorised such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Mr Serventi said: 
 
 'It had always been my responsibility at Transfield to allocate vehicles in my Business Unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The allocation was in accordance with the needs of the particular project a person was working upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">At no time during my employment at John Holland was I ever informed or was it suggested to me, that the allocation of pool vehicles was not within my authority or that the authority I had at Transfield was now different at John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Indeed, I understood from the conversation I had with [Mr Wild] , that I was to have the same authority I had at Transfield --- " nothing was to change only the sticker ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">' (Original emphasis .</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">) 
 

 40 Mr Serventi put forward several examples designed to show that he may have believed that taking a company-owned vehicle for his son's use for months on end was within what he regarded as his managerial prerogative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">On analysis none of the examples singly, nor all collectively, demonstrated any such thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">There were instances of short term favours to employees for genuine emergencies; no doubt (I would accept) short-term loans to employees of trucks for local carrying, again as a favour, and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The only long-term provision of a Transfield vehicle pointed to was for Mr Serventi's witness Jason Power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">But that was arranged with Mr Power's supervising manager and there was a practical and readily understood justification for it from Transfield's viewpoint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">41 There was no such justification for Mr Serventi's equipping his son for long periods with a company car, involving substantial private use of the car by his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Anthony at most had done a few weeks' vacation work for the company in another State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">There was no need or desirability that either Transfield or John Holland should foster especially good or friendly relations with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Anthony had no urgent need which might naturally excite a compassionate response by his father's employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr Serventi was handsomely remunerated including by provision of a good quality vehicle made available for his private use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 Mr Serventi's family was a close one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is very likely that he knew that substantial use was being made of the vehicles he had put into his son's possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">43 Anthony did not give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">44 Thus the first car, the 4WD utility, was taken for over seven months; the second car, the Corolla sedan, was initially taken for over four months, and then later for a period of approximately two weeks; and the third car, the Camry station wagon, was taken for approximately three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">In consequence, Mr Serventi arranged for his son the continuous availability of a company vehicle for more than a calendar year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Over almost the whole of that year substantial use of the vehicle was made --- roughly a tank of petrol per week was used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">45 At a late stage in the trial, Mr Bruce James, the CEO of Transfield between 1999 and 2002 (having taken over from Mr Belgiorno-Nettis), swore an affidavit tendered by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He was not required for cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Mr James had been employed in various positions at Transfield since 1975 and was asked to comment on several 'assumptions' pertaining to Mr Serventi's time at Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In relation to the use of Transfield vehicles, and in particular, the assumption that '[w]hilst Robert Serventi was employed by Transfield Construction, on at least two occasions he took a Transfield vehicle home for a period in the order of six months for the use of his son', Mr James said: 
 
 'Mr Serventi was not entitled to do this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I did not know that Mr Serventi had ever engaged in this practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">If I had been asked by Mr Serventi to authorise such a practice I would have refused to authorise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">I was not asked to authorise this practice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 

46 In relation to the use of Transfield employees, Mr James was asked to comment on an 'assumption' that Mr Serventi had directed a fellow Transfield employee, Mr Northcroft, to assist a tradesman who was carrying out maintenance work and renovations on Mr Serventi's home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">In response, Mr James stated that:
 
 'Mr Serventi was not entitled to do this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I did not know that Mr Serventi had ever engaged in this practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">If I had been asked to approve such a practice I would not have agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 
 I have further been asked whether my answer above would be different in the event that Mr Northcroft at the relevant time was not engaged in other duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">My answer would not change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">' 
 

47 In relation to the use of Transfield fuel, Mr James was asked to comment on an 'assumption' that from time to time Mr Serventi would direct Transfield employees to fill the fuel tank of his private vehicle with diesel from the tank at the Seven Hills depot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In response, Mr James stated that Mr Serventi was not entitled to do so, and that Mr James was unaware that such directions had been issued by Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">48 In my view, there was no custom and practice at Transfield as alleged by Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Nor was there any basis for him to think that there had been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It is an affront to common sense to suggest that a senior manager in a company would have the right or would think he might have the right, without at least securing the express agreement of the person or board to whom he answered, to make a motor vehicle available for substantial and entirely private use over a lengthy period by a relative, in circumstances where that relative had no special or urgent need for the vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Mr James' evidence must be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The Context 
 
49 A 'zero---tolerance' approach was taken by both Transfield and John Holland to cases of theft by blue-collar employees; theft of relatively minor items led to summary dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">50 There was a John Holland code of ethics generally made available to employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">It stressed, among other things, the need for 'integrity' and 'using company assets and resources only for legitimate business purposes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Common sense and such an approach would indicate the necessity for visible scrupulosity by managerial staff in dealing with company assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">51 The introduction and policing of the Fringe Benefits Tax regime and necessary accounting procedures for compliance, in existence since the 1980's, was in general, known to Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">FBT requirements were taken, both at Transfield and John Holland, to require strict accounting for the value of the private use made by employees of company assets and of company funds expended for the private benefit of employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">As a senior manager, Mr Serventi knew about this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">52 On the take-over of the Transfield business, John Holland executives including Mr Wild were at pains to explain to the incoming Transfield staff, including managers, the high accounting standards and levels of practice regarded by John Holland as necessary and appropriate to the operations of a subsidiary of a public company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">This must have percolated through to Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Dishonesty despite a 'paper trail' 
 
53 Much was made on Mr Serventi's behalf of the fact that there was a 'paper trail' to show that the vehicles were 'booked out' to Mr Serventi and that he likely knew that there would be such records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">54 Mr Serventi certainly did not tell Mr Maggio to ensure there were no such records and it is likely that he would have known (and during the relevant period he did come to know) that there would be records of the assignment of the company's vehicles to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">55 But he also believed, in my opinion, that Mr Maggio had enough wit to see to it that the records did not immediately show that Mr Serventi was taking the cars simply to give them to his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Mr Serventi was the 'boss' of Transfield and later of GridComm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He had done Mr Maggio some favours in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">In my opinion, the justified inference is that he believed that Mr Maggio knew which side his bread was buttered on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">He did not need to tell Mr Maggio what to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">56 As to the rest of the paper trail, (the petrol card records and so on), whatever Mr Serventi's state of mind about them, he did not desist from a course of conduct that, even if not in its actual inception, after some period --- a month at the most, had become dishonest, on account of those likely records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Failure to advert to the records or a belief in his own indispensability or invincibility may well have accounted for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">
 

57 In any case, Mr Serventi had no right at all to do what he did, and no belief that he did have such a right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The 'parallel restructuring' of Mr Serventi's division 
 
58 Mr Serventi claimed, as Mr Sasse foresaw he would, that he was the victim of a conspiracy: that the misconduct allegations against him were a mere, colourable cloak for getting rid of him without redundancy pay in the interests of an organisational restructuring that others in John Holland were planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">I attended to the evidence on this matter without, I trust, undue naivety or a blind faith in the captains and lieutenants of industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Mr Serventi's case in this respect was simply not made out on the entirety of the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">He was, on the evidence, bona fide dismissed for serious misconduct, even if such dismissal had other benefits for John Holland and for Mr Sasse's feelings in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Empathy and analysis 
 
59 I was at first, I confess, minded to find ways to believe and excuse Mr Serventi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He presented a forlorn but attractive figure --- an old lion of the Australian construction industry; encouraged by the old guard at Transfield to rule his divisional empire; a man who would look out for his own loyal employees; a man, I originally thought, who might have thought some minor, unorthodox gifts were in his power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">60 As the case unfolded and the sheer scale of the appropriation of the cars to his son became more clearly in focus, it simply became less and less possible to give fair expression to such sentiments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Ultimately Mr James' evidence delivered the coup de grace .</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Mr Serventi's evidence thereafter was unimpressive and undermined what had been an attractive demeanour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Conclusions 
 
61 Some aspects of Mr Serventi's position such as his advanced years and his long and meritorious service with Transfield may excite some sympathy, but the case cannot be decided on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">62 This is not a case where what is in issue is whether the application of the law would result in a 'harsh' outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Mr Sasse was not sorry to see Mr Serventi go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Some other employer might, possibly, despite the seriousness of his misconduct, at least have offered him the chance to resign but John Holland was not obliged to do this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">If an employee gives a fellow employee or a supervisor who dislikes him just cause for his dismissal, he cannot complain at law if that lawful consequence follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">63 There was only Mr Serventi's evidence to suggest a 'custom and practice' at Transfield that might justify his behaviour, and analysis of his stated experiences and examples did not support the existence of any such arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">There was unchallenged evidence from Mr James that at Transfield Mr Serventi had no right to do what he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">There is no adequate reason then as to why Mr Serventi would not have understood this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">64 It is inconceivable, in reality, that Mr Serventi thought he had a right to do what he was doing, especially in relation to his son's use of the vehicle:
 
&#8226; Mr Serventi had had to bargain for a car for himself and its use was guaranteed by express contractual terms;
 
&#8226; There was no question of any short-term emergency for, or humanitarian dispensation to, his son;
 
&#8226; By reason of Mr Serventi's participation in changing the arrangements as to the cars, it cannot be said that he did not turn his mind to the length of time his son had the use of them;
 
&#8226; He cannot have thought he had a right to do this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">He was unable to point to any real precedent with Transfield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The arrangements made in respect of Jason Power were entirely distinguishable: they had a work motive and they were disclosed to Jason Power's superiors; and
 
&#8226; The sheer time and scale of the use of the car by Mr Serventi's son takes such use out of the category of a trivial grace-and-favour dispensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">65 In my view Mr Serventi did not believe he had such a right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">66 Such was serious and wilful misconduct:
 
&#8226; it was dishonest;
 
&#8226; it was overbearing and it relied on the silence of GridComm employees;
 
&#8226; it was destructive of the standards to be expected of other employees;
 
&#8226; there was no excuse for it; and
 
&#8226; there was no relevant mitigating factor --- Mr Serventi's age, length of service with Transfield and so on are not that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">67 John Holland was entitled, by Mr Wild, summarily to terminate Mr Serventi's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">His application must be dismissed and, except as to some specific matters, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.</sentence>
