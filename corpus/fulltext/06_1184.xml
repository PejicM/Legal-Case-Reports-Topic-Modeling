<sentence id="s0">
 The applicant (Mr Hillig) seeks an order that no native title exists in relation to the land comprised in NSW Department of Lands Certificate of Title folio identifier 473 of Deposited Plan 728126 and located in the Local Government Area of Port Stephens, Parish of Tomaree, County of Gloucester, New South Wales ('the land').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The land was transferred to the Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council') pursuant to s 36 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW) ('the Land Rights Act') on 23 September 2003.</sentence>

<sentence id="s3">The members of the Land Council have passed a resolution to sell the land and a contract for its sale has been signed and awaits completion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">However, the land cannot be sold by the Land Council unless it is the subject of ' an approved determination of native title ' (s 40 and s 40AA of the Land Rights Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">An application may be made to this Court under Part 3 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act).</sentence>

<sentence id="s7">Mr Hillig, in his capacity as Administrator of the Land Council, brings an application pursuant to s 61(1) in Part 3 of the Act seeking a determination that native title does not exist in relation to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">His application is a ' non-claimant application ' within the meaning of s 253 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Hillig submits that he is entitled to bring the non-claimant application because the Land Council, as registered proprietor of the land, holds a non-native title interest in relation to the whole of the area in relation to which the determination is sought (s 61(1) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Hillig also submits that the requirements of the Act for notification of the non-claimant application have been met (s 66 of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Section 66(3) of the Act requires the Native Title Registrar ('the Registrar') to give notice of details of a non-claimant application to certain persons or bodies and to notify the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Section 66(2) and s 66(2A) of the Act require the Registrar to provide the relevant State Minister and representative bodies a copy of the application and certain other documents.</sentence>

<sentence id="s17">I am also satisfied that s 66(2) and s 66(2A) of the Act have been complied with.</sentence>

<sentence id="s19">NSW Native Title Services ('Native Title Services'), the body funded under s 203FE of the Act to perform the functions of a representative body in New South Wales, notified the Court of its intention to become a party to the application on 5 April 2006 and was joined as a respondent on 15 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Hillig submits that the application is unopposed and that the Court may make the order sought without holding a hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He relies on s 86G of the Act, which provides: 
 
 If, at any stage of a proceeding in relation to an application under section 61 , but after the end of the period specified in the notice given under section 66: 
 
 the application is unopposed; and 
 
 the Federal Court is satisfied that an order in, or consistent with, the terms sought by the applicant is within the power of the Court; 
 
 Court may, if it appears appropriate to do so, make such an order without holding a hearing or, if a hearing has started, without completing the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">...

<sentence id="s25">It is clear the application is unopposed within the meaning of s 86G(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I am also satisfied that the Court has power to make an order in the terms sought by Mr Hillig (s 86G(1)(b) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mr Hillig is the holder of a non-native title interest in the land and is entitled to bring the non-claimant application under s 61(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Court has jurisdiction to make a determination under s 61(1) of the Act that native title does not exist in relation to the land provided no prior approved determination of native title has been made (s 81, s 13(1)(a) and s 225 of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Searches conducted by the National Native Title Tribunal on 10 October 2005 and 1 June 2006 respectively did not find any approved determination of native title in relation to the land (s 13(1)(a)), or evidence of any native title determination application having been made in relation to the whole or a part of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">There is no evidence before the Court of any native title rights or interests in the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Nor, in circumstances where the provisions of the Act for notification have been complied with and the relevant searches undertaken, is there any evidence of persons who have asserted or might seek to assert such rights.</sentence>
