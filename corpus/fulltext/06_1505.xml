1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate given on 7 June 2006, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 27 July 2005 and handed down on 16 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse the grant of a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('China').</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He arrived in Australia on 27 January 2005 on a tourist visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 18 February 2005 he applied for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">A delegate of the Minister rejected the application on 9 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">An appeal to the Tribunal was lodged on 12 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because he was a Falun Gong practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He claimed that the Chinese authorities had fined his employer and threatened to dismiss him from his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The police came to the appellant's home and told the appellant that he would be imprisoned if he practised Falun Gong again and he was forced to declare that he was separated from Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant also asserted that one of his colleagues had been imprisoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 The Tribunal sent the appellant a letter dated 15 June 2005 inviting him to attend a hearing scheduled on 12 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In its decision, the Tribunal stated that no response was received to the invitation, that the letter was not returned unclaimed and that the appellant did not provide a telephone contact number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As the appellant did not appear at the hearing, the Tribunal proceeded to make a decision pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Due to the lack of details and the inability of the Tribunal to test the appellant's claims, the Tribunal held that it was unable to establish relevant facts sufficient for it to be satisfied that Australia owed protection obligations to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant's claims were true and was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention-related reason.</sentence>

<sentence id="s17">In relation to the grounds that asserted a failure to comply with procedures mandated by the Act, including ss 425 to 425A , the Federal Magistrate found that these grounds could not be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Her Honour considered there had been no contravention of s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The information regarding the appellant's circumstances were not a reason or part of a reason for the decision and the Tribunal's conclusion that the material was inadequate was not information under s 424A(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Her Honour held that no jurisdictional error was apparent on the materials and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 The notice of appeal to this Court identified the following grounds:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>

<sentence id="s31">No arguments are advanced in support of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In my view the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate does not bespeak error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">On the contrary, her Honour, in my view, was perfectly correct in holding that no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal was made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">7 The order of the court will be that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
