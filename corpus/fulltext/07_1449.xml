 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Application has been made by the respondents seeking orders that the applicant be refused leave to extend time for the initiation of her proceedings, or in the alternative, summary judgment in favour of the respondents pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('Federal Court Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The substantive proceeding was initiated by the applicant, Ms Bahonko, pursuant to s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('the HREOC Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">That section provides that if a complaint has been terminated by the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ('the Commission') under, relevantly, s 46H, of which notice has been given under s 46PH(2), any person affected by the complaint may make application to this Court alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 Section 46PO(2) provides that any such application must be made within 28 days after the date of issue of the notice of termination, or within such further time as the court concerned allows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 The application and claim were filed on 26 July 2006 and relate to a complaint made to the Commission dated 19 January 2006 against the first respondent ('the NBV'), the second respondent ('the Minister'), and the "Victorian Government".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Although the application and claim were made against the Minister by name, Bronwyn Pike, she is the former Minister for Health, and is the current Minister for Education, and it is convenient for the purposes of this judgment to refer to Bronwyn Pike as "the Minister".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I will amend the description of the second respondent to read "Former Minister for Health/Current Minister for Education" as requested by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 On 1 June 2006, a delegate of the Commission terminated the complaint of race and disability discrimination pursuant to s 46PH(1)(c) of the HREOC Act on the basis that it was lacking in substance, and gave Ms Bahonko notice of the termination on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Accordingly, Ms Bahonko was some 27 days late in commencing this proceeding and, putting aside arguments raised by Ms Bahonko that in the circumstances of the case leave is no longer in issue, to which I will return later, application has been made by Ms Bahonko for leave to file out of time her application and claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The application filed in this proceeding alleged that the respondents:
 
 ...engaged, have been engaged and continue to engage in a gross violation of fundamental human rights of the applicant in the economic, social, cultural, political, educational and other fields of life with the purpose of nullifying applicant's exercise on an equal footing of her rights in these fields.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">NBV requires applicant to comply with terms, conditions &amp; requirements which are not reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case &amp; the applicant cannot comply with those and the requirements to comply has the purpose and effect of nullifying and impairing the recognition on an equal footing as the other person would have in all the fields of a public life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Such actions are based on the applicant's race, descent, ethnic origin, political opinions and actions, religious beliefs and imputed disabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">

7 Ms Bahonko alleged that the Minister, in addition, "has vicarious liability" under s 18A of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ('RDA').</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">8 In the accompanying claim filed in accordance with O 81 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules'), Ms Bahonko claimed she suffered discrimination contrary to:
 
 &#8226; the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ('DDA'), based on an imputed disability;
 &#8226; section 9 of the RDA;
 &#8226; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (see Sch 2 of the HREOC Act); and 
 &#8226; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">

9 The particulars of the discrimination are described in the following terms:
 
 &#8226; The respondents "nullified applicant's rights in all spheres of the applicant's life including the provision and receiving of health services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">&#8226; The respondents failed to comply with the HREOC Act and any other relevant legislation "in their criminal actions against the applicant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">&#8226; The respondents "imputed multiple disabilities upon the applicant and vilified applicant, then discriminated against applicant on the basis of their imputations, impositions and vilifications".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">&#8226; The respondents denied the applicant "all human rights, liberty and freedom".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">&#8226; The respondents subjected the applicant to "a racially motivated harassment and psychological tortures for a prolonged period of time (the last two years)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">&#8226; The respondents' actions were wilful and deliberate according to a "long term criminal and a far-reaching plan".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This included an attempt to break up the applicant as a person and commit an "assault on applicant's identity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The respondents' actions prevented the applicant from properly supporting herself and leading a dignified life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The respondents' actions amount to genocide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">

10 Ms Bahonko seeks relief by way of injunctions against the alleged conduct of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She also seeks aggravated damages for economic losses consisting of income and other benefits for 21 years being the remaining years of her nursing career.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">She also seeks aggravated damages for non-economic losses, including damages to health, reputation, identity and nullification of her future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">THE STATUS OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
 
11 The procedural background to these proceedings is set out in my judgment delivered on 14 March 2007: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 2) [2007] FCA 351 , particularly at [12] to [39].</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">12 In this proceeding, a number of notices of motion have been filed by Ms Bahonko at various times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Some of those motions have been completely dealt with, some of them have been partly dealt with, and others have not been determined being left to await the determination of the applications the subject of these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It is useful to set out the parts of the notices of motion that remain open for determination by the Court:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">As mentioned above, the motion of the NBV, notice of which was dated 15 September 2006, seeking orders that Ms Bahonko be refused leave to extend time for the initiation of this proceeding and, in the alternative, for summary disposal of the proceeding if leave to initiate is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As mentioned above, the Minister's motion, notice of which was also dated 15 September 2006, seeking orders that there be judgment for the Minister against Ms Bahonko under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was dated 22 September 2006, seeking orders: 
 
 
 3.1 "That solicitor Ms Dominique Saunders will be held to account for deception/fraud committed on 01/09/06";
 3.2 "That Ms Saunders will be held accountable for the obstruction of justice, trickery, fraud, making false statements";

 3.4 "That Justice Ryan orders be set aside";
 3.5 "That a new direction hearing be established and conducted by the Judge without the conflict of interest and permanently allocated to the case";
 3.6 "That extension of time to institute appeal against Justice Ryan orders be granted to applicant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was dated 3 October 2006, which seeks, amongst other things, leave to appeal against the directions made by Ryan J on 1 September 2006, and in particular, orders in the following terms: 
 
 
 4.1 "Extra time to lodge application for leave to appeal Justice Ryan Orders of 01/09/06 is granted to the applicant";
 4.2 "Leave to appeal Justice Ryan orders from 01/09/06 are given to the applicant";
 4.3 "Applicant is exempted from the strict following of the Court Rules";
 4.4 "The Court Hearings including trial will be scheduled no more often than on a fortnightly basis".</sentence>

<sentence id="s40">5.3 "The original jurisdictions of the Court will be added to the current ones".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">5.4 "Additional jurisdictions relevant to the matters will be added".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">5.5 "Urgent monetary relief is granted to the applicant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Ms Bahonko's amended notice of motion dated 27 February 2007, paragraph 4 of which was amended by her notice of motion dated 28 May 2007, seeking orders that: 
 
 
 6.1 "Proceedings for the Contempt of Court by the Nurses Board of Victoria, Minister for Health Bronwyn Pike, VGS Office, Russell Kennedy Lawyers &amp; Dr Timothy Entwisle are commenced".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">6.2 "Jurisdiction of the Court in the matter VID 855/06 is extended to include relevant and criminal jurisdictions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 

13 In addition, on 17 May 2007, Ms Bahonko filed notice of a constitutional issue pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">14 The principal question to be determined is whether leave ought to be granted to Ms Bahonko to file this proceeding out of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
15 It is useful to set out the background to the complaint of Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In early 2003, Ms Bahonko commenced work at Moorfields Aged Care facility at Box Hill ('Moorfields').</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Whilst working at Moorfields, Ms Bahonko approached the Director of Nursing, Ms Riley, with concerns about the workplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">After this consultation, Ms Bahonko claimed she started to be "systematically harassed, stalked, subjected to various set ups and abuses".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">16 In August 2003, Ms Bahonko commenced a second job part time at another Uniting Church Aged Care facility at Bodalla ('Bodalla').</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Whilst in that position, Ms Bahonko was told by the Director of Nursing "not to show outside religious terms".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">This was apparently in response to her wearing a Virgin Mary on a chain visible outside her uniform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In around November 2003, Ms Bahonko stated that she was "stalked" by Ms Turnbull (CEO of Moorfields) and was "subjected to harassment and unlawful practices and the working condition as at Moorfields".</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">On 9 March 2004, Ms Bahonko claimed she was emotionally and verbally assaulted and openly told that she had no rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">She immediately ceased working at Bodalla.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">17 On 6 May 2004, an incident occurred at Moorfields which resulted in Ms Bahonko being escorted off the premises by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">18 It appears that some time before the incident, a complaint was made by a patient about Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">While that complaint remained unresolved, it seems that another two complaints were made against Ms Bahonko, complaining of inappropriate communication and aggression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">All three complaints remained unresolved at the time of the incident on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">By virtue of the complaints being unresolved, Ms Riley and Ms Turnbull decided to ask Ms Bahonko to stand down from her duties at Moorfields, pending an investigation into the outstanding complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">19 There are two different versions of events of what occurred on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">One version is that Ms Riley, along with Ms Wood, the Quality Manager at Moorfields, approached Ms Bahonko to ask her to leave the workplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">According to an incident report completed on the day, Ms Bahonko at first agreed to leave, but when Ms Riley asked her to give the keys to the drug trolley, she refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Some discussion ensued as to what stage Ms Bahonko was in administering medication to the resident patients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Ms Riley began to explain to Ms Bahonko that her actions with the medication were against "safe practice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Ms Bahonko apparently put her keys back in her pocket, sat down, and made some private phone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">At this stage, Ms Wood contacted Ms Turnbull about how to manage the situation, who instructed her to contact the police to have Ms Bahonko removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It seems that Ms Riley again asked Ms Bahonko to hand over the keys and leave the premises, which was refused, and the police were contacted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">After the police arrived, Ms Bahonko asked them to check her pre-prepared medication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The police asked her to hand over the keys and leave the premises, at which point Ms Bahonko apparently began disposing of the pre-prepared medication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The police physically approached her and escorted her from the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Ms Riley completed a report of the incident on the day, and also completed a medication incident report, which provided that Ms Bahonko had not adhered to the procedural and safe practice guidelines in preparing the medication on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">20 On the other hand, Ms Bahonko claimed the incident was a "criminal set up" organised by Ms Riley and Ms Turnbull.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Ms Bahonko claimed that her employer tampered with medication she was to administer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Ms Bahonko claimed the trolley with medications was taken from her and she was denied "a lawful handover of medications" when she stood down from her position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">She also said that she was lawfully obliged to discard the medication to prevent further crimes and frauds but was told by the police that she was "discarding evidence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In response to the "set up", Ms Bahonko made an official complaint to the safety authorities that she was "viciously assaulted" at Moorfields by police officers allegedly under the direction of Ms Riley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">21 Whatever were the actual circumstances of the incident, as a result, on 10 May 2004, a letter was sent to Ms Bahonko from Ms Turnbull terminating her employment at Moorfields for misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">22 On 19 May 2004, Ms Riley made a complaint to the NBV regarding the incident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">23 On 24 May 2004, in response to the complaint made by Ms Riley, the NBV held an extraordinary board meeting and decided to:
 
 1. initiate a preliminary investigation into Ms Bahonko's professional conduct and suspend her registration pending the outcome of the investigation; and 
 2. initiate a preliminary investigation into Ms Bahonko's ability to practise nursing on health grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">

The NBV wrote to Ms Bahonko informing her of this decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">24 On 25 May 2004, Ms Bahonko wrote to the NBV objecting to the suspension and denying the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">She sent further letters vehemently denying the allegations and provided her version of the events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">25 On 4 June 2004, Ms Bahonko filed an application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ('VCAT') for review of the NBV's decision of 24 May 2004 to suspend her registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">On 19 August 2004, on application by the NBV, VCAT decided to strike out Ms Bahonko's application: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2004] VCAT 1663.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">26 On 17 June 2004, the NBV held a board meeting to review its decision to suspend Ms Bahonko's registration and it decided to maintain the suspension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">A letter was written to Ms Bahonko explaining the NBV's decision to continue the investigations and the suspension of her registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">27 Ms Bahonko claimed she was told by the NBV's investigator, Ms Miln, that the NBV would lift her suspension, but due to her not signing some papers, this did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">However, according to a letter to Ms Bahonko from Russell Kennedy on behalf of the NBV, it was stated that Ms Miln required Ms Bahonko to "cooperate in and assist with the investigation process" in order to have the suspension lifted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It was also stated that a decision to lift the suspension could only be made by the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">28 On 6 July 2004, Ms Bahonko attended a hearing conducted by the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Ms Bahonko stated that she was "treated in a degrading manner and abusively" and she did not wish to attend any further hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">29 On 26 July 2004 the NBV wrote to Ms Bahonko stating that it had terminated the preliminary investigation into Ms Bahonko's health and fitness to practise as a nurse, but the investigation into her professional conduct was ongoing and the suspension remained in place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">30 In 2004, Ms Bahonko wrote to the Minister and on 23 August 2004 the Minister responded that, under the legislative framework for hearing of complaints and the appeal and review mechanisms in place, the Minister was unable to become involved in individual decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">31 On 27 August 2004, the NBV wrote to Ms Bahonko inviting her to attend a formal hearing into her professional conduct to be held on 27 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The NBV proposed to consider at the formal hearing alleged unprofessional conduct in which Ms Bahonko was said to have engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The NBV set out the allegations as follows:
 
 Moorfields (Box Hill) Aged Care Facility 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It is alleged that you engaged in unprofessional conduct while employed at Moorfields (Box Hill) Aged Care Facility, in that you: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.1 failed to act in a safe and competent manner in the treatment and care of residents and failed to respect their dignity; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.2 failed to comply with Moorfields Aged Care Facility policy and accepted nursing standards in the handling and administration of medication; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.3 in about December 2003 you failed to respect the dignity of patient MH in failing to accept the wishes of the family members of MH and the directions of superiors while MH was in the final stages of her life; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.4 on or about 24 April 2004 you failed to treat MM with dignity and respect in relation to her request for medication; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.5 refused to follow the lawful directions of superiors; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.6 behaved in a manner in relation to other staff that was of a lesser standard to that which might be reasonably expected by your peers and/or the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 
 
 
 
 
 Bodalla Home for the Aged 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It is alleged that you engaged in unprofessional conduct while employed at Bodalla Home for the Aged in that you failed to comply with Bodalla Home for the Aged policy and accepted nursing standards in documenting, handling and administration of medication, in that you: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.1 Left the drug trolley unattended on at least two occasions being 17 February and 2 March 2004; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.2 Signed medication that had not been administered; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.3 Administered medications at time when such medications were not authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 

32 I note that only the allegation described in paragraph 1.2 specifically related to the incident on 6 May 2004 at Moorfields, whereas all other alleged misconduct seemed to arise out of complaints made against Ms Bahonko by patients or her employers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">33 The NBV also informed Ms Bahonko that it had decided to appoint a panel of NBV members ('the Panel') to conduct the formal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In deciding to hold a formal hearing, the NBV considered a number of documents which it attached to the letter, which were said to support the allegations made against Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">34 On 25 August 2004, proceedings were filed by Ms Bahonko in the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking, amongst other things, an injunction to restrain the NBV's hearing of the complaints against Ms Bahonko scheduled for 27 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">On 6 September 2004, the Supreme Court proceeding was heard and dismissed on the basis that it had no prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Ms Bahonko appealed this decision, which was dismissed, and Ms Bahonko's application for special leave to appeal in the High Court was also refused: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2005] HCATrans 864 (20 October 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">35 The Panel's formal hearing went ahead on 27 September 2004 and was not attended by Ms Bahonko though she had been invited to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">On 14 October 2004, in its written determination, the Panel found that Ms Bahonko "had engaged in unprofessional conduct of a serious nature".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It appears from the Panel's reasons for determination that a number of witnesses appeared at the hearing and the NBV was represented by counsel and Russell Kennedy solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Panel found that Ms Bahonko showed "a consistent refusal to accept direction that appears to the Panel to be deliberate, repeated and inexcusable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Panel went on to find that her attitude towards the investigation and hearing was corroborative of the evidence "given in relation to Ms Bahonko's inability to take direction from her professional superiors".</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">36 The Panel determined to lift the suspension of Ms Bahonko's registration as a nurse and impose the following restrictions on her registration:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">That Ms Bahonko work under clinical supervision for a period of six months following her return to work as a registered nurse; 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">That Ms Bahonko's employer/s provide a report or reports in writing to the Board in relation to her work performance every three months, for two years following her return to work as a registered nurse; 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That Ms Bahonko undertake counselling with a registered psychologist, approved by the Board, for a period of two years with a therapeutic focus on improving her communication and team-building skills, and that reports on the compliance with counselling be provided by the psychologist to the Board on a confidential basis every three months; 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">That Ms Bahonko supply the Board with the name of the registered psychologist with whom she proposes to undertake counselling within one month of the date of the reasons for this determination; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">That Ms Bahonko successfully complete a course in medication administration, approved by the Board, of at least two days' duration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">
 

37 As previously mentioned, on 19 January 2006 Ms Bahonko made a complaint to the Commission against the NBV, the Minister and the "Victorian Government" alleging discrimination on the grounds of race, disability, religious beliefs and political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The complaint against the NBV primarily arose out of its decision to suspend her registration as a nurse on 24 May 2004, and its decision on 14 October 2004 to impose conditions on Ms Bahonko's registration after lifting the suspension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The complaint against the Minister arose because of the Minister's previous association with the Uniting Church, which is affiliated with the Aged Care facilities at which Ms Bahonko worked as a nurse at various times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The complaint against the "Victorian Government" was only in general terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">38 A delegate of the Commission described the complaint as appearing to raise issues under ss 5, 6, 19 and 122 of the DDA, s 9 of the RDA and ss 3 and 31 of the HREOC Act, and summarised the claims as follows:
 
 You appeared to claim that the NBV discriminated against you on the grounds of your race, disability, religious belief and political opinion by suspending your registration to practise as a nurse... You appeared to claim that [the Minister for Health] aided or permitted the actions of the NBV because she has portfolio responsibility for the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">

39 The complaint of race and disability discrimination was terminated on 1 June 2006 pursuant to s 46PH(1)(c) of the HREOC Act, on the basis that Ms Bahonko's allegations were lacking in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">40 In relation to the remaining complaint of discrimination on the grounds of religion and political opinions, the Commission decided not to continue to inquire into the alleged discriminatory acts or practice, pursuant to s 32(3)(c)(ii) of the HREOC Act, because the Commission was of the opinion that the allegations were lacking in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It was stated that:
 
 ...it is not sufficient for a person to allege that he or she was of a particular religious belief and had been treated unfairly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Accordingly it is not sufficient evidence of discrimination on the grounds of religion that [the Minister for Health] was formerly associated with the Uniting Church and you are not of this religion... 
 THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEME 
 
41 For the purposes of this proceeding, it is useful to set out some key provisions of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The HREOC Act defines "unlawful discrimination" in s 3 as meaning any acts, omissions, or practices that are unlawful under relevant provisions of the DDA, the RDA, the Sex Discrimination Act 1994 (Cth) and the Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">42 Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [14] to [20].</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">43 Part II of the HREOC Act deals with the functions of the Commission, which include functions relating to human rights and equal opportunity in employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It is under this Part that the Commission dealt with Ms Bahonko's claims of discrimination on the grounds of religion and political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">44 Part IIB of the HREOC Act specifically deals with redress for unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Division 1 of Pt IIB provides for conciliation by the President of the Commission and s 46PH allows the President to terminate a complaint on a number of grounds, including where the President is satisfied that the complaint is lacking in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">45 Division 2 of Pt IIB provides for possible further action in this Court or the Federal Magistrates Court where a complaint has been terminated by the President.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Section 46PO allows a person affected by a complaint, where that complaint has been terminated, to make application to this Court for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Section 46PO(3) is in the following terms:
 
 The unlawful discrimination alleged in the application: 
 
 
 
 (a) must be the same as (or the same in substances as) the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) must arise out of the same (or substantially the same) acts, omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 

46 As mentioned above, s 46PO(2) provides that any application must be made within 28 days after the date of issue of the notice, or "within such further time as the court concerned allows".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME 
 The relevant principles 
 
47 Under s 46PO(2), it is clear that the Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were described by Weinberg J in the decision of Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24].</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">His Honour referred to the principles expounded by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9, which related to an application for an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'), and held that the principles therein stated were applicable to s 46PO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I respectfully agree with Weinberg J that those principles are relevantly applicable to an application under the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">48 The main three matters that need to be taken into account are:
 
 &#8226; the explanation of the delay;
 &#8226; any prejudice to the respondent; and
 &#8226; whether the applicant has an arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

49 I should say that during the hearing, Ms Bahonko submitted that leave to file out of time had been impliedly given or was no longer required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">She referred a number of factors, including the amount of time that had elapsed since filing the proceeding, the number of interlocutory steps that have occurred, that the Court is not bound by technicalities in human rights proceedings by virtue of s 46PR of the HREOC Act, and that she will suffer prejudice if her application is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">She submitted as follows:
 
 ...the extension is not at issue any more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The extension of time has been resolved [by] the manner, the defendant proceed in this proceeding, by the manner the proceeding been handled and by the development and the process itself and it is quite fanciful and an abuse of the process, inappropriate legally at the moment, after a year the proceeding were in process to bring back something which has been basically dealt with, in real term by the process itself and has been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">

50 However, it was always clear that the matter of the necessity for leave remained an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The way in which the proceeding has run its course has been a result of the number of interlocutory applications brought by all the parties which required consideration by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">No interlocutory application involved or proceeded on the basis that the issue of leave to file out of time was resolved in favour of Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There can be no suggestion of waiver or abandonment by virtue of the conduct of the respondents to lead to the view that the extension of time issue need not be determined by me or that it did not remain a live issue for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Further, there is no basis to suggest that s 46PR is applicable to issues going to jurisdiction so as to permit me to consider the application for leave otherwise than in accordance with the principles set out above: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [20] and [70].</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Further, there can be no prejudice to Ms Bahonko, as the applications for summary dismissal, which were also before me, required consideration of the merits of the case, and therefore she was anticipating having to deal with the question of the merits of her complaints, and was given ample opportunity to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The reason for the delay 
 
51 The period of delay is not a significant one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Ms Bahonko explained that she had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11 April 2006 and was still ill from the time the Commission gave her notice of the termination of the complaint on 1 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">She submitted a number of medical certificates which stated she was unfit to work because of the accident from 11 April 2006 to 17 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">52 On the basis of those certificates, I accept that Ms Bahonko was ill at the time she received notification of the complaint until 17 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">I note that the delay in filing her proceeding is relatively short, and I consider her excuse is acceptable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Prejudice to the respondents 
 
53 The prejudice claimed by the respondents constituted wasted costs and vexation in defending the proceedings, which they claim are without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">There is no specific evidence of prejudice because of the delay, and I will continue on the basis that there is no relevant prejudice to the respondents other than that the respondents were entitled to have the matter finalised within 28 days after the notice of termination was issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I note, however, that absence of prejudice is not sufficient to allow an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Submissions on the merits of the case 
 
54 In these circumstances, whether or not an extension will be granted depends upon whether any of Ms Bahonko's claims can be said to be arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It is useful to first set out the parties' submissions in relation to the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The NBV's submissions 
 
55 As a preliminary matter, the NBV sought to strike out those paragraphs of Ms Bahonko's evidence that makes allegations broader than the complaint as terminated by the Commission, so far as it relates to the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">The NBV claimed that the complaint only concerned its decision of 24 May 2004 and its decision of 14 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">56 The NBV opposed the grant of an extension of time on the basis that her claims are hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The NBV submitted that its investigations of the professional complaints made against Ms Bahonko were entirely proper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Under s 22(1) of the Nurses Act 1993 (Vic) ('the Nurses Act '), the NBV was obliged to investigate any complaints about the professional conduct of a registered nurse which is about professional conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In order for the NBV to decide whether it was necessary to conduct a formal or informal hearing into the complaint, it must conduct a preliminary investigation: see s 22(2) of the Nurses Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">57 The NBV submitted that there is no evidence that any of Ms Riley, Ms Turnbull or the police officers involved in the incident on 6 May 2004 were employed by, servants of, agents of or "protected by" the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Whilst the NBV does not accept that any of the allegations against the conduct of those people was discriminatory in any way, it submitted that, in any event, the conduct occurred prior to, and without, the involvement of the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">58 The NBV further submitted that its decision to suspend Ms Bahonko's registration pending the outcome of the investigations was a proper exercise of its power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Section 25 of the Nurses Act gives the NBV power, after making a determination to conduct a preliminary investigation about the professional conduct of a registered nurse, to suspend the registration of the nurse until any hearing into the matter is completed, provided the NBV is of the opinion that it is necessary to do so because there is a serious risk that the health and safety of the public will be endangered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The NBV submitted that there is no evidence to suggest that it exercised its power other than for the purposes contemplated by the Nurses Act , and certainly not on any discriminatory grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">59 The NBV submitted that there was nothing unlawful about the NBV's subsequent decision on 14 October 2004 to impose conditions on Ms Bahonko's registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Under s 48 of the Nurses Act , an appointed panel may, after considering all submissions made at the formal hearing into the professional conduct of a nurse, make a finding that the nurse has engaged in unprofessional conduct of a serious nature and may, among other things, cancel the nurse's registration or impose conditions, limitations or restrictions on the registration of a nurse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The NBV's decision to impose various conditions on Ms Bahonko was made after a formal hearing on 27 September 2004, which Ms Bahonko chose not to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">It was submitted that there is no evidence to suggest that the NBV's decision on 14 October 2004 was made on any unlawful discriminatory ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">60 The NBV submitted that, even if Ms Bahonko's allegations against its conduct in the investigations are well-founded (which it does not accept), those allegations do not demonstrate that those decisions were made on any ground of unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Minister's submissions 
 
61 The Minister adopted the NBV's submissions in so far as they were relevant to the claims made against the Minister, Ms Bahonko's application for an extension of time and the Minister's application for summary judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">62 The Minister submitted that Ms Bahonko's material does not reveal how she could make a credible claim that the Minister discriminated against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">63 The Minister referred to the decision of Weinberg J concerning a discrimination proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko against the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ('RMIT') and others: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In that case, his Honour was similarly faced with an application for an extension of time, as Ms Bahonko had filed out of time, and an application for summary judgment made by one of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">After his Honour considered the various claims, he refused to grant Ms Bahonko an extension of time, concluding in relation to the claims against RMIT as follows (at [86]):
 
 It would be quite wrong, in my view, to grant an extension of time in circumstances where there is a paucity of material to support claims of unlawful discrimination which are cast in sweeping, unparticularised and seemingly exaggerated terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It is clear that the Commission acted correctly in terminating her complaints, having regard to the material that Ms Bahonko placed before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The additional material placed before this Court in support of her application for review of the Commission's decision takes her case no further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">

64 The Minister submitted that Ms Bahonko's material against the Minister was similarly sweeping, unparticularised and exaggerated and that the Commission was right to terminate and finalise her complaints against the Minister on the basis of the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">It was submitted that the additional material placed before this Court takes her case no further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">In the alternative, it was submitted that if the material does take the case further, it is not the same or substantially the same as those in her complaints, and is therefore outside the scope of review by this Court under s 46PO(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">65 The Minister submitted that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear Ms Bahonko's complaints in relation to religious and political opinions and relied upon Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA at [70] to [71] per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">66 In relation to discrimination on the grounds of race and disability, it was submitted that Ms Bahonko made no identifiable or substantiated allegations capable of falling within the various provisions of the RDA and the DDA, and on this basis, the application should be summarily dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The Minister submitted that the Commission was correct in terminating Ms Bahonko's complaint against the Minister, and referred to the following finding of the Commission:
 
 I note that you have listed [the Minister for Health] as a respondent to your complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Whilst the Department of Human Services has portfolio responsibility for the NBV, you have provided no evidence to suggest that [the Minister for Health] had any direct role in the NBV's decisions about your registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

67 In relation to the vicarious liability claim, the Minister referred to some key provisions of relevant legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The NBV was established pursuant to s 65(1) of the Nurses Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It is a body corporate, and pursuant to s 65(2)(c) , it could sue and be sued in its own name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Pursuant to s 67 , the NBV consisted of 12 members nominated by the Minister and appointed by the Governor in Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The NBV's powers, functions and consultation requirements were generally set out in s 66 of the Nurses Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">As mentioned above, it had power to suspend the registration of a nurse during the conduct of an investigation into his or her professional conduct and to make a determination to place conditions on the registration of a nurse following a formal hearing: see respectively ss 25(1)(a) and 49 (2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">By operation of s 51 of the Nurses Act and s 21A of the Evidence Act 1958 (Vic), at a formal hearing, the members of an appointed panel had the same privileges and immunities in relation to their acts as if they were done in action in the Supreme Court of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Whilst s 66(3) of the Nurses Act provided that the NBV must consult with the Minister and have regard to her advice in carrying out its functions and exercising its powers, its decisions were its own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Given the application of s 21A of the Evidence Act 1958 (Vic), this is particularly the case when the NBV was acting in a formal hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">68 Ms Bahonko claimed the Minister had vicarious liability pursuant to s 18A of the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Section 18A relevantly provides:
 
 (1) Subject to subsection (2) if: 
 
 
 
 (a) an employee or agent of a person does an act in connection with his or her duties as an employee or agent; and 
 (b) the act would be unlawful under this Part if it were done by that person; 
 
 
 
 This Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act done by an employee or agent of a person if it is established that the person took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee or agent from doing the act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">
 

69 It was submitted by the Minister that this section is confined to the acts of agents and employees, and accordingly Ms Bahonko's claim that the Minister is vicariously liable for acts of the NBV is without any basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">It was submitted that the NBV is plainly not the employee or agent of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The Minister was not said, in the Nurses Act , to be the NBV's employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The fact that the Minister had certain statutory functions in relation to the NBV does not make her liable for the actions of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The Minister relied upon the decision of Weinberg J in Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA at [77] to [83] where he dismissed similar allegations against the Minister for Education and Training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">His Honour specifically stated that s 18A of the RDA was confined to the acts of agents and employees and that the RMIT was not an employee or agent of the Minister for Education and Training even though the RMIT too was a body corporate whose members were appointed by the relevant Minister and in relation to which that Minister had a number of statutory functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">70 Accordingly, the Minister submitted that the applicant had no reasonable prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Ms Bahonko's submissions 
 
71 Ms Bahonko submitted that her claims are meritorious and the matter ought to proceed to trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Ms Bahonko claimed the respondents have engaged in unlawful conduct contrary to the RDA, the DDA and the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">72 Ms Bahonko's primary claim was that the actions of the NBV in its decision to suspend her registration, investigate Ms Bahonko's alleged professional misconduct, and ultimately impose conditions on Ms Bahonko's nursing registration, were based on her race, descent, national or ethnic origin, political opinions and actions, religious beliefs and imputed disabilities and had the unlawful purpose or effect of nullifying her enjoyment of certain rights, and thus constituted unlawful discrimination under the RDA, DDA and HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">73 In particular, Ms Bahonko claimed that the conditions and restrictions imposed by the NBV on her registration as a nurse contravened s 9(1) and 9(1A) of the RDA in that she was subject to less favourable treatment on the basis of her "race".</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Ms Bahonko submitted that the meaning of "race" included an implied meaning of moral choice, values and consciousness, rather than referring to the colour of her skin or geographical origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">On this implied meaning, Ms Bahonko claimed the NBV and all other persons involved belong to a "master race" of "moral perversion", to which Ms Bahonko does not belong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Rather, it was submitted, Ms Bahonko belonged to the race with "the orientation to good and truth".</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">74 Ms Bahonko submitted that the NBV's treatment of the complaints made against Ms Bahonko, in particular its decision to suspend her registration whilst investigating the claims and subsequently impose conditions upon her registration was a manifestation of discrimination on the basis of Ms Bahonko not belonging to the "master race".</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">75 Ms Bahonko also claimed that the use of the language the NBV adopted in its written determination of 14 October 2004 demonstrated its perceived racial superiority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Ms Bahonko submitted that the Panel's use of the word "superiors" in that determination demonstrated discrimination against her, implying she was from an inferior race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">76 In support of her claim for racial discrimination, Ms Bahonko described the nature of the respondents' actions as "systematic, systemic and increasing in viciousness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">She submitted that the "moral perverts" have a "large and powerful Network of supporters in the most crucial social institutions; they have their own lawyers, Ministers and Government officials".</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">She submitted that the purposes of the alleged discriminatory acts of the respondents and other parties were to nullify her rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In this regard, she stated that the "nature of the [respondents'] actions is clearly racially motivated as it is longitudinal and has consequences of racial nullifications of me in all spheres of my life".</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">She submitted that the respondents and the State of Victoria engaged in their actions "to cover up for and protect the primary offenders from criminal accountability" in relation to the incident at Moorfields on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">She submitted that those offenders belong to the "master race", which is the same racial make-up as the Minister and the CEO of the NBV and the police officers involved in the incident on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">77 Ms Bahonko claimed that all the instances in which she has been involved are linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">As submitted by Ms Bahonko:
 
 The Respondents...took part in the commission of a larger, racially motivated crime and circle of violence initiated at the Uniting Church Aged Care facilities in 2003, culminating in a vicious assault and tortures at Moorfields on 6 May 2004 and carried out in a systematic and systemic way for over the last 2 years by the institutions and individuals, some of them under direct responsibilities of the Respondents in those matters (for example doctors and nurses).</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">

78 She further claimed the respondents placed "unreasonable demands and conditions" upon her professional practice and in her role as a registered nurse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">In particular, Ms Bahonko referred to the Moorfields policy of withholding medication or treatment in circumstances where a patient has so requested, which she claims is "inhumane".</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">79 She submitted that the NBV's handling of the investigation was in "bad faith and on behalf of the perpetrators with intentions to perverse the course of justice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">She claimed the NBV showed "extreme malice" and the investigation was "flawed and tinted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Ms Bahonko was particularly concerned with the NBV's willingness to accept the accuracy of all complaints made against her, despite her objections that the complaints made by Ms Riley were "vexatious, malicious, frivolous and fictitious".</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">She claimed that there was demonstrated bias in the NBV suspending only her registration and not the complainant's registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">80 Ms Bahonko also submitted that the NBV's subsequent handling of the matter and in particular, its conduct in these proceedings through its lawyers, strengthens the pattern of behaviour which is to unfairly discriminate against Ms Bahonko and deny her all rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In addition, she pointed to being denied in 2004 assistance under the Victims of Crime Assistance Act 1996 (Vic) and the hearing of an alleged assault in the Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">She alleged that the NBV and the Minister wilfully took part in the commission of crimes and their behaviour subsequent amounts to protection of the primary offenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">81 Ms Bahonko also claimed that the NBV (amongst others) contravened s 17 of the RDA by inciting acts that are unlawful under the RDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Ms Bahonko referred to the NBV "inciting judiciaries to psychological abuses in the face of the law".</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Ms Bahonko also referred to government solicitors interfering with all her proceedings, and claimed that such interference constitutes contempt of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Ms Bahonko submitted the VCAT proceedings were corrupted and that the actions of the Victorian Government Solicitors on behalf of the NBV in seeking to strike out the application was "fraudulent" and "highly discriminatory" and part of a pattern of behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">82 Ms Bahonko, in claiming that the NBV had engaged in a campaign of racial vilifications and defamations against the applicant, pointed to the following publications:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">A news article in the Herald Sun on 28 September 2004 which refers to Ms Bahonko's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The article was written by a VCAT reporter, and reported on the incident at Moorfields and the subsequent events leading to the suspension of Ms Bahonko's registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">There is no mention of Ms Bahonko's race, although the article does state her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">A notice to nurses agents sent by the CEO of the NBV, Ms Milne-Roch, explaining the NBV's handling of the complaint against Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The notice explains her registration was suspended until further hearing of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The June 2005 volume of 'Nexus', an NBV publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The publication contains an article referring to the NBV defending its right to investigate complaints and suspend a nurse's registration during the investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">It does not refer to Ms Bahonko by name, and there is no reference to her race or religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">

83 Ms Bahonko also claimed she had suffered discrimination under the DDA on the basis of an imputed disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Ms Bahonko alleged that Ms Riley told the police at the incident on 6 May 2004 that Ms Bahonko suffered from paranoia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Ms Bahonko claimed that due to that imputation, she has been denied work and consistently subjected to violence and threats of violence by the "Victorian Government's servants".</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Ms Bahonko relied upon ss 5 and 6 of the DDA, which defines direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of disability, including an imputed disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">84 Further, Ms Bahonko submitted that the actions of the NBV in these proceedings, in particular the bringing of its application on 20 December 2006 to appoint a guardian or administrator under s 66 of the Guardianship and Administration Act 1986 (Vic), contravened s 42 of the DDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Ms Bahonko claimed that the respondents that section, which prohibits victimisation, by subjecting Ms Bahonko to detriment on the grounds that she brought this proceeding under the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Ms Bahonko also relied upon s 122, which makes it unlawful to cause, instruct, induce, aid or permit a person to contravene s 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Ms Bahonko also complained of similar applications by the Victorian Government Solicitors in other proceedings involving Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">85 Whilst most references in Ms Bahonko's material were to "the respondents", there were some specific allegations made against the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Ms Bahonko claimed that the Minister was vicariously liable for the unlawful acts of the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">She claimed the Minister was responsible for the various assaults she was subjected to in the health care facilities in which she worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Ms Bahonko stated that the Minister was a "key official and a direct link between various offenders and perpetrators".</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">86 Ms Bahonko also made allegations of the Minister's purposes for alleged discriminatory acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Ms Bahonko claimed that due to the Minister's previous association with the Uniting Church, by implication the Minister was involved in promoting the Church's ideologies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Ms Bahonko specifically referred to her employ for seven years within the Uniting Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">She also referred to the Minister's role in appointing NBV officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">She claimed the Minister subscribes to the Uniting Church ideology, which is a different ideology to Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Ms Bahonko claimed, therefore, that the Minister has an "ideological and racial agenda" in relation to her and treated people from a different background as "slaves".</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">87 Ms Bahonko also submitted the effect of the Minister's policies included that her rights were "nullified", and she pointed to instances in which she was refused certain medical treatments and health services, and as a result, caused Ms Bahonko to suffer for two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">She claimed that the Minister had engaged in "unprecedented human rights abuses, racial vilifications, discrimination and all the possible criminal activities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">88 In her written submissions, filed with the leave of the Court after hearing, Ms Bahonko described in great detail the effects and consequences of the alleged discriminatory acts of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">In referring to a number of unfavourable decisions and incidents, and Ms Bahonko's current circumstances, it was submitted that the effects and consequences confirm that those actions are racially motivated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">She claimed that anything positive and to her benefit is consistently refused by the respondents and the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">89 Ms Bahonko also raised claims against the respondents under the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic) for alleged discrimination on the basis of impairment, political beliefs or activity, race and religious belief and activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Conclusions 
 Scope of the proceeding 
 
90 I accept the respondents' submissions that in so far as Ms Bahonko alleged that the respondents discriminated against her on the basis of her political opinions and religious beliefs, those claims are not within the jurisdiction of this Court in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Jurisdiction is not a mere technicality or matter of legal form to which s 46PR of the HREOC Act can apply: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA at 70 per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">91 As mentioned above, in relation to Ms Bahonko's complaint of discrimination on the grounds of religion and political opinions filed with the Commission, the Commission decided not to continue to inquire into the alleged acts or practices because, pursuant to s 32(3)(c)(ii), the allegations were lacking in substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The Commission stated that this aspect of the claim was finalised and if Ms Bahonko disagreed with its decision on this aspect, she may apply for review of the decision by this Court or the Federal Magistrates Court under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">No application before me on this basis was brought or pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The application before me is pursuant to s 46PO of the HREOC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">92 However, assuming in favour of Ms Bahonko that the descent and ethnic origin grounds are substantially the same as the race and disability grounds alleged in the complaint, it appears that the grounds set out in the application other than religious belief and political opinions are within the jurisdiction of the Court and the merits must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">93 I do not consider it appropriate to strike out those paragraphs of Ms Bahonko's material that goes beyond the decisions of the NBV on 24 May 2004 and 14 October 2004, for which the NBV contended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The argument was based on the requirement in s 46PO(3) that the unlawful discrimination alleged in an application in this Court must:
 
 &#8226; be the same as, or the same in substance as, the unlawful discrimination the subject of the terminated complaint; or 
 &#8226; arise out of the same, or substantially the same, acts or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">

94 Therefore, whilst the original complaint was somewhat limited in the incidents referred to, it may be that the additional material can assist in demonstrating a pattern of behaviour or practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">It is clear that one key aspect of Ms Bahonko's claims is that all the events are connected and demonstrate a web of discrimination and she attempts to draw conclusions about the specific decisions of the NBV the subject of the complaint by reference to other material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">95 In relation to Ms Bahonko's submissions on the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic), it must be noted that Ms Bahonko does not seek any relief in her application under that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Therefore, even if the Court had jurisdiction to hear a matter arising under that Act, no such matter arises in this proceeding against the NBV or the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">There is certainly no evidence that the procedures required to be followed in that Act were followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Ms Bahonko did not file a complaint with the Commission (as that term is defined in that Act) or that such complaint was referred to VCAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Further, and in any event, this Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Commission (as defined in that Act) or VCAT, which is properly the subject of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria: see s 148 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 (Vic); s 211 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic); and Scherbakova v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2000] FCA 1566 per Weinberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">96 Accordingly, I consider the complaints relevant to Ms Bahonko's application to extend time are those relating to discrimination on the basis of race, descent, ethnic origin and imputed disability under the RDA and the DDA, and I will consider these on the basis of all the material put forward concerning such discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The claims against the NBV 
 
97 In order to properly consider Ms Bahonko's claims, it is necessary to set out s 9 of the RDA, which prohibits unlawful racial discrimination in the following terms:
 
 It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">

98 Further, s 9(1A) of the RDA prohibits indirect racial discrimination by providing that certain conduct amounts to an act involving a distinction based on, or an act done by reason of, the other person's race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, as proscribed under s 9(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Section 9(1A) relevantly provides that the following conduct amounts to such an act:
 
 Where: 
 
 
 (a) a person requires another person to comply with a term, condition or requirement which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case; and 
 (b) the other person does not or cannot comply with the term, condition or requirement; and 
 (c) the requirement to comply has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, by persons of the same race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the other person, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">
 

99 At its highest, I take Ms Bahonko's allegation of direct discrimination under s 9(1) of the RDA to be that the acts of the NBV constituted by its: 
 
(a) decision to investigate the complaints made against Ms Bahonko,
 
 (b) decision to suspend Ms Bahonko's nursing registration pending the outcome of the investigation, and 

(c) decision to impose restrictions on Ms Bahonko's nursing registration,
 
were unlawful as such acts were based on her not belonging to the "master race" or "superior race", and had the requisite unlawful purpose or effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">100 I take Ms Bahonko's allegation of indirect racial discrimination to be that the NBV's decision to impose restrictions on Ms Bahonko's nursing registration constituted conduct described under s 9(1A) and was unlawful as such conduct had the requisite unlawful purpose or effect under s 9(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">101 Putting aside the correctness of Ms Bahonko's premise that "race" as provided for in the RDA includes a distinction between a so-called "master race" or "evil people" and those who do not belong to such a race, there is simply no evidence to suggest that the NBV's decision to investigate the complaints made against Ms Bahonko was done on the basis of her race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Section 22(1) of the Nurses Act required the NBV to investigate any complaint about the professional conduct of a registered nurse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Section 22(2) required the NBV to conduct a preliminary investigation in order to determine whether or not a formal hearing should be held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Whilst I understand that Ms Bahonko was displeased with the NBV's decision, there is no evidence to suggest that it was based upon race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In this regard, I agree with the Commission's decision to dismiss Ms Bahonko's claims, on the basis that she had "not provided any evidence to suggest that the [NBV] treated [Ms Bahonko] less favourably than it would have treated a person without [Ms Bahonko's] disability or who was of a different racial background about whom it had received complaints".</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">It is certainly not sufficient evidence of racial discrimination that Ms Bahonko is of a different "racial makeup" to members of the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">102 Furthermore, other than bald assertions, there is no evidence to suggest that the NBV's decision to suspend Ms Bahonko's registration was done on any unlawful discriminatory ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">As set out in the NBV's submissions, there is no doubt that the NBV had the power, under s 25 of the Nurses Act , to suspend the registration of a nurse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">There is no evidence to suggest that the exercise of that power was done for any reason outside the contemplated purposes of the Nurses Act , let alone for a discriminatory reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">There is nothing in the material to suggest that Ms Bahonko was treated less favourably than other nurses against whom investigations have been commenced although I note that it was the first time the NBV exercised the power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">However there is nothing to suggest that it was on the basis of Ms Bahonko's race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">103 Similarly in relation to Ms Bahonko's complaint against the NBV about its decision to impose conditions, there is no evidence that the decision was made on any unlawful discriminatory ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">As was submitted by the NBV, it had power under the Nurses Act to impose conditions on the registration of a nurse, and there is nothing to suggest that its decision to exercise that power was in any way an act done on the basis of Ms Bahonko's race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">On the contrary, the evidence suggests that, after holding a formal hearing into the complaints made against Ms Bahonko's professional conduct, the NBV-appointed Panel took an informed view, and made its decision on the basis of the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">The Panel gave reasons for accepting or rejecting certain evidence, and on a detailed review of its statements, I can find no basis for accepting Ms Bahonko's allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">104 In relation to the claim for indirect discrimination, the conditions imposed seem to be reasonable given the nature of the alleged professional misconduct, but in any event there is no evidence to suggest that in the circumstances, they were unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Further, there is no evidence that the conditions were made for the purpose or had the effect of impairing any of Ms Bahonko's enjoyment of certain rights compared with people of a different racial background upon whom the same restrictions or conditions were placed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The conditions were simply made on the basis of investigations into her professional conduct and do not single her out on the basis of her race.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">There is no credible claim on this basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">105 The NBV's findings against Ms Bahonko, whilst clearly unfavourable to her, are not on any proper view based upon her race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The findings of the NBV relate to her conduct professionally and in my view the NBV gave lawful reasons to justify its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">I find no warrant on the material before me to go behind these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">If there was some material other than bald assertions to suspect that the reasons given were not given bona fide or were not the true reasons for the decision, then the court would be entitled to form a view which is not constrained by these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">This is not the case before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">106 It is unnecessary for me to consider Ms Bahonko's numerous submissions about the alleged purposes and effects of the NBV's conduct, as she has not satisfied me on the first aspect of unlawful discrimination, that the NBV has done any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">In particular, I refer to Ms Bahonko's claims that the purposes of the NBV's conduct were to nullify her rights in all spheres of her life and cover up for alleged criminal conduct connected to the incident on 6 May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In any event, there is no foundation in the evidence to support Ms Bahonko's contention that the NBV and others were involved in a web of conduct to nullify all her rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">107 I should mention that I do not accept Ms Bahonko's claim that the NBV's use of the word "superiors" constitutes or evidences unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">There is no basis to support the view that the use of the term meant anything other than professional superiors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">That word is commonly used in a professional context to refer to a person's boss or manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">108 In relation to Ms Bahonko's claim under s 17 of the RDA, there is no evidential basis to support such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Section 17 provides:
 
 It is unlawful for a person: 
 
 
 (a) to incite the doing of an act that is unlawful by reason of a provision of this Part; or 
 (b) to assist or promote whether by financial assistance or otherwise the doing of such an act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">
 

109 To the extent that her claim relates to the NBV inciting or assisting others to do any unlawful acts, the claim is without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">There is no evidence to support such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The two publications to which Ms Bahonko referred that were published by the NBV, which I have set out above, do not provide any evidence that the NBV has contravened s 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The other article relied upon by Ms Bahonko was written by a VCAT reporter, who is not properly the subject of this claim and, in any event, cannot on any view fall within the ambit of s 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">110 To the extent that her claim relates to the NBV's solicitors inciting judiciaries to do unlawful acts, the claim is similarly without any evidential foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">There is no evidence, other than mere assertion, that the NBV's solicitors have incited the doing of any unlawful acts, and to suggest that their mere involvement in these proceedings constitutes a contravention of s 17 is not tenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">111 In relation to Ms Bahonko's claims of discrimination on the basis of disability, she made reference to ss 5 and 6 of the DDA which merely define direct and indirect discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">No basis was suggested leading to the conclusion that there was any unlawful discrimination, and other than general assertion, no evidence was adduced specifically in relation to any unlawful discrimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">112 Ms Bahonko's claim that the NBV contravened s 42 of the DDA is similarly without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Section 42(1) makes it an offence for a person to commit an act of victimisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Section 42(2) provides that a person is taken to have committed an act of victimisation against another person if the first-mentioned person subjects, or threatens to subject, the other person to any detriment on the ground that, relevantly, the other person has brought proceedings under the DDA or the HREOC Act against any person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">There is simply no evidence before me to support this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">It is not enough for Ms Bahonko to show that she has suffered detriment as a result of the guardianship applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">She must show the NBV caused, or threatened to cause, such detriment on the grounds that Ms Bahonko brought this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">There is no evidence which demonstrates such a causal connection on the part of the NBV and this claim is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">113 In view of the above reasons, I would not grant Ms Bahonko further time to institute the proceeding against the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">The claims against the Minister 
 
114 To the extent that the claims against the NBV relate to the claims against the Minister, my reasons set out above apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Further, to the extent that other matters are alleged against the Minister, the allegations involve no particularisation, and are put in wide and exaggerated terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">No evidence is properly adduced to support these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">115 Ms Bahonko also claimed that the Minister was vicariously liable under s 18A of the RDA for the conduct of the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">In so far as this claim depends upon establishing that the NBV was responsible for unlawful discrimination, the claim must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">As I have found that there is no evidence to support a claim that the conduct of the NBV amounts to unlawful discrimination, the Minister cannot be liable for anything the NBV did or did not do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">116 In any event, I accept the Minister's submissions that the Minister's role in relation to the NBV was limited, in the same way Weinberg J found the role of the Minister for Education and Training was limited in Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The Minister was not directly involved in the decisions and conduct of the NBV, but rather the NBV was constituted as a distinct and separate body under the Nurses Act and its decisions were its own.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">117 Further, and in any event, s 18A is confined to the acts of agents and employees which, as the Minister submitted, does not extend to the NBV, as the NBV is not an employee or agent of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">True it is that the Minister appoints NBV members, but this does not make the Minister liable for actions of the NBV in relation to investigating professional conduct of nurses and imposing conditions on nurses' registrations: see also Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at 78.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">118 Similarly, Ms Bahonko's claim that the Minister contravened s 122 of the DDA depended upon my finding that the NBV contravened s 42 of the DDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">On the basis of my finding above that there is no evidence to suggest that the NBV contravened s 42 , this claim is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">119 I accept the Minister's submissions that Ms Bahonko did not make any credible claim against the Minister, and refuse her application for an extension of time to bring proceedings against the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Claims against others persons 
 
120 In relation to the alleged discrimination of Ms Riley, Ms Turnbull and the police officers involved in the incident on 6 May 2004, I consider these allegations are misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">There is nothing to suggest that these people were employed by, servants of, or agents of, or "protected by", the NBV and accordingly their conduct is not properly the subject of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">There is no evidence that any of those persons' conduct was discriminatory, and in any event, such conduct occurred prior to and without the involvement of the NBV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Nor am I of the view that there is any evidence to suggest that the NBV or the Minister sanctioned the behaviour of Ms Turnbull and Ms Riley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">There is simply no evidence to support these allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">121 In relation to the claims against other people related to the NBV, in particular the NBV's solicitors and counsel, there is no evidence that any of these persons' conduct was unlawful under the RDA or the DDA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Other than a number of bald assertions and accusations, there is nothing to support her contention that there is a conspiracy between all persons involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">122 By way of example, Ms Bahonko pointed to the NBV's solicitors' application to strike out Ms Bahonko's claim in VCAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">By letter dated 30 July 2004 from Russell Kennedy on behalf of the NBV to Ms Bahonko, it was stated that the NBV applied to strike out Ms Bahonko's application in VCAT on the basis that it was misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">In particular, it was stated that, in their view "VCAT does not have jurisdiction to hear the application for review in this instance, as a decision of the Board to suspend registration is only reviewable by VCAT when the Board has not instituted an investigation within a reasonable time of having suspended the registration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">There is nothing in this correspondence or their actions to support the contention made by the applicant against the NBV's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Ms Bahonko has attempted to relate by mere assertion all incidents which do not go in her favour, and conclude that the behaviour is somehow orchestrated by the NBV on discriminatory grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">However there is no evidence to support the alleged links and no merit to these general allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">REMAINING ISSUES 
 
123 I deal now with some remaining issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Applications for summary dismissal 
 
124 On the basis of the view I have taken above in relation to the merits of the case, I would, had it been necessary to do so, summarily dismiss the proceedings pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Under this provision, the respondents do not need to show that the applicant's case is hopeless --- it is sufficient that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The lack of substantive material from Ms Bahonko, and the material provided by the NBV, demonstrates that there is no reasonable prospect of Ms Bahonko succeeding at trial either against the NBV or the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Abuse of process 
 
125 Further, and in any event, the application is an abuse of process, because it is foredoomed to fail: see Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Whilst Ms Bahonko is certainly aggrieved by a sequence of circumstances, I can find no basis to support any allegation of unlawful discrimination, and the respondents should not be further vexed by unjustifiable proceedings and forced to incur unnecessary costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Ms Saunders' conduct 
 
126 Ms Bahonko's claims against Ms Saunders' conduct at the directions hearing on 1 September 2006 before Ryan J are misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">There is no evidence to suggest that Ms Saunders has been involved in "deception/fraud" or "obstruction of justice, trickery, frauds, making false statements" on 1 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">There is nothing to suggest that the actions of Ms Saunders were taken other than in the interests of her client and in accordance with her duties to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Accordingly, the orders sought should not be made and the motion will be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Contempt of Court 
 
127 Ms Bahonko made allegations of contempt of this Court against the NBV, the Minister, the Victorian Government Solicitors, Russell Kennedy and Dr Entwisle by way of various motions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">She also filed a notice of motion dated 28 May 2007 with an accompanying statement of charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Her claims focused on their involvement generally in these proceedings, including the bringing of the summary dismissal applications, their management of the evidence in this proceeding, their perceived conflicts of interest, and their applications seeking to appoint a guardian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The crux of her submission was that their behaviour amounted to protection of the primary offenders, and was generally misleading to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">128 I can see no basis for making any such orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Ms Bahonko has failed to raise any clear allegation of contempt against the various persons, and Ms Bahonko has not sought to raise any contempt in the proper manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">The statement of charge accompanying her motion, notice of which is dated 28 May 2007, is inadequately particularised, vague and should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Further, the evidence before the Court does not disclose any proper basis for the Court of its own motion instituting contempt proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">Criminal jurisdiction 
 
129 As to the extension of the jurisdiction of this Court, I know of no basis upon which I can extend the jurisdiction of this Court to include criminal jurisdiction: see also Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 115 at [17] per Jessup J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Therefore, to the extent that application is made seeking to pursue such orders, it should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Constitutional matter 
 
130 The applicant gave notice pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) that this proceeding involved a constitutional matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">The relevant notice was given by Ms Bahonko to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and of the States, but none of the Attorneys-General made any submissions to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">131 The notice of a constitutional matter, filed with the Court on 17 May 2007, does not provide much indication of the nature of the alleged constitutional matter, save from mentioning s 117 of the Constitution .</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">In the notice, Ms Bahonko made a number of assertions, none of which amount to any proper issue arising under the Constitution or a matter involving its interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Instead, she rehearsed the facts and made a number of bald assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">There is simply no material to support any claim that any provision of the Constitution has been breached in the way asserted by Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Application for leave to appeal from the directions of Ryan J 
 
132 In view of my above conclusions, this issue is no longer of importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">However in view of the applicant's submissions on this question, I will deal with it independently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">133 The applicant's motion, notice of which was dated 3 October 2006, sought leave to apply out of time for leave to appeal from the interlocutory orders made by Ryan J setting a timetable for the filing of notices of motion for summary disposal of the proceedings by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Ms Bahonko submitted that such leave was given in her absence and ought to be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The complaint is not so much directed to the timetabling in itself, but in Ryan J giving leave for the application itself to be made by the respondents and it having been made in her absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">134 The orders made by Ryan J were in effect only timetabling directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">No leave was actually required to bring the applications in themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">His Honour was effectively setting down a time within which applications ought to be filed and served in accordance with case management principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Whilst the orders may be read as giving leave to bring the applications, the true purpose was to put a limitation upon the timing of their filing and serving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">No natural justice issue arises in these circumstances where in fact it is the respondents that have had a limitation placed upon them in which to bring their applications for summary dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">There is no basis to set aside the orders made by Ryan J, being orders made in the proper exercise of his discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">135 Further, contrary to Ms Bahonko's argument, it is not improper for a party to a proceeding to apply for summary judgment of a matter which, in their view, has no prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">This is a mechanism provided for in the Rules to protect the interests of defending parties in litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Accordingly, I would dismiss Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was given on 3 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Joinder of the State of Victoria 
 
136 Although Ms Bahonko's complaint to the Commission did name the "Victorian Government", the actual complaints focused on the NBV and the Minster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">In this proceeding, the specific complaints against the State of Victoria seem to be limited to general and broad allegations of involvement, at most by way of oversight of the alleged discriminatory conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">However, the evidence does not come close to establishing that the State of Victoria is a necessary or proper party to the proceedings, or that the State of Victoria (through the "Victorian Government") undertook the behaviour complained of by Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Joinder of this proceeding with proceeding number VID 828/06 
 
137 On the basis of my refusing leave to file out of time, an order of this sort seeking to join this proceeding with proceeding number VID 828/06 would be inappropriate and unnecessary in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">In any event, proceeding number VID 828/06 has now been finalised in this Court and a special leave application is apparently waiting to be heard by the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Accordingly, proceeding number VID 828/06 is no longer relevantly available to be joined with this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Urgent monetary relief 
 
138 Finally, in view of my conclusions, there is no basis to grant urgent or any monetary relief in the circumstances claimed by Ms Bahonko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">CONCLUSION 
 
139 In light of the reasons above, I would propose to order that the applicant's application for leave to file her application and claim out of time be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">All other motions of Ms Bahonko filed in this proceeding should also be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">I will hear the parties as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-nine (139) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.</sentence>
