 GENERAL 
 In these proceedings, Mr Les Murgha and Mr Stewart Harris, on behalf of the Combined Gunggandji People (the "Applicant") seek a determination of Native Title pursuant to s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the " Native Title Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application relates to land identified in a map which is attached to the application (the "claim area").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The claim area lies to the south of Cairns, borders Mission Bay and includes the Yarrabah township.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">There are numerous respondents including the State of Queensland (the State"), Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council (the "Council"), Ergon Energy Corporation Limited, Telstra Corporation Limited, Black and White (Quick Service) Taxis Pty Ltd, numerous fishermen and other parties including Mr Harry Blucher Ludwick ("Mr Ludwick").</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I am presently concerned with a claim by Mr Ludwick that he is entitled to a lease or licence to occupy part of the claim area ("Mr Ludwick's claim").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The question arises in these proceedings by virtue of the requirements of s 225(b) , (c) and (d) of the Native Title Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Council is the successor in title to councils having different names which have performed local government functions over the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In these reasons I will use the term "Council" to describe the body performing such functions from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It will not generally be necessary to identify the particular Council in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">At all relevant times a department of the Government of Queensland has been responsible for Aboriginal affairs and the administration of legislation dealing with that subject.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Over the years the name of that department has changed many times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In these reasons references to the "Department" should be so understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Ludwick's claim arises out of legislation concerning the occupation and use of Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Such legislation has been administered by another department, the name of which has also changed from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I will refer to that department as the "Lands Department" and to the relevant Minister as the "Minister for Lands".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The claim area is vested in the Council pursuant to a deed of grant in trust dated 27 October 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Mr Ludwick lives on a block of land (the "Bukki block") within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It is on Bukki Road at Bukki, near Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The block is about four and half acres in size and is marked on an aerial photograph which is exhibit HBL 2 to Mr Ludwick's affidavit filed on 7 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Ludwick is not a member of the Combined Gunggandji People as defined in the application and does not claim to be a traditional owner of any part of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He claims to be entitled pursuant to statute to a lease of the Bukki block or to a licence to occupy it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">At one stage he also claimed an equitable licence to occupy the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">That claim was not pursued at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In these reasons I consider the validity of Mr Ludwick's statutory claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">His primary claim is to a lease pursuant to s 361A of the Land Act 1962 (Qld) (the "Land Act 1962") which provides: 
 Ownership of improvement not affected by grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">

 
 (1) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister [for Lands] and the trustees of land granted in trust [the Council] that at the date of issue of the Deed of Grant evidencing the grant any improvement on the land was owned by any person, that ownership shall not be prejudiced by the grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">

 
 (2) The person shown to own such improvement shall be entitled to the grant by the trustees of a lease that accords with the provisions of this Division of-
 (a) the land on which the improvement stands; and
 (b) where the improvement is a building or structure used as a residence or for business or in connexion with educational or religious purposes, a reasonable area of land being the immediate environs of the improvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">

 
 (3) Where in a case to which subsections (1) and (2) apply application is made to the Minister [for Lands] for his approval of the lease pursuant to section 343 it is not competent to the Minister [for Lands] to refuse the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">

 At a later stage I will say something about the history of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Alternatively, Mr Ludwick claims a licence pursuant to s 452A of the Land Act 1994 (Qld) (the " Land Act 1994 ") which provides: 
 Land granted for Aboriginal or Islander inhabitants 

 
 (1) Any person who, at the time when land was granted in trust under the repealed Act for the benefit of Aboriginal or Islander inhabitants, occupies any building or structure as the person's residence, as an authorised resident on the land, shall, notwithstanding the grant in trust, be entitled to continue the person's occupation of the building or structure upon the same terms and conditions as the person occupied it at the time of the grant until-
 (a) the trustee of the land determines otherwise and terminates the person's right to occupy the building or structure; or
 (b) the trustee of the land and that person agree to new terms and conditions for the person's occupation of the building or structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

 
 (2) No permit, claim, licence or lease under the Mineral Resources Act 1989 is to be granted or exist in respect of land granted in trust under the repealed Act for the benefit of Aboriginal or Islander inhabitants unless the approval of the Governor in Council thereto has first been obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

 
 (3) In considering whether or not to approve a permit, claim, licence or lease in respect of land referred to in subsection (1) the Governor in Council shall have regard to the views of and any recommendation made by the trustee of the land in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">

 MR LUDWICK'S HISTORY 
 Mr Ludwick was born on 29 November 1928 near Mt Surprise in this State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He says that he has always identified as an Aboriginal person and has been accepted as such by the Yarrabah community and every other Aboriginal community in which he has lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr Ludwick married Amanda Harris on 20 June 1952.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They had two children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">They separated in the late 1950s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">One of their children, Harry John Ludwick ("Harry Jnr"), now lives on a block of land adjacent to the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">After separating from his wife Mr Ludwick entered into a de facto relationship with Irene Gibson, which relationship lasted for about 17 or 18 years and yielded six children, including a son ("Harold").</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">For more than 20 Years Mr Ludwick has lived with Patricia Dianna Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">There are no children of the relationship, but Ms Yeatman has children from a previous relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Mr Ludwick was about ten years old when he went with his mother and other family members to live in Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">They had previously lived in Dimbulah at Eureka Creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The family moved because Mr Ludwick's father had gone to the War.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Ludwick did not see him again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">At that time Yarrabah was run by the Church of England as a mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Girls and boys were accommodated in separate dormitories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Children were separated from their mothers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Brothers were separated from sisters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr Ludwick believes that his mother died whilst he was living in the boys' dormitory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He lived there until he was about 14 and then was put to work on a mission farm at Oombunghi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">His first job away from Yarrabah was as a stockman on Gunnawarra Station near Mt Garrett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">He was there for about a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He then went cutting cane at Gordonvale, which was closer to Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">He also worked at a sawmill at Mareeba.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">During the relevant seasons he lived in barracks provided on site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">He also worked as a drover at Bessells Station near Georgetown and at Gilbert River Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">He cannot remember all of his employment history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">About a year before he married Ms Harris he became head stockman for the Yarrabah mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The mission kept its own beef cattle for feeding the people at the mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It also had horses and a bullock team for hauling logs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">At that time the livestock was kept at Oombunghi, a farming area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Because the cattle were breaking down fences to get at the vegetables, those conducting the mission decided to move the stock to Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Ludwick went with them and lived there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">At that time there were about 10 or 11 houses in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It had been part of the mission settlement but had been abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">There was a small sulky track near the houses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">At that time the only access was by horse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">When Mr Ludwick first moved to Bukki he lived on a block of land (the "original block") which was on the opposite side of the creek from the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In those days it was not necessary to obtain permission to live anywhere on the mission or to build a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Two men who were working with Mr Ludwick helped him to build a house on the original block, using bush materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Ludwick also planted a small garden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He was too busy to have a more extensive garden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The land on the other side of the creek (including the Bukki block) was used as a large holding paddock for horses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Mr Ludwick built a stockyard within that horse paddock for use in branding and dipping cattle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He built the stockyard in the same year as the first jet aircraft flew into Cairns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He remembers hearing the roar whilst he was fencing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Other evidence suggests that the first jet aircraft flew into Cairns in the mid-1960s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Mr Ludwick and his wife resided together on the original block and were there when both of their children were born.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It was on the opposite side of the creek from the mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">When the creek was in flood, there was no access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">For this reason Mr Ludwick decided to move to the other side of the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">At that time the two children were living with Mr Ludwick's mother-in-law in the mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">They visited their parents from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">When Mr Ludwick was about 28 or 29 years old he received a letter from the Director of the Department advising him that he was entitled to claim the original block and that, "no one would move me off it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">At that time the Church was still running the mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">He had not spoken to anybody about living on the original block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He was surprised to receive the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Whilst he was living with Ms Harris they moved onto the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The house on the original block was falling down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">They pitched a tent on the Bukki block and lived there whilst they cleared it with the intention of building another house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">By that time the government had taken over the mission from the Church and was destroying the stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The stockyard was no longer in use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Mr Ludwick was no longer the head stockman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It took about five months to clear the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He also levelled it, planted lawn and cleared old fences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Before he commenced to build a house on the Bukki block, his wife left him and moved back to the mission to live with her parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Shortly after his wife left, Mr Ludwick laid a concrete slab and built two small sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He accepts that an aerial photograph taken in about 1968 does not show the sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He accepts that they must have been built after that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr Ludwick continued to live on the Bukki block for about six months after his wife's departure, and then went elsewhere to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">He did not intend to leave for long and always intended to return to live on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">He worked in Malanda for about 18 months and then returned to the Bukki block for a short time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He obtained other employment with the Main Roads Department at Mt Molloy on the road to Cooktown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Whilst he was so employed he met Irene Gibson who was living at the Hopevale Mission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">They became attached to each other, although he was still married to his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This seems to have caused some difficulty in the Hopevale Mission, but that is not relevant for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Subsequently, he and Ms Gibson moved to Alice Springs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He was employed in loading and unloading trains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Whilst residing in the Northern Territory, they had a son who died when he was about four years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Ms Gibson returned to Malanda where her sister and brother-in-law were living.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Mr Ludwick stayed in the Northern Territory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He and Ms Gibson had been together for about 15 years, during which time they had six children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Their last child was born in 1975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">They had lived in Alice Springs and Larrimah in the Northern Territory and Malanda and Hopevale in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">At no time did they live on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Ludwick would visit it for a few days at a time, especially when they were living at Malanda.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">He was never absent from it for more than about eighteen months to two years at a time, and always intended to return eventually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">After separating from Ms Gibson, Mr Ludwick returned to Yarrabah, intending to live there permanently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This was in about 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Yarrabah was then run by the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">At a Council meeting held on 4 September 1980, a motion was passed "granting" permanent residency to Mr Ludwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It seems that such decision had no real effect other than as an indication of willingness to accept Mr Ludwick as a resident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">In a letter to the Director of the Department dated 15 October 1980 the Manager at Yarrabah advised that Mr Ludwick had applied for residency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">It was said that he was living with his brother (Arthur Ludwick) at Yarrabah, unemployed, separated and with no dependants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">There was no objection to the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The permit was subsequently issued by the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mr Ludwick considers that he would not have lived with his brother for very long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">They would not have got on well together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">His brother was then living with his wife (Ruby) near the police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He stayed with them from time to time, but only for a couple of days at a time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Arthur died some years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Ludwick said that if he had not built the sheds at Bukki before his departure for Malanda, then he built them shortly after his return, probably in 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">He lived in one shed and stored his property in the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He bought the sheds in Cairns and erected them on the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He transported them from Cairns in his sister's utility vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">There was no proper road at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">He subsequently planted a vegetable garden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">A couple of years after building the small sheds he expanded the concrete slab and built a larger shed over the top of the other two with the aim of increasing the size of the living area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Initially, he did not fully enclose the larger shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It was just a roof mounted on posts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">At about that time he also built a fence around the whole block using bush timber and wire which he had purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The fence is still there, although he has, from time to time, replaced posts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Mr Ludwick was happy living at Bukki but also enjoyed camping trips when he would fish and catch crabs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">During the crabbing season he would go away for a few weeks at a time, build a humpy on the beach and go fishing and crabbing every day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">At some stage he asked his son and daughter-in-law to look after the Bukki block whilst he was away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">On one of his crabbing trips he met Ms Yeatman, probably in about 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">She wanted to live at Bilma near the beach, and so he stayed with her there for some time, frequently returning to check on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Ms Yeatman built a house at Bilma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">After about two or three years they moved to the Bukki block and have lived there ever since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Ms Yeatman gave the Bilma house to her son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Ludwick and Ms Yeatman made improvements on the Bukki block, working on it every day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Over about two years they: Everything was done by hand, using materials which they had purchased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">They worked constantly on the block in order to maintain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">During a cyclone a large branch from a mango tree fell on the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Mr Ludwick rebuilt the damaged part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In either 2002 or 2003 the Council installed a septic tank system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It was supplied at Council expense and installed by workers from the Community Development Employment Programme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Quite recently Mr Ludwick and Ms Yeatman built a guest cottage on the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Mr Ludwick said that when he built his house, he believed that he could remain on the Bukki block "forever".</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">He said that Yarrabah people had been doing so for years, even after the government took over the mission from the Church.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">He said that the Council knew that he was building his house and other structures on the Bukki block and did not stop him, or tell him that he could not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">He bought cement from the Council for his work on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The Council upgraded the road, installed the septic tank and provided him with a refuse bin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">He has not received any letters or notices from the Council or anybody else, concerning his occupation of the Bukki block, save for notice of the Applicant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Soon after he received such notice Mr Schreiber (the Council chairman) came to see him and said: 
 You and Alfie and anyone else who has made headway are going to remain on their blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Don't let anyone move you off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">You don't shift for nobody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">

 The reference to "Alfie" was to Mr Ludwick's brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Mr Fourmile, apparently another a person having some position in the Council, also told him "Don't you move off the land".</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">At a town meeting there was discussion concerning the location of Mr Ludwick's front fence (which was too near the road).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">He was also told not to plant too near to the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">At one stage, a long time after he went to live on the Bukki block, a young man called Chris Burns came to the block and told Mr Ludwick that his grandfather (Peter Burns) had bought it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Mr Peter Burns had been a carpenter at Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">He had passed away prior to Chris Burns' visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr Ludwick told him that nobody could buy land from the government because it was reserved for residents of Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Mr Burns left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Mr Ludwick has not heard from him again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In a letter dated 4 March 1981, apparently from Mr Ludwick, to Mr Kilhoran (sic) at the Department, there was reference to an application for a 15 acre block at "Bucky".</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The writer asserted that a majority of members of the Council had supported the application, but it had, nonetheless, been refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The writer sought Mr Killoran's intervention in connection with the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Ludwick has no recollection of ever having made such an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">He says that the letter is not in his handwriting but concedes that the signature appears to be his.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The Department responded on 5 March 1981, indicating that enquiries were being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">An extract from Council minutes of a meeting held on 8 April 1981 is as follows: 
 On the motion of Cr. P. Neal, seconded by Cr. V. Schrieber, Mr. Harry Ludwick Jnr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">was granted permission to use about 10 acres of land on the Bucki [sic] Road towards Judu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">

 
 The non-perennial creek after Bucki [sic] Creek would act as the boundary between Colin Neal's property and that given to Harry Ludwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Harry's property would be on the same side of the road as that belonging to Ernie Bounghi and Colin Neal --- All in favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">

 Mr Ludwick says that he would normally understand the reference to "Harry Jnr" to be a reference to his eldest son (Harry John) who has a block of land at Bukki, adjacent to the Bukki block and on the opposite side of the road to that owned by Mr Bounghi.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Mr Ludwick's son, Harold is never called Harry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">On 2 June 1981 the Yarrabah Manager (SA O'Connor) wrote to the Director of the Department (probably Mr Killoran) "Re: Land Application by Mr A. Ludwick", as follows: 
 In reply to your letter of 26 th May 1981 I can now advise that Council has given permission for Mr A. Ludwick and his brother to use land in the "Bucky" [sic] area for small crop farming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I understand that a camp has been established on the area and a start has been made on the farming enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">

 
 A request by Mr Ludwick for assistance with clearing has been denied by this office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">However, it has been agreed that logs for the sawmill will be taken from the area in the near future and this will have the effect of providing access to the camp site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">

 
 Mr. Ludwick has been advised that he can make application for a special lease of the area however to date he has made no approach in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">

 
 I will advise if there are any further developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

 Mr Ludwick had two brothers (Arthur and Alf).</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Arthur lived in the Yarrabah township but never at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">He died a few years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">His brother, Alf, has a block at Bukki, but it is only about five acres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">A letter dated 15 June 1981 from the Director of the Department (probably Mr Killoran) to "Mr. H.B. Ludwick c/- Post Office Box 97, EDMONTON" states: 
 I refer further to my letter of 5 th March, relative to the use of land in the 'Bucky' area and am advised that the Council has granted approval for Mr A Ludwick and his brother to use an area of land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">

 
 Mr. Ludwick has been given appropriate advice and guidance by the Manager, Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">

 
Mr Ludwick said that he had received mail at Edmonton, but not after he returned to live at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">In minutes of a Council meeting held on 28 July 1982, under the heading "Correspondence Inward", there is reference to an item, "Harry Ludwick re housing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Mr Ludwick is unable to explain this item.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He says that it might refer to his son, Harry Jnr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">A letter from the Executive Officer at Yarrabah to the Department dated 4 March 1985, headed "Long Service Leave Entitlement --- HARRY LUDWICK" states: 
 The above person commenced duties as a carpenter with our department at Yarrabah on 17 th May 1973.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">

 
 Mr Ludwick's services have been continuous and meritorious and it is recommended that he be granted long service leave as from the 17 th May 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">

 
Mr Ludwick says that this must be a reference to his son, Harry Jnr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">A letter dated 16 December 1985 to the Executive Officer at Yarrabah from the Department refers to "Tenancy agreement for Harry Ludwick".</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Mr Ludwick says that he has never had a tenancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The reference may be to his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">On 21 April 1987 an application by Harry Ludwick and Harold Ludwick was lodged with the Council for its approval "that a lease be granted" over unidentified land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The applicants' dates of birth are shown as 29 November 1928 and 9 May 1969.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Mr Ludwick says that one signature looks like his, although he usually includes his middle initial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">He does not believe that he ever made such an application and does not understand why there would be an application in the name of Harold (his son), given that he has never lived at Yarrabah and has never wanted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">He is married and lives in Hopevale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">On 7 July 1992 the Council received a letter, purportedly from "Mr Harry Ludwick Snr, Buckee [sic] Road, Buckee [sic]" as follows: 
 I am writing to apply for the Position of Caretaker at Clarkie's [sic] Camp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">And if the council agrees with the request, I would like to sign my land at Buckee [sic] over to my sister Eileen and her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">

 
 Yours sincerely 

 
 Harry B Ludwick/Eileen C Ludwick 

 
 this was already explained to the Chairman the reason why I want's [sic] to move from here because Harry Jnr is moving next door &amp; each time his mother (Amanda) get's [sic] drunk she come down &amp; cause's [sic] trouble with us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">

 
Mr Ludwick says that he has never seen this letter and does not believe that he signed it or sent it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">His sister Eileen has never wanted to move on to the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There is a reply from the Council dated 14 July 1992 and addressed to Harry Ludwick as follows: Re: Land Lease 

 
 Your letter regarding your request to hand over the land at Bucky [sic] to your sister Ms Eileen Ludwick was discussed at the Councils Ordinary Meeting on 9th July, 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">

 
 Please be advised that Council cannot grant your sister this land as she does not qualify to be a resident of this Community (you must reside in Yarrabah trust area continuously for 6 months before you are considered resident).</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">

 
 In regards to your request to be a caretaker at Clarkes Camp, Council has stated that this area is set aside for recreational purposes for all community residents to utilize and that the community based Rangers are responsible for the patrolling of this area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">

 
 Council however thanks you for your interest and concern for the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">

 Mr Ludwick has no recollection of receiving this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However it suggests that the Council recognized Mr Ludwick's occupation of the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The documents to which I have referred were presumably supplied to Mr Ludwick's legal advisers by the State or the Council in the course of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">At a later stage the State produced further documents which are exhibited to the affidavit of Margaret Jean Reid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Ms Reid is employed by the Department of Communities as a senior policy officer, with responsibility for keeping the records relating to indigenous policy and administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Since August 2006 she has been involved in researching the files created by the various departments which have had responsibility for Aboriginal affairs since 1898, including litigation concerning the Yarrabah area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">She has searched for documents relevant to this matter but was unable to find any letter of the kind referred to by Mr Blucher in para 35 of his affidavit (received when he was 28 or 29 years of age and concerning his entitlement to the original block).</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">There is a note on the file dated 28 March 1981 headed: 
 Arthur Ludwick 
 Land Harry Ludwick 
 Re Land at Buckie [sic] 

 It is a little difficult to read but seems to say: 
 Percy Neal said would take him out &amp; stake the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Neal building a house at Bucky [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Co-op.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">claiming land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Near distributing land at Bucky [sic] among their own people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">No one else there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">One of white staff came ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Shook up a chap ... 

 In a letter dated 10 April 1981 to the Chairman (Mr Neal) the Director of the Department wrote: 
 I refer further to our discussion following on a telephone conversation with me by Mr. A. Ludwick of Yarrabah relative to land at 'Bukky' [sic].</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">

 
 It is regretted that opportunity did not offer for you to have a further talk with me before you went north and I write now to ask that you and the Council discuss with Mr. Ludwick and the Manager the overall position so that his request for land can receive proper consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">

 In a further letter from the Department dated 26 May 1981 to the Manager at Yarrabah it was said that: 
 I would appreciate advice of any developments relative to application by Mr. A. Ludwick in regard to land at "Bucky" [sic] as conveyed the Chairman on 10 th April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">

 There is a letter from Mr Ludwick to Dr Jan Walker at the Department dated 7 July 1994 in which he sets out his personal history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The purpose of the letter seems to have been to inquire as to whether there were "funds" to which he and Ms Yeatman were entitled, presumably funds paid by way of wages and held in trust pursuant to former government arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">I am, to some extent, relying on personal knowledge rather than evidence in so speculating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The letter shows that from 1943 to 1946 Mr Ludwick worked for canefarmers at Lucinda and from 1947 to 1948 at Gunnawarra Station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">From 1948 to 1952 he did station work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">He returned to Yarrabah at the end of 1952 but left again to work elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">One aerial photograph shows the two sheds on the Bukki block in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Another aerial photograph, taken in 2002, shows the Bukki block, with the boundary marked in red.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">There are also a number of photographs taken on the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">They show an attractive tropical environment, well maintained and with substantial planting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The buildings are not of high quality but appear to be sturdy enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">At the request of the parties I visited the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The photographs provide a reasonably accurate impression of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In his cross examination Mr Ludwick agreed that the sheds on the land were first erected after the opening of the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Prior to that time goods were brought to Yarrabah by barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">This suggests that the huts were built somewhat later than Mr Ludwick suggested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It was suggested to him that the road was opened in 1972.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Other evidence suggests that a rough road was built in 1966 or 1967.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">He seemed to agree with the suggestion that he had laid the concrete bases for the sheds in the early 1980s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">However other evidence suggests an earlier date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">He said that when he returned to Bukki in the early 1980s some of the old fencing was still standing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">He removed it all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">He agreed that he lived at Bilma with Ms Yeatman from 1986 or 1987 until 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">In his cross-examination he seemed to agree that whilst at Bilma he had been preparing the Bukki block in the expectation that they would live there (TS 110 ll 35-36), and that they had planned that "our" son (presumably Ms Yeatman's son) move into the Bilma house (TS 110 ll 25-26).</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Before meeting Ms Yeatman he had cleared an area in front of the existing house but not behind it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">On the right hand side, looking from the road, he had cleared to the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">He is not sure as to when he planted the vegetable garden but thought that it may have been after he returned with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">He gave inconclusive evidence concerning the erection of new fences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">There was a fence which followed the road as far as the creek and another fence to the left of the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">This was built some time after 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">He agreed that much of the fencing was probably constructed after he returned with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The premises required substantial work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">He and Ms Yeatman lived there whilst they were doing that work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Some of the planting in the lower land on the block (to the left of the house) was done after he returned with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He also agreed that fruit trees on the land were planted after 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He said that whilst he was at Bilma he returned to the Bukki block about once every three or four weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">However he did not stay on the block during such visits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">Mr Ludwick gave further evidence-in-chief, largely relevant to the area of land to which he might be entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">He said that in about 2004, reticulated water was installed on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Prior to such installation he had taken water from the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Before the installation of the septic tank there had been a pit toilet, located about 20 feet from the corner of the house and away from the road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">Mr Ludwick built it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">He also said that he had grown vegetables and fruit for his own consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">At one stage he had kept goats for meat, but that had been unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">He kept chickens for their eggs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">He needed the generator to provide electricity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">It would have been unsafe and uncomfortable to install it in the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">For this reason he built the generator shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The house was located so as to avoid damage from falling timber.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">He has never fished in the creek but has seen other people doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">He uses coconuts from coconut trees on the land for eating and also as chicken feed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">The area to the left of the house cannot be used for agriculture because water accumulates there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Initially, access to Yarrabah was by horse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">For that reason he kept horses on the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">I consider Mr Ludwick to be an honest, and generally reliable, witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It is likely and understandable that time has dulled his memory as to some matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I did not form the impression that he was seeking to strengthen his case by exaggeration or misrepresentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">I suspect that the Department and the Council have, on occasions, confused him with one or more of his brothers and sons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">That does not detract from his claim to the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Some documentary evidence gives general support to his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">I refer in particular to the Council letter of 14 July 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">OTHER EVIDENCE 
 Ms Yeatman said that when she first met Mr Ludwick at Yarrabah beach he told her that he had a block of land and a house at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">He wanted her to live with him there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">However she wanted to live at the beach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">They lived there for some time but were eventually told by "tribal people" (presumably members of the claim group) that they were no longer allowed to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Ms Yeatman obtained some land at Bilma where she and Mr Ludwick built a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">They lived there for a couple of years and then moved to the Bukki block so that her younger son could move into the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Ms Yeatman thinks that they have been together for more than 20 years, and that they moved to Bukki in about 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">When she arrived there, the big shed had been built with the two smaller sheds beneath it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">A fence had been erected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Whilst they were at Bilma, Mr Ludwick visited Bukki from time to time to check on the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">He did not suggest that he was performing any major building work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Hence Ms Yeatman understood that the improvements which she saw on the property when she first arrived had been built prior to her meeting Mr Ludwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">After moving to the Bukki block, they enclosed the big shed and then removed the two small sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">The big shed is now their home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Within the first year or two they added a verandah and started building separate sheds for use as a carport, a boatshed and a generator shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">They subsequently built a cottage for guests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">They planted fruit trees and other gardens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">They purchased their cement from the Council and made it clear that they were using it to build on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">About four years before the date of her affidavit (4 March 2008) the septic tank was installed by the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Mr Ludwick's eldest son, Harry Jnr, was born in Cairns on 22 November 1952 and raised by his mother, Amanda Harris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">She died on 9 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">He is married and has lived in Yarrabah for all of his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">He is now living at Bukki, next to the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">He has always understood that when he was very young, he lived with his mother and father on a block of land at Bukki, on the other side of the creek from the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">He recalls that when he was about 13 or 14 years old, in about 1966, his father started to take an interest in the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In those days he was "coming and going from Yarrabah".</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">He recalls that in about 1974, the two small sheds were erected side by side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Harry Jnr was then working as a carpenter for the Department of Community Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The head carpenter lent him a concrete mixer for his father's use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The land had already been cleared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">A vegetable patch had been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">I accept this evidence as offering the most reliable indication of when the sheds were built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Mr Ludwick's evidence was clearly unreliable on this score.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Harry Jnr said that his father had been living away from Yarrabah, but returned at about the time that his son was born on 21 March 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">Whilst his father was away Harry Jnr and his wife used the Bukki block for weekends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">After his father returned to Yarrabah in about 1981, he lived at Bilma for some time and then built a big shed over the top of the two small sheds and removed the two small sheds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">If Mr Ludwick lived at Bilma in the early 1980s, it must have been some years prior to his residing there with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The big shed had been built by about 1992 when Harry Jnr came from Mourigan to live at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Darryl Ralph Pollard was born on 12 June 1961 and moved to Yarrabah with his parents in October 1976.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">On 13 April 1985 he married Eileen, one of Ms Yeatman's daughters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">They have six children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He has resided continuously at Yarrabah since 1976, save for a period from September 1994 to December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">During that period he and his family lived at Kowanyama, nearer to his work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">However he returned frequently to Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">In about 1984 Mr Pollard applied to the Yarrabah Shire Council for a lease over land at Buddabadoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">In 1986 he and his wife decided to build a home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">They decided that the Buddabadoo block was too far away from town, and that they would prefer to live at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Towards the end of 1986 they applied to the Council for a lease over land at Bukki, indicating that they no longer wished to apply for land at Buddabadoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">They said that they had spoken to Peter and Willy Yeatman (who had previously claimed the Bukki land).</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Messrs Yeatman had said that they did not wish to maintain their claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">The Council stamp shows that Mr Pollard's letter and a sketch of the land claimed at Bukki were received on 2 November 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Mr Pollard asserts that he delivered the letter to the Council in the second half of 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">They built the house in early 1987 and took up residence in mid-1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">On 1 April 1987 Mr Pollard attended at the Council office to complete a Form 1 application for lease which is exhibited to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">It is dated 1 April 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">Mr Pollard remembers Mr Ludwick building a small shed on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">This was well before he and his wife moved to Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">It may have been in the late 1970s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">When Mr Pollard and his wife claimed their block in 1986 or 1987, the small shed was still on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">A roof structure had been built over it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The block was fenced, and there were several fruit trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">At the time, Mr Ludwick was living at Bilma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">His niece (Alberta Gibson) was living in the small shed on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">She was there for about a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Elaine Marina Pollard, has sworn an affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">She recalls there being two small sheds under the roof structure on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">She does not recall when her mother and Mr Ludwick actually commenced living there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Roy Alfred Gray was born in Cairns on 3 October 1944 and has lived at Yarrabah for most of his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">His only period of absence was from 1963 to 1979.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">He was elected to the Council in about 1980 and was a member until some time after it received the deed of grant in trust over the land (27 October, 1986).</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">He served as chairman and as deputy chairman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">He understood that prior to the deed of grant in trust, the Council had the legal authority to make decisions, with the guidance of the Manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">When he was first elected to the Council some Yarrabah residents had already moved on to blocks at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">There were sharefarmers on Back Beach Road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Before and during his time on the Council, articles appeared in the Cairns Post concerning the grant of ownership of Aboriginal reserves to Aboriginal councils.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">He remembers Mr Ludwick building at Bukki on one or two different sites and believes that he had the necessary permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The Applicant has filed two affidavits, one by Howard Hardy Lloyd Patterson and the other by Robert Lawrence Sands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Mr Patterson said that he was raised at Yarrabah and has lived there all his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">He said that in 1983 he went to Hopevale with Irene Gibson's nephew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">At that time Irene was living at Hopevale with Mr Ludwick and a number of children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">On that basis he asserts that Mr Ludwick was not living in Yarrabah in 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Mr Sands was born in Cairns on 10 October 1945 and raised in Yarrabah, living there until 1970.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">He is a Gunggandji elder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Yarrabah is his traditional country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Many of his family still reside there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">When he was 18, he qualified as a barge captain and ran the barge from Cairns to Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">In those days the barge was the only means of bringing materials into Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">He left Yarrabah in 1970 to work on Palm Island where he remained for about two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">He returned to Cairns in 1972 and was employed by the Cairns City Council until approximately 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">In February 1985 he commenced a course at the Kangaroo Point College of Technical and Further Education in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">This lasted for about two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">At the end of 1986 the Queensland Government employed him as a clerk at Kowanyama.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">He remained there until 1992 and then returned to Yarrabah as Chief Executive Officer of the Council, a position which he held for about two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">He then worked at Kowanyama until 2006, returning to Yarrabah, again to take employment there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Whilst he was in Kowanyama he returned to Yarrabah as often as he could, including over holiday periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">He believes that jet aircraft first flew to Cairns in the mid-1960s.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">It was not until 1966 or 1967 that there was a rough dirt road to Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Prior to that time the only way of bringing materials into Yarrabah was by barge or boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Little cement was available in Yarrabah prior to the road being established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Initially, it was a rough dirt road, not easy to traverse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">As to Mr Ludwick's assertion that he used his sister's utility to bring materials from Cairns, Mr Sands says that Mr Ludwick's sister was living outside of Yarrabah.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">In relation to para 85 of Mr Ludwick's affidavit (concerning the visit by Chris Burns), Mr Sands refers to an incident in which a girl related to the Harris family was killed and says that this event occurred near the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">I do not understand the significance of this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">He asserts that Mr Stephen Schreiber and Mr Vincent Schreiber were both Gunggandji men but that neither, acting alone, had authority under traditional law and custom to make decisions binding on Gunggandji people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Such decisions had to be made by elders and senior Gunggandji people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Mr Sands said in oral evidence-in-chief that he had fished in the creek when he was growing up as a child, setting eel traps during periods of extra high tide and during wet weather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">There were also yellow belly fish in the creek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">The area contained black palm trees which were harvested to make spear heads and other weapons The State relies upon a number of affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">The first is by Shane Arthur O'Connor who was employed by the Department for approximately 26 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">He worked at senior management level on every State-controlled Aboriginal community and in every regional office of the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">At one stage he was Assistant Under-Secretary, based in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Between December 1976 and January 1982 he was Manager at Yarrabah and had approximately 20 staff and a large Aboriginal workforce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">He said that the State took over control of the mission from the Church of England in 1960.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The manager of the Yarrabah reserve reported directly to the Director of the Department in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Mr O'Connor remembered members of the Ludwick family but did not specifically remember Mr Ludwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Whilst he was at Yarrabah the area at Bukki was accessible by road.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">However, when the creek flooded, communications and access were severely inhibited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">This influenced the Department's assessment of the suitability of the area for residential development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">He does not recall there being evidence of earlier housing in the area, but there were numerous squatters' camps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">They were not formally sanctioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">The presence of such residents was tolerated unless special circumstances required their relocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">If a person wished to reside on a reserve it was necessary to obtain a permit, theoretically before the person commenced such residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Frequently people would make application after arrival.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Local Councils could not grant such permits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The manager would seek its views and forward them, with the application, to the Director for approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Mr O'Connor remembered Mr Alf Ludwick as a person who was "someone determined to make a go of it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">He does not recall him farming with his brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">He was surprised at the commencing words of the letter dated 2 June 1981, apparently written by Mr O'Connor to the Director, in which he advised that the Council had given permission for Mr A Ludwick and his brother to use land in the Bukki area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">He says that he understood that land at Yarrabah belonged to the State, and that neither the Council nor he could have given it to anybody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Mr O'Connor recalls that government policy at that time was to encourage residents of such communities to start businesses and become self-reliant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The Council was similarly encouraged to take responsibility for the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">A request to use land for a business would have been referred to the Department, with advice as to the Council's attitude and as to Mr O'Connor's own views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Lawrence James Glass, Sheree Sharma and Kenneth John Carse have also sworn affidavits, but it is not necessary that I refer to their content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">FACTUAL FINDINGS 
 I find that in about 1974, Mr Ludwick built the two small huts on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">I find that he lived there from the early 1980s until some time late in 1986 or in 1987 when he went to Bilma, intending to return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">However he met Ms Yeatman and remained at Bilma until about 1990 when he returned to the Bukki block with her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">To the extent that Mr Pollard suggests that Mr Ludwick lived at Bilma at some earlier time in the 1980s, I infer that it must have been a discrete period of temporary residence, prior to his relationship with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">The roof of the current structure was erected over the huts in 1986 or 1987, prior to the commencement of Mr Ludwick's relationship with Ms Yeatman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">At that time Mr Ludwick also extended the concrete slab on which the huts stood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">I accept the Pollards' evidence that the roof was in place when they first decided to build at Bukki in late 1986 or early 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">I do not accept Mr Pollard's evidence that the withdrawal of the Buddabadoo application and the sketch map of the proposed Bukki claim (both marked as received by the Council on 2 November 1987) were lodged in 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">I think it more likely that they followed the form 1 application for the land at Bukki (dated 1 April 1987).</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">It is possible that the withdrawal and the sketch were required by the Council prior to its processing the application for the land at Bukki.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">I am unable to find that the roof of the present house was erected prior to the date of the deed of grant in trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">However I am satisfied that the two smaller huts and the slab on which they stood were standing on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The slab was incorporated into the present house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">I also find that Mr Ludwick's actions in occupying the Bukki block and erecting the huts were tolerated by the relevant authorities (the Department and the Council).</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I find that prior to the date of the deed of grant, Mr Ludwick had probably also erected fencing, gardens and a pit lavatory on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">These improvements were still standing at that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">THE DEED OF GRANT AND S 361A 
 In assessing Mr Ludwick's claims, the starting point is the deed of grant in trust dated 27 October 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">It is common ground that the land described therein includes the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Pursuant to the deed of grant the relevant land was vested in the Council in trust for the benefit of Aboriginal inhabitants and for no other purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">I have previously set out the provisions of s 361A of the Land Act 1962.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">That section was inserted by the Land Act (Aboriginal and Islander Land Grants) Amendment Act 1982 (Qld) (the "Aboriginal Land Grants Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">With effect from 1 July 1995 the Land Act 1962 was repealed and replaced by the Land Act 1994 , s 520 of which provides: 
 The repeal of the following sections of the repealed Act is limited in the following way --- 

 
(a) ...
 
 
(b) section 361A continues to apply to deeds of grant in trust granted before this Act commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The "repealed Act" was the Land Act 1962.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">At all material times s 5 of that Act 1962 defined the term "improvements" as: 
 Any building, yard, fence, well, bore, reservoir, artificial water course or watering-place, apparatus for raising, holding or conveying water, garden, orchard, plantation, cultivation, or any erection, construction or appliance being a fixture for the working or management of a holding or of any stock depastured thereon or for maintaining or increasing the natural capabilities of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">

 Both the huts and the slab on which they stood were improvements within this definition, as were the gardens, fences and the lavatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">The definition includes things which would normally be characterized as fixtures, usually owned by the owner of the fee simple or, in the case of Crown land, the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Section 361A clearly contemplates ownership of improvements by somebody other than the Crown or the holder of the fee simple title pursuant to a deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">The intention cannot have been to authorize the grant of a lease to the owner of improvements who already held the fee simple title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">In Commissioner of Main Roads v The North Shore Gas Company Limited (1967) 120 CLR 118 at 127, the majority of the High Court (Barwick CJ, McTiernan, Kitto and Taylor JJ) said: 
 Differences of opinion from time to time have arisen concerning the true meaning and operation of the principle expressed in the maxim "quicquid solo plantatur, solo cedit ..." but, primarily, it is applied to determine the right of the owner of land to things affixed to or imbedded in the soil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Whatever is fixed to the freehold is said to become part of it and is subjected to the same rights of property as the land itself ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The presumption is said to be rebuttable and, it seems to us, it must be so when a statute empowers someone other than the owner of land to affix to or embed things in the soil and yet retain ownership of the things so affixed or embedded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">

 Section 361A seems necessarily to contemplate such a situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">As was pointed out in argument, ss 236, 237 and 238 of the Land Act 1962 also seem to have contemplated somebody other than the Crown owning improvements situated on Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">It has not been submitted that any person other than Mr Ludwick might own improvements erected by him on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Since the hearing in this matter, the Minister for Lands has indicated that he is satisfied that the two sheds stood on the land at the date of the deed of grant and that Mr Ludwick owned them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">The Council is also satisfied as to those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">The State submits that although s 520(b) of the Land Act 1994 continues the application of s 361A to deeds of grant made prior to the commencement of that Act, it does not continue the operation of other relevant provisions of the Land Act 1962.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Further, it submits that pursuant to s 511 of the Land Act 1994 , references in s 361A to provisions of the Land Act 1962 are to be taken as references to the corresponding sections in the Land Act 1994 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1954 (Qld) (the "State Interpretation Act") preserves his rights pursuant to s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Section 361A provides that the terms of any lease are to be in accordance with "the provisions of this Division", prima facie referring to Division V (Reservations in Deeds of Grant) which is contained in Part XI (Grants, Reserves and Reservations for Public Purposes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Further, s 361A expressly deprives the Minister for Lands of his capacity to refuse to approve a proposed lease pursuant to s 343 of the Land Act 1962 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The State submits that s 57 of the Land Act 1994 now imposes the requirement for ministerial approval, the effect of which would, presumably, also be negated by s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The State submits that the conditions of any lease will be regulated by s 61 of the Land Act 1994 , and not by the "provisions of this Division".</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Mr Ludwick submits that s 343 (dealing with ministerial approval) and s 344 of the Land Act 1962 (dealing with conditions) continue to apply for the purposes of s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">It may not matter whether ministerial approval is required pursuant to s 343 of the Land Act 1962 or s 57 of the Land Act 1994 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">In either case s 361A(3) will compel ministerial consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">However the conditions permitted by s 344 of the Land Act 1962 differ from those permitted by s 61 in one potentially important respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">Section 343 provides for a maximum term of 75 years whilst s 61 provides for a maximum term of 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">A number of curiosities surround the terms and structure of s 361A and its location in the Land Act 1962 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Part XI deals generally with grants, reserves and reservations for public purposes including, in particular, deeds of grant in trust and reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">It is likely that the enactment of s 361A gave effect to a policy decision to transfer from the Crown the ownership of reserves held for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Such transfer was to be to Councils, primarily or solely representative of, and constituted by, indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">It was probably intended that s 361A would be a mechanism for regularising regimes of informal occupation existing in such reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">There is no reason to assume that the informal system of land occupation at Yarrabah was, in any way, unique.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">I draw these inferences from the enactment of s 361A as part of the Aboriginal Land Grants Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">It may have been more appropriate to include s 361A in Division II of Part XI of the Land Act 1962, dealing with appointment, duties and powers of trustees, rather than in Division V, dealing with reservations in deeds of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">With the exception of s 361A Division V seems not to deal with leases at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Section 361A(1) preserves ownership of improvements located on land at the time of issue of a deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Section 361A(2) addresses the question of leases of land upon which such improvements are located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">The owner of such improvements is "entitled" to a grant by the trustee of a lease which accords with the provisions of "this Division".</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">As I have observed Division V says nothing about the terms of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">Both Mr Ludwick and the State submit that the reference to "this Division" must be either a reference to "this Part", that is Part XI, dealing with deeds of grant, or to Division II of that Part, dealing with trustees' appointment, duties and powers, including the power to lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">In either case, Division II will regulate the terms of any lease pursuant to s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Such a construction is necessary in order to give effect to the legislative intention to grant leases to the owners of improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">STATE INTERPRETATION ACT 
 The question as to whether ss 343 and 344 of the Land Act 1962 or ss 57 and 61 of the Land Act 1994 should be applied as imposing a requirement for ministerial approval of any lease and in fixing its term was, in argument, treated as dependent upon the nature of the entitlement derived by Mr Ludwick pursuant to s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Broadly speaking counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that he obtained a right to a lease upon terms to be determined in accordance with the Land Act 1962.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">On that basis they submit that s 20(2)(c) of the State Interpretation Act applies so as to preserve such right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">That section provides that the repeal or amendment of an Act does not affect a right, privilege or liability acquired, accrued or incurred thereunder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">The State submits that Mr Ludwick has no accrued right to a lease but rather a "right arising from an Act" or a "right to take advantage of an enactment", such right being the right to take action in accordance with the law as it is at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">In support of this argument the State relies upon a line of decisions commencing with Abbott v Minister for Lands [1895] AC 425 and ending with the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand Corporation (Qld) Pty Ltd v Johnson [2008] 1 Qd R 203.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">I need only make brief comments concerning those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">In Abbott the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, on appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, considered legislation which permitted any person to tender for the conditional purchase of unsold Crown land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Such a purchase would normally have been subject to a condition requiring three years of bona fide continuous residence prior to grant of the freehold title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">However, where the purchaser already held fee simple land a purchase of adjoining land would not have been subject to the condition of residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">At some stage the relevant statute was amended to remove the advantage previously available to existing landholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">The question was whether or not a landholder could purchase adjoining land upon the previous, more favourable conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">At 431, the Judicial Committee said: 
 It may be, as Windeyer J. observes, that the power to take advantage of an enactment may without impropriety be termed a "right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">" But the question is whether it is a "right accrued" within the meaning of the enactment which has to be construed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">

 
 Their Lordships think not, and they are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the words relied on are found in conjunction with the words "obligations incurred or imposed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">They think that the mere right (assuming it to be properly so called) existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment, without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right, cannot properly be deemed a "right accrued" within the meaning of the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">

 In Director of Public Works v Ho Po Sang [1961] AC 901, the Judicial Committee considered a matter arising under Hong Kong planning law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The law contemplated the exercise of a vice-regal discretion to permit rebuilding on land occupied by tenants of the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Relevantly, their Lordships observed at 922: 
 It may be, therefore, that under some repealed enactment a right has been given but that in respect of it some investigation or legal proceeding is necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">The right is then unaffected and preserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">It will be preserved even if a process of quantification is necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">But there is a manifest distinction between an investigation in respect of a right and an investigation which is to decide whether some right should or should not be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Upon a repeal the former is preserved by the Interpretation Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The latter is not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">

 In Mathieson v Burton (1970) 124 CLR 1, the High Court was concerned with legislation which provided that following the death of a lessee of prescribed premises, a child of that lessee, over the age of 21 years, who was residing with the lessee immediately before his or her death, could, until grant of probate or letters of administration, continue to exercise the same rights of possession as the deceased lessee would have done had he or she lived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">In 1968 the legislation was amended to narrow the class of protected person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The respondent to the appeal in the High Court was the daughter of a deceased lessee who had died in 1958.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">There had been no grant of probate or letters of administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">The daughter claimed the right to occupy the premises pursuant to the legislation in its unamended form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">The High Court upheld her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">In particular, at 23, Gibbs J said: 
 In my opinion when the Act of 1968 was passed the respondent had an existing right to continue in possession of the subject premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">That right had arisen out of, and had been defined by, reference to, facts that had occurred before the Act of 1968 was passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the so-called right was in truth merely an immunity or protection from eviction which endured only so long as the statutory provision creating it remained in force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">With all respect, this submission gives insufficient force to the words of s. 83A(1); that subsection purports to create and confer a right of the same kind as the lessee would have had if he had lived and I can see no justification for ignoring these words and refusing to recognize as a right that which the legislature has expressly described as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">It is true that the right was both personal and temporary --- it was not capable of assignment and endured only until representation of the estate of the deceased lessee should be granted or until a court of competent jurisdiction should make an order to putting the respondent out of possession ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">However, to say ... that the right "is of a qualified, limited and transitory nature" is to define or explain the nature of the right but is not to deny its existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">

 In NSW Aboriginal Land Council v Minister Administering The Crown Lands (Consolidation) Act and the Western Lands Act (1988) 14 NSWLR 685, the New South Wales Court of Appeal considered the terms of Aboriginal land rights legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Such legislation had provided that any transfer of land to an Aboriginal Land Council should be in fee simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">In May 1986 the Act was amended to provide that in certain circumstances, such land should be granted by way of lease in perpetuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">On 26 April 1984, the Land Council had applied to the Minister for the transfer of certain land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The Minister refused the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The Council appealed to the Land and Environment Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">On 3 September 1987 the Minister decided to approve the application to the extent of granting a lease in perpetuity under the amended legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">In the Land and Environment Court, the Land Council sought a declaration that it was entitled to a transfer in fee simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The Court of Appeal held that a statutory right would be preserved, notwithstanding the repeal or amendment of the statute, even if the right could only be implemented by a non-discretionary decision of an official or a court, provided that the statutory machinery for obtaining that decision had been set in force before the repeal or amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">At 693-4, Hope JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said: 
 In my opinion ... the power which s 36(7) confers upon the Land and Environment Court is not a discretionary power but a power which it is bound to exercise in favour of the claimant in the circumstances specified in the subsection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">

 
 What then is the nature of the right which the Land Council had after it had made its claim, when it claim was being investigated by the Minister, and when it lodged its appeal to the Land and Environment Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">It is easier first to say what it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">It was not a mere right existing in the members of the relevant class of the community "to take an advantage of an enactment, without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right"..., nor was it a right to set in train an application for a grant which the Minister or on appeal, the court might, as a matter of discretion, grant or refuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">... 

 His Honour referred to Ho Po Sang where the relevant party was held to have had only a "hope or expectation" and continued: 
 The rights conferred by the Aboriginal Lands Rights Act do not fall into this category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">On the other hand the Act does not in terms expressly confer a right in the land on the applicant at the time the claim is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">It envisages that there will be an investigation by the Minister of the facts and if the facts establish that the conditions in the definition are satisfied the Minister is then bound to grant the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">If the Minister refuses, the court on appeal again investigates the same matters but the onus is put on the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">As it seems to me, assuming the conditions were in fact satisfied, the Land Council did not merely have a right to have its claim investigated; it had a right to have the claim granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">If the Minister wrongly refused to grant it, it had the right to have the court grant it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The right might be said to be a conditional one, namely, conditional upon the relevant facts being established, but the right was nonetheless a right because it was conditional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">

 At 696 his Honour said: 
 These decisions satisfy me that a statutory right will be preserved notwithstanding the repeal or amendment of the statute even though the right can only be implemented by a non-discretionary decision of an official or a court, provided that the statutory machinery for obtaining that decision has been in set in train before the repeal or amendment.</sentence>

 In Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia (1991) 174 CLR 430, the High Court considered the entitlement of a former member of the Defence Force who had applied to redeem weekly payments of compensation so that he might receive a lump sum in lieu as prescribed by the relevant statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">The application was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">The applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">After application, but before determination, the relevant provision was repealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">The repealing Act provided that proceedings instituted under the earlier legislation, but not completed upon repeal, "may be continued on and after that day and, when the proceedings are so continued, the relevant authority and the Commonwealth shall be parties to those proceedings".</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Reliance was placed upon s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1910 (Cth) (the "Commonwealth Interpretation Act") which was, in terms, similar to s 20 of the State Interpretation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">The majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) held that the relevant section of the earlier Act conferred substantive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">Their Honours said at 440: 
 If it be assumed that the appellant did not have a right to redemption in the sense first discussed, he had a right to have his claim to redemption determined in his favour if the delegate had wrongly refused his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">To borrow a sentence from the judgment of Hope JA in NSW Aboriginal Land Council v The Minister ...: 

 
 "The right might be said to be a conditional one, namely conditional upon the relevant facts being established, but the right was nonetheless a right because it was conditional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">" 

 
 Once the appellant lodged an application to the Tribunal to review the delegate's decision, he had a right to have the decision of the delegate reconsidered and determined by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">It was not merely "a power to take advantage of an enactment"... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">Nor was it a mere matter of procedure ... ; it was a substantive right ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">Section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act protects anything that may truly be described as a right, "although that right might fairly be called inchoate or contingent" ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">This was such a right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">It was a right in existence at the time the 1971 Act was repealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">That being so, and in the absence of a contrary intention, the right was protected by s.8 of the Acts Interpretation Act and was not affected by the repeal of the 1971 Act.</sentence>

 In Chang v Laidley Shire Council (2007) 234 CLR 1, the High Court considered Queensland planning legislation which provided for compensation where a change in the relevant legislation caused a reduction in value of an interest in land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">In considering the operation of s 20 of the State Interpretation Act, the High Court said at 34: 
 Terms like "right", "interest", "title", "power", or "privilege" when used in the context of a general interpretation provision like s 20 are to be understood by reference to the statute that has been amended or repealed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">They are terms that are not used "solely in any technical sense derived exclusively from property law or analytical jurisprudence" ... .</sentence>

 There is also a particularly useful summary of the question in Resort Management Services Ltd v Noosa Shire Council (1997) 2 Qd R 291, per McPherson JA at 298 and per Fryberg J at 301-308.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">I was also referred to the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Australand .</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">That matter concerned a statutory right to avoid a contract for the purchase of a prescribe interest in a managed investment scheme where the invitation to subscribe had been issued in contravention of a provision of the Corporations Law (now repealed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">The provision was repealed with effect from 1 July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">In certain cases, the transitional provisions continued the operation of the section until 1 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">On 8 September 2003 the appellants purported to avoid their contracts pursuant to the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">At first instance the primary Judge held that such avoidance was of no effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">I was particularly referred to a passage in the judgment of Keane JA at [113]-[117].</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">That passage offers a useful commentary on the cases to which I have referred but, with great respect, it does not seem to take the matter any further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">The cases contemplate at least three distinct situations in which s 20 might be engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Firstly, the relevant legislation might create a right which, by force of the legislation, accrues without any qualification or requirement for further action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Such a right will survive repeal of the relevant legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Secondly, the legislation may confer a right upon persons having certain qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Such legislation may contemplate an investigation to determine whether a particular person has the relevant qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Using the language of Ho Po Sang , there may be a need for investigation to ascertain whether the requirement for such qualifications is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Such a right will also survive repeal of the relevant statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">That situation is to be distinguished from that in which an investigation is carried out for the purpose of determining whether or not a right should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">The former situation was considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in the Land Council case where it was said that a right which could only be implemented "by a non-discretionary decision of an official or a court" would survive, "provided that any statutory machinery has been set in train before the repeal or amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">" The "non-discretionary decision" seems to be the equivalent of the investigation contemplated in Ho Po Sang .</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Finally, where a particular procedure has been commenced, there may be a right to have the procedure completed in accordance with the statute in its unrepealed form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">This was the case in Esber .</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Clearly, the proper characterization of the rights conferred by s 361A depends upon the proper construction of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">In approaching that question, one should keep in mind the apparent purpose of its enactment, namely to recognize and preserve the interests of Aboriginal people who have, whilst residing on reserves, expended time, effort and money in constructing improvements thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">In a broad sense the provision is remedial, designed to deal with an awkward situation created by changes in the non-indigenous community's attitude towards indigenous people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">As I have said, the case was argued substantially upon the basis that either s 344 of the Land Act 1962 operated to allow a lease for a term not exceeding 75 years, or s 61 of the Land Act 1994 applied, allowing for a lease not exceeding 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">Such an approach implicitly assumes that the term is to be fixed in some way, perhaps by the Council, and subject to ministerial approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">However that approach is inconsistent with the clear statutory intention that the Minister have no discretion as to the grant of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">It also seems unlikely that the Council was to have a discretion to refuse a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">In either case, power to fix or vary the term could be exercised so as to negate the benefit intended to be conferred upon the owners of improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">There are no prescribed criteria to guide any such decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">It would be clumsy to try to imply into s 361A some obligation on the Council and/or the Minister to act reasonably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Such an approach might involve a balancing exercise as between community and individual interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">There is nothing unusual about such a process, but this legislation seems to be directed at identifying, acknowledging and protecting individual rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Whilst s 344 or s 61 may fix the maximum term of any lease, I do not consider that either section limits the actual entitlement of a relevant owner of improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Section 361A(1) provides that the relevant time for determining the existence and ownership of improvements is the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The improvements must have been on the land at that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">However the subsection also recognizes the possibility that the relevant enquiry may actually be made at some later date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">Hence the subsection refers to an improvement which "was owned".</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The effect of s 361A(1) is that ownership of improvements is not to be prejudiced by such grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">In other words, the owner continues to own them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Pursuant to s 361A(2) the person "shown to own such improvements shall be entitled" to the grant of a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Much of the argument in this matter proceeded upon the basis that satisfaction of the Minister for Lands and the Council as to ownership of the improvements was a condition precedent to any right conferred upon the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">However such an approach puts too much emphasis upon the form of the section and too little upon its clear intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">There can be no doubt that the intention was that the owner of improvements be entitled to a lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">It was necessary for the Council (as trustee) and the Minister for Lands to be satisfied that a particular person was the person entitled to a lease relating to the improvements in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">However that requirement seems to be a process of the kind contemplated in Ho Po Sang , namely an investigation necessary in order to give effect to an entitlement, rather than a condition precedent to such entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">It is true that in the Land Council case, Hope JA added the additional requirement that any statutory mechanism have been commenced in order that the entitlement should survive repeal of the relevant statutory provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">In the present case, there is no requirement that the owner take any step for the purposes of s 361A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">It was assumed in argument that the owner of improvements was to undertake the task of satisfying the Minister for Lands and the Council of his or her ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">However the section does not say that, nor does it provide for any particular mechanism to be initiated by the owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">It is possible that Parliament contemplated that the Council or the Minister for Lands would investigate the ownership of improvements with a view to regularizing the position as to ownership and occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">The likelihood of such a statutory intention is increased when one considers that the legislation was, as I have said, designed to remedy some of the disadvantage suffered by a severely disadvantaged group in our society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">The reference in s 361A(3) to an "application" for the Minister's approval of a lease is to an application by the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">See s 343.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">I should also point out that use of the present tense "stands" in s 361A(2)(a) suggests that the entitlement arises at the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">In my view, the effect of s 361A is to confer a right upon the owner of improvements, subject only to satisfactory investigation of the question of his or her ownership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The right which an owner held pursuant to s 361A, prior to the repeal of the Land Act 1962, was a right to a lease in accordance with that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Such right would be within either the first or second category identified above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">If the entitlement were to one lease for whatever period the Council decided upon, then that right would survive pursuant to s 20 of the State Interpretation Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">However I consider that s 361A should not be construed as authorizing the grant of only one lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">Section 361A confers an entitlement upon a person who owns improvements on relevant land at a particular point in time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">The section does not limit the period during which such a person holds that entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">If so entitled as at the date of the deed of grant, an owner will be so entitled for the rest of his or her life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">This case provides an example of such an entitlement being addressed many years after the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">It seems to have been assumed in argument that an owner is entitled to only one lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">Such an approach might not fulfil the apparent objective of allowing the owner of improvements to continue to enjoy the benefits of his or her improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">The shorter the term of any lease, the less would be the capacity to enjoy such benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">Section 32C(a) of the State Interpretation Act provides that words in the singular include the plural.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">It would be more in accordance with the intention of the section if it were read as authorizing the grant of a lease at any time during the life of a relevant person, and regardless of whether any lease had previously been granted pursuant to the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">In the event that such a lease expires during the owner's lifetime, another may be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">The right to receive a lease is vested in the owner of improvements as at the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">It cannot be transferred or pass by will or on intestacy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">However, where a lease for a fixed term has been granted, and the lessee dies during the term, the right to the balance of the term will be an asset of the estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Given that the entitlement is to receive a lease from time to time, the better view is that such lease is to be pursuant to the law as it stands at the time at which each lease is granted, and that s 361A should now be read, pursuant to s 511 of the Land Act 1994 , as referring to the relevant provisions of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Counsel for the State submits that s 361A requires that the improvements be situated on the land both at the date of the deed of grant and at the date on which any lease is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">In my view s 361A should be construed as creating an entitlement to a lease as at the date of the deed of grant, and that subsequent removal of the improvements is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">The huts were still on the Bukki block as at date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">The foundation slab was, and remains, on the block, having been extended and incorporated into the larger hut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">It is probable that there were also gardens, fences and a lavatory on the land at the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">At least some of the fencing and gardens presently on the block probably pre-date the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">There is no doubt that there were improvements on the land on 27 October 1986, and that the slabs and, probably, some remnants of earlier fencing and gardens remain at the present time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">Section 361A(2) provides that the lease be of the land on which the improvements stand and, where the improvements involve a building or structure used as a residence, a reasonable area of land, being the immediate environs of the improvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">As to the purpose for which the land was used, the relevant time is again the date of the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">At the time that the Pollards moved on to their land at Bukki in late 1986 or early 1987, Mr Ludwick's niece was living in a small shed on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">She resided there for about a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">It is more probable than not that either Mr Ludwick was living there as at 27 October 1986, or that his niece was so residing, or about to commence doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Both Mr Ludwick and Ms Yeatman said that their relationship commenced in about 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">It is reasonable to infer that as at 27 October 1986 the land was being used as a residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">It is possible that it was vacant for a relatively short time, but more probable that it was occupied on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">In any event a period of temporary vacancy would not detract from the fact that the improvements were being used as a residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">This is particularly so, given that when he left, Mr Ludwick apparently intended to return to the Bukki block after his sojourn at Bilma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">His plans changed when he met Ms Yeatman in 1987, but it seems that he (and perhaps they) always intended to move to the Bukki block eventually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">The final matter is the area to be leased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">It is for the Council to exercise its discretion, having regard to s 361A(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Again, I do not wish to intervene in the exercise of that discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">However, as the matter was addressed in the course of argument, I will list some of the relevant considerations without meaning to exclude consideration of other factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">I say nothing about the weight to be given to any relevant factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">In this case, the following matters may be relevant: the sizes of other blocks in the area; access to the creek by Mr Ludwick and others, including traditional owners; the area actually occupied and cleared by Mr Ludwick; other community needs; value of the improvements on the Bukki block as at 27 October 1986 and of improvements erected since that date; and the area needed to facilitate use of the block for residential purposes, including conditions peculiar to the local community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">STATUTORY LICENCE 
 I have already set out the provisions of s 452A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">There were similar provisions in the Land Act 1962 (s 21), but I do not understand there to be any dispute arising out of Mr Ludwick's occupation of the premises prior to the present time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">A licence to occupy confers a lesser right than does a lease, particularly where the licence is terminable at will.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">Clearly, Mr Ludwick was residing lawfully on the Yarrabah reserve prior to the deed of grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">There seems to be no suggestion that his residence on the Bukki block was other than at least tacitly accepted by all relevant authorities including the Department and the Council.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">There is, however, a question as to whether, at the date of the deed of grant, he occupied any building or structure on the Bukki block as his residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">That is a different question from that posed by s 361A(2) which is whether the improvement was being used as a residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">For reasons previously given, I am satisfied that the Bukki block was probably being used as a residence as at 27 October 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">Such use was either by Mr Ludwick or his niece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">As Mr Ludwick seems to have met Ms Yeatman on the beach at Bilma in 1987, it is reasonable to infer that he resided at Bukki until shortly before such meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">On balance that finding justifies the inference that he was living there as at 27 October 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">His own evidence is that when he went to the beach he intended that it be only a temporary visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">When he met Ms Yeatman his plans changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">He still wished to return to Bukki but chose to live with her for a time on the beach, then in her house when it was built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">However none of this suggests that as at 27 October 1986 he intended to cease residing on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">He regularly returned to the block whilst living at Bilma and, in about 1990, returned with Ms Yeatman to live there permanently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">Whilst I would infer that Mr Ludwick was occupying the Bukki block as his residence in October 1986, s 452A contemplates a licence to "continue" such occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">It may be arguable that a break of three years makes such continuation impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">That question was not really ventilated in argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Given my view that Mr Ludwick is entitled to a lease, it is probably not necessary that I reach any conclusion concerning his entitlement to a licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">There has been no recent challenge to his right to remain on the Bukki block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">I certainly see no point in deciding the question simply so that Mr Ludwick may submit that his occupation to date is attributable to such a licence, and that his period of occupation should not be deducted from the term of any future lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">NATIVE TITLE 
 Finally, there is the question of the effect of Mr Ludwick's entitlement to a lease (or licence) upon any determination as to the existence of Native Title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">Although submissions were made concerning that matter, I consider that it will be better to leave it until the parties have had an opportunity to consider these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">I will then list the matter for further directions with a view to determining whether any point will be served by resolving the question of Mr Ludwick's entitlement to a licence, and whether I should now consider the effect of his entitlement in connection with the operation of the Native Title Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">I will also receive submissions as to appropriate forms of order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">I certify that the preceding eighty-seven (87) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.</sentence>
