 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 On Sunday, 24 August 2003, the plaintiffs, Mr Mark Ruaro and Mrs Secilia Ruaro, were the owners of a twin screw, inboard powered, raised bridge, wood, motor yacht approximately 56 feet in length built in 1938 by Holmes Brothers in Sydney, known as "Seaquest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Seaquest was bought by Mr and Mrs Ruaro in 1993 and, thereafter, they carried out major restoration works on Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Seaquest was their pride and joy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 On 24 August 2003, Seaquest was attached to a swing mooring in Rose Bay, which is part of Sydney Harbour, pursuant to a licence granted by the defendant, Holcomm Marine Pty Limited ( Holmeport ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In severe weather conditions in the afternoon of that day, another vessel, Pavana, which was attached to a swing mooring located more than 100 m distant from Seaquest, dragged its mooring until it came into contact with Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Over a period of approximately one hour, the contact between the two vessels led to the severance of the rope securing Seaquest to its swing mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Seaquest was then driven by the wind across Rose Bay to the Eastern sea wall where it was battered to such an extent that it broke up and was a total loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Mr and Mrs Ruaro have commenced a proceeding against Holmeport claiming damages in respect of the loss of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">They claim to be entitled to be compensated on several grounds:
 
 
 &#8226; Breach of duties of care allegedly owed by Holmeport to Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">&#8226; Breach of warranties allegedly implied, by the operation of s 74(1) and s 74(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( the Trade Practices Act ), in a mooring contract between Mr and Mrs Ruaro and Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">&#8226; Contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act by Holmeport, by allegedly making misleading and deceptive statements about the safety of Seaquest on the swing mooring to which she was attached at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 THE MAKING OF THE MOORING AGREEMENT 
 
4 Point Piper is a promontory in Sydney Harbour between Rose Bay and Double Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Point Piper generally constitutes the western shore of Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Point Piper marina, which is situated on the Rose Bay side of Point Piper, consists of a jetty to which berths are attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The facilities of the marina also include swing moorings in four separate areas of Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">One of the areas is for vessels of less than 24 feet, one is for vessels from 25 to 30 feet, one is four vessels from 31 to 37 feet and the fourth area, which is furthest away from the jetty, is for vessels of greater than 37 feet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The moorings are further apart for larger vessels than for smaller vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 At relevant times, Holmeport operated the Point Piper marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Holmeport became the operator of the Point Piper marina at some time prior to March 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There is no evidence as to the nature of the rights that Holmeport has to occupy the jetty and to control the use of the swing moorings that form part of the marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It appears, however, that Holmeport had an entitlement to grant a right to use the swing moorings and other facilities that constitute the Point Piper marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">At relevant times, Mr Campbell Holmes was the general manager of Holmeport, having commenced in that position in December 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">6 Seaquest was berthed at the end of the jetty of the Point Piper marina from 5 May 1993 until early 1994, when she was transferred from the berth to a swing mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In March 1996, Mr Ruaro had a conversation with Mr Holmes in the course of which Mr Holmes asked Mr Ruaro to sign a document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">After Mr Ruaro read the document, an exchange along the following lines took place:
 
 Mr Ruaro: Do you want me to sign this agreement which exonerates you from liability for moving my vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">You are asking me to absolve you from liability and you've got a clause here that if you move my vessel and you damage it you are exonerated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Prior to you taking over the marina, the receiver moved my friend's boat from a berth to a mooring and it dragged and hit my boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Where's my protection?</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Holmes: Look you don't have to worry about that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That man is not here anymore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">We are going to do things differently now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">We are part of the Boating Industry Association and that's why you have to sign this form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">All the paperwork has to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">We are going to be spending a lot of money and we're going to be making this place professional, world class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Look, your boat will be fine just there right where it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

 Mr Ruaro then signed the document that Mr Holmes provided to him ( the Mooring Agreement ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 It is not in dispute that a binding contract came into existence between Mr and Mrs Ruaro, on the one hand, and Holmeport on the other, in the terms of the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">From time to time the licence fee payable under the Mooring Agreement was varied, such that from January 2002 to August 2003, the monthly fee was $317.65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mr and Mrs Ruaro paid the monthly fee from the time of the Mooring Agreement up to the destruction of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">8 In deciding to sign the Mooring Agreement, Mr Ruaro had regard to the fact that Mr Campbell seemed to want to run a marina in a professional manner and the fact that he said he was going to upgrade all the facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Those facts and the maintenance were very important to Mr Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His main consideration was the safety of the Seaquest and the safety of the area that Seaquest was in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Ruaro understood, from what Mr Campbell said, that everything would be improving, and that Seaquest would be safe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">9 In deciding to continue to moor Seaquest at the Point Piper marina from 1996, Mr Ruaro had regard to his observations that the marina was being upgraded and that maintenance seemed to be being carried out on a regular basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">He did not find anything that brought any concerns to him and he thought that Holmeport had the money to do a professional job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">10 In about September 2000, Mr and Mrs Ruaro were on board Seaquest at the mooring in Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Ruaro telephoned Mr Holmes and asked if he could have some tender service so that he could go ashore to pick up his own tender.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Mr Holmes came out himself and a conversation then took place between Messrs Holmes and Ruaro on the deck of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The conversation was to the following effect:
 
 Mr Holmes: Are you going to slip the boat today?</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 Mr Ruaro: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">We wanted to slip it here, but you said that your slipway can't take it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">
 
 
 
 
 Mr Holmes: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">My engineer says that we can only take 30 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 
 Mr Ruaro: I think we weigh about 32 tonnes, so we will have to go to Henderson's slipway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
 
 
 Mr Holmes: Where's that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 Mr Ruaro: It's Peppercorn Reserve, Drummoyne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Campbell, something that concerns me: when we come back, I want to stay on this mooring because we have been here a long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">We're your oldest client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">We have always been safe here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mr Holmes: Yes I know that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Your boat has been here since 1993 and we have never had any trouble with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This spot is right for your boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 
 
 
 
 

11 Mr Ruaro said that if he had not been assured in March 1996 that things were going to improve and were on the up and up he would have left Point Piper Marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Mr Ruaro also said that he would have come back to the Rose Bay mooring after having Seaquest slipped in 2000, whether or not he had had the conversation with Mr Holmes at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The thrust of the concern expressed by Mr Ruaro was that, if he left the mooring to have Seaquest slipped by Hendersons, he would lose his mooring, which he desired to keep.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">THE TERMS OF THE MOORING AGREEMENT 
 
 12 The Mooring Agreement is a pro forma single sheet printed on both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The front of the sheet has a heading " Marine Craft Berthing, Storage and Mooring Agreement " and has the logos of the Boating Industry Association and the Marina Association of New South Wales appear on each side of the heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The front has printing and blank boxes for the insertion of particulars of the parties, described as Licensee and Licensor, particulars of the Licensee's marine craft and particulars of the licence fee and licence term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The names of Mr Ruaro and the business name of Holmeport were inserted in the first as Licensee and Licensor respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Particulars of Seaquest were inserted in the second box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The licence fee stated in the appropriate box was to be $200 per month and the term of the licence was to be monthly, commencing on 18 March 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">13 The final box contains space for signatures by the parties and for insertion of a date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Above the space for the signatures, the following is printed:
 
 " LICENSEES ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
 
 I the Licensee acknowledge that I have received a copy of this agreement signed by me and certify I have carefully read the agreement including the Conditions printed overleaf and agree to those Conditions as part of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">" 
 

The date 18 March 1996 was inserted in the space for the date and the signatures of Mr Ruaro, as Licensee, and Mr Holmes, as Licensor, were placed in that box.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">14 The front of the pro forma also contains a printed line linking the names of the parties to the description of the relevant marine craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The effect is that the pro forma contemplates an agreement between the Licensee and the Licensor:
 
 TO supply marina &#8298;berth &#8298;moor &#8298;store facilities &#8298; tender service and use marina facilities for: 
 
 
 the Licensee's marine craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The syntax of that provision is somewhat awry in that three of the services are described by way of a noun and one of the services, being moor, is described by a verb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Clearly enough, the provision refers to four different services at a marina, namely, provision of a berth, provision of a mooring, provision of store facilities and provision of a tender service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Presumably, the fee would vary according to the services ticked in any particular pro forma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">

15 In the pro forma signed by Mr Ruaro and Mr Holmes only the box adjacent to " moor " was ticked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That signifies that Holmeport was to provide to Mr Ruaro a mooring service for Seaquest and that Holmeport was not to provide a berth, store facilities or tender services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">16 The reverse of the pro forma is headed " CONDITIONS " and relevantly states as follows:

The reverse is endorsed with a statement that further supplies of the pro forma are obtainable from the Boating Industry Association of NSW Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">17 As I have indicated above, the only small box on the front of the Mooring Agreement that was ticked was the one relating to moor .</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Condition 2 on the reverse of the Mooring Agreement does not quite coincide with the line on the front of the Mooring Agreement, in so far as it refers to " berth/store/moor/dock ", although " dock " may be the equivalent of " tender service ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The format of Condition 2, having regard to the small boxes on the front of the Mooring Agreement, suggests that, in the present case, the words berth/moor/dock should have been deleted from Condition 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Clearly enough, however, and the proceeding was conducted on this basis, the effect of the Mooring Agreement was that Holmeport granted to Mr Ruaro a non-exclusive right to use the facilities of the Point Piper marina to moor Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It did not confer any right to berth Seaquest or to use store facilities or to receive any tender service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">THE PAVANA MOORING 
 
18 A typical swing mooring apparatus in Sydney Harbour consists of the following:
 
 
 &#8226; an anchoring mass for the bottom end of the apparatus, which is usually a concrete block with a "U" shaped eye cast into the top of it;
 &#8226; a ground chain consisting of a length of about 6 m of very heavy chain, attached to the eye in the concrete block with a swivel and a shackle;
 &#8226; a lighter chain attached to the heavier ground chain; and
 &#8226; a rope attached to the lighter chain, which is attached to a floating buoy or to a vessel when the vessel is moored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 

Under normal circumstances, most of the mooring load is taken by the heavy ground chain, which lies on the bottom, with the anchoring mass merely securing one end of that chain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">19 Under normal circumstances, the load applied to a vessel attached to such a mooring apparatus is of two kinds as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; an increasing and reducing load;
 &#8226; an environmental load.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">
 

The increasing and reducing load is related to the height of the tide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The moored vessel lifts a length of the heavy ground chain as the tide rises and returns that length to the bottom as the tide falls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The environmental load is a superimposed load representing the effect of wind and waves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The force of that load will vary with the velocity of the wind, which can also affect the wave climate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">20 A vessel on a swing mooring such as that described, is in a dynamic situation with respect to its mooring block, which may be assumed to be fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The vessel will move forward and backward as the tide rises and falls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It will also move backwards in response to increases in wind and wave action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">As the wind and wave action reduces, the vessel will move forward as the heavy chain is laid on the bottom again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The total load on a mooring, measured at the vessel, can be more or less than the load related to the height of the tide, depending on the environmental factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">21 In early March 2003, Polaris Marine Construction and Recovery Pty Limited (Polaris) was requested to discuss the possibility of servicing Holmeport's moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In response to that request, Mr Adam William Peeters, the supervisor for mooring and special events of Polaris, spoke to Ms Sandra Kearney-Hayes, the manager of Holmeport's marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Shortly thereafter, Mr Peeters met Ms Kearney-Hayes at Holmeport's marina where they had a brief conversation the effect of which was as follows:
 
 Ms Kearney-Hayes: We want to talk to you about servicing our moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Mr Peeters: When were they last serviced?</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Ms Kearney-Hayes: About 12 months ago so they are due for servicing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Peeters: What have you got out there?</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 
 Ms Kearney-Hayes: I have no idea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">[Our current contractor] never tells us what we've got or what they do --- we merely get an invoice with a lump sum figure on it for all the moorings that were serviced at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">That is one of the reasons we are unhappy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Mr Peeters: I would like to lift one and see what is there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">That will give me some idea how big the job is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">

22 Mr Peeters and a general hand employed by Holmeport went out on board Polaris' vessel and inspected one of the moorings, selected at random.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">They returned to the office and Mr Peeters had a further conversation with Ms Kearney-Hayes to the following effect:
 
 Mr Peeters: I've pulled up one of your moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Basically it is in really bad shape and will need much of it replaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">If they are all like this first one, service is going to be pretty time consuming and expensive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">We work on an hourly rate, which is what we do for all commercial moorings and yacht clubs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">In the long run this will work out cheaper for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Okay I would like you to start as soon as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Mr Peeters: I will schedule it in and I'll allow three days a week so I can fit it in with other work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Here is a chart which shows the position of our moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">

23 Mr Peeters began work on 20 March 2003, when he had a telephone conversation with Ms Kearney-Hayes to the following effect:
 
 Ms Kearney-Hayes: We would like you to start on the outside ones first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">We are concerned that they may drag because they are in a more exposed area than the inner ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Peeters: I normally start at the shoreline and work my way out to make sure that the moorings are evenly spaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Look, we are really worried about those outer ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Mr Peeters: Okay, would it be alright if I start at the channel and worked out?</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Yes, that'll be fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

24 The first stage of work was carried out by Mr Peeters on 20 and 21 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">After sending an invoice for that work, he received a telephone call from Ms Kearney-Hayes on 27 March 2003 and had a conversation to the following effect:
 
 Ms Kearney-Hayes: I have been looking at the bill received from you guys for all the moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Wow it's so expensive!</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Mr Peeters: Well, your moorings are in such bad shape.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">I need to replace a lot of materials, and most of them are too light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">You should make the outside moorings as heavy as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Two one-tonne blocks is the best Polaris can do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">You should put that down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Ms Kearney-Hayes: How much is a one tonne block?</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mr Peeters: They're $400 each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Ms Kearney-Hayes: If you put two down, that is $800 plus all the other material, per mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Our cash flow wont allow that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Is there a cheaper alternative?</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Mr Peeters: Any increase in weight will assist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">When I pick up a mooring with a half-tonne block I could replace that with a new one tonne block and then put the left over half-tonne blocks together to make up the one tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">That would at least mean that your outer moorings are a minimum of one tonne, which is heavier than what they are now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Have you had any problems with any of the moorings lifting or dragging in the past?</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Ms Kearney-Hayes: No, none at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Mr Peeters: Well, it's not what I would recommend but at least they'll be heavier than they are now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">There will be a risk that they will drag, depending on the vessel and the conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Ms Kearney-Hayes: We simply can't afford to put a new block on every mooring --- one tonne will do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Mr Peeters: Okay, if that's what you want, but it's your responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Sure, we've had no problems before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">We will take the risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">

25 Mr Peeters serviced mooring number 60 on 8 May 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">He added a half-tonne block from the previous mooring that he had serviced to the existing half-tonne block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">There was no vessel on mooring number 60 when he carried out the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">26 Later in May 2003, Mr Peeters had another telephone conversation with Ms Kearney-Hayes to the following effect:
 
 Ms Kearney-Hayes: I am calling about mooring 79.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">We really don't want to risk that vessel going anywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Can you make that one two tonnes?</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Mr Peeters: Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Shall I put two one-tonne blocks on that one?</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Yes, that's fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Peeters: I will also need to upgrade the other components to be strong enough to lift the blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Ms Kearney-Hayes: Okay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">

Mr Peeters serviced mooring number 79 on 21 May 2003 and replaced two half-tonne blocks with two one-tonne blocks and upgraded the other components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">27 The Pavana is a schooner rigged yacht of the Malabar Class built in 1929.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It has an overall length of 52 feet (15.85 m) including a bowsprit of 14 feet (4.27 m) and a beam of 14 feet (4.27 m).</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Its draft is 7 feet (2.13 m) and it has a displacement of approximately 30 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">28 On 24 August 2003, Pavana was attached to swing mooring number 60, one of the moorings that forms part of the Point Piper marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Mooring number 60 is in the area for vessels in excess of 37 feet, located some distance from Holmeport's marina jetty to the east of the Royal Motor Yacht Club's marina, which is also situated at Point Piper on Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">29 It is common ground that, at that time, mooring number 60 consisted of the following:
 
 
 &#8226; two half-tonne concrete blocks;
 &#8226; one swivel;
 &#8226; 7 m of 38 mm ground chain;
 &#8226; 4 m of 20 mm chain to the vessel;

 THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ON 24 AUGUST 2003 
 
30 There is no doubt that the weather conditions in Sydney generally and in Rose Bay in particular on the afternoon of 24 August 2003 were severe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The issue between the parties is the degree of severity and the frequency with which, on average, such conditions are experienced on Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">31 The Bureau of Meteorology maintains several automatic weather stations around the shoreline of Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">However, a number of those automatic weather stations have only been operative for a relatively short time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The closest weather stations to Rose Bay are at Fort Dennison, Wedding Cake West and North Head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Fort Dennison is 2.7 km from Point Piper/Rose Bay in a west north-westerly direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Wedding Cake West is approximately 2.9 km from Point Piper/Rose Bay in a generally north north-easterly direction and North Head is about 7 km from Point Piper/Rose Bay in a north-easterly direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">32 At the weather stations the Bureau measures " wind direction ", " wind speed " and " maximum wind gust ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Wind direction is the mean wind direction over the 10 minute period up until the time indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">It is given in true degrees and indicates the direction from which the wind is blowing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Wind speed is the mean wind speed over the 10 minute period up until the time indicated and is recorded in kilometres per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The maximum wind gust is the maximum gust recorded in the 10 minutes up until the observation time indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">33 The Bureau's records show that, between 2 pm and 6 pm on 24 August 2003, the wind direction at Fort Dennison was generally at 310 degrees, although it varied between 300 and 320 degrees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">That is generally north-westerly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">During that time, the wind speed is recorded as varying between 41 km per hour and 70 km per hour with wind gusts ranging from 59 km per hour to as much as 109 km per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">At Wedding Cake West the wind direction was generally 280 degrees to 290 degrees, which is generally west-north-west.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The wind speed ranged from 37 km per hour to 63 km per hour and wind gusts ranged from 61 km per hour to 96 km per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">At North Head, the wind direction was 300 to 310 degrees, which is generally north-westerly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The wind speed ranged from 37 km per hour to 68 km per hour and wind gusts ranged from 70 km per hour to 120 km per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">34 Under the Beaufort Wind Scale, which is commonly used to describe weather conditions, winds of 40 to 50 km per hour are described as Strong Winds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Under such conditions large waves begin to form on the sea, white foam crests become more extensive with some spray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">On land, large branches are in motion, whistling is heard in telephone wires and umbrellas can only be used with difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Winds from 51 to 62 km per hour are classified as Near Gale, when the sea heaps up and white foam from breaking waves begins to be blown in streaks along the direction of the wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">On land, whole trees are in motion and inconvenience can be felt when walking against the wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Winds from 63 to 75 km per hour are described as gale force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">On the sea, there are moderately high waves of greater length, edges of crests begin to break into spindrift, foam is blown in well marked streaks along the direction of the wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On land, twigs break off trees and progress is generally impeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">35 Unchallenged evidence was given by a number of witnesses who experienced the conditions on the afternoon of 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Mr Graham Forsaith is a boating service officer with the New South Wales Waterways Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Mr Forsaith has had private and professional experience on Sydney Harbour for approximately 30 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">His role as a boating service officer is to regulate and ensure compliance with New South Wales maritime and environmental legislation by the users of New South Wales waterways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">His role involves dealing with the users of private and commercial moorings and private and commercial vessels and liaising with them regarding water safety issues and compliance with regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Mr Forsaith was on duty on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">36 Mr Forsaith said that Sydney Harbour experienced an extreme storm on that day with very high winds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">He described the weather as being extreme and as generating the strongest wind gusts that he could recall in his 30 years on the harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">He has not seen a similar sized storm since.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Mr Forsaith received in excess of 20 calls for assistance from boat users and owners on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Some 12 to 14 vessels broke their moorings within the area under his control, being the area to the east of Sydney Harbour Bridge across to Manly and all of the bays and waterways in between.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He began to receive calls from members of the public from approximately 10 am and continued to receive calls until approximately 6 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Because of the size of the storm, Mr Forsaith considered that there was little that he, as a boating service officer, could do for vessels that had either broken mooring lines or dragged their moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Once a vessel begins drifting, there is little that can be done in severe winds without causing further damage to other vessels that may be in the vicinity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">As a result of the storm on 24 August 2003, 7 or 8 vessels were stranded on the sand in Double Bay, on the western side of Point Piper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Mr Forsaith considered that the worst affected areas on that day were Double Bay, Watsons Bay and Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">37 Mr Vincent Julian Vaughn was a pilot with Sydney Harbour Seaplanes, which is based at Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">During 24 August 2003, Mr Vaughn spent the day monitoring a seaplane at the Rose Bay jetty for possible damage from winds and rough water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Mr Vaughn said that the wind strength grew progressively stronger and stronger as the day went on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">38 At about 4.30 pm, Mr Vaughn saw a number of boats drifting across Rose Bay at an angle and velocity that suggested that they were not attached to moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">In particular, Pavana drifted approximately 100 to 200 metres upwind of Seaquest and collided with Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Pavana came across the bow of Seaquest and rafted itself to the forward starboard side of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Pavana shifted to its side at a sharp angle with its mooring line taut against the mooring line of Seaquest, which was also taut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">At that time, the wind became stronger and the water conditions became rougher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Pavana held in the same position for about one hour until eventually the mooring line of Seaquest was severed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Seaquest then moved through the water at an angle and velocity that indicated that it was freely adrift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Seaquest drifted towards the south eastern corner of Rose Bay and became jammed between the public ferry wharf and the rock wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">During that time, Pavana continued to drift but at a rate that was slower than would be expected of a vessel that was freely adrift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">39 Mr Malcolm Turnbull, a resident of Point Piper, observed Seaquest freely drifting in Rose Bay close to the shore at about 5.30 pm on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Mr Turnbull made a video recording of Seaquest drifting between 5.30 pm and 6 pm and of Seaquest being caught between Rose Bay Wharf and the sea wall and being driven against the sea wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The video recording is in evidence and shows strong winds and rough seas in Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">40 Mr Michael McMahon is the proprietor and operator of Catalina Restaurant, which is located on the promontory which juts out into Rose Bay towards the north.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Mr McMahon observed winds in the early afternoon of 24 August 2003, which became stronger during the afternoon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">At about 4.30 pm he saw several vessels that were moored in Rose Bay drifting across its waters following the wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">One of the vessels was Pavana, which collided with Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Mr McMahon said that, after hitting against each other for about one hour, the mooring line of Seaquest was cut and it drifted freely across Rose Bay, hitting the rock walls and jetty and breaking up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">41 A police report made by Senior Constable Christian Popp of Sydney Water Police records his attendance at Rose Bay in relation to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Constable Popp said that a decision was made not to attempt to remove Seaquest because of the extreme wind conditions at the time, including gusting in excess of 100 km per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">42 Mr Peeters observed the storm on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">He had not seen a storm of such ferocity in more than 16 years of working on Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">After the storm, he was asked to carry out clean up work for Holmeport, including mooring number 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">In the course of that work, he pulled mooring number 60 out of the water to examine its components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">He found all of the components of the mooring intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">After the examination, Ms Kearney-Hayes instructed him to put another 1 tonne block on mooring number 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Mr Peeters told her that it would also need a new swivel bolt rope and a new anti-chafe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">43 Mr Russell P. Morison is a meteorological consultant and is senior research scientist within the Centre for Environmental Modelling and Prediction and Climate and Environmental Dynamics Laboratory at the University of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">A large part of his professional career has been involved in computer modelling of the environment, in particular the atmosphere, ocean and waves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">He has been working in meteorological modellings since the 1980s and has published extensively in his field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">44 Mr Morison expressed his opinion in writing that the wind speeds that occurred at Rose Bay on 24 August 2003 are unlikely to have exceeded gale force, on the Beaufort Wind Scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In his opinion, the sustained wind speeds shown by that data for Fort Denison and Wedding Cake West were in the strong wind speed range from 3 pm to 4.30 pm and peaked in the gale wind speed range in the period 4.30 pm to 6 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Mr Morison referred to frequency tables produced by the Bureau of Meteorology that, he says, show that strong winds occur in Sydney Harbour, on average, every couple of weeks and that gale force winds, on average, occur east of Sydney Harbour Bridge a few times a year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">45 Mr Morison expressed the opinion, therefore, that the wind speeds in Sydney Harbour, including Rose Bay, were strong in the late afternoon of 24 August 2003, moving up to gale force in the early evening.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">He considered that it was very unlikely that winds exceeded gale force and considered that the storm represented a reasonably common occurrence in the climatology of the region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">He said that wind speeds of the strength in question have a return period of less than five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">While he thought it was possible that there were winds that reached strong gale force, even winds of that severity have a return period below 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">That is to say, such conditions occur more frequently than once every 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">His opinion was based on data obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Mr Morison considered that, meteorologically speaking, a 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 year event was not " rare ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Such an event should be expected to have a moderate probability of occurring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">46 Mr Martin Babakhan is a lecturer in Aviation Meteorology at the University of Newcastle, Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Mr Babakhan expressed his opinion in writing that the storm that occurred in Sydney on the afternoon of 24 August 2003 would occur less than 0.5% of the time in the last 17 years and he therefore characterised it as a " rare occurrence ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">His written opinions explained how the weather conditions occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">His opinion was that the storm on the afternoon of 24 August 2003 was caused by an intense low pressure system and cold front moving through the Sydney region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The Bureau of Meteorology issued a special weather report stating that for Sydney, at 5.35 pm winds were at 112.97 km per hour with a possibility of storm force winds in the afternoon, being winds with speed ranges between 88 and 102 km per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">47 Based on data provided by the Bureau of Meteorology, Mr Babakhan considered that the winds that occurred on 24 August 2003 would occur at Wedding Cake West in excess of 15 times per year and at Fort Dennison nearly four times per year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">He characterised the storm as " a rare occurrence " and of an intensity that occurs in Sydney Harbour on average no more than sixteen hours per year at 3 pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He accepted in cross-examination that that signified an average recurrence interval of between five and ten years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
48 Under s 4 of the Trade Practices Act , the term services includes, relevantly, any rights (including rights in relation to, and interests in, real or personal property), benefits, privileges or facilities that are, or are to be, provided, granted or conferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">More specifically, the term includes the rights, benefits, privileges or facilities that are, or are to be, provided, granted, or conferred under a contract for, or in relation to, the provision of, or the use or enjoyment of facilities for, amusement, entertainment, recreation or instruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">That extended definition may be thought to go beyond the meaning of the term services in ordinary English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The proceeding was conducted on the basis that the right conferred by the Mooring Agreement was services within the meaning of s 4 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">49 Section 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act relevantly provides that, in every contract for the supply by a corporation of services to a consumer, there is an implied warranty that the services will be rendered with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">It is common ground that there was implied in the Mooring Agreement a warranty that the services that are the subject of the Mooring Agreement would be rendered with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">50 Section 74(2) of the Trade Practices Act relevantly provides that, where a corporation supplies services to a consumer and the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the corporation any particular purpose for which the services are required or the result that he or she desires the services to achieve, there is an implied warranty that the services supplied under the contract will be reasonably fit for that purpose or are of such a nature and quality that they might reasonably be expected to achieve that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">However, there is an exception where the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him or her to rely, on the corporation's skill or judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Holmeport does not accept that any warranty was implied in the Mooring Agreement by the operation of s 74(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">51 There are provisions of the Trade Practices Act designed to negate attempts to contract out of the benefits intended to be conferred by provisions such as s 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Thus, s 68 relevantly provides that any term of a contract that purports to exclude, restrict or modify, or has the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying the application of s 74 or any liability of a corporation for breach of a warranty implied by s 74 , is void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">On the other hand, s 68A(1) provides, relevantly, that a term of the contract is not void under s 68 by reason only that the term limits the liability of the corporation for a breach of a warranty implied by s 74 to:
 
 
 &#8226; the supplying of the services again; or
 &#8226; the payment of the costs of having the services supplied again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">
 

52 The significance of s 68A is that it demonstrates, subject to the other provisions of s 68A , that s 68 was not intended, in ordinary circumstances, to void a term including a right to compensation for consequential loss suffered by breach of a warranty implied by s 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">That may have some bearing on the construction to be given to s 68 in relation to a term of a contract that might operate to exclude, restrict or modify the application of s 74 or any liability for breach of warranty implied by s 74 , which also has the effect of excluding some other liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">A question arises as to whether the effect of s 68 is to render a term of a contract void only to the extent that it purports to do or has the effect of doing the things described in s 68 , or whether it renders a term that has that effect void for all purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">THE ISSUES 
 
53 The questions in issue are as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; Whether Holmeport, through Mr Campbell Holmes, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of the statements made by him to Mr Ruaro in 1996 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">&#8226; Whether there was a breach of the warranty implied by s 74(1) of the Trade Practices Act that the services supplied by Holmeport to Mr and Mrs Ruaro under the Mooring Agreement would be rendered with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">&#8226; Whether there was a warranty implied by s 74(2) of the Trade Practices Act that the services supplied by Holmeport to Mr and Mrs Ruaro under the Mooring Agreement would be reasonably fit for the purpose of mooring Seaquest; in particular, whether Mr and Mrs Ruaro made that purpose known to Holmeport or whether the circumstances showed that Mr and Mrs Ruaro did not rely on any skill or judgment on the part of Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">&#8226; Whether Holmeport was under a duty to Mr and Mrs Ruaro to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the moorings of vessels in the environment of Seaquest's mooring were suitable for the vessels attached thereto and did not create a danger by moving across the sea bed within the environment of Seaquest's mooring ( the secure mooring duty ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">&#8226; Whether Holmeport was under a duty to Mr and Mrs Ruaro to take all reasonable precautions to avoid damage to other vessels in the vicinity of Pavana by keeping a proper lookout in times of windy weather and providing a caretaker with a vessel with adequate towing power in the event that there was a risk of collision by vessels ( the proper look out duty ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">&#8226; Whether the provisions of the Mooring Agreement were such as to exclude such duties of care and, if so, whether any such provision is void by the operation of s 68 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">&#8226; Whether there was a breach of any warranty implied by s 74 or a breach of the secure mooring duty; in particular, whether the swing mooring to which Pavana was attached ought to have been capable of resisting drag in weather conditions that, on average, occur on Sydney Harbour more frequently than once every 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">&#8226; The value of Seaquest at the time of its destruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">
 
 CONTRAVENTION OF SECTION 52 OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
54 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that the statements made by Mr Holmes to Mr Ruaro on the two occasions outlined above, in 1996 and 2000, were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">They say that, by those statements, Holmeport, through Mr Holmes, represented to Mr Ruaro, that the mooring provided for Seaquest, and its environment, constitute a safe mooring for Seaquest and that the mooring and its environment are and will be suitable for the purpose of mooring Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">55 Mr and Mrs Ruaro say that they were representations with respect to a future matter and that Mr Holmes did not have any reasonable grounds for making them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">They also say that, because Holmeport adduced no evidence that it had reasonable grounds to make the representation, Holmeport is deemed, by the operation of s 51A(2) of the Trade Practices Act , not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">They say, in addition, that the representations were continuing representations that continued until the destruction of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">56 The first question is whether the representation pleaded arises from the statements made by Mr Holmes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">I do not consider, on a fair reading of the exchange between Mr Ruaro and Mr Holmes in 1996, which is set out above (see paragraph [6]), that the exchange constituted the representation alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">It is clear from the language of the exchange deposed to by Mr Ruaro, which was not disputed, that Mr Ruaro's concern related to the possibility of Seaquest being moved, and being damaged in the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">When Mr Holmes said that Seaquest would be " fine just there right where it is ", he was not making a representation about the safety or the environment of the mooring to which Seaquest was attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">He was allaying Mr Ruaro's concerns that Holmeport might attempt to move Seaquest and cause damage to it by doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Holmeport did not, in 1996, make the representations alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Accordingly, there can be no question of the alleged representations being continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">57 The exchange that occurred in September 2000 was in a similar vein to the earlier exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Mr Ruaro's expressed concern was that, if he removed Seaquest to Drummoyne for the purposes of having it slipped, presumably for the purpose of carrying out renovation work, the mooring that he had may not be available when he returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The thrust of Mr Holmes' statement was not directed to the safety or the environment of the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Rather, he was merely allaying Mr Ruaro's concerns that, when Seaquest was returned to Rose Bay, he might not have the same mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The exchange that took place in September 2000 did not constitute the alleged representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Similarly, there can be no question of the alleged representations being continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">58 The question of whether the alleged representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, therefore, does not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Properly understood, the statements made by Mr Holmes were to the effect that Seaquest would not be moved from its mooring and that the mooring would continue to be available for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Indeed, it is clear from Mr Ruaro's evidence, that he understood the statements made by Mr Holmes in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">59 The third question that would arise, if the representations alleged were made out, was whether Mr and Mrs Ruaro suffered damage by the conduct alleged, within the meaning of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">That question would require consideration of whether there was a causal connection between the loss of Seaquest and the statements made by Mr Holmes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Mr and Mrs Ruaro alleged that, in reliance upon the statements made by Mr Holmes, Mr Ruaro signed the Mooring Agreement and did not move Seaquest from its mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">60 However, Mr Ruaro gave no evidence that he understood the statements made by Mr Holmes constituted the representation alleged that he was induced to sign the Mooring Agreement and not to move Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Rather, he did not understand that Mr Holmes was telling him that the Seaquest mooring and its environment constituted a safe mooring for Seaquest and that the environment of the mooring would be suitable for the purpose of mooring Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Mr Ruaro gave no evidence of any such understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">61 Mr and Mrs Ruaro have not established that they have a cause of action based on contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act on the part of Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">SECTION 74(1) OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
62 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that the Mooring Agreement contained an implied term that all services to be provided by Holmeport pursuant to the Mooring Agreement would be provided with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">They say that the mooring services provided pursuant to the Mooring Agreement, including the selection of the environment within which those services were performed, were not provided with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">63 The notion of a non-exclusive licence to attach a vessel to a swing mooring of the kind in question does not fit felicitously within the ordinary English concept of " services ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">However, it is common ground that the extended meaning of that term would include the rights arising under the Mooring Agreement, consisting of the non-exclusive licence to attach Seaquest to the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">That right was provided by Holmeport without hindrance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Seaquest's mooring held fast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">64 The rights conferred on Mr and Mrs Ruaro by the Mooring Agreement did not extend to the safekeeping of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Indeed, the express terms of the Mooring Agreement provide to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">I do not consider that the services provided under the Mooring Agreement, being the right to the use or enjoyment of the mooring under a non-exclusive licence, was provided by Holmeport otherwise than with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Indeed, it is difficult to comprehend, in the present context, what care and skill would be entailed in the mere offering of a person to use a facility that, of itself, was sound.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The position may be different, of course, if the mooring to which Seaquest was attached was inadequate to restrain Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">That may have involved a failure to provide the relevant services with due care and skill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">That, however, is not this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">There was no breach of the warranty implied by s 74(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">SECTION 74(2) OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
65 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that the Mooring Agreement contained an implied term pursuant to s 74(2) , that all services, including the locating of the mooring for Seaquest pursuant to the Mooring Agreement, would be reasonably fit for the purpose of providing a mooring and its concomitant environment for Seaquest and would be of such a nature and quality that they might reasonably be expected to achieve that result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">They rely on the same facts and circumstances as are relied upon as constituting a breach of the secure mooring duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">66 However, there is a prior question in relation to s 74(2) , namely, whether a warranty such as is alleged was implied in the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">No such warranty will be implied unless Mr and Mrs Ruaro, either expressly or by implication, made known to Holmeport, the particular purpose for which the relevant services were required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Further, the warranty will not be implied where the circumstances show that Mr and Mrs Ruaro did not rely, or that it was unreasonable for them to rely, on Holmeport's skill and judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">67 Mr and Mrs Ruaro point to Mr Ruaro's discussions with Mr Holmes in 1996 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">They say that, in those conversations, Mr and Mrs Ruaro made known to Mr Holmes the purpose for which the non-exclusive licence to use the mooring was required, namely, the mooring of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Clearly, the discussion in 2000 cannot be relevant to the implication of a warranty in the Mooring Agreement, which was made in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">68 It is clear enough that Mr Ruaro made known to Mr Holmes the purpose for which Mr and Mrs Ruaro required the non-exclusive licence to use the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">However, I consider that the circumstances show that Mr and Mrs Ruaro did not rely on any skill or judgment on the part of Mr Holmes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Further, in the circumstances, it would be unreasonable for them to rely on any particular skill or judgment, having regard to the terms of the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">69 Seaquest had been moored at the Point Piper marina for several years before the Mooring Agreement was signed and before Mr Ruaro and Mr Holmes had their conversation in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">There was no suggestion, in 1996, that Mr Ruaro wished to take Seaquest away from the Point Piper marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The only question is whether he would enter into a written agreement with respect to the use of the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">He wanted to ensure that he retained the same mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">He had chosen Holmeport's marina as being convenient for his purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">In the circumstances, I consider that it is clear that he did not rely on Mr Holmes' skill and judgment as to the adequacy of the mooring in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">He was apparently disappointed by the lack of professionalism shown by Mr Holmes' predecessor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">That, however, had nothing to do with reliance upon Mr Holmes' skill and judgment as to the adequacy of the Seaquest mooring as a mooring for Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">70 Further, the terms of the Mooring Agreement confirm that that is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Mr Ruaro was asked to sign the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">He read it carefully enough for him to notice Condition 4, such that he queried what he characterised as an " exoneration clause ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Indeed, immediately above his signature was the statement that he had carefully read the Mooring Agreement, including the conditions printed overleaf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">There is every reason, therefore, to conclude that he also read Condition 7, whereby he expressly acknowledged and warranted that he had examined the facilities and relied on his own judgment in accepting the use of the facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">It is clear, in all of the circumstances, that Mr and Mrs Ruaro did not rely on the skill and judgment of Holmeport or Mr Holmes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">71 Section 68 of the Trade Practices Act has no operation in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Section 74(2) in its terms recognises that there will be circumstances where no term is implied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Section 68 does not have the effect of nullifying the qualification in s 74(2) itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">DUTY OF CARE 
 
72 Mr and Mrs Ruaro allege that Holmeport owed duties of care to them in two respects as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; To take all reasonable measures to ensure that the moorings of boats in the environment of the Seaquest mooring were suitable for the vessels attached thereto and did not create a danger by moving across the seabed within the environment of the Seaquest mooring so as to collide with the Seaquest ( the secure mooring duty ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">&#8226; To take all reasonable precautions to avoid damage to Seaquest by keeping a proper lookout in times of windy weather and providing a caretaker with a vessel with adequate towing power in the event that there was a risk of collision by vessels at the Point Piper marina ( the proper lookout duty ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">
 

73 As to the proper lookout duty, the real issue was whether such a duty arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">If it did, there was essentially no dispute that the duty was not discharged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">That is to say, Holmeport accepts that it did not keep any lookout in times of windy weather or provide a caretaker in order to avoid damage to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The question of breach of the secure mooring duty depends upon whether mooring number 60 ought to have been capable of resisting drag in the weather conditions that occurred on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">I shall deal with that question later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">74 The existence of the two duties must be considered in the context of the relationship that existed between Holmeport and Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">That, in turn, depends, to some extent, on the terms of the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">75 In their second further amended statement of claim, Mr and Mrs Ruaro make the following allegations in support of the existence of the alleged duties of care:
 
 
 &#8226; Holmeport ought reasonably to have foreseen that, when it laid and provided a mooring for Pavana that was of such weight and configuration that it was likely to move when Pavana was moored to it, the environment of the Seaquest mooring would be rendered dangerous to Seaquest because Pavana would drag its mooring and collide with nearby vessels including Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">&#8226; Mr and Mrs Ruaro were part of a special, ascertainable class who might suffer economic loss by reason that the Pavana mooring was inadequate or not fit for the purpose of mooring Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">&#8226; Mr and Mrs Ruaro were vulnerable to loss from a collision between Seaquest and the Pavana resulting from Pavana's dragging its mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">
 

76 While those factors may well give rise to a duty on the part of Holmeport to take reasonable measures to ensure that the mooring of Pavana was suitable for Pavana, I do not consider that those factors give rise to a duty on the part of Holmeport to keep a proper lookout in times of windy weather and provide a caretaker with a vessel with adequate towing power in the event of a risk of collision, in order to avoid damage to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">77 The latter conclusion is reinforced by the terms of the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The relationship between Holmeport and Mr and Mrs Ruaro was a contractual one, under which Holmeport granted to Mr and Mrs Ruaro the right to use and occupy its facilities to moor Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">By Condition 4 of the Mooring Agreement, Mr and Mrs Ruaro agreed that Holmeport was not to be liable for the care and protection of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">That is to say, they agreed that Holmeport was not to be responsible for the care and protection of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Further, they acknowledged that they had examined the facilities that were the subject of the Mooring Agreement and relied on their own judgment in accepting the use of the facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Mr and Mrs Ruaro were paying a fixed monthly sum for the use of the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">They were paying no fee for the safe keeping of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">I do not consider that Holmeport was, in the circumstances, under a duty to keep a proper lookout in times of windy weather or to provide a caretaker with a vessel with adequate towing power in the event that there was a risk of collision in order to avoid damage to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">78 The terms of the secure mooring duty alleged are curious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Mr and Mrs Ruaro allege a duty to take reasonable measures to ensure that the moorings of boats in the environment of Seaquest were suitable for the vessels attached to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">They allege that that duty was owed to them as members of a special ascertainable class who might suffer economic loss by a mooring in the environment in which the members of that class had moored vessels, being a mooring that: 
 
&#8226; was inadequate for the purpose of mooring Pavana;
 
&#8226; was not fit for the purposes of mooring Pavana; or 
 
&#8226; was not suitable for Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">79 Holmeport also placed reliance on the indemnity contained in Condition 3(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">By that provision, Mr and Mrs Ruaro agreed that they would indemnify and keep indemnified Holmeport from all actions and claims for which Holmeport might become liable in respect of or arising from loss or damage to any property arising out of the use of " the Facilities " or any act or omission by Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">As a matter of construction, I do not consider that that provision would entitle Holmeport to be indemnified by Mr and Mrs Ruaro in respect of any liability that Holmeport might be held to have to Mr and Mrs Ruaro in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">I consider that the provision should be construed as an agreement to indemnify Holmeport in respect of any liability that Holmeport might incur by reason of acts or omissions on the part of Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">It follows, therefore, that, whatever the outcome of the claim by Mr and Mrs Ruaro might be, Holmeport's cross-claim should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">To the extent that there have been costs attributable solely to the cross-claim, Holmeport should pay those costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">80 Nevertheless, the terms of Condition 3(b) have a bearing on the question of whether or not Holmeport owed a duty to Mr and Mrs Ruaro in the terms of the secure mooring duty as alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">That is to say, the Mooring Agreement must be construed as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">In particular, Condition 4 must be construed in the light of the other conditions of the Mooring Agreement and the relationship that it created between Mr and Mrs Ruaro and Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">Holmeport contends that the effect of the Mooring Agreement, and Conditions 4 and 11 in particular, is that the secure mooring duty, as alleged, did not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">81 Condition 3(b) evinces a clear intention that Mr and Mrs Ruaro were to bear the risk of any liability that might be incurred by Holmeport arising out of the use of the facilities by Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">That is emphasised by Condition 3(j), whereby Mr and Mrs Ruaro agree to take out and maintain proper and adequate insurance in respect of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">While Condition 3(j) refers to " the Craft ", it is clear that that is intended to refer to the marine craft, particulars of which were inserted in the appropriate box on the front of the Mooring Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">While Condition 3(j) refers specifically to public liability insurance, its terms clearly also include insurance of the Craft against any loss of or damage to the Craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">The provision is part of the overall scheme of the Mooring Agreement, which is clearly designed to limit the obligations of Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">82 Condition 4 of the Mooring Agreement must be understood against that scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">The syntax of the second part of Condition 4 is not easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">It is clearly intended to exonerate Holmeport from some liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Clearly enough, Holmeport is not to be liable for any loss or damage, however caused, which may be suffered or incurred by or in respect of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Clearly, Mr and Mrs Ruaro suffered damage and loss in respect of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">83 In a sense, Condition 4 operates fortuitously in favour of Holmeport in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Clearly enough, Condition 4 was intended to operate in circumstances where, by reason of some deficiency in the mooring assigned to Seaquest, Seaquest became adrift and suffered damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Nevertheless, Condition 4 is applicable in its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">As a matter of contract, Mr and Mrs Ruaro agreed that Holmeport would not be liable for any loss or damage suffered or incurred by or in respect of Seaquest, however caused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">As a matter of contract, they have agreed not to hold Holmeport responsible for any loss or damage by or in respect of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I do not consider that Holmeport owed the secure mooring duty to Mr and Mrs Ruaro as alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">Accordingly, subject to the operation of s 68 of the Trade Practices Act , I do not consider that Holmeport has any liability in tort for breach of the alleged secure mooring duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">OPERATION OF SECTION 68 OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
84 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contended that the conditions of the Mooring Agreement to which I have referred above purport to exclude, restrict or modify or have the effect of excluding, restricting or modifying the application of s 74 of the Trade Practices Act and any liability of Holmeport for breach of the warranties implied by s 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">They say that, therefore, those conditions are void by the operation of s 68 of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Accordingly, they say, the conditions can have no effect in relation to the question of the existence of a duty of care, the breach of which would give rise to a liability in tort under the general law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">85 I do not consider that s 68 of the Trade Practices Act operates to render Condition 4 void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">I consider that the effect of s 68 is to render a term of a contract void only to the extent that it modifies the operation of, relevantly, s 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Section 68 is not designed to strike down valid contractual arrangements except in so far as the arrangements are designed to exclude the benefits intended to be conferred by provisions such as s 74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">ADEQUACY OF MOORING 60 TO RESTRAIN PAVANA 
 
86 In the light of the conclusions that I have reached, it is not strictly necessary to deal with the question of the adequacy of mooring number 60 as a mooring for Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Nevertheless, that question was a substantial issue in the proceeding and it is appropriate that I express the conclusions that I would reach as to whether there was a breach of the secure mooring duty or a breach of a warranty implied by s 74(2) of the Trade Practices Act , if I had concluded that Holmeport owed the secure mooring duty or that a warranty was implied by s 74(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The question, as I apprehend the contentions of the parties, is whether Holmeport took reasonable measures to ensure that Pavana's mooring was adequate to hold Pavana in conditions that could reasonably be expected in Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">87 Mr and Mrs Ruaro alleged that Holmeport was in breach of the secure mooring duty and of the s 74(2) warranty in so far as Holmeport:
 
 
 &#8226; failed to check the condition and adequacy of mooring number 60 for Pavana;
 &#8226; failed to supply an adequate mooring block for Pavana to ensure that the mooring would not be dragged by Pavana;
 &#8226; failed to ensure that mooring number 60 was adequate for the purpose of mooring Pavana so that it would not drag;
 &#8226; failed to ensure that Pavana was allocated to a mooring that was appropriate for its use;
 &#8226; caused Pavana to be moored to mooring number 60 when Holmeport knew or ought to have known that mooring number 60 would not be adequate to hold Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">
 

88 There is no accepted design or methodology for the design of swing moorings in Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Components of mooring systems are assembled and installed by mooring contractors based on experience and judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">However, Mr and Mrs Ruaro say that, even if there was no standard practice at the time for the laying of moorings or the allocation of moorings to boats, such a lack of a consistent industry practice is not a defence to their claims of breach of duty and breach of warranty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">89 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that Holmeport was under a duty to ensure, or alternatively, warranted, that the Pavana mooring was reasonably fit to withstand wind conditions more severe than the conditions that occurred on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">They conducted the proceeding on the basis that the issue was whether the mooring to which Pavana was attached ought to have been capable of holding her in weather conditions of a 50 year average recurrence interval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Average recurrence interval is a means of defining the frequency of an event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Thus, a 50 year average recurrence interval event is an event that is, on average, going to occur or be exceeded once in every 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">90 Mr and Mrs Ruaro point to the evidence that conditions of the severity that was experienced in Rose Bay on 24 August 2003 occur, on average, much more frequently than once every 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">They say that, therefore, there was a breach of the secure mooring duty and of the s 74(2) warranty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">91 Holmeport, on the other hand, does not accept that an arbitrary criterion of a 50 year average recurrence interval is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">It says that, in any event, mooring number 60 was adequate for Pavana and the conditions of 24 August 2003 were so exceptional that it ought not be held responsible for the failure of mooring number 60 to hold Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">92 Mr and Mrs Ruaro rely on the evidence of Mr Gregory William Britton, a well qualified engineer, who is the principal of Patterson Britton &amp; Partners Pty Ltd and who has 28 years experience in coastal maritime and environmental engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">Mr Britton was asked to express his opinion as to whether mooring number 60 was, on 24 August 2003, reasonably adequate for a vessel of the dimensions, displacement, weight and design of Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">In his written opinion, Mr Britton said that, in order to assess the adequacy of mooring number 60, it was necessary to estimate its holding capacity as installed and the holding capacity that might reasonably have been provided in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">93 Mr Britton said that the holding capacity of a mooring is a function of a range of factors, including the following:
 
&#8226; type of seabed;
 
&#8226; the weight of the anchoring mass; and 
 
&#8226; the scope of the mooring line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">94 The seabed in the area of mooring number 60 in Rose Bay is sandy silt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">Sand has a more consisting holding power than mud or silt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The weight of the anchoring mass of mooring number 60 was one tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Scope is the ratio of the length of total mooring line from the anchor block to the water surface, divided by the water depth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The total mooring line length of mooring number 60 was approximately 25 m, comprising 11 m of chain, 1 m of anti-chafe line and 13 m of silver rope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The water depth at the mooring at low tide was approximately 12 m. On that basis, the scope of the mooring line of mooring number 60 would have been 2:1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">That is typical of the scope of moorings in Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">95 The tendency for a mooring to drag is resisted by the frictional force between the sea bed and the anchoring mass, being the concrete blocks in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">That is dependent on the buoyant mass of the blocks, reduction in that weight due to the lift force and the coefficient of friction between the blocks and the sea bed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Concrete blocks having a mass in air of 1 tonne would have a buoyant mass of 0.6 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">The lift force will depend upon the environmental conditions such as wind and wave effects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">A typical coefficient of friction between concrete and sand is 0.5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Thus, the holding efficiency of concrete blocks would be expected to be less than half the combined weight of the concrete blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">96 In his written opinion, Mr Britton referred to Australian Standard AS4997-2005, entitled Guidelines for the Design of Maritime Structures ( AS4997 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">AS4997 sets out guidelines for the design of structures in a marine environment and is intended to cover the design of near shore coastal and estuarine structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">It specifies the structures the design of which it is intended to cover, including berthing dolphins and floating berths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">It does not mention swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">While AS4997 was not published until 2005, a draft, in essentially the same terms, was circulated for public comment in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">97 Section 5 of AS4997 is concerned with ' Design Actions '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Clause 5.1 provides that the design for ultimate strength, serviceability, stability and other relevant limit states for maritime structures should take into account the appropriate design actions, including wind actions, current and debris actions and wave actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Clause 5.4 deals with " Wind Actions " and says that wind actions on vessels and floating structures may be designed using a wind pressure based on a 30 second gust rather than basic wind speeds due to 3 second gusts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The reason is that floating structures have a delayed response to wind loads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">98 Clause 5.5 of AS4997 deals with " Current Actions " and provides that the design strength of maritime structures should allow for the combined effects of tidal and river estuarine flood currents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Clause 5.9 deals with " Wave Actions " and clause 5.9.2 refers to " Design Wave Heights ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Clause 5.9.2 provides that the design strength of maritime structures should allow for the highest wave likely to occur on the structure over the selected design life and an annual probability of exceedence based on the function category of the facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">99 Table 5.4 of AS4997 shows the " Annual Probability of Exceedance of Design Wave Events " for structures of various design lives and function categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">It shows that the design working life of small craft facilities is 25 years and that the probability of exceedance of design wave events of structures presenting a low degree of hazard to life or property, being small craft facilities, is 1 in 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">100 Section 6 of AS4997 is concerned with " Durability ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Clause 6.1 provides that maritime structures are generally sited in very aggressive environments for normal structural materials and suggests that the design of maritime structures should include consideration of the requirements to withstand the aggressive environment while the structure remains serviceable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Clause 6.2.1, under the heading " Design Life ", provides that, at the end of the design life, the structure should have adequate strength to resist ultimate loads and be serviceable, but may have reached a stage where further deterioration will result in inadequate structural capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">Table 6.1, which follows that clause, specifies a design life of 25 years for small craft facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">101 In oral evidence, Mr Britton also referred to Marina Guidelines , published by the New South Wales Department of Public Works in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Mr Britton said that the Marina Guidelines were superseded when AS4997 was introduced, such that AS4997 embodies some 20 years or so of practice in the relevant area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Mr Britton and his firm were involved in the preparation of the Marina Guidelines and in the preparation of AS4997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">102 The objectives of the Marina Guidelines were to identify the principal issues that should be considered by the proponents, designers and reviewers of marina proposals and to provide sound technical advice on design concepts for marinas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Section 5 of the Marina Guidelines deals with natural forces in the marine environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Clause 5.1 states that wind and wave action can be the major cause of structural damage at a marina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Clause 5.3 provides that wind loads should be determined using a design wind pressure based on a " steady state " wind speed, rather than the speed of wind gusts, because the higher gust loads are seldom transmitted to the mooring system owing to the inertia of the boats and floatation units and the flexibility of mooring lines and piles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Clause 5.3 suggests that a mean return period of 50 years for the design wind is recommended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">103 Mr Britton said that the concept of an average recurrence interval is adopted quite regularly as a risk based approach to the design of small craft facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">He said that it had certainly been adopted within the New South Wales Public Works Department and by other people who are involved in the design of marinas or small craft facilities generically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">104 In his written opinion, Mr Britton said that AS4997 " provides some guidance for the design event that might reasonably be adopted ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">He also said that, based on table 5.4 in AS4997, " it could be argued that an event having an average recurrence interval between 50 and 200 years should be adopted " [emphasis added].</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">In his oral evidence, Mr Britton said that the Marina Guidelines were generally accepted in New South Wales and that he regarded the reference to a return period of 50 years as confirming his opinion that it could be argued that an event having an average recurrence interval of at least 50 years should be adopted as the criterion for the holding capacity of a swing mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">105 Mr Britton expressed his opinion in oral evidence that there was not a lot of difference between the considerations that should be taken into account in relation to marinas, on the one hand, and swing moorings, on the other, in so far as they are both small craft facilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">He said that the consequence of failure in a marina is really no different from failure in a mooring: vessels will become adrift and may be damaged or may damage other vessels or other structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Mr Britton said that he would not regard a vessel on a mooring as different in any significant way from a vessel on a marina berth, in terms of the consequences of something going wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">He did not see the design of a swing mooring as being any different from the design philosophy used for marinas in determining wind loads.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">On that basis, he said that he would advise a client to adopt a 50 average recurrence interval as the relevant design event for a swing mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">106 Mr Britton explained that his reasoning process for that conclusion was that it is a balanced risk based judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">He said that there is a certain likelihood of such an event occurring on average, once in every 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">If it does occur, the consequence could be substantial damage to the particular vessel, damage to other vessels and potential damage to life as a result of people trying to rescue vessels in such circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">He expressed the opinion that the standard to be adopted required a determination of the likelihood and consequences of failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">107 In the course of cross-examination, Mr Britton accepted that what happens in relation to swing moorings on Sydney Harbour has really been based on local knowledge and information passed down, almost, from father to son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Mr Britton agreed that there are a number of well-known mooring industry families.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">He agreed that a great deal of experience had been built up by people involved in laying and servicing moorings, replacing moorings and in all activities involving moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">He accepted that, in effect, there have been no designs or design standards that have been used in the mooring industry on Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">108 Mr Britton was not aware of the use of the concept of average recurrence interval in relation to swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">He said that swing moorings have not received a lot of regulation and there are very few industry standards in terms of their design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">He said that, so far as he is aware, the concept of an average recurrence interval has not been written down in relation to swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">In his experience, moorings are put in place by mooring contractors who have rules of thumb that they have developed over a number of years of experience, often handed down through family members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">He explained that the rules of thumb depend upon size of vessel, water depth, and scope of mooring lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">109 Mr Warwick J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Hood AO is a consulting naval architect and marine transport consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">He has been in private practice for some 43 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">He has achieved great distinction as a naval architect and has appeared frequently to give evidence in litigation involving issues in which he has relevant training and experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">110 In 1989, Mr Hood was a member of the Committee of Inquiry into Moorings for Recreational Craft in New South Wales, which examined all aspects of moorings including:
 
 
 &#8226; the demand for moorings;
 &#8226; typical mooring areas, such as Woodford Bay in the Lane Cove River and Rushcutters Bay in Sydney Harbour;
 &#8226; typical mooring apparatus, including single swing, two point limited swing and trot mooring systems;
 &#8226; typical loads on mooring apparatus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">
 

Mr Hood was asked, in particular, to measure the loads on such systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">111 Mr Hood conducted several tests designed to measure boats on mooring lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Three moorings on which he conducted tests were located off Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, at Kirribilli, and one was located in the Parramatta River at Putney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">Each mooring block had a mass of 1 tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">The three moorings at Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, after an initial resistance of up to 1.2 tonnes, showed a resistance to dragging of between 0.9 and 1.1 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The mooring at Putney, which appeared to have sunk into mud, showed an initial resistance of about 1.2 tonnes and then showed a resistance of about 1 tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Mr Hood concluded that the steady dragging load in a mooring apparatus is approximately equal to the mass of its block, although the " break out " load is slightly higher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">112 In his written opinion Mr Hood said that, based on the specifications of the Pavana and the wind speeds recorded for 23 August 2004, mooring number 60 should have been adequate to hold Pavana without dragging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Accordingly, in his opinion, the reason for the failure of the mooring to hold Pavana was extreme and unusual weather, causing extreme pitching of Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">113 Mr Hood observed that the winds on 24 August 2003 were predominantly from the north-west and that, while Holmeport's marina is itself protected from winds from the north-west by the high ground of Point Piper, mooring number 60 was located in such a position that it would have been subjected to the full force of the wind, because little protection is provided by the low land and buildings of Woollahra Point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">114 Mr Hood assumed that the wave action at the location of mooring number 60 was the result of the full force of the wind and a fetch of about 3 km to the north-west across the Harbour from the location of the mooring towards Cremorne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Fetch is the distance over which the wind blows in order to make waves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Mr Hood expressed his opinion that, assuming the wind speed was about 70 km per hour and the fetch was about 3 km in 12 metres of water, waves would have a height of about 0.76 m and a period of about 3 seconds at the location of mooring number 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Mr Hood said that it is impossible to estimate accurately the effect that waves of that height and period would have on a vessel like Pavana without much more information than was available to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">However, having regard to his experience with yachts of similar size and configuration to Pavana, Mr Hood considered that it was possible that Pavana was pitching with considerable amplitude: the period of encounter with the waves could have been close to the natural period of pitch when the amplitude of pitch would have been increased because of resonance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">115 Mr Hood provided calculations concerning the effect of the wind speeds of 24 August 2003 on Pavana when attached to mooring number 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">The calculations assumed an area of Pavana that would be exposed to the wind, which Mr Hood referred to as the flat plate area .</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">For a wind speed of 70 km per hour, the necessary flat plate area that would need to be exposed to the wind to develop a load of 1 tonne, the load necessary to drag Pavana's mooring, would be about 360 square feet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Since the beam of Pavana was 14.10 feet, the height of the " flat plate " would need to be 25.5 feet in order to produce a flat plate area of 360 square feet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Mr Hood considered that it was unlikely, from his limited knowledge of Pavana, that, with a beam of 14.10 feet, there would be sufficient height to create a flat plate of 360 square feet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">116 Allowing for a wind speed of 109 km per hour, the maximum gust speed between 5 pm and 5.30 pm, the flat plate area would need to be about 162 square feet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">With a beam of 14.10 feet, the area exposed to the wind would need to be 11.5 feet high to achieve a load of 1 tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Mr Hood also considered that that was unlikely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">117 In the light of the calculations, Mr Hood concluded that mooring number 60 should have been adequate to hold a vessel of Pavana's specifications without dragging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">It was for that reason that he concluded that the weather must have been so extreme and unusual as to cause extreme pitching of Pavana, thereby causing the mooring number 60 to drag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">118 Mr Peeters has, on behalf of Polaris, been responsible for the maintenance of approximately 20% of the 6,500 moorings in Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Many of the moorings that he has serviced are swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">In particular, he has serviced swing moorings located as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; Sydney Amateurs Yacht Club, on the Cremorne side of Mosman Bay: all are a minimum of 1 tonne, although some are two 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">&#8226; Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club, on Felix Bay, on the northern side of Point Piper: some are 1/2 tonne moorings and some are 1 tonne moorings, having rather small boats on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">&#8226; Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, in Rushcutters Bay: temporary moorings are laid at the time of the commencement of the Sydney/Hobart Yacht Race; they are 1 tonne blocks, although a few have two 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">&#8226; Royal Motor Yacht Club, next door to the Point Piper marina in Rose Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Mr Peeters first serviced them in 2000 and put down blocks of a minimum of 2 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">&#8226; Royal Australian Navy Sailing Association, in Rushcutters Bay: there are 1/2 tonne and 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">&#8226; Balmoral Marina, in Middle Harbour, there are 1/2 tonne and 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">&#8226; Double Bay Marina in Double Bay, the bay on the other side of Point Piper from Rose Bay has 1/2 tonne and 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">
 

119 Mr Peeters has also laid moorings for many private individuals in Sydney Harbour with a minimum of a 1 tonne block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">Mr Peeters said that, in his experience, the material of construction of a vessel makes no difference to the mooring required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">The important aspect is the " windage ", which affects the force put against a vessel by wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The windage is the area of a vessel that will be exposed to the wind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The greater the windage, the greater will be the force applied to the vessel by wind of a given velocity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">120 Mr Peeters explained that a schooner rigged yacht would not have as high a windage as the same sized motor boat or cruiser, with, for example, a big cabin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">Mr Peeters prescribed a minimum of 2 tonnes for the moorings for Royal Motor Yacht Club in Rose Bay because all of the vessels moored there are cruisers: Royal Motor Yacht Club is a motor boat club and not a yacht club and all of the boats, regardless of their size and length, have a high windage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">121 Mr Peeters said that, apart from the moorings of the Royal Motor Yacht Club in Rose Bay, there were very few moorings with more than a single 1 tonne block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">Mr Peeters said that he had experience of no more than three vessels of specifications similar to Pavana that were moored on swing moorings of two 1 tonne blocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">They were located in Rushcutters Bay and Parramatta River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">122 Mr Peeters has not given consideration to the concept of an average recurrence interval in determining the appropriate block for a given swing mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Rather, his experience is limited to placing such blocks as his client requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">That is to be expected, since Mr Peeters could never know the dimensions of a vessel that might thereafter be moored to one of the swing moorings that he laid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">123 Mr Peeters also gave oral evidence about the effect of suction on a mooring when it is being serviced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">He explained that the force needed to break the suction and lift a concrete block from the sea bed normally exceeds the mass of the block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Force is exerted until the suction breaks, after which the block can be lifted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">That is consistent with Mr Hood's experience concerning the break out load of a concrete block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">124 Mr Britton was an impressive witness and clearly a highly competent engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">On the other hand, it is clear enough from his evidence that, prior to being asked to provide an opinion in relation to the incident of 24 August 2003, he had not previously turned his attention to design criteria for swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">His expertise is in relation to the design of marinas and similar structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">The Marina Guidelines and AS4997 are concerned with the same structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">125 A distinction can be drawn between marinas, on the one hand, and a swing mooring, on the other, in so far as the latter is a stand alone facility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">On the other hand, a swing mooring must be adequate to restrain the vessel moored to it, at least in conditions that are such as might reasonably be expected in the location where the mooring is situated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">If a mooring is not adequate to restrain a vessel, damage, not only to the vessel, but to other property, may follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Further, it must be remembered that the criteria in AS4997 are based on a working life of small craft facilities, with which AS4997 is concerned, of 25 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">While Mr Britton, for the reasons outlined above, considered that it was reasonable to adopt the same criteria for swing moorings, there was no evidence as to the design working life of swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">126 I do not consider that failure to ensure that a particular mooring can withstand weather conditions that might occur more frequently than once every 50 years is necessarily the appropriate criterion for determining the standard of care required to avoid damage to property or to determine the fitness of a mooring for a particular vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Certainly, industry practice is not of itself the determinant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">What is normally done is not necessarily not negligent or reasonably appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">127 However, the difficulty with the one in 50 year criterion suggested by Mr Britton is that it is by no means clear, from the evidence, as to what weight of mooring block would be adequate to restrain a vessel of the dimensions of Pavana in weather conditions of the severity that occurs no more frequently than once every 50 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">There is certainly no industry criterion applicable in Sydney Harbour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">128 While Mr Britton is clearly an expert in his field, his opinions concerning swing moorings are hypothetical and argumentative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">That is to say, in his written opinion, he expressed no opinion but simply said that AS4997 provides some guidance and that it could be argued that a 1 in 50 year event should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">129 The effect of ss 76 and 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) is that evidence of an opinion will not be admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed unless the person who gives the opinion has specialised knowledge and the opinion given about the existence of a fact in issue is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">While Mr Britton has a great deal of knowledge and experience in relation to maritime structures, he acknowledged that he has not really turned his mind to the question of swing moorings such as those in question in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Mr Britton's written opinion proceeded by way of analogy and, at best, did no more than advance a tentative argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Even in his oral evidence, Mr Britton's opinion was one based on reasoning by analogy from his experience of maritime structures such as marinas, rather than any experience of the behaviour of swing moorings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">While there was no objection to Mr Britton's opinion evidence on the basis that it did not satisfy s 79 of the Evidence Act , it may well have been rejected had there been an objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Be that as it may, I have had regard to the opinion, but have discounted the weight to be given to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">130 On the whole, the evidence as to the adequacy of mooring number 60 for Pavana is somewhat unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Both Mr Peeters and Mr Hood considered that the " windage " of a vessel was significant in determining whether a mooring was adequate to restrain the vessel in relevant conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Mr Hood's opinion is that, from the somewhat limited assumptions he made as to the windage of Pavana, a one tonne mooring ought to have been adequate to restrain it in the conditions that prevailed on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">He surmised, therefore, that there must have been highly unusual wave effects that resulted in extreme pitching of Pavana so as to cause it to drag mooring number 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">131 There was no evidence that the combination of circumstances that led to the destruction of Seaquest were foreseeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">It may have been foreseeable that, if weather conditions that occur once every five to ten years prevailed, mooring number 60 may not be adequate to restrain Pavana from dragging the mooring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">It would also be reasonably foreseeable that, if Pavana dragged its mooring, it may come into collision with another vessel in the vicinity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">However, it appears to have been unusually bad luck that resulted in some part of Pavana or its mooring line cutting the mooring line of Seaquest, so as to allow Seaquest to become fully adrift and be blown to its destruction against the Roses Bay sea wall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Nevertheless, Holmeport did not contend that the damage that was actually occasioned to Seaquest was not reasonably foreseeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Clearly enough, on the evidence, dragging of moorings is a risk that is known and is therefore foreseeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">132 The winds recorded at Fort Denison and Wedding Cake West on 24 August 2003 were such as might be expected to occur at least once in every 5 or 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">On the other hand, the eye witness reports to which I have referred indicate that the weather conditions in Rose Bay on that day were fierce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">The fact that Pavanna dragged its mooring for some 200 metres appears to me to be quite extraordinary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">There was no evidence to suggest that anything other than exceptional conditions could have led to that occurrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Mr Hood's evidence was directed to that very question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">Further, the fact that seven or eight vessels were stranded on the sand in Double Bay, on the other side of Point Piper from Rose Bay, suggests exceptional conditions, although there was no evidence as to the size or other dimensions of those stranded vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">When Mr Peeters lifted mooring number 60, he found that all of its components were intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">The conditions must have been particularly exceptional for Pavana to have dragged the mooring as far as it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">133 Mr and Mrs Ruaro point to the suggestion made by Mr Peeters to Ms Kearney-Hayes that the outside moorings should be as heavy as possible and that two one tonne blocks should be put down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">However, Mr Peeters was not expressing any view as to the adequacy of a mooring for any particular vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">There was no vessel on mooring number 60 when Mr Peeters carried out his work and he did not no suggest that one tonne was insufficient for a vessel of the dimensions of Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">The observations made by Mr Peeters, therefore, must simply be regarded as referring to the fact that the outside moorings are preserved for the biggest vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">It cannot be construed as a statement that the mooring blocks that were in place were inadequate for the particular vessels that were using them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">There was no evidence, other than Mr Hood's, concerning a mooring that would be sufficient to restrain a vessel of Pavana's dimension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">134 I am not persuaded, on the balance of probability, that Holmeport did not take all reasonable measures to ensure that mooring number 60 was adequate for Pavana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Nor am I persuaded that the mooring to which Seaquest was attached was not reasonably fit for the purpose of mooring Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Accordingly, I would conclude that, if a warranty was implied by s 74(2) , there was no breach of the warranty and that if Holmeport owed the secure mooring duty to Mr and Mrs Ruaro, there was no breach of that duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">VALUE OF SEAQUEST 
 
135 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that, if they succeed, they are entitled to be put in the position in which they would have been but for the conduct on the part of Holemport that led to the loss of Seaquest, so far as money can do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Initially, they had contended that, because of the uniqueness of Seaquest, having been constructed of huon pine, a rare timber, the damages should be based on the full reconstruction cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">However, they no longer press for damages based on that cost, having accepted that, in practical terms, Seaquest could not be rebuilt with huon pine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">I consider that the abandonment of reliance on the other measure was a correct decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">136 Mr and Mrs Ruaro now contend that the proper approach is to value Seaquest by reference to sales of comparable vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">That approach is not essentially different from that contended for by Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Holmeport contends that the proper quantum of damages is the market value of Seaquest at the time and place of its loss in Rose Bay on 24 August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">In the absence of a clear market value, the best evidence of value is the opinion of those who knew the vessel shortly before the loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">The next best is the opinion of those well conversant with shipping generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">The original cost and insured value of a vessel are of less weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">137 I would take the parties to be ad idem on the proposition that the appropriate quantum of damage to which Mr and Mrs Ruaro would be entitled is the fair market value of Seaquest in Sydney on 24 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">That entails a determination of the price that a willing, but not too anxious seller, would accept and a willing but not too anxious buyer, would pay for a vessel comparable to Seaquest at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Having regard to the uniqueness of Seaquest, that determination must be a matter of opinion, which gives rise to disputation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">138 Mr and Mrs Ruaro bought Seaquest for $80,000 in April 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">They did so after assessments of Seaquest conducted by Captain Peter Kysil, a master surveyor, engineer and valuer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">From 1975 to 1997, Captain Kysil was the proprietor of a marine consultancy conducted on the Georges River, New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">Since 1985 he has been carrying on practice as a national pre-purchase marine craft assessor, general marine consultant and boat broker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">In the course of that business, he has advised both private pleasure craft and commercial craft buyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">He has also provided project supervision services in relation to refurbishment, repair and construction works for various craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">139 In written reports provided to Mr and Mrs Ruaro in March and April 1993, Captain Kysil advised that the sum of $80,000 would be an appropriate sum for insurance purposes for Seaquest and that a purchase price of $75,000 for Seaquest would represent a good buy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">140 Captain Kysil provided further reports to Mr and Mrs Ruaro in October 2001, when he described the presentation of Seaquest overall as " good, robust, honestly presented and originally well built ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">By that time, substantial restoration and renovation work had been carried out on Seaquest by Mr and Mrs Ruaro, with the assistance of various tradesmen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">Captain Kysil observed that rejuvenation of Seaquest was " substantially completed " and that external superstructure finishes and deck finishes, once completed, would enhance Seaquest's presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">He observed that further work being done progressively would maintain Seaquest's seagoing capability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Captain Kysil expressed the opinion that Seaquest was sound and seaworthy and he that had seen nothing that would alert him to any risk factor that would necessitate a note of caution to a prospective insurer, other than the normal risks associated with marine craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">He advised that, for insurance purposes, the sum of $110,000 was appropriate, being $80,000 for the hull, $20,000 for machinery and $5,600 for equipment, $2,000 for the tender and $2,400 for a Mercury outboard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">He advised that, on completion of the total refurbishment of Seaquest, the overall valuation would be considerably higher than that figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">He did not, at that time, specify the higher figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">141 As at the date of its loss, Seaquest was insured in the sum of $108,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">That sum has been paid to Mr and Mrs Ruaro by the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Holmeport accepts that that payment is not relevant to the assessment of quantum but points to the sum insured as giving some indication of the value of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">142 On 25 August 2003, Captain Kysil observed Seaquest, at a distance of approximately 10 m from the shore, following its break up and destruction on the previous day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">He was also furnished with a detailed written log of the restoration, renovation and repair works carried out on Seaquest from the time of his report of 19 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Holmeport does not dispute that the log fairly describes the works carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Mr Ruaro also gave Captain Kysil a detailed oral account of those works during a 31/2 hour interview on 18 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">143 In addition, Mr Ruaro swore a lengthy affidavit, which was read in the proceeding, in which he described in considerable detail the work that had been carried out on the restoration, renovation and repair of Seaquest from the time of its acquisition until the time of its loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">That was not disputed by Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Nor did Holmeport dispute that the works had been carried out in a good and workmanlike manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">144 In the light of the above material, Captain Kysil expressed his opinion in a report of 21 June 2004 concerning the value of Seaquest when destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">He did so on the assumption that the works described by Mr Ruaro had been carried out and that Seaquest had been restored to a high standard to maintain its heavy weather offshore seagoing capability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Captain Kysil also made the assumption that the items that he had previously identified in earlier reports as requiring attention had been rectified more than adequately, resulting in Seaquest's economic life being considerably extended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">Captain Kysil expressed the opinion that, having regard to the log of works presented to him and his continuity of association with Seaquest, the value of Seaquest when destroyed was " at least $400,000+ ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">145 Captain Kysil was cross-examined on handwritten notes that he made during the course of his discussion with Mr Ruaro on 18 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">His notes contain a comment as follows:
 
 "I am satisfied that from chronology explained 
 
 6 hrs/day Aug 2001-24 th Aug 2003 
 50 hrs 110 weeks 
 5,500 hrs 5,500 x 50 
 
 
 275,000 " 
 
 
 

He accepted that that was a calculation of the time spent by Mr Ruaro in his work on Seaquest, valued at the rate of $50 per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">Next, Captain Kysil's note showed a schedule of expenses totalling $22,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">The aggregate of $275,000 for time and $22,000 for expenses is $297,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">It was suggested to Captain Kysil in the course of cross-examination that he had arrived at his valuation of $400,000+ by adding that sum of $297,000 to the figure of $110,000 mentioned in his report of 21 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Captain Kysil denied that that was his methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">146 Captain Kysil's report of 21 June 2004 was admitted without objection, notwithstanding that he had not disclosed a particular methodology adopted in arriving at his valuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">In the course of the cross-examination, he asserted that he had arrived at the figure of $400,000 by " looking at the Australian market ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">He said that, having a working knowledge of general values of timber craft similar to Seaquest, he adopted the most conservative estimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">However, he could not, in cross-examination, specify any craft that he had identified for the purposes of arriving at his valuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">The most that he was able to recall was that " they were perhaps Halvorsens and the like ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Halvorsen is a well known manufacturer of pleasure yachts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Captain Kysil said that he looked at " the wish price " for such vessels and not at the actual sale price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">He said that it was commonly understood that the advertised asking price was a starting point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">147 Mr and Mrs Ruaro were given leave to adduce further evidence from Captain Kysil after he had the opportunity, overnight, to examine his files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">That leave was given without opposition from Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">On the following day, Captain Kysil produced three editions of a boating magazine called " Trade-A-Boat ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">He identified pages from those publications that he said contained entries related to vessels that he said were comparable to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">He prepared a schedule identifying five vessels shown in those publications and the asking price stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">He said that on the previous evening he had examined back issues of Trade-A-Boat for the purpose of " preparing comparators ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">He said that he felt it important to demonstrate the lesser value of shorter craft compared to Seaquest and also other craft of comparable size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">He identified two craft of lesser size in his table that were intended to be indicators of the value of shorter craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">148 Captain Kysil said that the best he was able to do currently was " to make soft comparisons ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">He said that there was no identical craft to Seaquest with which he could make a direct comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">However, he said that some fundamental aspects of the type of craft identified in his schedule fit the parameters of Seaquest in approximate length and propulsion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">He also took into account the internal space and the general arrangement of the craft and the respective capability of the vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">149 The unsatisfactory nature of the overnight work carried out by Captain Kysil is that none of the five vessels identified by him is a Holmes vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">The date of construction of the five vessels is not known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">Captain Kysil appears to have chosen the vessels simply by reason of their length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">He gave no evidence whatsoever as to the characteristics of any of the five vessels to show that they were in any way comparable with Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">150 The schedule prepared by Captain Kysil from his most recent examination of Trade-A-Boat showed five vessels with asking prices ranging from $485,000 to $800,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">There is nothing in the photograph in the extracts from Trade-A-Boat to suggest any particular similarity to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">There was no evidence as to the price of which any of the vessels was actually traded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">151 In further cross-examination, Captain Kysil asserted that his purpose in preparing the schedule was to show his methodology for arriving at a valuation of $400,000+.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">He denied the night before was the first time he had made reference to comparable vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">When it was pointed out to him that he had not referred to such a methodology in his report of 21 June 2004, he referred to a page of his handwritten notes of his discussion with Mr Ruaro of 18 June 2004 as follows:
 
 "$595 3 x 58&#8242; Halvorsens" 
 

Captain Kysil said that that was a note that he made having examined internet sites equivalent to the Trade-A-Boat publication, showing the price at which Halvorsen cruisers were advertised for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">152 Captain Kysil's handwritten notes give rise to an inference that he calculated the value of $400,000+ by adding to his earlier valuation an assessment of the work carried out on the Seaquest after that time; there is no other real explanation given for the marked increase in the value from $110,000 in 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Having regard to the absence of any stated methodology in Captain Kysil's report of 21 June 2004, I would be disposed to give very little weight to the so-called comparators provided by Captain Kysil following the indulgence that I granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">153 Mr William John Wright is a very experienced naval architect who has designed and built many vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">In December 2006, Mr Wright expressed his opinion in writing on the uniqueness of Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">Mr Wright considered that Seaquest was a unique vessel, as it had a high standard of design and workmanship, typical of high ended wooden pleasure boats of its era and particularly because very few professionally built vessels of the size and era of Seaquest had full length huon pine planking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">Mr Wright considered that the most noticeable and valuable characteristic was the fact that its hull was built using huon pine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">154 Huon pine is one of Australia's oldest living trees and is indigenous to Tasmania and nowhere else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">Huon pine trees can reach an age in excess of 3,000 years and grow at an extremely low rate of 0.3 mm to 2 mm per year in diameter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">The trees are rare in that they reproduce once every five to seven years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">They commonly reach heights of 20 to 25 m. Due to the exceptional quality of huon pine as crafting material, including the building of boats, it was harvested on a large scale from the early 1800s and today there are only limited quantities available on the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Thus, huon pine is a very expensive and rare material to be used in shipbuilding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">Its price is traditionally about three times that of the common hardwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">No more than 500 cubic metres of huon pine saw logs are available each year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Further, most of the available stock is only 3 m in length, which renders it useless for planking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Seaquest's planking was a minimum of 5.5 m. Hence the rarity of vessels whose hulls are fully planked with huon pine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">155 Mr Wright's opinion is of collateral relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">Mr and Mrs Ruaro originally sought to rely on evidence from Mr Wright to show the cost of rebuilding a vessel equivalent to Seaquest with huon pine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Ultimately, however, they accepted that that was not the correct measure of damages and that the correct measure is the fair market value of Seaquest in Sydney at the time of its destruction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">However, Mr Wright's evidence still has some relevance to indicate the uniqueness of Seaquest, a factor that may well have a part to play in its fair market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">156 In addition, to the evidence of Captain Kysil and Mr Wright, Mr and Mrs Ruaro adduced evidence from Mr Dennis Kelly, a professional marine surveyor, specialising in yachts and small craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">Mr Kelly carries on his practice in New Jersey, USA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">As a result of his training and experience as a marine surveyor and valuer, Mr Kelly has general market knowledge of marine craft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">By use of a number of source materials and from his discussions with boat brokers with whom he works, he maintains an up to date knowledge of the market in pleasure vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">157 In a written report of 8 July 2006, Mr Kelly expressed the opinion that a 65 year old wooden motor yacht in top condition, of fine quality and historical design character would represent a historical artefact and a major collectible investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">Mr Kelly had regard to a number of similar sized wooden yachts that had been sold or listed for sale on the East Coast of the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">He had regard to particulars of classic vessels extracted from magazines that he considered was relevant market information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">158 Mr Kelly observed that factors that indicate the market price of a vessel include the overall soundness and seaworthiness of the vessel, the character and design of the vessel, the retention of unique features of the vessel and the completeness of the overall restoration undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">Mr Kelly assumed, from various survey reports from Captain Kysil, that Seaquest appeared to be in a sound and seaworthy condition and that the restoration of Seaquest was extensive and was undertaken as a true labour of love by Mr and Mrs Ruaro.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">159 Mr Kelly acknowledged in his report that assigning a market value to an antique vessel is, at best, an inexact science and art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">He recognised that many factors enter into the equation of establishing a fair market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">160 Mr Kelly defined fair market value as the most probable price in terms of money that a vessel should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions of a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently and knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">It assumes a reasonable time has been allowed for exposure on the open market and that the sale represents a normal consideration for the vessel sold, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">On that basis, Mr Kelly's opinion is that the fair market value for Seaquest at the time of her loss would have ranged between $US310,000 and $US330,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">161 However, that must be taken to be the fair market value of Seaquest on the East Coast of the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">Mr Kelly gave no evidence of knowledge of any sale in Australia of any comparable vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">All of the sales considered by him appear to be in relation to transactions on the East Coast of the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">162 Nevertheless, a vessel such as Seaquest is transportable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">The fair market value of an equivalent vessel on the East Coast of the United States is therefore relevant to the question of the fair market value of Seaquest in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">However, it would be necessary to take into account the cost of transportation of Seaquest to the East Coast of the United States in order to make use of Mr Kelly's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">In assessing the fair market value of Seaquest in Sydney in 2003, the cost of transporting Seaquest to the East Coast of the United States would be an expense of the seller, in realising the price that might be obtained on the East Coast of the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">A quotation by Matthew Short and Associates Pty Ltd, customs brokers and freight forwarders, who arrange the shipment of vessels out of Australia was tendered without objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">The quotation for the shipment from Sydney to the East Coast of the United States of a 56 foot cruiser was approximately $AUS116,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">163 Holmeport adduced evidence from Mr Maurice Peter Drent and Mr John Charles Messenger as to their respective opinions of the fair market value of Seaquest in August 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Mr Drent expressed his opinion in writing that the market value of Seaquest in Australia was between $185,000 and $195,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">Mr Messenger expressed his opinion in writing that the value of Seaquest prior to its destruction on 24 August 2003 was no more than $210,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">164 Mr Drent was the founder of Maurice Drent Boating Services, whose objective is to market quality used power and sail recreational boats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Mr Drent estimates that the business has been involved in the sale of some 2,500 vessels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">Mr Drent himself is active in the general role of administration of and advisor to the businesses conducted under that name and handles a number of high profile boats and sales himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">165 Based on Captain Kysil's reports, Mr Drent considered that there were several structural changes and repairs to Seaquest that would not enhance its value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">They included:
 
 
 &#8226; fibreglass sheathed plywood decking;
 &#8226; added bridge deck, which did not flow with the general lines of the vessel;
 &#8226; a number of original ribs that were cracked and had been repaired by placing sister ribs beside them;
 &#8226; copper sheathing had been added in various areas of the keel and keelson;
 &#8226; an antiquated Perkins diesel engine that would not comply with future emission control standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">
 

166 Mr Drent considered that Holmes, the builder of Seaquest, is a name held in good respect but that it was difficult for the value of a Holmes built vessel to reach the same value as that of vessels built by Halvorsen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">While Halvorsen vessels were not built to a higher standard than Holmes vessels, Mr Dent considers that they enjoy a higher status in the classic boat purchaser's mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">Mr Drent mistakenly assumed that Seaquest had only one engine, not two, although he did not consider that that made a difference to the value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">167 Mr Drent referred to two vessels that he took into account in arriving at his opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">The first was a 50 foot Halvorsen Bridgedeck Cruiser, built by Halvorsen around 1950.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">Its last two owners had spent a considerable amount of money on its restoration and he classified the vessel as being 9 out of 10 for style and presentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">The vendor netted $383,000 after paying a commission of 6%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Mr Drent considered that that figure was achieved because of the presentation, originality and styling, the Halvorsen name and the age and engineering of the vessel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">168 The second vessel described by Mr Drent is a 48 foot Holmes Bridgedeck Cruiser, which has been upgraded with diesel engines with low hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">Mr Drent considers that that vessel is very similar to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">The vessel has been for sale in Sydney for more than 12 months with an asking price of $295,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">At present, it remains unsold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">That vessel is somewhat shorter than Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">On the other hand, it is, to an untrained eye, very similar in its appearance to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">There is nothing to suggest that there has been a substantial change in market conditions between August 2003 and the present time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">The fact that the second vessel has not been sold suggests that the asking price is higher than its market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">169 Mr Messenger considered that some of the work carried out by Mr Ruaro in the upgrading and maintenance of Seaquest would not necessarily add value to the vessel equal to the value of the work done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">He referred particularly to rectifying rot and other faults.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">He also observed that replacement of equipment from time to time would not increase the value by an amount equivalent to the amount spent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">170 Mr Messenger considered that the addition of a covered bridge deck hardtop to Seaquest was not totally in sympathy with its classic line and would have detracted from its value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">Mr Messenger considered that timber vessels have very high maintenance costs and that Seaquest, therefore, was the kind of vessel that appeals to the handyman or owner that is not afraid to spend money on maintenance and upkeep.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">Mr Messenger accepted that Mr Ruaro had done a very thorough job of restoration and maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">However, Mr Messenger considered that, since Mr Ruaro did not have any specialist qualifications in boat building repair or maintenance and that a large proportion of the work he carried out was with assistance from tradesmen, Seaquest may not have obtained the best sale figure if it had been put on the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">Mr Messenger also considered that the age of the main motors would be another drawback.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">171 I consider that the valuation evidence is somewhat unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">There is a dearth of evidence as to comparable vessels to Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">As I have indicated, I would not give a great deal of weight to Captain Kysil's opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">On the other hand, neither Mr Drent nor Mr Messenger referred to comparable sales to any useful degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">Their opinions were admitted without objection, except as to specific parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Had there been objection, it may be that much of the evidence would have been rejected as not satisfying the requirements of s 79 of the Evidence Act , in so far as the opinions do not demonstrate the reasoning that led them to the opinions in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">172 Evidence was given that a commission in the order of 6% is generally payable in connection with the sale of pleasure craft such as Seaquest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">That would not be a consideration in the assessment of fair market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">173 Doing the best that I can on the basis of the evidence, I would be disposed to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that Seaquest had a market value in August 2003 in the vicinity of $US320,000 less the sum of $A116,000, being the cost of transportation to the East Coast of the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">If Mr and Mrs Ruaro were entitled to damages, that would be the measure of their damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">CONCLUSION 
 
174 However, in the light of the conclusions outlined above, there must be judgment for Holmeport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">The proceeding must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Mr and Mrs Ruaro must pay Holmeport's costs of the proceeding, subject to any question of the costs of the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy-four (174) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.</sentence>
