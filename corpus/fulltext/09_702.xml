 BUCHANAN J: 
 Introduction
 Ms Jane Rutter is a professional flautist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Between 1989 and 2007 she released eleven albums in Australia and has sold her albums both in Australia and in other countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">At various times in her career she has performed as a soloist with very well-known international musicians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Ms Rutter is also a composer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In late 1992, according to her evidence, she composed and wrote a melody which she called "Blo".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The eight bars of the melody were written on a scrap piece of manuscript which was subsequently lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In mid 1993 she wrote a complete musical piece based on the melody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The manuscript was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Her fourth album was entitled "Blo" and was released in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">This album included an arrangement of Blo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The essence of Ms Rutter's claim in the present proceedings is that her copyright as author of Blo was infringed when the first respondent which, as will be seen, was in 1999 granted a 12 month licence to reproduce the score of the melody for specified purposes, continued thereafter to do so without her permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Brookland Valley Estate Pty Limited ("Brookland Valley") is the operating company of the Brookland Valley vineyard in the Margaret River region of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The land upon which the vineyard is situated was acquired by the second respondent, the family trust company of Mr Malcolm Jones and his wife, Mrs Deidre Jones, in 1983.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The first wines were produced in 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In 1993 the family trust, JFT (WA) Pty Limited ("JFT"), went into partnership with a company called Mulloway Pty Limited ("Mulloway").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In 1997 BRL Hardy Limited (later Hardy Wine Company Limited and then Constellation Australia Limited) ("BRL Hardy") acquired a 50% interest in the vineyard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">From that time the business operated as a joint venture under the name of the first respondent in which BRL Hardy had a 50 percent interest, JFT a 25 percent interest and Mulloway a 25 percent interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Proceedings against JFT were settled before the matter came to trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Although Mulloway and BRL Hardy had, respectively, one and two representatives on the board of Brookland Valley, day to day management was retained by Mr and Mrs Jones with assistance from BRL Hardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Jones was managing director of Brookland Valley from 1997 until September 2004 and then acted as a consultant to Brookland Valley until December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">From 1997 to 2004 Mrs Jones was employed by Brookland Valley as the marketing manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Verse 1 range
 On 21 October 1997, not long after the establishment of the joint venture, Mr Jones as managing director of Brookland Valley made a proposal to the board that two new brands be introduced to the range to supplement the existing Brookland Valley brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">One was described as a "Margaret River" brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The proposal for the third brand was discontinued a short time later but the proposal for the new Margaret River brand continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Mrs Jones was closely involved, both professionally and personally, in the development of a marketing strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The development of that strategy became intimately connected with a statue (which Mr and Mrs Jones knew as "Pan", but which a witness in the proceedings identified as "Daphnis") which they had purchased in 1978.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Mrs Jones described the matter as follows: 
 "Malcolm and I purchased the statue of Pan in 1978 in an antique shop in Double Bay, Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">When we purchased the land to become the Brookland Valley Vineyard I came up with the idea of placing the statue on a rock on the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The statue had become a symbol in our family of enjoying the good life, music, fun and wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This was also our approach to making wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Over the initial years of developing the winery the family often held parties around the statue and decorated it for Christmas, making it an important part of our family history.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

 
 In 1988 Malcolm and I decided to place an image of the Pan statue on the first wines produced by Brookland Valley Vineyard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">From 1990 when the Flutes Caf&eacute; was established I came up with the idea of placing the Pan statue on a rock at the front of the restaurant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">We often played Pan music in the restaurant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The statue and story of Pan became strongly connected to Brookland Valley Vineyard and was often used in our marketing initiatives from the very beginning of the winery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">" 

 It was decided that the new brand would be called the "Verse 1" range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Mrs Jones said: 
 "Given that the new range sought to engage a new market for Brookland Valley and was the winery's second label, I considered that it was important to launch the product in a way to attract the interest of retailers, restaurateurs and wine media.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">

 
 It was in this context that I drew the association between Pan, as a flautist and the possibility of the launches involving a musical performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I also came up with an idea to have music incorporated in the label and to have a CD produced which was associated with Pan and the second label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This CD could then be played in the Flutes Caf&eacute; and Gallery and in the restaurants and retail stores which stocked Verse 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">

 
 Getting retailers, restaurateurs, wine media and wine judges to attend a launch of a winery's second label is very difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As such, I anticipated that there would be a need for a reasonably large budget to have a launch which would entice their attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

 
 In or about late 1997 or early 1998 my concept for the launch of the second label involved having a flautist play at each of the launch functions which would be likely to be held in Sydney, Melbourne and either Perth or Margaret River.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">My initial idea was to hire a local flautist in each city.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I also came up with a mock up idea for the label to include an excerpt of a piece of music which was to be associated with the second label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">My idea was that the piece of music on the label would be played by the flautist at the launch functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" 

 Mrs Jones developed the idea of involving Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">She said: 
 "I thought that she would be a good fit with the concept I was developing which incorporated Pan and his magical panflute and I thought that given that she had not been performing for some time, she may be willing to be involved in the launch of the second label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">

 
 My original marketing concept involved Jane performing at launch functions and composing a piece of music which could be associated with Verse 1 and Pan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I wanted the piece to be called Pan's Song.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Also part of my concept was for a CD to be compiled with Pan's Song and some other tracks to be given away at the launch functions and to the retailers and restaurateurs as an incentive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">" 

 The concept was discussed at a meeting on 12 and 13 November 1998 where Mr and Mrs Jones and representatives of BRL Hardy were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was decided that the Verse 1 range would be constituted, at least initially, by a white wine, a Semillon Sauvignon Blanc from 1999, and a red wine, a Cabernet Merlot from 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The proposed involvement of Ms Rutter was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The following was recorded: 
 "Promotion: Malcolm outlined plans to involve Jane Rutter as a Verse 1 ambassador.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This was well received and all agreed support on this scale was required to achieve the sales distribution and growth targeted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Negotiations are continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">" 

 In a 1999 Australian Marketing Plan prepared for Brookland Valley by the brand manager, Mr Hornabrook, in November 1998 sales of the Verse 1 brand were forecast at 9,500 cases (114,000 bottles) but when the 1999 Australian Marketing Plan was discussed at a meeting on 16 December 1998 it was recorded that wine volumes would be reduced to 7,500 cases (90,000 bottles).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The record of the same meeting included the observation: 
 "Jane Rutter contract:
 Malcolm and Dee to finalise negotiations with Jane Rutter's management for the promotion of Verse 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This contract should be for a minimum of 2 years with agreement to make personal appearances, perform, endorse and provide exclusive rights to a CD of selected music tracks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">A meeting in Sydney is planned for Tuesday 23 February to finalise the launch activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" 

 Use of Ms Rutter's services and music
 From mid 1998 to mid 1999 Ms Rutter was represented by Mr Roy Ferin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">They fell out in mid 1999 but before that happened negotiations had commenced with Mr Ferin to involve Ms Rutter in promotion of the Verse 1 range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">A report made by Mr Jones to the Brookland Valley board for the 1998 December quarter board meeting recorded: 
 "The Verse 1 label will be released in late September 1999 and bearing in mind the significant future production of this label a substantial promotional budget has been prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The package includes use of Jane Rutter in the production of a piece of music and a CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">" 

 Ms Rutter did not become personally involved in negotiations until 23 February 1999 when she attended a meeting in Sydney with Mr and Mrs Jones and Mr Ferin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr and Mrs Jones and Ms Rutter each gave evidence about the conversation at that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Mr Ferin was not called to give evidence by either Ms Rutter or Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I am satisfied that he was not, by the time these proceedings came to be heard and for a considerable time prior to that, in the camp of either side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">No inference is available from the failure of either side to compel him to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">However, the passage of time (ten years), the fact that nobody made any note of the meeting but relied instead upon recollection to attempt to recreate the substance of the conversation and that no independent version of events was available means that the evidence about what was said at the meeting needs to be approached with considerable caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Both parties agreed that the arrangement between them had later been captured in a written form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">However, a matter of considerable difficulty for the resolution of the present case is that no written contract was ever finally executed and there was some real lack of certainty about which documents should be regarded as stating the final terms of the agreement which was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Nevertheless, resolution of those matters does not depend upon preferring any particular version of the conversation which took place on 23 February 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">I am satisfied that, at that time, both Ms Rutter and Mrs Jones in particular were very enthusiastic, both about the concept and Ms Rutter's participation in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The 1999 Australian Marketing Plan was presented to a meeting of the board on 25 February 1999, two days after the meeting with Ms Rutter in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Apart from the meeting on 23 February 1999, negotiations took place, up to mid 1999, through the agency of Mr Ferin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Central to the concept which Mrs Jones had developed was the provision by Ms Rutter of an original piece of music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">She had in mind that the piece of music would be performed and promoted to the public in various ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">First, it would be performed for the purpose of creating a complimentary music CD upon which would also be recorded other pieces of Ms Rutter's music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The CD would be paid for by Brookland Valley and would be available to restaurants and bottle shops as a promotional tool associated with the Verse 1 range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Naturally, one benefit to Ms Rutter would be a greater exposure of the public to her music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Arrangements for the production of the CD were negotiated between Mr Ferin and Mr Hornabrook of BRL Hardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The recording was made in early 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">A second aspect of the overall arrangement was the proposal that Ms Rutter perform the original piece of music and other music on three occasions: 9 August 1999 in Melbourne, 11 August 1999 in Sydney and 20 November 1999 at the Brookland Valley vineyard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In due course it became necessary to alter the date and location of the third performance which occurred finally in mid 2000 in Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The third aspect of the arrangement was that Ms Rutter would provide a manuscript of the original composition for reproduction on the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">She provided the score of the melody of Blo and later played Blo at each of the three launches, in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">While negotiations were going on about the terms upon which Ms Rutter would licence the use of her original composition she approved, on 13 May 1999, artwork for the label which in due course appeared on the Verse 1 range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The front label for Verse 1 wines showed an image of a young, impish, naked, male flautist, together with three staves (12 bars) of Ms Rutter's music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The back label included the words: "Pan's Song written by Jane Rutter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Ms Rutter described the significance of the music which she approved for reproduction on the label in the following way: 
 "Collectively, this part of the composition is the centrepiece of Blo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The complete musical piece of Blo lasts for around four minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Of the 12 bars of the melody of Blo depicted on the [label], I believe the relative significance of the bars of music in the context of the complete musical piece are as follows: 

 
 (a) The first set of 4 bars of music on the first stave are the crux of melody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">These 30 odd notes form the expositional statement and are the most important part of the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Without this melody, the composition would not exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The scale used is an Aeolian mode (A D Minor scale with an added note --- a flattened 7 th as well as a raised 7 th ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The scale has two 7ths in it which has an emotional, ethnic and historical relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The melody is Greek/Middle Europe and exotic in style.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The rhythm is that of a Pagan dance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It has both Classical and Greek as well as cross-over influences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It is an unusual and distinctive melody and rhythm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">If played on a flute, the first 4 bars would have a duration of between 10 and 13 seconds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It is the genesis of Blo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">

 
 (b) The second set of 4 bars of music (appearing on the middle stave of music) are also very important and represent the completion of the most important part of Blo's melody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">If played on a flute, the 4 bars would have a duration of between 10 and 13 seconds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The music in the first and second set of 4 bars is repeated several times throughout the entire 4 minute composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">

 
 (c) The third set of 4 bars of music (appearing on the bottom stave of music) is an embellishment of the first set of 4 bars of music which forms the centrepiece of the composition and melody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">" 

 In the first instance, three staves of music, each of four bars, appeared on the label of Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">As will be seen the label was changed in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Thereafter, only the first stave of music appeared --- described by Ms Rutter as the crux of the melody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The license arrangement
 The task of determining the terms of the final arrangement has been made more difficult by the fact that neither side kept full records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Indeed, despite the fact that Mr Jones gave evidence that he left all records connected with the negotiations at Brookland Valley Vineyard when he ceased to be managing director of Brookland Valley and the fact that there was evidence of a thorough search for such records, Brookland Valley was not able to produce any written record of, or arising from, the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Ms Rutter's records were incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">They consisted of documents which were sent to her from time to time by Mr Ferin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Some of them bore handwritten annotations by her which appeared to find reflection in later versions of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">There were a number of documents transferred by facsimile from Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">They included three draft agreements and some other documents, in the form of letters, dated 21 May 1999 intended, apparently, to be transmitted by facsimile to Mr and Mrs Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Mr and Mrs Jones both stated in their evidence that they had no recollection of ever seeing the letters apparently intended to be sent to them by facsimile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">There is no other objective indication that they were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">They might just as easily have been drafts of letters sent to Ms Rutter for her examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">I am not prepared to assume, in the absence of any evidence, that these communications were ever made by Mr Ferin to Mr and Mrs Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">However, it is possible to make confident findings about a number of matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">On 28 July 1999, Mr Jones wrote to Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Ferin had been dismissed only a matter of days before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">In his letter Mr Jones described the essential features of the arrangement which had been agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He proposed a small number of changes to the terms of a draft contract which was obviously before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">He proposed to make payment of the bulk of the agreed payment within a matter of days and in fact did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Indeed, by mistake, the payment was made twice and Ms Rutter refunded the overpayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Those events, which require more detailed examination, provide a foundation for determining the written terms of the arrangement which, although not signed by Mr Jones and Ms Rutter, is nevertheless evidenced in writing and by the payment and acceptance of the contract payment then due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">There were four drafts in evidence of a document entitled "Jane Rutter Agreement for Services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The fourth document post dated critical events and the time at which the contract was concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Nobody suggested that it accurately set out the concluded terms of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">It requires no further attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The first three documents were sent by facsimile transmission from Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter on 19 May 1999, 23 June 1999 and 29 June 1999 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The documents were progressively more detailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">It seems to me possible to exclude two of the documents as the one before Mr Jones on 28 July 1999, when he wrote to Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I shall discuss this matter again in more detail when the specific terms of the contract, as I have found it, have been set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">However, it is possible to commence to narrow the field by reference to the surrounding circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It is convenient to deal first with the document sent to Ms Rutter on 23 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Ms Rutter's evidence was inconclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">However, it seems unlikely that the contract agreed was the version faxed to Ms Rutter on 23 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">That document indicated that the contract would be between Ms Rutter, Mr Ferin and Brookland Valley Vineyards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The later version sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 indicated that the contract would be signed by Ms Rutter only and Brookland Valley Vineyards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">A suggestion made by Mr Jones in his letter of 28 July 1999 --- "Change Address in document to Jane Rutter" --- is consistent with the later version of 29 June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The second document contained handwritten notes by Ms Rutter which found substantial reflection in the third document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I think it unlikely that Mr Ferin sent this version as a neutral participant both to Ms Rutter and to Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He was representing Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I think it much more likely that it was sent to Ms Rutter for consideration, before being sent to Brookland Valley if acceptable to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">There are further matters of detail referred to shortly which also contributed to my conclusion that the second version did not form the basis of the final contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The first document, of 19 May 1999, does not match the terms of the document which was obviously before Mr Jones at the time he made his suggestions for inclusion in the final contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Jones' evidence was that to the best of his recollection he only ever saw one version of the "Jane Rutter Agreement for Services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">In his affidavit evidence he said in two places that he believed it was likely that document was the version sent by Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 or an earlier version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">In his oral evidence Mr Jones made some attempt to suggest that he probably had before him the first version and not some later version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I am not prepared to accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">As will be seen shortly Mr Jones, on 28 July 1999, made specific suggestions for final amendment of whatever document he had before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Those suggestions cannot be reconciled with the terms of the first version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I am satisfied it was not the first version which was before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The third document, sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999, bore the notation "Draft #5".</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">It is unclear whether this notation, which does not appear on any other version, referred to drafts given to Ms Rutter for her consideration or drafts provided to Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It is impossible to be certain that there was not some other document before Mr Jones of which no record now remains but, having regard to the terms of the proposals which he made and the general description that he offered Ms Rutter of the arrangement, I am satisfied that the version sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 reflects, in substance, the terms of the bargain finally concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">At the time he made his final suggestions, Mr Jones also had before him a facsimile from Ms Rutter dated 27 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Ms Rutter and Mr Ferin had fallen out a few days earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">In a facsimile dated 24 July 1999 Mr Ferin proposed, nevertheless, that he continue as event co-ordinator for the events which had been arranged, while engaging someone else to actually manage the events, and work with Ms Rutter, on the days in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">On 26 July 1999, Ms Rutter sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Ferin indicating her lack of understanding of the state of negotiations but protesting that a contract should earlier have been concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Mr Ferin replied on the following day indicating that Mr Jones had "agreed to pay $27,500 by this Friday," a figure which I will shortly explain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Mr Ferin also alerted Ms Rutter to the possibility that the proposed performance at Brookland Valley Vineyard in November might need to be postponed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">He said that, subject to one or two matters, "there's no problems with the Agreement" from Mr Jones' standpoint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">This gives further support to my conclusion that the document receiving Mr Jones' endorsement was not one of the early versions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Ms Rutter's facsimile transmission to Mr Jones of 27 July 1999 said the following: 
 "Dear Malcolm 

 
 Further to our conversation today, I enclose my account number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">As agreed you will deposit $27,500 into this account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The remaining $7,500 will be settled by 30 th November 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">

 
 I have no problem with changing the dates in November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">I would like this to be as successful as possible for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">I have turned down work for this to the tune of about $10,000 so how about settling $1,000 worth of Verse 1 wine on me?!!</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">(as compensation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Please let me know your thoughts!</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">

 
 Account J. E. RUTTER
 [Account details omitted] 

 
 PS I hope this is OK" 

 It is evident that Mr Jones understood that Ms Rutter was not fully familiar with the course of negotiations and perhaps not with the significance of the document about which he, the following day, was to make final suggestions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">His letter dated 28 July 1999 should be set out in full: 
 "Date: 28 th July 1999 

 
 Dear Jane, 

 
 Following our telephone conversation I set out below the changes we suggest in the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">

 
 As a background explanation our arrangement is a licence arrangement to use your music and your name on our label and marketing material and promotions for the period of 12 months commencing 1 st August 1999 with an extension of 6 months sell-off period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The production run on this wine in 1999 is a maximum of 90,000 bottles.</sentence>

 (Amendments suggested by Mr Jones are underlined or struck through.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">) 

 Before dealing further with the terms of the contract which I have found was concluded between Ms Rutter and Brookland Valley on 2 August 1999, when payment was received in her account, I should note another matter upon which Brookland Valley relied to suggest that the draft contract which was before Mr Jones was not the one I have found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">That submission was based on the fourth change suggested by Mr Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">It was suggested that the presence in the draft of "Brookland Valley Vineyards, Willyabrup, WA" could not be reconciled with Mr Jones' recitation, in his letter, of "Brookland Valley Vineyard" singular in relation to performance venues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The second version of the draft contract said "Brookland Valley Vineyards" as did the first version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">The first version did not have a clause 2.2 to which Mr Jones' suggestions in his second suggested addition could possibly relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">I am satisfied, as I said earlier, that the first version was not the document which was before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The second version is not materially different from the third version in any respect relevant to the present proceedings but there are one or two further matters that persuaded me that, despite the discrepancy referred to, the second version should not be regarded as that which was before Mr Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">In the second version there appeared a clause 4.5, which did not appear in the third version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">It said: 
 "4.5 The Performer shall provide use of her name and image in printed material directly related to the marketing and advertising of the Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">All artwork for such printed material must be forwarded to Ferin Music Australia or Jane Rutter for approval prior to publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">The Performer's consent must be obtained in relation to the placement of any marketing and/or advertising material in any publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">" 

 Although much of this clause was in the same terms as clause 4.4, so far as it related to obtaining Ms Rutter's consent to the placement of marketing or advertising material, there was an important difference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Ms Rutter made a hand written comment referrable to the first sentence which said "I hate this".</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">At the end of the proposed clause she said: "We need to discuss this".</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">I think it unlikely that this provision remained in the draft contract over her opposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">It was not in the later version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">In her oral evidence she was quite clear in her recollection that she was concerned about the use of particular images and photographs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Another matter is that the second version indicated that the venues in both Sydney and Melbourne had not been fixed whereas the third version identified at least the place of the Sydney performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">I do not think there is any foundation upon which I should prefer the second version to the third version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">It is important for the ascertainment of the legal rights and obligations to which the parties bound themselves to come to conclusions about the actual terms of the contract between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Later, when I come to address other issues, it will be permissible to refer to the representations which Mr Jones made in his letter of 28 July 1999 about the general character of the arrangement between Ms Rutter and Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">For the moment it is sufficient to indicate that I see no material inconsistency between the terms of the contract which I have found and the explanation which Mr Jones gave about the arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">It is neither necessary nor appropriate to construe the terms of the contract by reference to Mr Jones' description of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Construction of the contract should proceed by reference to the terms which I have found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Some features of those terms should be plainly identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The association between the parties was for the purpose of the launch, marketing and sale of two varieties of wine labelled Verse 1: Semillon Blanc and Cabernet Merlot (Recital B).</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Not more than 90,000 bottles of wine were to be produced in 1999 with a label including Ms Rutter's music and name (clause 2.2 as amended).</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">When the agreement expired (which would occur at the latest on 2 August 2000) unless Brookland Valley had exercised a renewal option there was not to be any distribution of further quantities of wine with labels which included Ms Rutter's name or music, subject only to a six month sell-off period for product which had already been manufactured (clause 2.3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Ms Rutter authorised the reproduction of her composition on no more than 90,000 bottles and reserved all other rights in the composition (clause 4.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">All those provisions were clearly expressed and, in my view, unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Brookland Valley had one option to extend the agreement for a further one year on the same terms and conditions (clause 5.3 and 6.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Mr Jones confirmed in his oral evidence that he originally had in mind that further performances in the following year would be arranged if the initial arrangements proved successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It was also clear from the evidence that a budget had been approved for a two year period by the board of Brookland Valley to undertake the marketing program devised by Mrs Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Brookland Valley did not exercise the option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">As will be seen, shortly after the agreement was concluded, it moved away from, and outside the parameters of, the terms of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Ms Rutter was to be paid a "sponsorship" fee of $20,000 and a total of $15,000 for three performances, of which $7,500 was to be paid immediately and the balance after the final performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Ms Rutter's evidence was that, at the time, she was commanding a performance fee in the order of $5,000 per performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Accordingly the arrangements which were made for payment for performances were consistent with her professional arrangements at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There was debate in the proceedings about the matters to which the $20,000 "sponsorship" might relate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In accordance with the terms of the contract the $20,000 fee was related to "The Performers Sponsorship Services" identified in clause 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">It therefore included payment for the authorisation of reproduction of the original composition, provision of an accompanist on three occasions, availability for up to 21 interviews and not unreasonably withholding consent to the placement of marketing or advertising material relating to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">On the evidence only two or three interviews were required of her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">There was no evidence which would support a conclusion that the obligations not to withhold consent unreasonably were onerous or particularly important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">I am satisfied that the bulk of the $20,000 fee should be regarded as related, in one way or another, to the authorisation to reproduce the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">The other matters are either relatively trivial or not ones which are capable of being assigned a particular value in money terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">I am satisfied that, even during the term of this agreement, Brookland Valley breached a number of its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">It did not confine the marketing and sale of wine bearing labels which included Ms Rutter's name and music to the wine varieties Semillon Blanc and Cabernet Merlot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">It did not confine production to 90,000 bottles with a label including Ms Rutter's music and name, even in the first year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">It did not seek Ms Rutter's authorisation to reproduce her composition on additional bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Moreover, Brookland Valley continued to produce and distribute further and increasing quantities of wine with labels including Ms Rutter's name and music after the expiration of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Notwithstanding that it did not exercise its option to renew the agreement or ever thereafter seek to renegotiate it, it continued to reproduce Ms Rutter's composition and use her name without her authorisation and without any payment being made to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The present proceedings, however, are not proceedings for breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">They are principally proceedings under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ("the Copyright Act ") for breach of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Before turning to consider that cause of action in more detail it will be necessary to trace the later course of events and the ways in which Brookland Valley continued to use Ms Rutter's composition and name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Verse 1 sales
 At a meeting of the board of Brookland Valley on Friday, 13 August 1999, less than two weeks after the contract with Ms Rutter had been concluded, it was agreed that a Chardonnay should be added to the Verse 1 range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">This step had been recommended by Mr Jones in his managing director's report dated 12 August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">It seems inconceivable that Mr Jones could not have appreciated that the addition of an extra wine variety, and use of the label agreed with Ms Rutter, would be a step outside the agreement which he had made with her such a short time before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Thereafter, Mr Jones and Brookland Valley were to conduct themselves as though the contract with Ms Rutter did not exist and permission to reproduce her musical score was irrelevant, although it was only through the licence granted by the contract concluded on 2 August 1999 that Brookland Valley had obtained the right to use her original music on its labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">At a board meeting on Monday, 22 November 1999, Mr Jones proposed the immediate production of a Verse 1 Chardonnay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The meeting resolved to produce a Verse 1 Chardonnay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Mrs Jones was to be closely involved in the sales aspects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">At a board meeting held on Thursday, 17 February 2000, Mr Jones suggested that a Shiraz be released under a Verse 1 label and the meeting resolved to proceed with that proposal as soon as practicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">At that same meeting Mr Whelan, who gave evidence in the present proceedings, reported that Verse 1 had been registered in and trademarked in Australia and England and was in the process of being trademarked in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">The trademark registered in Australia included a stave of the music supplied by Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">At the board meeting on Monday, 8 May 2000, Mr Jones was asked for production and sales forecasts for Verse 1 for the next five years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">He estimated "that the four varieties of the brand would total around 28,000 cases for 2000/01; 43,000 cases for 2001/02; 58,000 cases for 2002/03; 72,000 cases [for] 2003/04 and 90,000 cases [for] 2004/05".</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">These estimates were for production and sale of 336,000, 516,000, 696,000, 864,000 and 1,080,000 bottles respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">It is clear from these estimates that the initial arrangements agreed with Ms Rutter were very modest by comparison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">By 2004/05, production was forecast to be twelve times as great as was originally estimated for 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">At the board meeting on Tuesday, 21 November 2000 there was some discussion about the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The following is recorded: 
 "Mr Jones also advised that BRL marketing had wanted some changes to the Verse 1 label --- creating more space around 'Margaret River'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr Jones commented that this would unbalance the label and it would need to be redesigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Mr Kennedy commented that he thought the whole package was very good and agreed that it should remain as is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">All that was needed was to get out and sell the wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The directors resolved that the label remain as is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">" 

 This outcome is consistent with evidence which Mrs Jones gave in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">In her affidavit she said: 
 "At various times after the label was created, members of the Hardy sales team suggested that the label be updated as it was not always well received by the trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">I was opposed to the change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">I felt that the design worked well with the whole concept I had developed for the range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">" 

 In mid 2001, Mrs Jones revised the labels and marketing material for all the Brookland Valley brands including Verse 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">The Verse 1 label remained substantially intact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In particular, those elements provided by Ms Rutter or attributed to her remained without change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Documents attached to the managing director's report for the December quarter 2000, which Mr Jones signed on 25 February 2001, recorded sales from August 1999 until December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">It will be remembered that the contract with Ms Rutter contemplated sales of 90,000 bottles of Verse 1 Semillon Blanc and Cabernet Merlot in a twelve month period with a six month run off period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The sales figures showed that Verse 1 Chardonnay commenced to be sold in April 2000, well within the twelve month period of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The sales figures showed that, in the twelve months to the end of July 2000, 80,604 bottles of the original two varieties were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Sales of 90,000 of those two varieties were completed by the end of the following month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Under the contract that was the end of Ms Rutter's authorisation to use her original music on the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Sales continued into the period which should have been subject of the option to renew the contract or the negotiation of a new contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">At the same time, in the initial twelve month period, 14,784 bottles of Verse 1 Chardonnay were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Another way of looking at the situation is that 90,000 bottles bearing the Verse 1 label were sold by some time during July 2000, before the expiration of the nominal period of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">The necessity to review the arrangement with Ms Rutter appears to have received no attention at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">At a board meeting on Monday, 7 May 2001 Mrs Jones presented the revised Verse 1 labels to the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">They were approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">This reiteration of the use of Ms Rutter's copyright material occurred at a time when she had given no authority for such use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">It occurred within the period which would have been covered by any exercise of the option to renew the contract, which option was not in fact exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Thereafter the labels continued to be used and applied to generally increasing production until a complaint was first made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The proposed Verse 1 Shiraz had not initially been introduced but it was added to the range in due course in August 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The 2002 marketing plan, which was revised in November 2001, appears to suggest that sales doubled from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2000 to 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Sales in 2000 were recorded at 122,604 bottles and were forecast for years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 at 255,084, 348,000, 396,000, 456,000 and 492,000 bottles respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">The report records Mr Jones' belief that a potential was present for sales of 600,000 bottles by 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Actual sales, and forecasts, were more modest than the forecasts made in May 2000 but they were still substantially greater than the original arrangement, and increasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">By the time of his report on 9 February 2003 for the December quarter of 2002, Mr Jones was forecasting Verse 1 sales in 2003 of 509,820 bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Minutes of the board meeting held on 11 August 2003 record the following: 
 "The Board noted the continued growth of the Verse 1 brand in the domestic market and Mr Jones commented that he saw no reason why the growth year-on-year of around 140% would not continue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The Verse 1 brand was well regarded in the market place and was now receiving considerable focus from the majors and key independents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">" 

 In his managing director's report dated 28 January 2004 for the December quarter 2003, Mr Jones reported to the board: 
 "For calendar year 2003, total sales of Verse 1 in the domestic market were 43,685 cases against sales in 2002 of 32,757 --- a growth of 133%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">

 
 The 2004 marketing plan is in the process of being finalized and it is proposed to set the budget at 55,000 cases, although the target is for 65,000 cases due to the proposed price reduction of the Verse 1 reds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">" 

 The target was accordingly for 780,000 bottles in 2004 in the domestic market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">In his managing director's report dated 11 August 2004 for the June quarter 2004, around the fifth anniversary of the contract with Ms Rutter, Mr Jones reported: 
 "Sales of Verse 1 continue to grow strongly at 129% of budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">For the full year Verse 1 achieved 119% of budget and a growth on the 2003 year of 130%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">I am pleased to report that growth is continuing to gain momentum with July 2004 sales achieving 138% of budget reaching a record of 6,444 cases for the month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Whilst the Semillon Sauvignon Blanc continues to be the hero of the brand, the reds are now growing strongly since being line priced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Considerable activity is taking place with the majors and key independents and I am confident that the next six months sales will substantially exceed budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Verse 1 has certainly gained its own sales momentum and I believe that over the next two years budgets will be well and truly exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">" 

 This report was made shortly before Mr Jones' interest in Brookland Valley was finalised by the sale of the interest held by the corporate vehicle for his family, JFT (WA) Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">Throughout the whole of the period of his stewardship of Brookland Valley while the Verse 1 range was in existence, therefore, a period of about five years, the Verse 1 range had been marketed and sold with a label which prominently featured Ms Rutter's music and attributed the music to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">During the same period sales had increased substantially and the momentum had been maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The contribution of the Verse 1 label
 Evidence given in the proceedings by current executives of Brookland Valley or its parent company to the effect that the label made no contribution to the brand must be treated with scepticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">There is no indication of any kind that those in day to day control of Brookland Valley held such a view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">On the contrary, the evidence shows that such doubts about the effectiveness of the label as may have been expressed by some sales or marketing personnel were rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The only reasonable inference available is that the management of Brookland Valley were happy that the label was making a useful contribution to what was an increasingly successful brand and an extremely important one for the overall success of Brookland Valley as the minutes of the board meetings consistently recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">It is quite clear from evidence to which I shall come that changes in the label which subsequently occurred came after Mr and Mrs Jones had left Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Even then unauthorised use of Ms Rutter's composition did not cease although the reproduction of the music diminished in size and the attribution to Ms Rutter ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">In a sense this compounded the unauthorised use of the music itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Not only did Brookland Valley continue to use something in respect of which it had no effective licence but it removed any acknowledgement or attribution that Ms Rutter was its creator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">It was not until after the present proceedings were commenced that the use of Ms Rutter's music finally ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">As earlier indicated, a separate arrangement was made with Ms Rutter for the production of a CD containing her music, the cost being borne by Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Before the expiration of the twelve month contract period, on 13 July 2000, Mr Jones sent a facsimile transmission to Ms Rutter's manager, Mr Robbie Porter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Mr Jones said, in part: 
 "Dear Mr Porter 

 
 I refer to your fax re Jane Rutter's CD for a release in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">

 
 As I clearly expressed to Jane on Friday, we are unable to pay more than $3.50 per CD for this promotion otherwise it is not an economic proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">We felt that Jane could receive a lot of promotion from this release, which would represent a return to her in another way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">

 
 We have looked at a number of alternatives including producing a CD with just general music on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">However we think that the Verse 1 CD of Jane's is very good and we would like to keep the promotion with Jane going forward .</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">

 
 On review as a final offer we would agree to $4.25 per CD for 1000 CDs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">

 
 We need an acceptance from you within the next 7 days otherwise we will have to proceed without the CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">"
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">) 

 Mr Jones sent another facsimile to Mr Porter six days later recording agreement to a price of $4.25 for 1,250 CDs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">On 2 December 2002, Mr Jones confirmed a purchase order for a further 2,000 CDs "packaged in the identical format including insert" for a figure of $5.00 plus GST for each CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">These are all tangible indications that the promotion of the Verse 1 concept, as devised by Mrs Jones and approved by the board, was thought to be assisted by an association with Ms Rutter and her music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">In his affidavit Mr Jones said that if Ms Rutter had sought a further fee for the use of her music and name on the Verse 1 wine labels after the expiration of the contract he would have opposed the payment of such a fee and changed the label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">I do not accept this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">I see no objective support for any suggestion that Mr or Mrs Jones would have made a substantial change in the labelling arrangements so soon after the launch of the Verse 1 brand and while it was, relatively speaking, in its infancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">On the contrary, the contemporaneous documentary evidence strongly supports a conclusion that both Mr and Mrs Jones were happy with the label and with other aspects of the arrangement as the continuing production and use of the CD illustrates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">As has already been indicated, the label was used substantially unchanged through a period of very significant growth in sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">It was obviously not regarded as counter productive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">On the contrary, I think the only reasonable inference is that it was regarded as making a useful contribution to the sales and marketing strategy for the Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">I see no reason to conclude that Brookland Valley would not have made a practical and reasonable commercial arrangement with Ms Rutter to enable the label to remain in use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">It is not possible to give any serious credence to the suggestion that the mere fact that some further licence fee would be required would be sufficient to generate the level of resistance suggested by Mr Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The only suggested foundation for this retrospective prediction was that Mrs Jones had found Ms Rutter difficult to work with during the various launch functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">This evidence came chiefly from Mrs Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Passing reference only was made to it by Mr Jones who did no more than recount, in a summary form, statements he attributed to his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">Mrs Jones in her affidavit evidence suggested that Ms Rutter was disorganised and demanding at the Sydney and Melbourne launch functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">She suggested that she decided at that time not to proceed with any similar functions in the future and secured the agreement of Mr Jones and Mr Hornabrook to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">Mr Jones did not give such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Mr Hornabrook was not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">There is no other record which supports Mrs Jones' assertions about the decision she said she took.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">However, any such decision, if in fact it was taken, was, on any view, a qualified one because Mrs Jones excepted from her asserted decision discontinuation of the music and name on the label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The effect of this exception, accepting her evidence at face value, is that whatever view was taken about future launch functions Mrs Jones recalls an active decision to continue the use of Ms Rutter's music and name on the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">That is entirely consistent with what the contemporaneous material shows for the remaining four years while Mr and Mrs Jones remained associated with Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">It adds to my conviction that those aspects of the label were not regarded as being without value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Mrs Jones also asserted that she would not have countenanced payment of a further fee to Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I do not accept this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">I think it is clear from the evidence as a whole that the name and music were regarded as important elements on the label and it strains credulity to suggest that a sensible commercial arrangement would not have been reached to permit their authorised continuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">In particular, I am satisfied that, in Mrs Jones' mind, it was important that the concept she had devised be promoted as an authentic one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">It is clear that the Verse 1 concept, and matters of detail concerning public relations for it, including the design of the label for wine bottles and for packaging such as cartons, were the special interest of Mrs Jones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">She was responsible for negotiations and discussions with designers as well as for the original concept itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Despite one answer which she gave to the effect that the provision of an original composition by Ms Rutter was simply a nice finishing touch (a characterisation which I do not accept), I am satisfied that it was a central element, and important to the authenticity and integrity of the whole concept, that Ms Rutter provide an original composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">That composition was to be, and was, advanced by reference to, in reliance upon and in association with Ms Rutter's undoubted reputation, especially in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Mrs Jones regarded the identification, on the back label, of Ms Rutter as the composer of the music appearing on the front label as part of the concept she had in mind to market Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">She was asked: 
 "And you included the reference to the fact that Pan's song had been written by Jane Rutter to communicate to such members of the public that the music appearing on the front was that of Ms Rutter's, didn't you?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">" 

 
and:
 
 "You regarded this design as finalised in 1999 as effective, so far as you were concerned, as effective to convey the concept that you had come up with?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">" 

 I see no reason to conclude that that element of the concept lost its commercial significance after the period of time to which the contract related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Mr Kenneth Boundy, a marketing consultant who gave expert evidence for Brookland Valley, agreed that at the time Verse 1 wines were launched music was used as part of the "brand essence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">He thought that Ms Rutter's involvement gave musical credibility and was "clearly of some perceived value to Brookland Valley in differentiating the product".</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">The fact that some years later Brookland Valley, after the departure of Mr and Mrs Jones, first reduced the reproduced score to one stave of music consisting of four bars and then, faced with the commencement of the present proceedings, replaced it with something meaningless gives no reason to think that, at any relevant time, the element of the concept represented by Ms Rutter's composition had become regarded as without significance or value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">I am satisfied that the contrary is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">The fact that Brookland Valley did nothing to honour its obligations to Ms Rutter cannot assist it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">From about 2 August 2000 it acted in disregard of her legal rights and without her permission or authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">It acted as though the use of Ms Rutter's music and name was a matter under its unilateral control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">It was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">Brookland Valley continued, as part of its commercial exploitation of a successful product, to take the benefit of the arrangements which it had negotiated with Ms Rutter during 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">However, despite taking the full advantage of her contribution, it disregarded both her legal and moral entitlement to share in some way in the commercial success of what was originally their joint endeavour and turned its back on the promise which it made to her in the letter of 28 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">I place no weight on the evidence of Mr and Mrs Jones predicting what they would have done if Ms Rutter had approached them after twelve months seeking further payment for the use of her music and name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">I prefer to judge the matter by reference to their conduct at the time rather than by reference to affidavits drafted for the purpose of the proceedings, with all the imponderables that such a process entails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">No commercially significant reason was offered to support their ex post facto predictions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">The objective material is consistent only with them each believing that continued use of the label in the form it bore was an appropriate and valuable contribution to their sales and marketing plans for Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">I do not regard it as realistic to suppose that some sensible commercial arrangement would not have been made had it been necessary to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The first change to the Verse 1 label
 In the first of two affidavits prepared for the proceedings Mr Andrew Charleson, the National Fine Wine Manager for Constellation Wines Australia, deposed that prior to 2005 Mrs Jones "had total control over the packaging and labelling of the Brookland Valley ranges, including Verse 1".</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">He said that BRL Hardy acquired the Jones' family interest in the Brookland Valley Winery in 2005 and immediately took the opportunity to make changes to the labelling and packaging of Verse 1 in response to criticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">This misstates the position and I am satisfied that the position, indeed, has been overstated, probably with a view to making some point in the proceedings in Brookland Valley's interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The true position is that Mr and Mrs Jones relinquished their roles in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Thereafter little, if anything, appears to have been done about Verse 1 labelling before September 2005, twelve months later when the position was reviewed for other reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">At that time Ms Shirley De Zolt had responsibilities with respect to marketing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">Ms De Zolt was not called to give evidence in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In September 2005 she prepared a design brief for Mr John Davies at Insight Design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">She said: 
 "Brookland Valley has developed from a small Margaret River boutique estate to a strong brand in a fantastic growth cycle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">In Australia, the entry level MR sub brand Verse 1 has achieved sales over 50,000 targeting 80,000-100,000 pa in the next 1-2 years in addition to developing export markets with similar growth patterns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">

 
 So, as we face the next phase of growth challenge, and as the Verse 1 range was launched 7 years ago, it is time to review the existing design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Whilst not seeking a departure from our core brand elements, the design process does need to provide a scale of options to review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">" 

 She said that the background as to why Verse 1 required a packaging upgrade was complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">One factor mentioned was that the current pack "has begun to look tired".</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Otherwise the only other comment on any aspect of the label relevant to the present proceedings occurred in the course of making a number of points about the proportion of elements on the label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Ms De Zolt said: 
 "Music notes, while a key theme for the range, dominate the label a little too much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">Perhaps to review the application of the notes to be blind embossed (not printed), or reduced, or moved to the back label or kept in colour but much smaller and softer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Ultimately more air is needed to quite a cluttered label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">" 

 Ms De Zolt gave a presentation in November 2005 to explain the rationale for proposed changes to the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">The presentation proposed that there be only a single stave of music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">It said, in part, "Music --- too much of it, confusing, congestion".</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">In the recommended design options there were some new elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Some elements were to be retained and improved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">One of those elements was the music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The change was described as follows: "Music --- cut back/more subtle &amp; not overpowering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">Off centred for contemporary look and not complete piece.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">In background".</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">In January 2006 Ms De Zolt gave a presentation to the Hardy's sales team to present the finalised packaging and to explain the rationale behind it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">The comment concerning the music was simply: "Music notes are at height of flute/more subtle".</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">This music was still Ms Rutter's but the attribution which had previously appeared on the back label was removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Ms Anna Falkiner was, at the time she swore an affidavit for use in the proceedings, the Senior Global Brand Manager (Western Australian Portfolio) for Constellation Wines Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">She had been an employee of Constellation Wines from 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">She took over from Ms De Zolt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">She appears to have played no part in the redesign of the label in 2005/2006 but was nevertheless called to give evidence that was dismissive of both Mrs Jones' original concept and of any suggestion that Ms Rutter's name or music made any contribution to the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">She seemed unwilling to accept reasonable propositions in cross-examination, insisting for example that "Verse 1" was only a "sub-brand" although occasionally in unguarded remarks she used exactly the same terminology to which she was resistant in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">I did not find her evidence of any assistance on the question of the significance to be attributed to the conduct of those who preceded her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">The approach by Ms Rutter's lawyers
 During the period that the label was being revised, Mr James Bell, a commercial and entertainment lawyer, wrote to Brookland Valley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">His letter was dated 26 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">The letter was countersigned by Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It asked for copies of the contractual documentation and a full accounting of Ms Rutter's entitlements under the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The letter was received by Mr John Whelan, then company secretary and in-house legal counsel of Constellation Wines, on about 27 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">Mr Whelan spoke with Mr Jones shortly thereafter and was told that Ms Rutter had been paid for the use of her music on the Verse 1 label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">In early October 2005 he searched at the Brookland Valley Vineyard for any documents evidencing the contract but found none.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">In his affidavit he said: 
 "Having found no documents onsite at Brookland Valley or on file at Constellation Wines, and given Mr Jones' recollection that no such agreement existed, I concluded that Ms Rutter must have been mistaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">I had intended to respond to Mr Bell on my return from Western Australia but overlooked doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">" 

 Consequently, according to Mr Whelan, no response was made to Mr Bell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">As already indicated, plans went ahead to change the Verse 1 label but to retain Ms Rutter's music on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">This simple explanation requires further examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Mr Whelan accepted, in cross-examination, that he was conscious at the time that Ms Rutter's musical work could only be used by Brookland Valley if there had been an assignment of copyright in writing or a licence granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">His enquiries had revealed neither.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">He was asked: 
 "So you were in a position where there was a concerning situation from the point of view of the company?---It was of concern, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">

 
 Because you knew that the company had been reproducing the music on the label for a long period of time and needed a licence of some sort to do that?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">" 

 
and:
 
 "But it was, if there was no agreement, it was a great matter of concern to you, wasn't it?---There were no agreement at all, yes it was a matter of concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">" 

 
and:
 
 "HIS HONOUR: Is this correct that if there was no agreement, that was a matter of concern?</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">If there was an agreement, it was important to know how it was constituted and what its terms were?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">" 

 No response was made to Mr Bell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">No enquiries were made, directly or indirectly, of Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Mr Whelan was, on his evidence, which he gave in a straightforward and candid fashion, conscious of the fact that Ms Rutter's copyright in her music was being breached in an ongoing way, and had been for some time, unless she had licensed its use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Mr Bell's letter put any assumption to that effect in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Mr Whelan's own enquiries had not revealed the necessary permission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">In my view Mr Whelan was on sufficient notice to make it imprudent in the extreme to leave matters as, in fact, they were left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">On 22 December 2006 Gadens Lawyers, who now acted for Ms Rutter, wrote to the Hardy Wine Company in South Australia referring to and enclosing a copy of Mr Bell's earlier letter of 26 September 2005 and referring also to the fact that the reproduction of Ms Rutter's score on the label had been recently altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">The letter said: 
 "Please contact us to arrange a convenient time to meet with us to discuss this matter and our client's rights and entitlements from your use of her name and music, in an amicable manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">" 
 This letter also went unanswered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Mr Whelan's explanation is that it is unlikely he would have seen it until he returned from his summer holiday in mid-January 2007 which was after the date which Gadens had stipulated for a reply --- 15 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">That explanation does nothing to indicate why a response was not sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">As Mr Whelan indicated, the next step, which was foreshadowed in Gadens letter, was not taken until 10 April 2007 when the application and statement of claim were served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">There was more than adequate time and opportunity for Mr Whelan to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">The approach from Gadens was moderate in its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The lack of any response was surprising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">The institution of proceedings was practically inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Mr Whelan conceded that he knew of no basis upon which it could be asserted that Ms Rutter had given the necessary permission to reproduce her music after 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">He was asked in cross-examination: 
 "I think you have agreed, in answer to some questions asked earlier this morning, that if there was no agreement for the grant of permission, it was a serious matter from the company's perspective?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">

 
 It was a serious matter because you knew over a number of years the --- beyond 1999, the company had been reproducing the music on the label?---Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">

 
 And so that, at the point in which your inquiries were exhausted, shortly after the receipt of this material attached to the letter from Gadens of 18 April 2007, you were in the position where the company couldn't establish a licence or permission granted by Ms Rutter?---Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">

 
 That is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">And what I want to know is has there ever been a position since then when you have become aware of material which has enabled you to form the view that there was a permission or licence granted in relation to the reproduction of the music on the label for the periods --- for the years 2000 and following through to 2006?---No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">" 

 Events after the commencement of proceedings
 At the commencement of the proceedings Brookland Valley was still using Ms Rutter's music on the Verse 1 label although without attribution of her as the author.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">Mr Charleson's evidence was that when the proceedings were commenced action was taken to remove Ms Rutter's music from the label and a new label was used from about mid 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Steps were taken to notify wholesalers and retailers to destroy print material and point of purchase material containing images of the previous Verse 1 labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">However steps were not taken to prevent ongoing sales of Verse 1 wines bearing the label with Ms Rutter's music or even to stop use of the label at the point of production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">A schedule attached to Mr Charleson's affidavit identified orders for printing Verse 1 labels for Cabernet Merlot, Chardonnay, Ros&eacute; (which had been added to the range), Semillon Sauvignon Blanc and Shiraz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">The schedule covered the period from 17 January 2005 to 21 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">It was apparent that, after commencement of the proceedings, 183,312 bottles of Verse 1 Cabernet Merlot were produced with labels showing Ms Rutter's music as were 118,272 bottles of Verse 1 Chardonnay, 15,240 bottles of Verse 1 Ros&eacute;, 815,760 bottles of Verse 1 Semillon Sauvignon Blanc and 26,364 bottles of Verse 1 Shiraz.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Work orders for the production of such labels were given, after the commencement of the proceedings, on 11 April 2007, 18 April 2007, 20 April 2007, 2 May 2007, 7 May 2007, 16 May 2007, 8 June 2007, 11 July 2007, 25 July 2007 and 1 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Ms Rutter gave unchallenged evidence that on 26 October 2007 she was able to purchase a bottle of 2005 Verse 1 Chardonnay with the label containing three staves of music which had been in use since 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">On 23 October 2008 she purchased a bottle of 2006 Verse 1 Cabernet Merlot with a label showing one stave of her music and on the same day purchased a bottle of 2006 Verse 1 Ros&eacute; with a label showing one stave of her music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">On 24 October 2008 she purchased a bottle of 2006 Verse 1 Chardonnay with a label showing one stave of her music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">There was no evidence given in the proceedings that Brookland Valley made any effort to stop selling bottles of wine in its possession which already bore labels containing Ms Rutter's music or to retrieve any such bottles from wholesalers or retailers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">Presumably Brookland Valley was content to take its profit from those sales and simply see Ms Rutter in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Infringement of copyright
 Sections 31(1)(a) , 35 (2) and 36 (1) of the Copyright Act provide as follows: 
 "31(1) For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a work, is the exclusive right: 

(a) in the case of a literary, dramatic or musical work, to do all or any of the following acts:

<sentence id="s570">" 

 I am satisfied, and ultimately no case was suggested to the contrary, that Ms Rutter was the author of Blo, the owner of copyright in Blo and that no licence for its reproduction in whole or in part was granted to Brookland Valley except by the terms of the contract concluded on 2 August 1999.</sentence>

 "It is clear that the phrase 'substantial part' refers to the quality of what is taken rather than the quantity ... in determining whether the quality of what is taken makes it a 'substantial part' of the copyright work, it is important to inquire into the importance which the taken portion bears in relation to the work as a whole: is it an 'essential' or 'material' part of the work?</sentence>

<sentence id="s576">Mr Richard Toop is a musicologist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">He gave both affidavit and oral evidence in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">He has an international reputation, particularly as an analyst of twentieth-century music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">He expressed the opinion, which was not challenged in any relevant respect, that: 
 &#9679; 'Blo' was an original musical composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">It was recognisable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">

&#9679; There were, in the first few bars, already juxtapositions of innately distinctive figures that were sufficiently unusual for the melody also to be considered original in a broader, qualitative sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">&#9679; The part of 'Blo' reproduced on the Verse 1 label from 1999 to 2005 (sic) was an immediately recognisable excerpt of 'Blo'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">That part of 'Blo' is a significant, essential and material part of the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">&#9679; The part of 'Blo' reproduced on the Verse 1 label from 2005 (sic), although shorter, is also an immediately recognisable excerpt of 'Blo'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">It also is a significant, essential and material part of the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">There was no countervailing evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">I accept Mr Toop's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">I conclude that the Verse 1 labels produced from 1999 until around 2007, which featured Ms Rutter's music, reproduced her original musical work in substantial part and published it in breach of her exclusive right to do so, except to the extent authorised by her in the contract made on or about 2 August 1999, for the period thereby identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">I do not accept a submission made by Brookland Valley to the effect that publication of the "music graphic" did not represent an infringement of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">No authority was cited to support the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">For reasons given earlier, I do not accept, as Brookland Valley submitted, that the music was included on the label as a "decorative element".</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">On the contrary, I am satisfied that it was essential to the concept, and its execution, that the music be authentic, original and associated with a high profile classical musician.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">The attempts made in the proceedings, in various ways, to dismiss those elements of the original concept seem to me to be the product of forensic revisionism rather than a faithful representation of events as they played out in 1998, 1999 and thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The limitation period
 Section 134(1) of the Copyright Act provides: 
 "134(1) An action shall not be brought for an infringement of copyright or in respect of the conversion or detention of an infringing copy, or of a device (including a circumvention device) used or intended to be used for making infringing copies, after the expiration of six years from the time when the infringement took place or the infringing copy or device was made, as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">" 

 The proceedings were commenced on 29 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">Accordingly, Brookland Valley argued that no relief was available to Ms Rutter with respect to infringement of copyright up to 28 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">No real answer was made to this submission and it should therefore be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">The result is that it will be necessary, at various points, to make an adjustment to the relief which would otherwise have been available to acknowledge this limitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Celebrity endorsement
 Some time and attention was devoted by both parties to how damages, if they were to be awarded, should be calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">One question which was debated was the value, if any, of Ms Rutter's personal association with Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Evidence was called from a number of witnesses about the value of celebrity endorsements in advertising and about the calculation of an appropriate fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Notwithstanding these efforts, in my view the issue is not a relevant one in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">There was no indication on the Verse 1 labels that Ms Rutter was providing any form of personal endorsement for Verse 1 wines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">Neither, in my view, does any inference to that effect arise from the attribution to her of authorship of "Pan's Song".</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">Until 2006 Ms Rutter was shown simply as the composer of the music.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">In my view that fact, together with her undoubted reputation in Australia, added authenticity to the concept, as Mrs Jones desired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">However, it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the present case to approach the question of the assessment of damages on the basis of attributing some value to a notional endorsement by Ms Rutter of Verse 1 wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">Compensatory damages
 Section 115(1) and (2) of the Copyright Act provide: 
 "115(1) Subject to this Act, the owner of a copyright may bring an action for an infringement of the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">

 
 (2) Subject to this Act, the relief that a court may grant in an action for an infringement of copyright includes an injunction (subject to such terms, if any, as the court thinks fit) and either damages or an account of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">" 

 Ms Rutter sought damages, rather than an account of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">A clear case has been made out for damages for breach of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">It is not realistic to make an assessment of such damages on the basis that Brookland Valley would not have come to some arrangement with Ms Rutter concerning the use of her music and her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">It did in fact use her music and her name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The assessment of damages must be approached upon the basis that it would have been prepared to make a commercially sensible arrangement in order to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">I reject a submission made by Brookland Valley that Ms Rutter is only entitled to the same amount it would have cost Brookland Valley to redesign the label to remove her music and name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The starting point for an assessment of what arrangement would have represented a reasonable commercial one in all the circumstances must commence with the bargain actually made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">In that bargain $20,000 was assigned for sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">The sponsorship responsibilities were identified in clause 4 "The Performers Sponsorship Services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">I shall set them out again for convenience: 
 "4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">The Performers Sponsorship Services 

 
 4.1 The Performer shall provide the written text to the composition 'Blo' by Jane Rutter for the purpose of use by the Promoter in reproduced prints of said text on the Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">The Performer, as the owner of the copyright in the composition, authorises the promoter to reproduce the composition on no more than 90,000 units of the Product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">The Performer reserves all other rights in the composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">

 
 4.2 The Performer shall provide an accompanist for each of the performances listed in Item 2 of the schedule on the dates listed in Item 3 of the schedule and the accompanist's performance fee shall be included in the Sponsorship fee listed in Item 4 of the schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">

 
 4.3 The Performer will be available for up to a maximum of twenty one (21) interviews in total, at mutually convenient times to promote the performances and the Product, subject to the Performer's prior professional commitments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Interviews shall be organised by the Promoter or it's authorised agents to a maximum of nine (9) print interviews, nine (9) radio interviews and three (3) television interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">

 
 4.4 All marketing, advertising, press and print material that includes Jane Rutter must be forwarded to Ferin Music Australia or Jane Rutter for approval prior to publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">The Performer's consent must be obtained in relation to the placement of any marketing and/or advertising material in any publication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">

 The original agreement referred only to two varieties of wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">I think the number of varieties of wine should be regarded as of less importance than the total number of bottles to which labels containing Ms Rutter's music were to be attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">At the outset it was contemplated that 90,000 bottles to which labels would be attached would be produced in the contract period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">In fact that number was exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">One suggestion made by counsel for Ms Rutter was that I should assess the position simply as though the sponsorship fee of $20,000 represented a royalty of 22.22 cents on each of 90,000 bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">I do not think that would be a realistic approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">I am satisfied, however, that the sponsorship fee should, for reasons which will be explained, be regarded as including a lump sum licence payment of $15,000 and a royalty of 2 cents per bottle, as well as provision for the other matters referred to in clause 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">I think it reasonable to assume that the element of primary importance to the parties, at least at the time the original agreement was made, was a lump sum payment by way of a licence fee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">However, in view of the shared expectation of a given production run, and the optimism for increased sales thereafter, it is unrealistic to think that some adjustment to accommodate the level of success of the range would not have been mutually agreeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">Although a royalty will not provide an appropriate measure of damages where it appears a copyright owner would not have been prepared to grant a licence (see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v D.A.P.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Services (Kempsey) Pty Limited (in liquidation) [2007] FCAFC 40 ( "Aristocrat" ) at [27]), there is no suggestion in the present case that Ms Rutter would not have been prepared to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">This element, however, should be a modest one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">In my view a royalty of 2 cents per bottle meets that standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">At $1,800 for 90,000 bottles it would comprise a small part of the initial payment but was capable of affording some limited participation in a successful marketing endeavour thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The calculation should be made for all sales of bottles to which were affixed labels bearing Ms Rutter's music, excluding the original 90,000 bottles to which the contract related and also excluding sales up to 28 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Some allowance needs to be made for the cost of an accompanist on three occasions (clause 4.2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">I will attribute $400 for each occasion ($1,200 total) to this factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">There were only a small number of interviews which Ms Rutter was required to attend (clause 4.3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">Of the remaining $17,000 I will allow $2,000 for other contingencies including interviews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">The remainder of $15,000 seems to me to represent an appropriate core payment which, in substance, reflects the bargain which was made and which might reasonably be thought to have been acceptable to the parties for later years, supplemented by the modest royalty I have already discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Due to the six year limitation on Ms Rutter's right to claim relief, any payment referable to the period before 28 March 2001 must be excised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">Accordingly, the $15,000 notional payment attributed to the period from 2 August 2000 to 1 August 2001 must be reduced pro rata to $5,178.08 (for the period of 126 days from 29 March 2001 to 1 August 2001).</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">On Mr Charleson's evidence, printing of labels with Ms Rutter's music continued until 1 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Conveniently that identifies a span of exactly eight years from the making of the contract and seven years from its expiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">In my view Ms Rutter should be compensated firstly with an amount of $95,178 to represent the core payment I have isolated for each of those additional years, but again commencing on 29 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">Then it becomes necessary to attribute a fee of 2 cents per bottle to sales made from 29 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">Mr Charleson's evidence also enables sales to be calculated in the following way: 2000 - 30,060 bottles (120,060 sold from which the 90,000 bottles originally bargained for must be deducted); 2001 --- 270,012 bottles; 2002 --- 469,284 bottles; 2003 --- 567,084 bottles; 2004 --- 813,012 bottles; 2005 --- 920,760 bottles; and 2006 --- 1,366,776 bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">In addition a calculation may be made from Mr Charleson's schedule of labels printed in 2007 bearing Ms Rutter's music (but excluding those which do not) of 1,332,744 bottles in 2007 to 1 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">The total is 5,769,732 bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">To recognise the limitation period excluding relief up to 28 March 2001, the whole of the net sales from 2000 (30,060) must be excluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">It is not possible to discern from the evidence what sales were made, in 2001, up to 28 March 2001 and which from 29 March 2001 on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">I will therefore reduce the 2001 sales figure of 270,012 bottles pro rata to 205,653 bottles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">The adjusted total is 5,675,313.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">On the approach I have taken I think Ms Rutter is entitled to further damages, in addition to the $95,178 already identified, of $113,506, giving a total of $208,684.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Additional damages 
 Section 115(4) of the Copyright Act provides: 
 "115(4) Where, in an action under this section:
 (a) an infringement of copyright is established; and
 (b) the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so, having regard to:
 (i) the flagrancy of the infringement; and
 (ia) the need to deter similar infringements of copyright; and
 (ib) the conduct of the defendant after the act constituting the infringement or, if relevant, after the defendant was informed that the defendant had allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright; and
 (ii) whether the infringement involved the conversion of a work or other subject-matter from hardcopy or analog form into a digital or other electronic machine-readable form; and
 (iii) any benefit shown to have accrued to the defendant by reason of the infringement; and
 (iv) all other relevant matters;
 the court may, in assessing damages for the infringement, award such additional damages as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">" 

 The conduct of Brookland Valley must be evaluated by reference to the conduct of its human agents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">In my view the disregard of Ms Rutter's rights was flagrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Apart from breach of any contractual terms, the representations contained in Mr Jones' letter of 28 July 1999, about the substance of the arrangements then proposed by him, were perfectly clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The acknowledgment that: "If we wish to continue to use your music and your name in future years production we must negotiate a further agreement and failing being able to negotiate the licence is at an end and we will discontinue the use of your music and name on our Verse 1 label" was dishonoured without apparent compunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">The agreement which Brookland Valley made with Ms Rutter was itself breached virtually immediately with the introduction of a new variety of wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">It was then breached when the agreed volumes were exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">Disregard of her rights continued after the expiry of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Mr and Mrs Jones took what they wished from the arrangement with little apparent regard for Ms Rutter's entitlements and legitimate interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Mr Jones' failure to honour the bargain which he had made with Ms Rutter or take any step to address her rights may not be dismissed as simple carelessness on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">His representation to Mr Whelan to the effect that Ms Rutter had been paid in full for her contribution was manifestly incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">If that was the basis upon which he proceeded it was clearly not open to him to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">If it was not, the position is, if anything, worse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">The position did not improve when Mr and Mrs Jones ceased their involvement with Brookland Valley towards the end of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">Ms Rutter's enquiries about the matter, through Mr Bell, and the approach made on her behalf by Gadens, went unanswered even though it was quite apparent that there was a serious question about the right of Brookland Valley to use, and continue using, her music on its labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Nothing was done until the proceedings were commenced and even then the steps that were taken were ones which displayed no real recognition of Ms Rutter's entitlements past, present or future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">For a number of months the labels bearing Ms Rutter's music were reordered for every variety of Verse 1 wine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">In my view, each of the elements identified in s 115(4)(b)(i) , (ia), (ib) and (iii) of the Copyright Act is engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">The conduct of Brookland Valley was flagrant and it continued in disregard of Ms Rutter's rights even after it had been expressly brought to its attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">Brookland Valley continued to take the full benefit of the marketing program which it devised, even after Mr Bell's letter in September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">I do not accept the evidence given in the proceedings that I should regard the continued use of Ms Rutter's music as of no consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">The new label, put into use from January 2006, continued to display it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">I am fortified in my view that some account must be taken of the need for deterrence by the approach which was taken at various points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">In the end, in one form or another the unsatisfactory and flagrant disregard of Ms Rutter's rights spanned a period of about eight years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">The moderate attempts which she made to seek clarification of the position went without response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">Even the commencement of the present proceedings appeared to bring insufficient recognition of the gravity of the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">An estimate of additional damages is again necessarily broad but that is almost inevitable in cases of this kind (see Aristocrat at [52]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">In my view a figure of $150,000 as additional damages is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">The restriction of Ms Rutter's claims to the period from 29 March 2001 does not remove or relevantly qualify her entitlement to an amount for additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">Nor does it affect the amount which I have found is appropriate to be awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">Moral rights
 The back label used from about 2006 did not attribute authorship by Ms Rutter of the music on the front label (now one stave).</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Under s 195AO of the Copyright Act that was an infringement of Ms Rutter's "moral rights" of attribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Under s 195AZA , damages are available for loss resulting from the infringement but s 195AZB makes clear that there may be no double counting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">In my view, the lack of attribution did not increase the loss flowing from breach of copyright in the original work which continued in 2006 and into 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">There is no need to consider any separate order under s 195AZA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Injunctive relief
 Ms Rutter has sought an injunction to prevent further breach of copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">In my view such an order is not necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">It is not appropriate in my view for the Court to grant an injunction which has no real work to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">Trade Practices Act 
 Ms Rutter's application also seeks damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for misleading and deceptive conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">However, she is not able to point to any damage which she has suffered as a result of that alleged conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">It follows that damages would not be available on that account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">She has not sought any form of declaratory relief in relation to the conduct of which she complained under this cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">No relief is therefore appropriate under the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Interest
 Ms Rutter, in her statement of claim, sought interest on a judgment in her favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">I decline to award interest on the amount of additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">I regard that as a sum which reflects the elements referred to in s 115(4) of the Copyright Act rather than as compensation for direct loss (see also Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 51A(3)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">However, there is no good reason why Ms Rutter should not be awarded interest on her compensatory damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Until December 2008, the Federal Court Rules did not provide a guide to the calculation of an appropriate rate of interest and the practice of the Court was to award interest at the rate applied in the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the proceedings were heard (see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd (t/as Easams Australia) v BHP Information Technology Pty Limited [2003] FCA 688 ; 201 ALR 55 at [6] --- [7]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">Order 35 r 7A of the Federal Court Rules now provides: 
 "7A If determining a rate of interest for an order under paragraph 51A(1)(a) of the Act, the Court or a Judge may fix the rate as: 

(a) the cash rate of interest set by the Reserve Bank of Australia from time to time during the period mentioned in paragraph 51A(1)(a) of the Act, plus 4 per cent; or
 
(b) such other rate as the Court or Judge thinks fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">"
 
 The compensatory damages which I calculated were based, in part, on a notional core amount of $15,000 per annum for the period from 29 March 2001 to 1 August 2007 and, in part, upon a notional royalty of 2 cents per label on bottles of Verse 1 wine sold until 1 August 2007, excluding the first 90,000 bottles and then excluding any sales to be attributed to the period up to and including 28 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">There are two principal difficulties presented by any attempt to relate an appropriate rate of interest to the compensatory damages I have found are justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">First, the cash rate set by the Reserve Bank of Australia (if that was to be chosen as a guide) was somewhat volatile, moving up and down between 6.25% on 2 August 2000 (coincidentally) and 3.00% at the present time, having reached 7.25% on 5 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">The average rates from 2 August 2000 were 5.41%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">The addition of 4% as suggested by O 35 r 7A provides a range of 10.25% to 7.00%, peaking at 11.25%, with an average of 9.41%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">Over the same period of time the rate applied by the Supreme Court of New South Wales ranged between 11% (from 1 September 2000) to 9% at the present time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">In view of the next difficulty which I need to address it is in my view better in the circumstances of this case to fix a single rate of interest to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">In my view, an appropriate rate of interest to be applied uniformly over the whole period would be 9%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">A rate of interest applied to a notional payment of $15,000 due on 2 August in each of the years 2000 to 2006 (adjusted initially to reflect the limitation period) up to date of judgment may be calculated as follows: Date Amount
$ Rate Period Amount $ 29 March 2001 5,178.08 9% 8 yrs 94 days 3,848.24 2 Aug 2001 15,000.00 9% 7 yrs 333 days 10,681.64 2 Aug 2002 15,000.00 9% 6 yrs 333 days 9,331.64 2 Aug 2003 15,000.00 9% 5 yrs 333 days 7,981.64 2 Aug 2004 15,000.00 9% 4 yrs 333 days 6,631.64 2 Aug 2005 15,000.00 9% 3 yrs 333 days 5,281.64 2 Aug 2006 15,000.00 9% 2 yrs 333 days 3,931.64 
 95,178.08 
 
 47,688.08 The next complication arises from the need to apply a rate of interest progressively, and to figures which are not derived directly from the same periods in which renewals of the original arrangement on a periodic basis would most likely have occurred --- i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">in one yearly or longer periods commencing on 2 August.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">In my view the fairest approach to this question would be to calculate interest on the 2 cent royalty I have determined from the conclusion of the respective sales periods --- end 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 1 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">The application of interest thereby occurs after actual sales rather than in anticipation of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">Interest should be applied to the date of judgment, 30 June 2009, which is generally fairly straightforward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">The calculation is explained in the following table:
 Year Bottles Damages 
$ Rate Period Amount 
$ 2000 - - 9% 8.5 yrs - 2001 205,653 4,113.06 9% 7.5 yrs 2,776.32 2002 469,284 9,385.68 9% 6.5 yrs 5,490.62 2003 567,084 11,341.68 9% 5.5 yrs 5,614.13 2004 813,012 16,260.24 9% 4.5 yrs 6,585.40 2005 920,760 18,415.20 9% 3.5 yrs 5,800.79 2006 1,366,776 27,335.52 9% 2.5 yrs 6,150.49 1 Aug 2007 1,332,744 26,654.88 9% 1 yr 333 days 4,587.56 
 5,675,313 113,506.26 
 
 37,005.31 
 The total amount of interest upon compensatory damages, derived from the preceding calculations, is $84,693.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">The cross-claim
 During the course of the exchange of pleadings in this case Brookland Valley made a cross-claim against Ms Rutter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">The details are no longer important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">Shortly before the trial Brookland Valley decided not to pursue the cross-claim, which may therefore be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">Costs
 I will hear the parties on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">Orders
 In my view the appropriate orders at the present time are: 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">The first respondent pay to the applicant the sum of $443,377, made up as follows: 
 
 (a) $208,684 as compensatory damages for breach of copyright, 
 
 (b) $84,693 as interest upon compensatory damages to the date of judgment, 
 
 (c) $150,000 as additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">The cross-claim is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">The parties will be heard on costs.</sentence>
