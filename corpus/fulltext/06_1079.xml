<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 I have before me an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith pronounced on 23 May 2006 by which his Honour dismissed an application by applicant SZHVH for an order that the respondent show cause why 'a remedy' ought not to be granted in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') in relation to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming on 15 November 2005 the decision of the respondent's delegate to refuse the applicant a Protection (Class XA) Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 Although these reasons are written for the benefit of the parties and necessarily involve a consideration of particular rules and principles, I have attempted to deal with the grounds of appeal identified in the draft notice of appeal in a way which will enable the self-represented applicant, assisted by an interpreter, to understand the reasons for deciding that leave to file the proposed notice of appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 The application was made pursuant to r 44.01 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) ('FMCR').</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">A hearing of the application for an order to show cause was conducted pursuant to r 44.12 of the FMCR which confers a power upon the court to dismiss the application if the court is not satisfied 'that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">If the court is satisfied that an application has raised an arguable case for the relevant relief, the court may adjourn the show cause proceeding and order a respondent to show cause at a final hearing why an order for the relief claimed should not be made on the grounds mentioned in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Alternatively, the court may make final orders in relation to the claims for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 Section 476(1) of the Act provides that the Federal Magistrates Court has the same original jurisdiction in relation to migration decisions 'as the High Court has under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Rule 44.14 of the FMCR provides that a writ of a particular kind issued by the Federal Magistrates Court under Part 44 which deals with 'Proceedings under the Migration Act 1958 ' must be substantially in the form of a writ of that kind issued under the High Court Rules 2004 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 Federal Magistrate Smith was not satisfied that the application raised an arguable case for the relief claimed by the applicant and accordingly his Honour dismissed the application pursuant to r 44.12(1)(a) of the FMCR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 Rule 44.12(2) provides that a dismissal of an application pursuant to paragraph (1)(a) of r 44.12 is 'interlocutory'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">An appeal lies from that order to the Federal Court of Australia pursuant to s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and s 24(1A) of that Act provides that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court that is an interlocutory judgment unless the court or a Judge gives leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">An application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment must be filed within seven days of the date on which the interlocutory judgment was pronounced or within such further time as the court or a Judge may allow (Order 52, r 10(2A)(b) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">7 In this case, the application for leave to appeal was filed on 7 June 2006 supported by an affidavit by the applicant annexing a draft notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">By the draft notice of appeal, the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith on three grounds, namely: 
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I meet the refugee criteria as I was discriminated by local Indonesian people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Tribunal failed to give procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">My fear of being killed is well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 
 
 8 The applicant is a national of Indonesia of Chinese ethnicity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In a statement attached to his Visa application, the applicant said that he: 
 
 '... came from a Chinese family, an ethnic group which had been targeted by the native Indonesian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I came to Australia to seek protection as my house in Sambas had been looted and burnt down to ashes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Some of my female relatives living in Jakarta were raped by the local.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">My female relatives were often sexually harassed by the native Indonesian at work and in the neighbourhood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I left Indonesia because I can no longer live in fear of harm and threat to my life ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Being an ethnic Chinese, my life has always been deprived of happiness, security, liberty and freedom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">I am afraid to go back as the possibility of being killed by the mob is high'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 
 
 9 The applicant's application was rejected by the delegate of the respondent on 13 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">On 16 August 2005, the applicant lodged an application for review with the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">On 12 September 2005, the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant addressed to the mailing address nominated in Section D of the Application for Review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The letter was sent pursuant to ss 425 and 425A of the Act and was addressed to the mailing address contemplated by s 441A(4)(c)(i).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The letter advised the applicant that the Tribunal had considered the material before it in relation to the application but was unable to make a decision in his favour on that information alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal invited the applicant to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The letter nominated a time, date and place for the hearing and advised the applicant that if he did not attend the hearing and the Tribunal elected not to postpone the hearing, the Tribunal could make a decision on the application without further notice to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">10 The applicant did not respond to the letter of 12 September 2005 nor was the letter returned to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The applicant did not attend the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On 25 October 2005, the Tribunal elected to exercise the power conferred upon it by s 426A(1) of the Act and proceeded to 'make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the decision record of the Tribunal, the Tribunal notes that it received no communication from the applicant and was unable to telephone him as no telephone contact had been provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Tribunal concluded that it was not satisfied on the evidence before it that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees ('the Refugees' Convention' and 'the Refugees' Protocol').</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">11 The applicant filed an application for review and appeared before the Federal Magistrates Court on 25 January 2006 assisted by an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The applicant subsequently filed an amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, no additional evidence was filed in support of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The applicant received a court book and advice and assistance under the free legal advice scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The applicant's affidavit in support of the application merely attached the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The amended application simply asserted one ground, namely, 'the Tribunal made the finding which is illogical'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Five particulars of the ground were given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Federal Magistrate Smith found that only one particular might have been capable of establishing a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The formulation of the particular was in these terms, 'the Tribunal has not taken or adequately taken into consideration that the applicant's claims that his relatives and family have been tortured simply because of his race'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">His Honour concluded that the Tribunal had considered the underlying merits of the application and that the remaining particulars were no more than a reassertion of the applicant's general claim to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">None of those particulars, in his Honour's view, supported a ground of jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">12 The draft notice of appeal contains the three grounds previously mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As to the first, the applicant simply asserts that he meets the criteria under the Refugees' Convention and the Refugees' Protocol because he was discriminated against by local Indonesian people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This ground is simply an attempt to review or re-open the merits of the matters put before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It does not demonstrate that his Honour erred by failing to identify jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It represents, understandably from the perspective of the applicant, an attempt to persuade the court that on the facts, the claimant is genuinely a refugee for the purposes of the Refugees' Convention and the Refugees' Protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">However, the question to be determined by the court is whether Federal Magistrate Smith made an error of law as contended for by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The ground is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">13 By the third ground, the applicant reasserts that his 'fear of being killed is well-founded'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Similarly, this ground is an invitation to reconsider the merits of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">To the extent that this ground of appeal set out in the draft notice of appeal is properly characterised as a contention that there was no basis upon which the Tribunal could have properly reached its conclusions and that Federal Magistrate Smith erred by failing to find that the conclusions reached by the Tribunal were not open to it, the ground fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The conclusions reached by the Tribunal were open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The ground does not identify any error on the part of his Honour in failing to identify a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">14 The second ground asserts that the Tribunal failed to afford the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The ground is entirely unparticularised and not supported by any material in the applicant's affidavit in support of the application for leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The claim that the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness to the applicant is simply a bare allegation .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">No material has been put before the court which challenges the validity of the invitation under s 425 or the notice under s 425A or any other aspect of the conduct of the Tribunal which might properly be characterised as a denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Plainly enough, a bare allegation of jurisdictional error is of no assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The applicant must provide the court with a basis upon which the error is said to arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">An examination of the Tribunal decision does not suggest a basis for considering that any jurisdictional error occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">15 Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the application for leave to appeal with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
