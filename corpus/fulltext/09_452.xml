<sentence id="s0">
 This is an application made under sections 459A and 459P of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the " Corporations Act ") by a creditor, Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd ("Sunstate Orchards"), for an order that the defendant Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd ("Citrus") be wound up in insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The background to the application is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In Federal Court proceeding QUD400 of 2005, Citrus, Mr Peter Michael Tracy, the sole director of Citrus, and another company incorporated by Mr Tracy called Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd ("Citrus No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2"), contended, put simply, that in reliance upon a number of representations said to have been made by Sunstate Orchards and its director, Mr Andrew Colin Strahley, to Citrus and Mr Tracy, Citrus as buyer entered into a contract with Sunstate Orchards as seller, to purchase two citrus orchards, one described as the Tiaro Orchard and the other as the Bundaberg Orchard; particular chattels, and, a contract to purchase land located at Maryborough containing a fruit packing shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Certain implementation steps were said to have been taken in reliance on the representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The representations were said to concern matters of existing fact such as fruit production and crop yields in a particular year and future matters such as likely costs of production, net profit and production pack-out rates applicable to fruit crops that were to be grown on the orchard lands in particular periods, among other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">These representations were said to be misleading when made, on a number of grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Citrus, Mr Tracy and Citrus No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 claimed against Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley (the respondents in the proceeding) damages for the contended losses suffered in reliance upon the representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The respondents contested the entire content of the claims including the formulation of the principal claim for damages concerning the contended loss of value in the acquisition of the lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In addition, Sunstate Orchards brought a cross-claim in the proceeding against Citrus on the footing that Citrus had failed to settle the contract for the acquisition of the packing shed land, had repudiated the contract and had caused Sunstate Orchards to suffer loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Sunstate Orchards also cross-claimed against Citrus for payment of an unpaid loan of $150,000 plus interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The principal controversy on these factual matters was one between Mr Tracy for Citrus and Mr Strahley for Sunstate Orchards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">After an 18 day trial and a lengthy judgment, the primary judge on 5 September 2008 dismissed all claims of all applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">No contended misrepresentation was established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">No finding of misleading or deceptive conduct was made against the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The claim against Mr Strahley was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicants having tested at trial each of the propositions they contended for, were wholly unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 17 October 2008, the primary judge ordered the applicants including Citrus to pay the costs of Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley of the proceeding excluding the costs of particular interlocutory applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley were ordered to pay the costs of four interlocutory applications dealt with in the course of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The solicitor for Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley, Mr Cotter, contends by his affidavit that the fees and costs of his clients of the proceeding are approximately $1,467,000 although those costs have not yet been assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Also on 5 September 2008, the primary judge gave judgment against Citrus in favour of Sunstate Orchards on the cross-claim for damages in the sum of $385,383 for breach of the Packing Shed Agreement and ordered Citrus to pay Sunstate Orchards the outstanding unsecured debt of $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Citrus was also ordered to pay interest on each amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">On 17 October 2008, the primary judge assessed interest on those amounts up to the date of judgment at $163,409.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Accordingly, judgment was entered in favour of Sunstate Orchards against Citrus in the sum of $698,792.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">During the course of the proceeding, the Full Court of this Court on 1 June 2006 ordered Citrus to provide security for the costs of the respondents to the proceeding of $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">A further order for security was made by the primary judge on 5 December 2006 of $75,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Total security of $225,000 was paid into Court by Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Citrus, Mr Tracy and Citrus No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">2 (the appellants) have filed a notice of appeal from the whole of the judgment of the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The appeal, as a result of the matters to be mentioned shortly, is to be heard in the August Sittings of the Full Court commencing on 17 August 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On 10 December 2008, the Court ordered that the appellants on or before 9 January 2009 provide security for the costs of the respondents to the appeal in an amount of $105,000 and the appeal be stayed until provision of the security or further order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The appellants were ordered to pay the respondents' costs of the security application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Security was not provided by 9 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 6 March 2009, the Court extended the date for provision of the security to 9 March 2009 and security was provided by Citrus by that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">On 10 December 2008, the Court granted an opposed application for a stay of the orders of 5 September 2008 on the cross-claim for payment by Citrus of $698,792.00, on condition that Citrus pay into Court an amount of $195,782.83 by 9 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That amount represented the unpaid loan component of the orders together with interest referable to that loan, up to judgment on 5 September 2008, of $45,782.83 ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1867).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Citrus did not pay into Court the amount on which the stay was conditioned, by 9 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It has not been paid since 9 January 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Thus, there is no stay of the judgment debt on the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">On 25 February 2009, Sunstate Orchards made demand for payment of the judgment debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">No payment has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On 18 March 2009, Sunstate Orchards filed this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The application and supporting affidavits were served at the registered office of Citrus on or about 18 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Tracy was served with the papers on 21 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The application was returnable on 17 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">At approximately 4.15pm on 16 April 2009, Mr Tracy as sole director of Citrus resolved in terms of s 436A(1) of the Corporations Act and Mr Jonathan McLeod was appointed administrator of Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">On 17 April 2009, Mr McLeod, through counsel on his behalf, sought an adjournment of the winding-up application on the footing that Mr Tracy had foreshadowed in writing a proposed Deed of Company Arrangement ("deed") to be put to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The administrator sought time to talk to Mr Tracy "to see how good the Deed of Company Arrangement is".</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr Lynch, solicitor, who was given leave to appear on behalf of Mr Tracy, made submissions that Mr Tracy had agreed to fund the appeal proceeding for the benefit of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Citrus which has at all material times acted as a trustee, is manifestly insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">During the course of the earlier proceeding Mr Tracy conceded in evidence that Citrus could not pay any judgment if unsuccessful in the litigation or any order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Tracy accepted in evidence that Citrus did not have sufficient assets to provide security for costs as earlier sought in an amount of $87,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Tracy ultimately provided loan monies to Citrus to fund the provision of security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The amount on which the stay order was conditioned has not been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Citrus borrowed $2,210,000 from the National Australia Bank secured by a fixed and floating charge over its assets and undertaking and specific mortgages over land registered in its name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Citrus failed to comply with obligations under those instruments and on 17 August 2006 the bank entered into possession of particular property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">On 7 March 2007, the bank appointed receivers and managers of the assets and undertakings secured by the fixed and floating charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The amount owing to the bank by Citrus at the date of appointment was $2,875,090.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The bank realised property under its control on 19 March 2007 and the receivers and managers realised property the subject of the bank's charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">An amount of $2,588,578 was paid to the bank in reduction of the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">At 15 December 2007, a value of nil was ascribed to assets of Citrus subject to the charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The charge has not been released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The amount still owing to the bank, the subject of the charge, is estimated at $600,000 which essentially represents accumulated interest on the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mrs Adrienne Tracy in March 2005 made a loan to Citrus of $1,150,000 secured by a second ranking fixed and floating charge over the assets and undertaking of Citrus and mortgages over land owned by Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">An amount of $1,994,094 is due and payable to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The fixed and floating charge has not been released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">There are, it seems, only two other creditors of Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Peter Tracy claimed to be owed $330,000 in respect of loans made to Citrus in respect of security although an amount of $1,460,644.95 is now claimed by Mr Tracy according to his Proof of Debt lodged in the administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Mrs Tracy now claims principal and interest of $1,998,085.61 according to her Proof of Debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The second creditor is Mr Peter Nichols who claims a debt of $46,774.22 for contract services provided in the year ending 30 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The company ceased trading in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">On 23 June 2005, Mr Tracy resolved that Citrus No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">2 (Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd) was insolvent or likely to become insolvent and that Mr David Hambleton be appointed as administrator of the company in accordance with Part 5.3A of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The field of creditors therefore are the bank, Mr Tracy, his wife Mrs Tracy, Mr Nichols and the judgment creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">On 17 April 2009, the winding up application was adjourned to 29 April 2009 to enable the administrators to isolate and identify with Mr Tracy the terms and conditions attaching to his proposal to establish a Deed of Company Arrangement and how that deed might be funded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Since the field of creditors is very contained and Mr Tracy has the carriage of Citrus's affairs and is the party proposing the deed, the application was adjourned to 29 April 2009 to enable discussions to take place between Mr Tracy and the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Those discussions would necessarily inform the exercise of the Court's discretion on the question arising under s 440A(2) as to whether the Court could be affirmatively satisfied that "it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The administrator was ordered to provide a report arising out of his discussions with Mr Tracy in relation to the company's affairs and Mr Tracy's proposal for a deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">A report was filed on 27 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In that report, Mr McLeod confirms the field of creditors of Citrus as discussed in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">He says he has spoken with Mr Tracy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He is to receive the books of account and financial statements of Citrus from Mr Tracy and the company's former accountant shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">He has not had time to determine whether any other assets might be available to the company arising out of any transactions that might be susceptible of challenge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The company is plainly insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr McLeod attaches to his report a deed proposed by Mr Tracy by which he proposes to continue to fund the costs of the appeal, which costs would be repaid to him in priority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Any fruits of a successful appeal would be available to the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Upon approval of the deed, the day to day management, operation, control, supervision and administration of Citrus would be returned to Mr Tracy subject only to the specific reservations expressed in the deed (cl 6.6.1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">During the arrangement, Citrus, subject to the overall supervision of the administrator, would be entitled to continue its business and undertaking (cl 6.6.2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">That undertaking now involves the acquisition of legal services in the conduct of the appeal and the conduct of consequential proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Clause 7.4 of the deed provides for a discharge of claims against Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">By cl 9.1.3, the proceeds of any judgment against Sunstate Orchards or Mr Strahley in the appeal or any subsequent retrial will be paid into the fund established for creditors under the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">By cl 9.2.1, Mr Tracy shall cause Citrus to prosecute the appeal and shall pay all legal expenses of Citrus in so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">A monthly report is to be made to the administrator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In the event that the administrator in good faith believes that Citrus is failing to prosecute the appeal with due diligence, he may require Citrus to show cause why he should not convene a meeting of creditors and seek termination of the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">By cl 9.2.6, Mr Tracy agrees to pay Citrus's costs of conducting any retrial of the primary proceeding and in the event that the administrator forms a good faith belief that Citrus is failing to prosecute any retrial, a meeting of creditors can be convened to consider termination of the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">On 29 April 2009, the application again came before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The administrator sought an adjournment of the application until a date after the second meeting of creditors on 22 May 2009 at which the deed proposed by Mr Tracy is to be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The administrator offers an undertaking not to sign the deed if approved by creditors until the matter has come before the Court again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The administrator says that the creditors should decide the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr Lynch on behalf of Mr Tracy supports that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The administrator says that the Court may, in any event, terminate the Deed of Company Arrangement under s 445D(1) of the Corporations Act on any of the grounds identified in that section including a ground that effect cannot be given to the deed without injustice or undue delay (ground 445D(1)(e)) and that the deed should be terminated for "some other reason" (ground 445D(1)(g)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mr Tracy has not filed any affidavit that gives content to how he would actually fund the deed and the obligations he has assumed under the deed to fund the costs of the appeal and any consequential proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The application was adjourned on 17 April 2009 to enable the administrator to conduct discussions so as to establish the precise basis on which Mr Tracy could and would fund the appeal and any subsequent proceedings, particularly having regard to the insolvency of Citrus and the history of its financial position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Tracy has not filed any affidavit identifying where the funds would come from and how he would propose to provide funds to support the obligations contained in the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Lynch seeks a further adjournment to enable such an affidavit to be filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Mr Tracy has had ample time to prepare an affidavit identifying these central matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The administrator considers that Citrus should execute the proposed Deed of Company Arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Four factors are identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The administrator says the estimated return is expected to be higher under the deed than the return to creditors should the company be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Secondly, the deed proposal is made at no direct cost to creditors and provides for a "potential return" to creditors that is well above any potential return under liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Thirdly, the deed is subject to further consultation with creditors and the administrator so as to ensure that there is no exposure with respect to potential adverse costs orders in any proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Fourthly, the administrator says that he has been advised by the director that "he is sufficiently financial to proceed with funding the appeal and the retrial of the matter (should one be ordered by the Court of Appeal)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">There is no content recited in the report or in any affidavit from Mr Tracy as to how that funding would be provided or as to the basis upon which a view could be formed that Mr Tracy "is sufficiently financial to proceed" with the obligations he proposes to undertake under the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The application ought not be further adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Citrus is to be wound up in insolvency for these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The company is manifestly insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If the appeal is unsuccessful, no creditor will receive anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">If the appeal is successful, the Full Court is likely to order a retrial of the principal proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Mr Tracy must then fund Citrus's costs of that action to trial and judgment and satisfy any security for costs orders likely to be made against Citrus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">No funds will be available to creditors unless and until Citrus establishes a judgment in its favour upon a retrial and is successful in any appeal, if filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The proposed fund to be established for creditors is contingent upon many uncertainties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The principal claim has already been the subject of a determination by a superior Court adverse to Citrus on the merits, after a lengthy trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Although the appeal cannot be characterised as frivolous or vexatious, the judgment of the Court at first instance ought not to be treated as simply a provisional determination of the issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The claims made by Citrus have been fully ventilated in a trial and judgment entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Citrus made an application for a stay which was conditionally successful, yet the condition attaching to the stay was not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The proposed adjournment of the winding-up application coupled with the proposal to establish a Deed of Company Arrangement on the terms put forward by Mr Tracy simply defeats the order in relation to the stay application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Should Citrus ultimately be successful in a retrial of its proceeding, the likely award of damages will not exceed the debt due to the bank under its charge, presently assessed at $600,000, together with accumulating interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On one view, the potential damages may be formulated in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The settlement sum paid in acquisition of the orchards was $3,005,986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Miscellaneous expenses were $138,696.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The market value based on the case put forward by Citrus, at the relevant date, was $2,800,000 resulting in a loss of $344,682.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">However, for present purposes, I proceed on the footing that damages in the principal action may be in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The primary judge in the principal proceeding did not assess damages in light of other findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If an award of damages ultimately made, does exceed the bank's debt, the excess of damages will flow to Mrs Tracy under her charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The balance of her claim would remain unsatisfied as would the claims of Mr Tracy and Mr Nichols and any claim Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley may have based upon unsatisfied costs orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Thus it follows that the bank may be in a significantly better position under the deed if the contingencies upon which a fund depends all fall in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Mrs Tracy may be partially advanced in recovery of some of the debt owed to her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">However, I cannot be satisfied that the creditors as a group are better off by allowing the company to continue in administration rather than in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The administrator and Mr Lynch contend that the bank has breached its duty to Citrus in respect of the treatment of water licences in relation to particular lands, and any step taken by the bank to recover any further monies under the security (such as the proceeds of a judgment) would be resisted and, if necessary, Citrus would commence proceedings seeking appropriate relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That action represents another proceeding which Mr Tracy would be required to fund in order to prevent the bank attaching, under its security, any damages awarded as a result of a proposed retrial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The discretion under s 440A(2) is to be exercised having regard to the well known observations of McPherson J (Davies and Pincus JJ concurring) in Creevey v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456 (see also Re First Netcom Pty Ltd (2000) 35 ACSR 615 , per Santow J) concerning the closely related question of whether the creditors could hope to get more by way of payment of their debts from administration rather than liquidation and whether there is persuasive evidence of assets which if realised under one form of administration rather than the other would produce a larger or accelerated dividend to the creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The hope must however be a real and not remote possibility, unclouded by cascading contingencies all of which must fall in before an asset might become available to the creditors as a group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">In Creevey , the Court discounted a contended claim as a possible asset available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In that case the foreshadowed claim had not been formulated in any concrete way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The claim in this case has been formulated but has already been found to be unmeritorious after a lengthy trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">A liquidator of Citrus could form a view about the merits of the proceeding and conduct discussions with Mr Tracy as to his willingness to fund the liquidator in the conduct of an appeal and any subsequent retrial of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In considering the exercise of the discretion under s 440A(2) of the Act, I accept that there is no evidence upon which any transaction entered into by Citrus might be called into question in a way which would produce further funds to a liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The question is whether the Court can be affirmatively satisfied that it is in the interests of creditors that the company continue in administration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Having regard to all of these factors, I cannot be so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">It necessarily follows that the company must be wound up in insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The orders are those recited in the formal orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">I certify that the preceding thirty (30) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
