 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Audi Australia Pty Ltd ("Audi") is the Australian importer and wholesaler of Audi motor vehicles to Audi dealers located throughout Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">This proceeding concerns an advertising campaign conducted by Audi in relation to the Audi Q7 Series of motor vehicles, including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE motor vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The advertising campaign was conducted between 23 June 2007 and 18 August 2007 by way of seven advertisements on broadsheet pages in "The Age" and 3 half broadsheet pages in the "Sydney Morning Herald", a brochure entitled the "2006 Specification Brochure" available from its dealerships and on its website and, finally, the Audi website which included the 2006 Specification Brochure (collectively "the Advertising Material").</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 By application dated 8 November 2007, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") alleged that Audi, by publishing the Advertising Material, engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 52 , 53 (a), 53 (c) and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 27 November 2007, the ACCC and Audi agreed to compromise the proceeding and submitted to the Court orders which the parties sought by consent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The proposed orders were submitted by consent on the basis that Audi also gave certain undertakings to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 As a general principle, a court does not make declarations on matters relating to public rights by consent or on admissions, but only if it is satisfied by evidence: ASIC v Rich (No 2) (2004) 22 ACLC 1232 at [10]; Williams v Powell [1894] WN (Eng) 141; Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221 at 225---227; Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525; Wallersteiner v Moir [1974] 3 All ER 217; Metzger v Department of Health and Social Security [1977] 3 All ER 444 at 451; BMI Ltd v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (NSW) Branch (1983) 51 ALR 401; Young P W, Declaratory Orders (2nd ed, 1984) [601].</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 The evidence adduced in support of the resolution of the proceeding on the terms of the proposed consent orders was a copy of the Advertising Material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">These reasons for decision record why, in my view, it is appropriate for the Court to make orders in terms of the proposed consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">FACTS 
 
6 The facts are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Advertising Material was published; each of the advertisements was published either in the Age or the Sydney Morning Herald, the 2006 Specification Brochure was available from Audi's dealerships and on its website and the 2007 Specification Brochure was available on its website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">7 The ACCC submits that Audi made representations in the Advertising Material that:
 
 
 (1) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is a motor vehicle with 7 seats as a standard feature ("the 7 Seat Representation");
 (2) motor vehicles in the Audi Q7 Series have 7 seats as a standard feature ("the 7 Seat Series Representation");
 (3) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is a motor vehicle available for a purchase price of $79,900 ("the Price Representation");
 (4) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is a motor vehicle with 7 seats available for a purchase price of $79,900 ("the 7 Seat Price Representation");
 (collectively "the Representations").</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 

8 I have carefully reviewed the Advertising Material several times and have sought to assess the likely effect of each on potential customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In reviewing the Advertising Material I had at the forefront the caution from Lindgren J in Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [47] regarding television advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Of course, similar caution must be adopted when reviewing the Advertising Material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">9 I accept that the following Representations were conveyed in the following Advertising Material:
 Advertising Material Episode Representations Conveyed The Age First to Sixth Advertisements 23 June 2007, 7, 14, 28 July 2007 4 and 11 August 2007 7 Seat Representation Price Representation 7 Seat Price Representation The Age Seventh Advertisement (18 August 2007) 7 Seat Representation 7 Seat Price Representation Sydney Morning Herald Eighth Advertisement (30 June --- 1 July 2007) 7 Seat Representation Price Representation 7 Seat Price Representation Sydney Morning Herald Ninth and Tenth Advertisements (7-8 July 2007 and 21-22 July 2007) 7 Seat Series Representation Audi Website 7 Seat Series Representation 2007 Specifications Brochure August 2007 7 Seat Series Representation 2006 Specifications Brochure August 2006 7 Seat Series Representation 
10 Next, the ACCC submits that the Representations were false, misleading or deceptive on the basis that:
 
 
 (1) the Audi Q7 Series motor vehicles including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE have 5 seats as a standard feature;
 (2) 7 seats is an option available in the Audi Q7 Series motor vehicles including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE;
 (3) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is not available for purchase as a 7 seat vehicle at or from $79,900; 
 
 
 (4) the Audi Q7 3.6 SE is not available for purchase at or from $79,900; 
 
 
 (5) there is a fee or charge to be paid in addition to the price of $79,900 to purchase an Audi Q7 3.6 SE vehicle for mandatory components including dealer delivery and statutory charges; and
 (6) there is a fee or charge to be paid in addition to the price of $79,900 for the 2 optional extra seats (in order to have 7 seats).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 7 Seat and 7 Seat Price Representations 
 
11 Audi admits that:
 
 
 (1) by making the 7 Seat Representation, it engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 52 , 53 (a), 53 (c) and 55 of the Act ; and
 (2) by making the 7 Seat Price Representation, it engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 (e) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 

 The declarations in paragraphs 1 and 5 of the Orders are directed to these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 Seat Series Representations 
 
12 Audi admits that by making the 7 Seat Series Representation, it engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 52 , 53 (a), 53 (c) and 55 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The declarations in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Orders are directed to these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Price Representations 
 
13 Audi admits that by making the Price Representation, it engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 (e) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The declaration in paragraph 4 of the Orders is directed to these contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">ORDERS 
 
14 As already noted, the proposed Orders provide for declarations in relation to Audi's admitted contraventions of ss 52 , 53 (a), 53 (c) and 55 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The proposed Orders also provide for a publication order pursuant to ss 86D(2)(a) and (b) of the Act and for Audi to pay the costs of the ACCC fixed in the sum of $25,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In addition to the proposed Orders, Audi offered to give undertakings to the Court to the effect that it will not repeat the contravening conduct in respect of the Audi Q7 Series of motor vehicles and it will continue to administer and review its trade practices compliance program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">15 In my view, it is appropriate for there to be orders in accordance with the minute of proposed orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The orders are within power and otherwise appropriate: ACCC v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2001] ATPR 41-840 at [24] and ACCC v Econovite Pty Ltd [2003] ATPR 41-959 at [12].</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Moreover, in the circumstances, it is in the public interest that these proceedings be settled: see Kiefel J in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v ACCC (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 291.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">16 In the circumstances, I will make orders in accordance with the minutes of proposed orders in conjunction with the undertakings to be given by Audi to the Court.</sentence>

<sentence id="s34">the reference to the additional fee or charge of $1,700 was not prominent or likely to come to the attention of persons reading the advertisements .</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 The Court also declared that by making these representations Audi Australia misled the public regarding the price of the Audi Q7 3.6 SE and the standard or quality, the nature, the characteristics and the suitability for their purpose of the motor vehicles in the Audi Q7 Series, including the Audi Q7 3.6 SE.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Further, the Court declared that Audi Australia had represented that motor vehicles in the Audi Q7 Series had performance characteristics, uses or benefits that they did not have.</sentence>
