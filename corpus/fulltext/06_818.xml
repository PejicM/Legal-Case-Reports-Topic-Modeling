 THE APPEALS 
 
 1 These are appeals by three taxpayers against appealable objection decisions made by the respondent (the "Commissioner") in connection with their taxation returns for the years ended 30 June 1995, 30 June 1996, 30 June 1997, 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr and Mrs Weyers are husband and wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Nommack Nominees Pty Ltd ("Nommack Nominees") was originally known as Robert Weyers Constructions Pty Ltd and later, as Zapped Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Since December 1994 it has been the trustee of the Elizabeth Street Sydney trust (the "Sydney trust"), or at least that is the case advanced by all three applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Mr and Mrs Weyers are directors and shareholders of Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 MR WEYERS' TRADING HISTORY 
 
 2 Mr Weyers has, for a long time, worked in the construction and property development industries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">At one stage he was a tradesman, conducting his business through Nommack Nominees, then known as Robert Weyers Constructions Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He and his family moved to Queensland in 1983 when he took up a position with Richard Crookes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd ("the Crookes company").</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In or about 1991 the Crookes company went into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Weyers was a director and had given personal guarantees of its debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Trade creditors sought to enforce the guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">At that time Robert Weyers Constructions changed its name to Zapped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Weyers survived financially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Since that time, he and Mrs Weyers have been concerned to avoid personal liability for trade debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Until late 1994 Mr Weyers traded through a company called Cherrybrook Pty Ltd ("Cherrybrook") as trustee of the Weyers Family Trust (the "family trust").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Initially, Cherrybrook contracted for the supply of Mr Weyers' services to Forrester Parker Developments Pty Ltd ("Forrester") which company was completing projects previously undertaken by the Crookes company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The arrangement between Cherrybrook and Forrester continued until late 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">By that time Cherrybrook was also engaging in other projects not involving Forrester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Weyers expected that Cherrybrook would derive substantially increased income in the future and so consulted his accountants about tax minimization.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He initially spoke to a Mr Don Steele, but Mr Steele's son, Mr Ross Steele, was primarily involved in the events which followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 TAX MINIMIZATION ADVICE, MR STEELE, MR PRIDDLE AND MR COLLIE 
 
 3 Mr Ross Steele or Mr Don Steele consulted two persons who were experienced in tax minimization, Mr Priddle and Mr Collie, both solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Priddle was practising on his own account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Collie practised with a firm, Cleary Hoare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I infer that thereafter, Mr and Mrs Weyers acted upon advice given by either Mr Ross Steele, Mr Priddle or Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">After Nommack Nominees became involved in relevant transactions, it also acted on such advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">4 Mr Priddle recommended that Mr and Mrs Weyers "acquire" a trust which had accumulated losses against which income could be "set off" for tax purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">At that time, Mr Priddle expected that the efficacy of such a device might be adversely affected by anticipated amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act (1936) (Cth) (the "ITA Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It was therefore necessary to move quickly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He approached Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Mr Collie knew of the Sydney trust and, in late 1994, it was decided that Mr and Mrs Weyers should acquire control of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Priddle had previously known nothing about the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Collie attended to the necessary documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">At some stage Mr Priddle advised the Weyers that the proposal was lawful and effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">In a letter to Mr Weyers, dated 21 December 1994 he said:
 'I refer to our recent discussions in relation to the affairs of the Elizabeth Street Sydney Trust and confirm that I have researched the records and affairs of the Trust thoroughly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The transaction reflected in the Facilitation Agreement and the Deed of the Removal of Appointment of Trustee makes it clear at law that the new Trustee (and therefore the Trust) cannot in any way be liable for any debts of the Trust incurred before today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 
 5 In evidence he said that in advising Mr Weyers to acquire the Sydney trust he had not considered whether there was any continuity as between the trust's previous business and that to be conducted through it by Mr Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">6 It is convenient at this stage to say a little about Mr Collie's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In 1992 he acquired a company called ComLaw Pty Ltd which was appointed to be trustee of the ComLaw trust and undertook all future activities in that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mr Collie originally intended that it would perform syndication work in relation to property developments but in the early 1990s, he identified opportunities arising out of the collapsed property market, particularly in Sydney and Adelaide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In order to take advantage of these opportunities ComLaw acquired two other companies, Annesley Investments Pty Ltd ("Annesley") and Haven Sea Pty Ltd ("Haven Sea").</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">At all material times Mr Collie was a director of both companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Annesley became trustee of the Annesley Trust which was established on 1 May 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">These entities played minor roles in the transactions subsequently entered into by the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">7 During 1994 and 1995 ComLaw was approached by accountants, some seeking to find a market for clients who "owned" trusts which had accumulated losses and others seeking entities with deductible tax losses for acquisition by clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Collie decided that Annesley and Haven Sea should enter that market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The general basis upon which they operated in acquiring and selling "entities" was as follows: 
 
 
 '10.1 Only trusts with assets (whether realised or unrealised deductible losses) would be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It was recognised that whilst a trust would not fail for want of a trustee, it would do so for want of any assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.2 Accordingly, care was taken as far as possible to ensure that any prospective trust had always retained some assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 10.3 Annesley would assume the role of a facilitator and acquire control of relevant trusts when there appeared to be a prospect of marrying a vendor and a purchaser with a significant price difference between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 10.4 Haven Sea would assume the role of trustee at the time the acquisition was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 10.5 In order to limit any financial exposure to Annesley, the acquisitions were only to be made on the purchaser committing to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 
 
 8 The documents used to give effect to such transactions included:- 
 
 '10.6.1 A Facilitation Agreement pursuant to which Annesley acquired effective control of the loss trust from the relevant interests of the vendor described as the "Facilitators" ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 10.6.2 A Deed of Removal and Appointment of Trustee pursuant to which Haven Sea was appointed the new trustee in lieu of vendor interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Deed also provided for the acquisition by Annesley for a nominal sum of the previous trustee's right of indemnity against trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.6.3 Financial Statements relating to the period up to the acquisition by Annesley being provided and confirmed by the vendor or parties associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.6.4 A Facilitation Agreement pursuant to which Annesley (as Facilitator) agreed to transfer control of the trust with the difference between the consideration payable under this agreement and that payable under the agreement referred to in sub-paragraph 1 above representing the profit to be derived by Annesley on the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10.6.5 A Deed of Removal and Appointment of Trustee which, in essence, provided for the appointment of the purchaser's nominee as the new trustee of the trust and also saw the transfer of the right of indemnity to interests associated with the purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In most cases, the consideration payable was equivalent to the consideration payable under the Deed relating to the change of trustee in favour of Haven Sea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 10.6.6 Financial statements and business records being provided to the purchaser's interests and, if possible and relevant, statutory declarations from those aware of the previous business dealings of the trust being acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">' 
 
 
 9 Mr Collie said that this approach was used in about eight transactions in the period from 30 June 1994 to 30 April 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">10 In late 1994 Mr Collie was contacted by Mr Gary Urwin of the Sydney accounting firm, Hall Chadwick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">He indicated that clients of that firm had incurred significant trading losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He inquired whether there was a market in Brisbane for such "entities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The word "entities" seems to have referred to, or included, the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">At about that time Mr Collie was also contacted by Mr Priddle on behalf of the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Mr Collie said that 'At some point soon thereafter, it became apparent that (the Sydney trust) could be suitable given the quantum of losses and the likely purchase/sale costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">' Mr Collie "acquired" the trust and "assigned" it to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">This occurred in or about December 1994, prior to the date on which sch 2F (ss 265-5 --- 272-140) of the ITA Act took effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 THE SYDNEY TRUST 
 
 11 The history of the Sydney trust appears from the affidavit of Richard Thomas de Lauret Arnold, a chartered accountant, and those of two solicitors, Mr Robinson and Mr Creais.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Mr Arnold was, from its incorporation in 1984 until 1989, a director of Nommack (No 75) Pty Ltd ("Nommack (No 75)"), the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">No explanation has been given for choice of the name Nommack Nominees as the new name for Zapped Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It was unrelated to Nommack (No 75).</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The Sydney trust was established on 11 October 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Nommack (No 75) was its trustee from that date, probably until June, 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Mr Arnold prepared its tax returns until 1989 and, after the Weyers obtained control of it, for the years 1990 to 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">12 The Sydney trust was set up by Frank William Theeman and George Adler, both of whom were Mr Arnold's clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">They intended to use it as a vehicle for the purchase and sale of property in the Sydney central business district.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">They acquired Nommack (No 75) for use as its trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The trust deed is dated 11 October 1985 and records that the settlor, Vernette Elizabeth McLean, transferred to Nommack (No 75) the sum of one dollar upon the terms and conditions of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">There is confusion in the trust accounts as to whether the original settled amount was one dollar or ten dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The beneficiaries identified are:
 '(a) National Heart Foundation of Australia Queensland Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 (b) The Australian Red Cross Society Queensland Division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 (c) The Royal Guide Dogs for the Blind Association of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 
 (d) Any person or corporation (not being the Settlor) who or which at the time hereof or at any time prior to the vesting day has made or makes a donation to any one or more of the above named beneficiaries in the sum of $2 or upwards and who or which (with the consent of the Guardian should there be a person or company holding such office) the Trustee may at any time and from time to time after June 30, 1985 and before the vesting day nominate to be a general beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 (e) Any person, corporation, trustee of any trust or charity as the Appointor shall by notice in writing to the Trustee after June 30 1985 and before the vesting day appoint to be a beneficiary for the purpose of this Deed PROVIDED THAT the following shall not be appointed beneficiaries for the purpose of this subclause; 
 (i) the Settlor; 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) any trust which would if appointed result in the infringement of the law against perpetuities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) Any assignee of rights of a beneficiary including any assignee of a part of those rights or of the right to receive income in whole or in part indefinitely for a fixed or limited period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 
 
 
 13 The trust deed contemplated the appointment of both an appointor and a guardian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Pursuant to sch 3 the first guardian was F.W.T.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Investments Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The first appointor was Commercial Administrations (Kogarah) Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The guardian could, in effect, control aspects of the trustee's exercise of powers under the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The taxpayers accept that at all times relevant to these proceedings, there was no guardian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The appointor was empowered to appoint new trustees and a new appointor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 THEEMAN AND ADLER --- PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 14 Mr Arnold said that Messrs Theeman and Adler conducted their business in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Having identified a property for development, they would then acquire a new trustee company and establish a separate trust for the venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The trustee would enter into an agreement to purchase the chosen property, borrowing the amount of the deposit pursuant to a limited recourse loan agreement with Rothwells, a merchant bank, or one of its associated companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The terms of the loan provided for the equal division of nett profits between the lender and the trustee, after repayment of loan moneys and interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Theeman and Adler were not, themselves, developers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">They acquired property only for resale to developers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">15 According to Mr Arnold, the Sydney trust was established by Theeman and Adler as a vehicle for the purchase and sale of property at 261 and 263 Elizabeth Street, Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">That property was acquired and re-sold prior to 30 June 1987 for a nett profit of about $500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Notwithstanding the previously stated policy of using a new company and a new trust for each project, Messrs Theeman and Adler decided to use the Sydney trust in the acquisition and sale (the "Elizabeth Street project") of another property at 142-148 Elizabeth Street, Sydney (the "Elizabeth Street property").</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In August 1987 Nommack (No 75), as trustee of the Sydney trust, entered into a contract to buy that property for $16.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">A deposit of $1.65 million was paid, having been advanced to Nommack (No 75) by Media Portfolio Ltd. Mr Arnold understood that company to be a member of the Rothwells Group, based in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">However other evidence suggests that it was associated with a Mr Peter Lucas and was based in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Arnold's evidence invites the inference that the loan was on terms similar to those set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I am not sure that I should draw it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">16 The funds were advanced by way of a commercial bill facility for a fixed period, but in the expectation that it would be renegotiated at maturity and "rolled over" for up to two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Mr Arnold said in par 19 of his affidavit:
 'In terms of the loan arrangements, the trustee Nommack No 75 remained liable for repayment of the deposit monies and accrued interest to Media Portfolio (even in the event of the Contract of Sale not proceeding).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I recall that Frank Theeman was a man of substantial wealth whilst Mr Adler had very few assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Mr Theeman was concerned in relation to his liability on borrowed funds and insisted that any borrowings that they undertook were to be limited only to the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">That is, there were to be no personal guarantees or other recourse beyond the special project vehicle and its assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">' 
 
 17 Mr Arnold did not identify the source of his knowledge as set out in the first sentence of the paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">One might reasonably expect a director of Nommack (No 75) to have had such knowledge, but other parts of the evidence suggest that he had no direct knowledge of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The project failed, and the vendor forfeited the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It is not entirely clear whether this was because Nommack Nominees could not find a buyer or because it could not find funds to complete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Perhaps it was a combination of both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Such difficulties were said to have resulted from the collapse of the property market and the 1987 stock market "crash".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">18 On 11 August 1988 Nommack (No 75) lodged a caveat over the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">I infer that, by that date, it was in default, and that the vendor had rescinded, or threatened to rescind, the contract, forfeiting the deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Mr Theeman died on 24 January 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">On 10 September 1990 the vendor applied, pursuant to the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), for an 'application for preparation of lapsing notice'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">That is apparently the process used by registered proprietors in New South Wales to remove caveats.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Evidence from the solicitors who were then acting for Nommack (No 75), Messrs Robinson and Creais, suggests that in all probability, the caveat was subsequently removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Mr Arnold cannot remember the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">I infer that the caveat has been removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It is inconceivable that it could still be current in light of the subsequent history of Nommack (No 75).</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Arnold understood that the debt owed to Media Portfolio was never forgiven or repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It continued to accumulate interest which Mr Arnold showed as a debt in the accounts of Nommack (No 75) for the years 1990 --- 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">According to Mr Arnold, an additional debt of $133,971 was incurred for consultancy fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">As far as the evidence goes, neither Nommack (No 75) nor the Sydney trust entered into any further transactions until late 1994 or early 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 "TRANSFER" OF THE SYDNEY TRUST TO MR COLLIE 
 
 19 On 20 June 1994, the appointor, Commercial Administrations (Kogarah) Pty Ltd, now known as Hall Chadwick NSW Management Consulting Pty Ltd ("Hall Chadwick NSW"), appointed V.A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Clothing Pty Ltd ("VA Clothing") to be trustee of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">VA Clothing was controlled by Mr Arnold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I infer that this step was taken in preparation for the transfer of the trust to some other person, perhaps Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Until 29 February 1996 Mr Arnold's wife was also a director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">They both attended a meeting of the board held on 20 June 1994 at which the company's appointment as trustee was noted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Under the heading 'Indemnity' , the minutes recorded that: 
 'The Chairman referred to the Elizabeth Street Sydney Trust and reported that he had negotiated acquisition of the right of indemnity from the former Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In view of the trust's liabilities, the acquisition price was agreed to be $1,000 to be satisfied by payment of the amount in part settlement of professional accountancy fees due by the former trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">
 RESOLVED to execute any necessary documents to complete the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 20 This suggests that Mr Arnold had negotiated the assignment of the right of indemnity by Nommack (No 75) in payment of his outstanding fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">One might have inferred that Mr Arnold was the assignee, but that would not explain why the matter was raised at the board meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">In subsequent transactions it seems to have been assumed that VA Clothing was the assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">There is no other evidence as to the terms of the assignment, nor as to the mechanism by which Nommack (No 75) made the assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It also seems to have subsequently been assumed that Nommack (No 75) had, by such assignment, released its claim to indemnity from the trust assets for any debt properly incurred by it as trustee of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I would not infer such release from the content of the minutes of the meeting of 20 June 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">I would rather have inferred that the assignment was of the future benefit of the right to indemnity, although such an assignment would be unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The trust deed and equitable principles would have conferred such right on any new trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">21 As at 20 June 1994, according to Mr Arnold, the trust assets included:
 &#8226; the settlement sum of $10; 
 &#8226; an unsecured loan to Nommack (No 41) Pty Ltd in the amount of $1,700;
 &#8226; an entitlement to the refund of stamp duty paid on the contract to purchase the Elizabeth Street property; and
 &#8226; the books and records of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">22 The settlement sum was, in fact, one dollar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In cross-examination, Mr Arnold agreed that he had not physically received that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He also accepted that Mr Theeman had, prior to his death in 1989, recovered the stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Mr Robinson's evidence demonstrates as much.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">As there is no evidence of the receipt of that refund by Nommack (No 75), one might infer either that it did not pay the stamp duty in the first place, or that Mr Theeman's estate owes the relevant amount to Nommack (No 75) or to the present trustee, Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is no evidence as to the source of funds used to pay the stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">There is some evidence that the liquidator of Media Portfolio enquired about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">This might suggest that its records show that it paid the stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">23 Exhibit RTLA9 to Mr Arnold's affidavit is a "facilitation agreement", apparently dated 23 December 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">This was evidenced by the "transfer" of the Sydney trust to Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The typed date is "22", but this has been crossed out and the date "23" inserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The parties are VA Clothing, Hall Chadwick NSW and Annesley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">24 Mr Arnold asserted that on 23 December 1994 VA Clothing became appointor of the Sydney trust pursuant to cl 10 of the facilitation agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Pursuant to a deed of removal and appointment of trustee, which is schedule 2 to the facilitation agreement, VA Clothing was to become trustee prior to settlement, but then to be replaced by Haven Sea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">On my reading of cl 10 of the facilitation agreement, Annesley became appointor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The facilitation agreement recorded Annesley's wish to obtain control of the trust, 'including all assets and liabilities' and provided that at completion, Annesley was to be put in control of various records, choses in action and a 'Duly executed deed in the form of the Deed referred to in Part Six of the Schedule ', apparently the deed of removal and appointment of trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Consideration for the "acquisition" was the sum of $35,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">25 On or about 24 December 1994 Mr Arnold signed and lodged tax returns for the years 1989-90 to 1993-94.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The return for 1994 showed accumulated losses of $2,655,292.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Arnold said that the debt of $1,700, shown in the accounts as owing by Nommack (No 41) to the trustee, was the balance of funds previously held by Nommack (No 75) as trustee, which funds were not needed and so were lent to Nommack (No 41).</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Mr Arnold was a director of that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">It has been wound up and/or de-registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">26 The accumulated losses were apparently reflective of debts owed to Media Portfolio, Ratic Investments Pty Ltd and Nommack (No 100) Pty Ltd (the "trust debtors").</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It seems that all of these debts arose out of the Elizabeth Street project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The vast bulk of the indebtedness was allegedly owed to Media Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">I understand the parties to have conducted the case upon the basis that all three debts should be treated in the same way for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The dispute is as to how all three should be treated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">27 It seems that in addition to the consideration identified in the facilitation agreement, the sum of $10,000 was paid to persons entitled to share in Mr Theeman's estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">
 "TRANSFER" OF THE SYDNEY TRUST TO THE WEYERS 
 
 28 The documentation evidencing the transfer of control of the Sydney trust to the Weyers was in much the same form as that adopted in transferring control to Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The facilitation agreement dated 21 December 1994 recited the fact that Mr Weyers wished to obtain 'control of the trust including all assets and liabilities' and that Annesley and Haven Sea (the appointor and trustee) were willing to facilitate delivery of such control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">At completion Mr Weyers was to receive:

 29 That deed was a deed of removal and appointment of trustee similar in form to that used in the earlier transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Weyers was to pay to Haven Sea the sum of $155,000, $85,000 on completion and the balance on or before 31 March 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">At the completion date the Sydney trust was to have no liabilities other than those disclosed in financial statements and final accounts '... within a reasonable time after the completion date' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">There were to be no outstanding contracts, engagements or agreements binding the trust, and the trust and trustee were to have complied with 'all material requirements and obligations statutory and lawful in respect of their accounts and records and the lodgment of all statutory returns of both the Trust and the Trustee ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">30 The deed of removal and appointment of trustee is dated 24 December 1994, the "4" having been handwritten over a pre-existing printed figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The settlement date was also 24 December 1994, that date having been similarly inserted by hand-written amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The deed recites that Haven Sea was:
 &#8226; 'to be appointed the trustee of the Trust with effect from the date set out in Part 7 of the Schedule (24 December 1994) on terms including the acquisition of the right of indemnity against trust assets to which (Nommack (No 75) was entitled ...' and

<sentence id="s189">' 
 31 The deed also provided that the appointor (Annesley) would appoint Nommack Nominees as trustee in lieu of Haven Sea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Haven Sea would, at the option of Mr Weyers: 
 
 
 '2.1 Assign and transfer all its right, title and interest in the right of indemnity to (Mr Weyers) or (his) nominee in which event (Haven Sea) shall forever discharge and release the assets of the Trust and (Nommack Nominees) and any liability for stamp duty in respect of such assignment and transfer shall be borne by (Mr Weyers).</sentence>

 32 The deed also provided that '... provision by (Mr Weyers) at settlement of a notice in writing exercising his option shall be sufficient to give full effect to (subclause 2.2) without further documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">' At some stage, probably on or about 22 or 23 December 1994, Mr Weyers nominated Cherrybrook for this purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">See exhibit RW15 to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 THE SYDNEY TRUST AND THE WEYERS --- TRADING HISTORY 
 
 33 It seems that Mr Weyers was employed by Cherrybrook until 20 December 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">On 30 March 1995, Nommack Nominees entered into an agreement with Forrester for the supply of consultancy services, but with effect from 20 December 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">As it is common ground that Mr Weyers was to provide such services to Forrester as an employee of Nommack Nominees, I infer that he ceased working for Cherrybrook on that date and immediately commenced employment with Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Mrs Weyers became secretary of Nommack Nominees and provided bookkeeping services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Nommack Nominees paid salaries to both Mr and Mrs Weyers, but they concede that the amounts were not sufficient to meet their living expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">They regularly paid for personal and household outgoings from Sydney trust funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">To the extent that such payments were not treated in the trust accounts as salaries, they were treated as loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">
 TRUST INCOME AND OUTGOINGS 
 
 34 Relevant aspects of the trust financial records for the tax years from 1994-1995 to 2001-2002 are set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">These figures are subject to two qualifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Firstly, in each year, I have identified nett business income and other items of income, most of which are quite small.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The total of such items was probably not the taxable income for the year in question because there were some minor deductions or adjustments which I have not included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">However I have treated it as being the taxable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">In each year, I have then identified the purported set off of that taxable income against accumulated trust losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Because I may have overlooked some minor deductions, the statement that in each year a particular amount was set off against accumulated losses may not be precisely correct, but it is close enough to give a fair impression of the way in which the Weyers' affairs and those of the trust were conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Secondly, the evidence suggests that there were some amended returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">I may have overlooked one or more of them but again, the overall impression is fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">However these figures should not be used as a basis for any further calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">
 1995 
 

Nett business income $184,383 (from Forrester)
Distribution from non-primary production income $156,887 (from Cherrybrook)
Interest $ 207 
 $341,477

This sum was allegedly set off against prior year losses, leading to an assessable income of nil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The balance sheet shows the following outstanding loans owing to Nommack Nominees as at 30 June 1995 and as at 30 June 1994:

I understand "K Weyers" to be Mrs Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Thus loans to Mr and Mrs Weyers in this tax year exceeded $180,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">As I understand the evidence, the debt previously owed by Nommack (No 41) was written off rather than paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The 1995 balance sheet shows non-current liabilities at 30 June 1995 as totalling $2,656,991, including:

 35 Of the above figures Mr Weyers gave some explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The amount of $156,887 identified in the 1995 return as a distribution from partnerships and trusts was a distribution from Cherrybrook as trustee of the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Exhibit RW5 to Mr Weyers' affidavit contains minutes of a meeting of the directors of Cherrybrook as trustee, held on 3 March 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Mr and Mrs Weyers attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The minutes noted a profit to 28 February 1995 of $207,413 and a decision to make an interim distribution of $160,00 to be 'paid set aside and applied for the benefit of Nommack Nominees Pty Ltd ... (as trustee for the Elizabeth Street Sydney Trust)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">However it seems that Cherrybrook was to retain possession of that amount and 'reinvest the same by way of loan or loans on behalf of each beneficiary to The Weyers Family Trust such loan or loans being interest-free and repayable on demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">' Although the wording is a little obscure, this seems to mean that the money was to be lent by the Sydney trust to the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">At a subsequent meeting held on 28 June 1995, an appropriation of a capital gain of $4,014 was made in favour of Karen Weyers, presumably Mrs Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">This led to a trust loss for the year ended 30 June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">That loss was 'applied in reducing the amount of the interim distribution to Nommack Nominees Pty Ltd' , reducing the amount of the original distribution of $160,000 to $155,268.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">The figures do not quite add up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">36 In the 1995 year, according to Mr Steele, 'A PPS credit was incorrectly included in the personal returns of Robert Weyers and Barbara Karen Weyers of $28,000 each and incorrectly excluded from the ESST taxation return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">' This seems to be a distribution of the PPS credit of $56,000 which appears in the Sydney trust's return for the year 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Such a credit may only be passed on to a beneficiary in this way if he or she receives a share of the nett income of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In their 1995 returns, Mr and Mrs Weyers each declared receipt of $28,000 from this source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Both deny that they are, or have ever been, beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">They claim to have received loans from it during the year in question, but not to have shared in any income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The Commissioner relies on the distribution of PPS benefits as demonstrating that they are, or were, beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">37 In August 2004, Mr and Mrs Weyers made statutory declarations asserting that they were not, and had never been beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">They also executed releases in respect of any benefits derived in that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Whilst Mr and Mrs Weyers may give evidence as to whether they were beneficiaries at any particular time, they cannot change the position retrospectively in so far as concerns accrued tax liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">38 As to the 1996 return, Mr Weyers said that the profit derived from a joint venture with Finmack concerned development of a block of units at Wynnum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Sale of the units progressed slowly, and so Nommack Nominees purchased two of the units for rental and sale at a later date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">39 In 1997 Nommack Nominees sold two units in the Royal Albert apartment complex in the Brisbane central business district, deriving a profit from such sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">40 In 1999 an amended return was lodged, but nothing relevant arises from that fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">41 In 2000 Nommack Nominees entered into a joint venture with a company called Forrester Kurts which was the successor to Forrester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">42 In 2001 the Sydney trust made a loss, largely as the result of income from sales being received in the 2002 year rather than in the 2001 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The market was a little depressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Mr Weyers may have chosen to retain stock rather than to sell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">
 TAX RETURNS, PART IVA DETERMINATIONS AND RE-ASSESSMENTS 
 Mr Weyers 
 
 43 Below, I set out relevant detail from Mr Weyers' tax returns for 1994 and 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">
 Year ended 30 June 1994 
 
 44 Mr Weyers returned the following income: 
 from Cherrybrook (presumably salary) $ 36,000 partnerships and trusts $ 67,044 nett capital gain $ 26,100 Total taxable income $129,144 

 Year ended 30 June 1995 
 
 45 Mr Weyers returned the following income: 
 from Cherrybrook (presumably salary) $54,000 partnerships and trusts Nil Total taxable income $54,000 

 
 46 The sum of $28,000 was claimed by way of "PPS credit" against tax payable, apparently as a distribution from the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">At a later stage it was decided that such claim had been incorrectly made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">I have previously discussed this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">47 In each of the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2002, Mr Weyers returned gross income of $60,000, derived from Nommack Nominees, presumably as salary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">48 At some time prior to 11 December 2003, the Commissioner concluded that the accumulated losses in the Sydney trust were not available for application in reduction of trust income in the years 1995 to 2000 and 2002, and that there had been an avoidance of tax payable by Mr Weyers due to fraud or evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">On 11 December 2003, the Commissioner made determinations pursuant to Part IVA of the ITA Act with respect to Mr Weyers' assessable income for each of those years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">49 In each case the Determination under Part IVA was in the following form, with the appropriate additional information inserted:
 'I, ......, in the exercise of the powers and functions delegated to me by the Commissioner of Taxation, determine under paragraph 177F(1)(b) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Act) that: 
 
 
 
 The amount of $... being referable to a tax benefit obtained by Nommack Nominees Pty Limited as trustee of Elizabeth Street Sydney Trust (the Trust) in connection with a scheme to which the provisions of Part IVA of the Act applies, namely a deduction or part of a deduction being allowable to the Trust in relation to the year of income, be not allowable to the Trust in calculating the nett income (as defined in s 95 of the Act) of the Trust for the year of income ended 30 June ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">
 
 
 
 I further determine under paragraph 177F(1)(a) of the Act that: 
 
 
 
 The whole of the amount of $... being referable to a tax benefit obtained by Robert Weyers in connection with a scheme and being the net income of the Trust for the year ended 30 June ..., be included in the assessable income of Robert Weyers, TFN 135 610 687, for the year of income ended 30 June ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">
 
 
 
 I further determine under subsection 177F(2) of the Act that an amount of $... being the whole of the net income of the trust for the year ended 30 June ... be included in the assessable income of Robert Weyers for the year ended 30 June ... under subsection 97(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">' 
 
 50 On 23 December 2003, the Commissioner issued the following amended assessments of taxable income:

 51 On 20 February 2004, Mr Weyers lodged objections to those amended assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">On 7 June 2004, the Commissioner disallowed the objections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Mr Weyers now appeals from those decisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">

 53 Mrs Weyers objected, but her objections were dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Mrs Weyers appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">
 Nommack Nominees on its own account and as trustee of the Sydney trust 
 
 54 As I understand the position, Nommack Nominees, in its own right and as trustee, returned no income for each relevant year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">On or about 10 November 2004, the Commissioner issued notices of assessment against Nommack Nominees in its own right, fixing its taxable income for relevant years as follows: 
 1995 $341,477 1996 $597,908 1997 $209,377 1998 $168,598 1999 $140,123 2000 $444,237 2002 $759,335 

 
 55 Nommack Nominees objected to these assessments, but the objections were overruled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">It appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The Commissioner also issued amended assessments for Nommack Nominees as trustee of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Those matters are the subject of proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">
 FACTUAL DISPUTES 
 
 56 The Commissioner claims to know nothing about the prior trading history of the Sydney trust or Nommack (No 75), nor of the circumstances in which Mr Collie, and then the Weyers, obtained control of that trust, nor of its dealings thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">He submits that it is for each taxpayer to prove that the amended assessments are excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">57 I am, on balance, inclined to accept Mr Arnold's evidence and that of Mr Robinson and Mr Creais as to the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the Sydney trust and as to the loss of the deposit paid pursuant to the contract to purchase the Elizabeth Street, property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Mr Robinson was not cross-examined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Mr Creais was generally a more impressive witness than was Mr Arnold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">He seemed to have no particular interest in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Mr Arnold, on the other hand, had some interest in the transfer of the Sydney trust to Mr Collie, although the exact nature of that interest was unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">Where the evidence of Mr Arnold conflicts with that of either of the solicitors, I prefer the latter evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">58 I see no reason to doubt that in June 1999, Hall Chadwick NSW exercised its power as appointor to appoint VA Clothing to be trustee of the Sydney trust or that Nommack (No 75) was struck off in July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">I accept that Hall Chadwick NSW subsequently appointed Haven Sea to be trustee and Annesley to be appointor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Annesley, in turn, appointed Nommack Nominees to be trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">59 In the course of the trial counsel for the Commissioner demonstrated concern at the changed dates on some of the documentation transferring control of the trust to Mr Collie and then to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">In the end I am unable to see that anything turns upon that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Mr and Mrs Weyers, Mr Steele, Mr Priddle and Mr Collie all agreed that there was a meeting at the Weyers' home in late December 1994 at which documents incidental to the "transfer" of the Sydney trust to the Weyers were executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I find that the meeting occurred prior to Christmas Eve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Although there may be some doubt about the order in which documents effecting the two "transfers" were executed, the parties' intentions are clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">All have conducted themselves upon the basis that those transactions were effective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">I see no reason to doubt that they were effective, assuming that the Sydney trust remained in existence at all material times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">60 My general acceptance of the factual matrix outlined above should not be taken as indicating my acceptance of any evidence as to the existence in the Sydney trust of accumulated losses, the intentions with which transactions were entered into or the characterization of particular transactions, either in the evidence of the witnesses or in the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">To the extent necessary, I will deal with other aspects of the evidence in my subsequent reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">
 THE LOSS 
 
 61 Whilst I accept that Nommack (No 75) as trustee of the Sydney trust contracted to purchase the Elizabeth Street property and lost its deposit, the question is whether or not those circumstances led to its incurring a loss for the purposes of the ITA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">As I understand it that depends upon its being a loss or outgoing of the kind previously contemplated by s 51 of the ITA Act and now by s 8-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">As Dixon J observed in New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 60 ; (1938) 61 CLR 179 at 207:
 'To come within that provision there must be a loss or outgoing actually incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">"Incurred" does not mean only defrayed, discharged, or borne, but rather it includes encountered, run into, or fallen upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">It is unsafe to attempt exhaustive definitions of a concept intended to have such a various or multifarious application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">But it does not include a loss or expenditure which is no more than impending, threatened, or expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">' 
 
 62 See also Federal Commissioner of Taxation v James Flood Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 65 ; (1953) 88 CLR 492 at 506-507.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">63 If the creditors were entitled to call for repayment by Nommack (No 75) of their advances, it was entitled to indemnity out of the trust assets in the same amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The first question, then, is whether the creditors were so entitled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">It is convenient to focus on the position of Media Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">According to Mr Arnold, the arrangement between Nommack (No 75) and Media Portfolio was that on resale, the borrowed funds would be repaid with interest and any profit divided equally between two companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">However Mr Arnold did not see any relevant documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Indeed, it seems that there was no documentation until after it became apparent that the project would fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">See par 8 of Mr Robinson's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Mr Arnold seems to have understood that the loan was from a company in the Rothwells group, from which group Messrs Theeman and Adler had previously borrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">Mr Creais understood that Media Portfolio was not part of the Rothwells group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">64 Mr Arnold's knowledge of the transactions seemed, at some points, to be based on the assumption that it was funded in the same way as had been previous transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Clearly, however, it differed from earlier transactions in that it was a second transaction using Nommack (No 75) and the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">According to Mr Arnold, Messrs Theeman and Adler had previously used each trustee company and trust for only one transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">If Media Portfolio was not part of the Rothwells group, that was also a departure from the previous practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">At other points, Mr Arnold's knowledge seemed to be derived primarily from statements made to him by Mr Theeman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">The evidence was received under s 63 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">I am unpersuaded as to its reliability or that Mr Arnold had any specific knowledge of the terms upon which Media Portfolio advanced the relevant funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">65 Although I accept that Media Portfolio advanced the deposit, I find it more difficult to conclude that the advance was to be repayable by Nommack (No 75) in the event that the project failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">If Media Portfolio was to recover the loan, interest and half of any profits on resale, it is quite possible that it was to bear some or all of the risk of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Prior to the circumstances which caused the project to fail, the risk may have seemed quite small.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Given that Nommack (No 75) had virtually no assets and there were no guarantees, Media Portfolio can hardly have expected such repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">66 Mr Robinson said that after the advance was made, and after the stock market crash which was responsible for the project's failure, Mr Theeman agreed to execute loan documents evidencing the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Mr Robinson also said that shortly after the documents were signed, the debt was assigned by Media Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Perhaps there was some potential tax advantage to Media Portfolio or any assignee in appearing to be entitled to repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">It seems that at a later stage, the liquidator of Media Portfolio enquired after the stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">As I have said, this might suggest that Media Portfolio paid the stamp duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Nobody seems ever to have sought to recover the debt or interest on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">67 In all of the circumstances, I am inclined to the view that at the time of the transaction, nobody expected that Nommack (No 75) would repay the amount of the advance or interest in the event that the project failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">That no attempt has ever been made to secure repayment confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Of course, absence of a reasonable expectation of payment does not mean that there was no legal liability to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The fact that Media Portfolio advanced funds to meet amounts payable by Nommack (No 75) pursuant to the contract would normally be sufficient to justify an implied undertaking to repay, but the circumstances of this case are more complex, particularly as Nommack (No 75) and Media Portfolio were joint venturers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">
 TREATMENT OF THE "DEBT" IN THE ACCOUNTS OF NOMMACK (NO 75) 
 
 68 There is considerable confusion in Mr Arnold's evidence concerning the preparation of accounts and tax returns for Nommack (No 75) for the years 1988 to 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">In his first affidavit he said at par 15:
 'Hereto annexed and marked "RTLA-4" are true copies of a bundle of documents comprising financial statements and tax returns for the financial years 1985/1986 to 1990 (inclusive) which were prepared by me and which were part of the documents which were retained by me as part of the business records of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">' 
 
 69 Exhibit RTLA4 appears to contain tax returns for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">The contract for the Elizabeth Street property was entered into in August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The 1988 return discloses a nett loss of $6,518, showing the Elizabeth Street property as an asset valued at $1,835,139.47 (presumably representing the amount of the deposit and some outgoings) and liabilities, including commercial bills, totalling somewhat more than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">At a later stage the Commissioner adjusted that return to include profit on sale of the property at 261 and 263 Elizabeth Street in the amount of $554,226 which profits had been distributed to Ratic Investments Pty Ltd as trustee of the Theeman Family Trust and Stavex Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">The 1989 return shows a nett loss of $277 and carried forward losses of $6,795.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">No other information for that year is provided in exhibit RTLA4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The 1990 return, which is also included in exhibit RTLA4, shows total assets of $1,710 represented by the $1,700 advance to Nommack (No 41) previously mentioned and the erroneous settlement amount of $10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Liabilities are shown to be $2,656,991.56, apparently the amount of the trust debts, plus interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">70 In par 35 of his affidavit Mr Arnold said that 'On or about 24 December 1994 I signed and caused to be lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation income tax returns for Nommack No.75 as trustee of the (Sydney trust) for the years ended 30 June 1990 to 30 June 1994 (inclusive) ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">This suggests that such documents were prepared later than those contained in ex RTLA4, probably at the time of the transfer of the Sydney trust to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">The difficulty with that scenario is that the (perhaps critical) 1990 return is in both categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">71 In par 24 of Mr Arnold's first affidavit he said, concerning the claimed "loss" and interest thereon:
 'The loss sustained by the Trust on forfeiture of the deposit under its contractual arrangements with Tipora Pty Ltd ("Tipora") was a substantial loss and included interest which was also payable on that loan which Nommack No.75 received from Media Portfolios.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">I calculated the interest expense due to Media Portfolio prior to submitting the 1990 income tax return of Nommack No.75 at $864,513.70.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">' 
 
 72 In view of the express statement in par 35 that the 1990 return was lodged on 24 December 1994, it seems probable that the 1990 return was prepared shortly before its submission in December 1994, and that its inclusion in exhibit RTLA4 was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">The matter is further complicated by Mr Arnold's second affidavit in which he said at par 1.7:
 'I have been shown a copy of documents 100, 116 and 122 within the Agreed Bundle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">All of these documents were prepared by me; subsequently presented to Mr Theeman for his approval and were subsequently approved by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">In the course of the preparation of the financial documents for each entity, I would be provided with source documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The source documents would come to me and after looking through them I would delegate tasks regarding those documents to various staff members of mine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">I have not retained any of those documents myself however some of the documents were kept within the files which were provided to the new trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">' 
 
 73 I do not understand this statement to detract from Mr Arnold's other evidence to the effect that he had not seen documents evidencing the Elizabeth Street transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">The documents in the agreed bundle to which Mr Arnold referred were a report for the Sydney trust for the year ended 30 June 1987 (document 100), the trial balance for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 (document 116), and a transfer of shares in Nommack (No 75) by Commercial Administrations (Kogarah) Pty Ltd (now Hall Chadwick NSW) to Nommack (No 41) Pty Ltd (document 122).</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The trial balance to 30 June 1989 showed a credit item of $1,783,971.46, representing the Elizabeth Street property, and a debit item of $1,650,000 said to represent 'commercial bills' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">It shows inventories as $1,783,971.46 and liabilities as $1,792,483, yielding a nett excess of liabilities over assets of $6,784.88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">In the agreed bundle of documents the trial balance follows a copy of the tax return for the year 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">This appears to be a copy of the same document as is found in exhibit RTLA4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">The trial balance precedes documents which appear to be accounts for 1988-1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">The trial balance bears figures in the top left-hand corner which suggest that it was prepared in November 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">In any event it is unlikely that the trial balance for 1988-1989 was shown to Mr Theeman and approved by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">He died in January 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">I reject Mr Arnold's evidence concerning the date of preparation of the trial balance and his claim that he showed it to Mr Theeman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">
 WAS A RELEVANT LOSS OR OUTGOING INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ELIZABETH STREET PROPERTY?</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">
 
 74 I accept that when Media Portfolio advanced the amount of the deposit, it expected to recoup it from the proceeds of sale of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">This is demonstrated by the inclusion in the 1987-1988 accounts of the Elizabeth Street property as an asset and the amount of the bills as a liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The question is whether Nommack (No 75) was liable to repay the advance (with interest) if the project failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The absence of any assets suggests that there was no expectation that it would be able to discharge such liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Media Portfolio apparently made no demand for repayment before it went into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">There was a suggestion that the debt had been assigned by Media Portfolio, but no assignee has ever made demand for repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The liquidator of Media Portfolio enquired about the stamp duty, but not about the debt or interest thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The only reasonable inference is that it was never contemplated that, in the events which occurred, the advance would be repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">I infer from the fact that the liquidator demonstrated no interest in the debt that it did not appear in the books of Media Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">This conclusion is re-inforced by the fact that tax returns for the years 1990 to 1994 were not prepared until Mr Collie showed interest in the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">If there were real losses of this magnitude, one would expect that steps would have been taken to maintain records of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">As these proceedings demonstrate, there was at least the possibility that they were of value to some people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Of course Mr Theeman died in January 1989 but nonetheless, he seems to have been a person of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">One might have expected that his personal representative would have been anxious to maximize such benefits as were available from those losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">75 I do not say that I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that Nommack (No 75) was not liable to repay the Media Portfolio debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">However I am not persuaded that it was so liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">As to the other debts, my understanding is that they were allegedly incurred by the creditors on behalf of Nommack (No 75) for the purposes of the Elizabeth Street project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">In the absence of any suggestion by the parties that they should be treated differently, they should be treated in the same way as the Media Portfolio debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">I am not satisfied that they were to be repaid by Nommack (No 75) in the event that the Elizabeth Street project failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">76 It seems that in the accounts of Nommack (No 75) the contract for purchase of the Elizabeth Street property was treated as being on foot as at 30 June 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">There seems to have been little justification for so treating it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">The caveat was lodged, in August 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">It is likely that the contract had been determined by that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">77 There is one other aspect of Mr Arnold's evidence to which I should refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">He said at par 26 that he was aware of outgoings totalling $133,971, 'related to project costs including consultants such as engineers, architects and town planners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">' He claimed to have seen journal entries, bank statements and/or primary documents such as cheques, requisitions and invoices justifying that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">It may be that these items were included in the smaller debts to which I have previously referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">If so, then my treatment of those debts as outlined above is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">If not, I am unwilling to accept this evidence in the absence of more detailed explanation of the amounts in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">
 ASSUMING THAT THE TRUST DEBTS WERE INCURRED 
 
 78 Despite my findings concerning the non-incurrence of the trust debts, it is appropriate that I consider the outcome in the event that such finding is incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The Commissioner asserts that if there was a loss, then at some time prior to December 1994, it ceased to be available because it became apparent that the loans would never be called in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">It is now more than eight years since the advances and more than seven years since the Elizabeth Street project failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Nommack (No 75) and Ratic Investments have been de-registered, and Media Portfolio has been wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">There would be serious procedural difficulties in seeking to recover such debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Mr Weyers was assured by Mr Priddle that the trust assets were not liable for any debts incurred prior to December 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">I find it difficult to believe that he would have acquired the trust on any other basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">On balance it is safe to infer that by the time Mr Weyers acquired the trust in December 1994, there was no reasonable possibility that Media Portfolio or anybody else would seek to enforce any debt owed by Nommack (No 75).</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">There was also no reasonable likelihood that Nommack (No 75) would seek indemnity out of the assets of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">It is also probable that the situation in June 1994, when VA Clothing became trustee, was the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">
 TREATMENT OF FORGIVEN OR ABANDONED DEBTS 
 
 79 Assuming, contrary to my finding, that there was a loss in the 1988 or 1989 tax years, and accepting that by some time prior to December 1994, it was improbable that the trust debts, upon which the loss was based, would ever be called up, it is necessary to determine the tax consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The Commissioner submits that I should apply by analogy the decision of Hill J in Warner Music Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 197.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">In that case the taxpayer was, in November 1985, served with two sales tax assessments for the periods from 1 January 1982 to 31 May 1985 and from 1 February 1982 until 31 May 1982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The assessments were in the amounts of $599,087.72 and $564,544.69, together with additional tax in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">The taxpayer objected to the assessments and sought an extension of time in which to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The extension was disallowed, and the decision to disallow challenged pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the "ADJR Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The Commissioner sought to recover the debt in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">The proceedings under the ADJR Act were resolved by consent orders in 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The dispute between the parties was ultimately settled in 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">The Commissioner agreed to accept $650,000 in full satisfaction of the taxpayer's liability under the two assessments, waiving all rights to recover the amounts initially assessed, without admitting the correctness of the taxpayer's arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The taxpayer then claimed the total amounts assessed, excluding the additional tax, as income tax deductions for the year ended 30 November 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">The Commissioner allowed the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">The unpaid liability for sales tax had not previously appeared in the taxpayer's accounts, but it had been noted in the directors' report, with an indication that there had been an objection, and that in the opinion of the directors no amount was payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">In subsequent years similar notes appeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The Commissioner sought to include that part of each assessment which he had foregone as income received by the taxpayer in the 1991 tax year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">80 In June 1987 two further sales tax assessments were issued for the periods 1 June 1984 to 30 June 1985.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">One was for $4,197,209.20 with additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">The other was for the amount of $87,210 with additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">The amounts assessed were not paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">An extension of time was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The Commissioner refused the application, and an application was made pursuant to the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">The taxpayer lodged objections against both assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The objections were overruled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The taxpayer appealed, in respect of the larger assessment to this Court, and in respect of the smaller, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">The proceedings concerning the refusal of the extension of time were settled upon the taxpayer agreeing to pay $1 million to the Commissioner who agreed not to commence recovery proceedings with respect to the balance until the proceedings had been determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The proceedings in this Court were determined in favour of the taxpayer, as were the proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">The Commissioner refunded the amount of $1 million to the taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The taxpayer claimed income tax deductions for the 1987 year in the amounts of the two assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The claims were allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The taxpayer returned the amount of the refund as assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">The Commissioner assessed that amount to income tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">81 Expert accounting evidence was led concerning the proper accounting treatment of the disputed sales tax assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">In order to understand the reasons given by Hill J, it is necessary to know something about that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">82 One accounting witness said that once a sales tax assessment had been issued and become payable, liability should be recognized in the balance sheet of the taxpayer, whether or not the assessment is challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">The witness then considered whether the assessment should be an "expense" item in the profit and loss account, and whether there should be a corresponding "receivable" item in the balance sheet, representing the contingent right to have the assessment expunged in the event of a successful objection and appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Hill J said at 202:
 It is, no doubt, obvious that the question whether a receivable should have been recognised in the balance sheet involved a question of judgment, depending upon factors such as the likelihood of success in contesting the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Also relevant, no doubt, would be matters such as materiality and prudence in the preparation of the accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">If (the taxpayer) had had a high expectation of success for its objection, in (the accountant's) view this would have justified recognition of a receivable in an amount equal to the liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">In such a case it would, no doubt, be wrong to recognize the liability as an expense in the profit and loss account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">' 
 
 83 The same accountant said that in the event of forgiveness or waiver of the liability, the initial entry recording the liability should be reversed and any corresponding asset written back.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">84 Another accounting witness said that in a relevant United States standard, the definition of liability had, as the key issue, 'whether management believed that payment of the amount of the liability was probable, either at the time of the original assessment or subsequent thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">' Of this proposition, Hill J said at 203:
 'It is clear from his evidence that there could, at least, be occasions, in his view, where there could be an offsetting asset which, if the view was taken that the whole of the assessment was capable of being overturned on appeal, could be equal in amount to the amount of the liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">In other words, if a taxpayer owed the Commissioner a sum of money and the taxpayer believed that it would be wholly successful on appeal so that there was a receivable in an amount equal to the amount of the assessment, the two amounts could be netted off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">...' 
 
 85 The Commissioner advanced the proposition that:
 '... the Court should recognise a general principle of taxation law that the assessable income of any taxpayer should include the gain or benefit derived by that taxpayer by the reduction or extinction of a liability in respect of which a deduction had been allowed under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ... in a previous year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">' 
 
 86 Hill J considered that such a proposition was inconsistent with the earlier decision of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99, a decision which was subsequently upheld on appeal by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe [1997] HCA 16 ; (1996-1997) 187 CLR 266.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">In those circumstances Hill J said (at 205):
 'The real issue between the parties is whether the release of (the taxpayer) from its liability to pay sales tax constituted income in ordinary concepts by virtue of that release constituting a gain or profit forming part of its business income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">There are two steps in the resolution of this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The first involves the question whether the amount released involved a gain to (the taxpayer) so as to constitute a profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The second is whether this profit or gain was on revenue account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">' 
 
 87 At 210, his Honour observed:
 'The cumulative effect of these provisions is that service of a notice of assessment of sales tax gives rise to a statutory liability which may be recovered by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">... That liability operated to reduce the actual assets of (the taxpayer) from the moment of time that the notice of assessment issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">While there may be difficulty in a lawyer comprehending the concept of a notice of appeal against an income tax assessment as being property ... no doubt it is possible to talk, in commercial terms, of a company having an offsetting right through the objection and appeal procedure whereby a company might hope to bring about a situation that the liability to pay sales tax is extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">But whether that is correct or not, (the taxpayer) had a continuing liability to the Commissioner of Taxation until the 1991 income tax year when, as a result of compromise or court decision as the case may be, it was freed from that liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">In a legal sense, at that point of time (the taxpayer) made a gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The fact of that gain is not in any way to be diminished by reference to possible accounting treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">It cannot be the law that the fact that one taxpayer forms a view that its chances of success on an objection are high and another taxpayer forms the view that its chances of success on a sales tax objection are low, that the consequences of being released from the sales tax liability would differ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">In my view, it is unarguable that (the taxpayer) made a gain when the sales tax liabilities to which it remained subject until the 1991 income tax year, were released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">
 
 Once it is accepted that there was a gain, then the question is whether that gain should be characterised as income in ordinary concepts in the year in which the gain was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">' 
 
 88 Although there was no substantial body of expert accounting evidence in this case, both Mr Steele and Mr Arnold gave some evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Mr Steele's evidence is of principal significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Of his methods in preparing financial statements for Nommack Nominees, he said at par 25:
 'Financial Statements were prepared ... as specific purpose compilation reports for the sole use of the trustees and to satisfy the requirements of the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">No audit was conducted and there was no requirement to prepare more complex and onerous general purpose financial statements.</sentence>

 89 In pars 37-38 concerning the debt of $1,700 owed by Nommack (No 41) he said: 
 
 
 '37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">In presenting the accounts for the year ended 30 June 1995 a decision was made that this debt might not be collectible and it was therefore written off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">It was determined that the collection of the debt was most likely uncommercial and even though I believe it was never formally released, it was at the time prudent accounting practice for the debt to be written off to show a true and fair view of the financial asset position of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">

<sentence id="s502">It is usual accounting practice to apply the "doctrine of conservatism" in the preparation of financial accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">That is, I will generally take a less than optimistic view of the value of assets, particularly if estimated realisation amounts will be less than cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">' 
 
 
 
 90 Of the treatment of the loss associated with the Elizabeth Street project, he said at pars 95-97: 
 
 
 '95.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">In my opinion the accounting methodology which has been adopted is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">Based on my understanding of the facts that Messrs Theeman and Adler (as Nommack No 75) were acquiring sites with a view to obtaining the development approvals (and no more) --- it would have been appropriate and indeed correct for the land to be treated as trading stock as opposed to investments and any profit or loss to be ordinary trading income as opposed to a capital gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">
 
 
 
 
 
 96.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">In my opinion if a taxpayer is buying with the intention of making profit by reselling rather than intending to hold the asset, the former mentioned is trading and ought properly to be brought to account as ordinary trading income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
 97.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">Due to the nature of the losses as well as the change in legislation under the Income Tax Assessment Act , and out of an abundance of caution, I sought advice each year concerning the deductibility of the income against the losses which were accumulated within (the Sydney trust) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">I initially received verbal advices in this regard from Mr Les Priddle and thereafter I received written advice from Cleary Hoare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">' 
 
 
 
 91 A number of letters of advice are attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">They canvassed aspects of taxation law as it applies to trusts but offered little practical advice specific to the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">At par 98 Mr Steele said:
 'The seeking of these advices was viewed by myself as prudent, especially after the implementation of the trust loss provisions (by way of amendment to the ITAA) in 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Based on the advices which I received from Cleary Hoare, I advised Mr and Mrs Weyers that in each year in question they were entitled to the deduction of any income in the (Sydney trust) from prior years and from the net amount of prior year losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">I also recall that I sought specific reassurance from Cleary Hoare in relation to the transitional provisions in regard to the controller of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">I was therefore of the view that the legislation applied as at the date on which it was implemented and had no retrospective operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">
 
 92 In par 99 he referred to other advice but its content is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">93 In cross-examination Mr Steele said that he would not apply the doctrine of conservatism so as to write off debts owed by a company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">He said that 'Assets tend to be written down, liabilities tend to be written up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">' Mr Steele also said that if a debt was forgiven, the forgiveness might be treated as the debtor's income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Such treatment was not dependent upon the borrowing having been shown as "current".</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">He said that if a creditor ceased to exist, he would nonetheless leave the debt in the debtor's books if it remained legally payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">He also said that he would take legal advice as to the appropriate treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">He also would apply the doctrine of conservatism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">94 Mr Steele was asked about steps taken to identify the circumstances in which the trust debts arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">He said that his role was not to audit the books, implying that he had more or less accepted the records provided to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">He had been advised that if he wrote off the liabilities in this case, 'there will be consequences' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">He understood that to be a reference to tax consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">In effect he considered that if there was any chance that the liabilities could be called in, prudence dictated that they be kept on the books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">This seems to suggest that if there is no chance of their being collected, they may be written off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">At a meeting held on 26 April 1996 the matter was specifically discussed with Mr Priddle and Mr Collie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">It was decided that the trust debts should stay in the accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">He would not write off a debt owed to a company which had been deregistered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">95 Mr Steele said, concerning his understanding of the Weyers' position in connection with the trust losses and liabilities:
 'Well, my understanding of it was that the client effectively --- this is going to sound a little bit unusual but sort of owned the --- he effectively had both sides of the equation here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">He had a right of indemnity anyway, in respect of these liabilities, so he had acquired that, I think from the previous trustee, and in a sense you might say that --- you might say in a sense that he had both sides of the ledger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">' 
 
 96 Mr Steele was asked if some provision ought to have been made for paying the trust debts and replied:
 'Well, I think --- my understanding is if the liabilities were in fact called and Mr Weyers had a right of indemnity against the trust assets which would have been his loan accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">' 
 
 97 Mr Steele may have been referring to the continued presence in the trust accounts of the trust debts and the certainty that they would not be called up because of the fact that Cherrybrook had purportedly received an assignment of the right to indemnity previously held by Nommack (No 75), the actual debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">98 Mr Steele did not consider the operation of any limitation statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">99 He was asked questions about advice which he had received in preparing tax returns for the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">He may have consulted another accountant about some aspects, but his advice came primarily from Mr Priddle and Cleary Hoare, of which firm Mr Collie was a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">I will consider that advice in more detail in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">It was, perhaps, unfortunate that Mr Steele should have continued to seek advice from Cleary Hoare in view of Mr Collie's involvement in the acquisition of the Sydney trust by the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">100 Mr Steele and the Weyers did not discuss the way in which the trust debts might have been paid if called up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Mr Steele said that 'generally you don't have to ring creditors and ask them if they want payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">They normally demand it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">' He said that had the debts been demanded he thought that the Weyers would have paid them because 'The Weyers had always paid their debts, to my knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">' This seems to be inconsistent with his earlier evidence concerning the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">He was asked about assets from which Nommack Nominees might have paid the debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">His answer was:
 'What assets might --- I don't think Nommack had any right to any assets because it hadn't incurred the liabilities, had it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">' 
 
 101 He was then asked, and answered:
 'What trust property of which you were aware might Nommack have looked to, as trustee in the first instance, to meet any call if one were ever made by a liquidator of Rothwells or Media Portfolio?</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">--- Well, my understanding would be that it hadn't incurred the liabilities, why would it have any access to the assets?</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">
 
 How can you say it hadn't incurred the liabilities when you had been putting them in the accounts for years?</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">--- Yes, because those liabilities belong to a prior trustee, didn't they?</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">They were incurred by prior trustees, isn't that exactly what the advice says?</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">
 
 How can you say, having told us solemnly for the last hour and a half or two hours that you recorded this debt because you were told that it was still owed, how can you say they hadn't incurred liability for it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">--- Well, Nommack had.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">The previous trustee had incurred the --- it was still a debt of the trust, but it had been incurred by the prior trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">' 
 
 102 He agreed that Mr and Mrs Weyers had, after the meeting in December 1994, advanced moneys to themselves from the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">He thought that somebody must have advised them in connection with that matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">103 Concerning the origins of the trust debts, he said:
 'I knew very little about these, you know, these particular, the depth of the transactions behind the scenes because they were in prior records prepared by previous accountants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">But my understanding of it is that these liabilities, in effect that Mr Weyers had acquired the right of indemnity and therefore if these liabilities --- in effect he owed these liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">It's a terrible --- its not necessarily maybe a legal method of looking at it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">It's the way I looked at it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">' 
 
 104 Further cross-examination indicated that Mr Steele had no knowledge of the source of any indemnity to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">He later suggested that Nommack (No 75) had given the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">105 It is appropriate to say something about the various legal advices received by Mr Steele in connection with this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">I have previously referred to exhibits 3 and 8 which are copies of a letter dated 21 December 1994 from Mr Priddle to Mr Weyers in which he advised that 'The transaction reflected in the Facilitation Agreement and the Deed of the Removal of Appointment of Trustee makes it clear at law that the new Trustee (and therefore the Trust) cannot in any way be liable for any debts of the Trust incurred before today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">' At a meeting on 26 April 1996 Mr Steele raised with Mr Priddle and Mr Collie the proper accounting treatment of the trust liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">He received some information concerning those liabilities and was told that they should be kept on the books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">He said that he enquired as to whether the liabilities were 'to be continued from here' and was advised that they should be, and that they were existing liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">He was told that they were still legally payable and that:
 '(A)ny merging or write-off, or whatever, of these loans could give rise to adverse tax consequences, and that whilst they also remained on the books, there would be essentially no adverse tax consequences, and there was a technical argument, obviously between Mr Collie and Mr Priddle about a number of these things, which is beyond my understanding as a simple accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">However it was quite clear, as a result of that meeting, that these were in fact liabilities of the trust, as perceived by my client, and they were to be in fact --- were to remain on the books, and I took that advice, and it's as simple as that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">' 
 
 106 He did not enquire as to whether the creditors still existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">107 On 20 June 2001 Cleary Hoare advised in relation to liabilities to Ratic Investments Pty Ltd, Nommack (No 100) Pty Ltd and arising out of "Commercial Bills" as follows:
 'We advise that under the documentation in which the above Trust was acquired, the rights of creditors under the liabilities were not acquired by Robert Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">What was acquired was the right to be indemnified out of the assets of the Trust in respect of those liabilities, which was acquired by Robert Weyers from the former Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">
 
 The rights of creditors is a right to payment of the liability by the entity which incurred the liabilities, namely the former Trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Since the former Trustee has no assets to meet those liabilities and is not entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Trust, the assets of the Trust are not available for meeting the claims in respect of those liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">
 
 However, the amounts owing in respect of those liabilities remain owing to the original creditors (they have not been assigned to Robert Weyers) and so the disclosure of those liabilities would remain as stated in the balance sheet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">' 
 
 108 Both Mr Priddle and Cleary Hoare accepted that the debts remained owing by Nommack (No 75).</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Both, however, considered that Nommack (No 75) no longer had a right of indemnity as against trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">This appears to have been as a result of the purported successive transfers of the right of indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The object of the exercise seems to have been to permit retention of the trust debts as liabilities in the accounts whilst protecting the trust assets from any call for indemnity in respect of such debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">I need hardly say that it is unlikely that Nommack Nominees could properly claim to be liable for the trust debts if there were no possible way in which they could be enforced against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">Accepting at face value the view that Nommack (No 75) released any claim to indemnity from the trust assets, it follows that Nommack Nominees and the trust itself (if one may use that term loosely) had no loss to apply against income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">In that case there could be no question of the Sydney trust being liable for the debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">They clearly could not be called up as against any entity other than Nommack (No 75), and that company would have no recourse to trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">109 Mr Steele's approach to accounting methods was, in my view, influenced by his desire to ensure that the Weyers derived the benefit for which they had bargained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">He was content to rely upon advice given by Mr Collie and Mr Priddle, notwithstanding their involvement in the Weyers' acquisition of the Sydney trust and their interest in ensuring that the Weyers obtained such benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Mr Steele conceded that there were accounting aspects which concerned him, and he claimed to have consulted another accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">Yet there is no evidence of any request for detailed and independent legal or accounting advice or of the receipt of such advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">Mr Steele was unable to give any rational explanation as to how the Sydney trust, through Nommack Nominees, could have been liable, for accounting purposes, for debts incurred by the Nommack (No 75) whilst, at the same time, not liable to indemnify that company for such debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">110 Mr Arnold said that in terms of accounting practice, a debt owed by a company which had been deregistered, might be removed from the creditor's accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">As to the treatment of moneys owed to a company which was in liquidation, he said that he would check the question of liability and make inquiries as to what the liquidator intended to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">If the company to which money was owed had been deregistered, and if there was no notice of assignment of the debt or that the company had been acting as trustee, an accountant would be inclined to delete the liability from the accounts of the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">Mr Arnold agreed that at the time at which he made his statutory declaration (exhibit 9 --- 16 December 1994), he did not expect that the debts owed to Media Portfolio, Ratic Investments and Nommack (No 100) would ever be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">He said that notwithstanding this, he retained them in the accounts because '... there was no formal release.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">They were just carried forward as historical balances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">There was no formal release of those debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">' If, as Mr Arnold conceded, it may be appropriate to write off an unclaimed debt in the books of a debtor, then this was a clear case for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">111 The question is whether or not Nommack Nominees was entitled to set off income derived between December 1994 and 30 June 2002 against the accumulated losses incurred as a result of the trust debts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">The question is not as to the proper treatment of the debts for accounting purposes, although that may give some insight into the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">It is rather as to the continued existence of the debts in December 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The problem may be unusual, but that is because of the curiosity of the taxpayers' conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">There is no suggestion that Nommack (No 75) lost anything, save that it incurred the trust debts which have not been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">It is not remotely likely that they will ever be paid by that company, or that it will be indemnified for any such payment from trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">The taxpayers' case seems to be that even if Nommack (No 75) were to pay them, the trust assets would remain unaffected by such payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">The taxpayers argue that nonetheless, trust income may be set off against the losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Such an unlikely situation invites close examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">112 Whatever the position in 1988, by December 1994 the trust debts had ceased to exist as liabilities of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">That may have been because Nommack (No 75) had released its right to claim indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">Alternatively the passage of time, winding up or de-registration of relevant companies and possibly, the assignment of the debt by Media Portfolio, together with the absence of any demand, made it highly unlikely that such debts would ever be called in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">That was almost certainly the situation as at the time of acquisition of the Sydney trust by the Weyers and as at June 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">In those circumstances, to value them in the trust accounts at face value was to misrepresent the true position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The circumstances to which I have referred, and the Weyers' willingness to acquire the trust and inject money into it, suggest that from a commercial point of view, there was no possibility of the debts ever being called in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The accounts should have reflected that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">113 Either of two approaches might be appropriate for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">The first is that adopted by Hill J in Warner Music .</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">His Honour there treated forgiveness of a debt as a gain which, if of a revenue nature, should be treated as income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">If that approach were adopted in the present case, it would presumably be necessary for the Commissioner, if he still may, to re-assess the taxable income of the trust in one or more of the years prior to 1995 to reflect such gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">That gain would then go in reduction of the accumulated losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">The result would be that by December 1994, and probably by 30 June 1994, the accumulated losses would have ceased to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">114 The second approach, which I favour, would be to recognize that the trust debts and accumulated losses were over-valued in the accounts of the trust as at December 1994, and as at 30 June 1994 (after the right of indemnity had allegedly been released by Nommack (No 75).</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">By that time, at the latest, they were worth nothing and should have been taken out of the accounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">That was so whether one treated the release by Nommack (No 75) as being effective or relied upon the history of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">It was factually incorrect to assert that the trust had suffered any loss as a result of the Elizabeth Street project, notwithstanding the position as it may have appeared in 1988 or as Mr Arnold saw it in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">To adopt the language of the accountants in Warner Music , management's belief as to the probability of the company having to pay the relevant debts proved to be unduly pessimistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">Such an approach is, in my view, more attractive than is any attempt to apply the Warner Music approach to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">
 LIMITATION STATUTES 
 
 115 The Commissioner submitted that the trust debts may, in any event, have been, at relevant times, statute-barred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">The submission was not developed in detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">The debts may have been incurred in New South Wales where, as I understand it, there are both procedural and substantive bars after expiry of the limitation period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">It was suggested that the creditor was in Western Australia or Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">For procedural purposes, it may be that Queensland law should be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">This "choice of law" question was not addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">In any event, since 1990, the debts have been consistently acknowledged in the books of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">
 CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THE SYDNEY TRUST 
 
 116 The Commissioner also submitted that the Sydney trust had ceased to exist at some time prior to 1994, by virtue of there being no property subject to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">It is not sufficient for the Commissioner to assert this fact and leave it to the taxpayers to disprove the assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">Given the virtually indisputable facts which demonstrate that the trust was established and had property, one would readily infer that it continued to exist in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">It is likely that the settled fund of one dollar was lost, however a debt of $1,700 remained due by Nommack (No 41).</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">Whilst it may have been written off at some time since 1994, I cannot infer that it had been extinguished prior to that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">It may not have been worth much, but it may have had some value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Secondly, the trust's books of account are still in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">They are trust property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Thirdly, any beneficiaries may have some right of recourse against Nommack (No 75) as trustee, arising out of the Elizabeth Street project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">It is not every day that a trustee, acting properly, loses such a substantial amount so quickly and with such apparent ease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">I am not persuaded that the trust has ever been without assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">I am also not persuaded that any changes of trustee or of beneficiaries terminated the trust or effected a resettlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Such changes were contemplated by the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">
 PAYMENTS TO NOMMACK NOMINEES AND TO THE WEYERS 
 
 117 It is necessary to consider the amounts received by Nommack Nominees and Mr and Mrs Weyers, other than those payments made by way of salary, in order to determine whether they should be included in the assessable income of each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">I should first refer to the evidence of Mr and Mrs Weyers concerning those amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">At TS 92 Mr Weyers said 'I think we lived off that loan account ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">The following questions and answers ensued:
 'Now, did that strike you as in any way something of a dilemma at all for you, as a director of the trustee lending that money to you and your wife?</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">--- Initially, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">I again went back to my accountant and asked him if this was all right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">He said, "Yes, that is correct, because its your money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">" 
 
 And that's really how you treated it, as if it was your money?</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">
 
 In that context then, did you strike any term for the loan, anything about when it might be repaid by you or by you and your wife?</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">I asked that question at that same time, and it was a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">It was my money, payable back on demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">
 
 So more or less as far as you were concerned, just like looking in mirror?</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">
 
 Really?</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Well, on demand?</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">
 
 And no interest?</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">--- No, to my knowledge, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">
 
 No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">Not a subject that ever entered your mind, that there might be interest at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">
 
 Did you look at all of the trust deed in deciding to make any of those lines?</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">Again, its advice from my advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">
 
 Did you ever form a view at all, in your capacity as a director of the trustee company, Nommack Nominees, to this effect, "Gee, that loan account balance is getting a bit high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">I better get Robert Weyers to pay it back?</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">" --- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">
 
 Never turned your mind to that at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">--- Not at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">
 
 Just let it run on?</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">--- Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">
 
 Year after year?</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">
 
 You personally do some packaging work and project management of the kind you described yesterday, and Forrester Parker pay money across to Nommack Nominees?</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">--- That's correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">
 
 Effectively for the work that you described in terms of your expertise?</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">
 
 And then it goes into a bank account of Nommack Nominees?</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">
 
 And then either you or your wife --- or you and your wife jointly just draw the money down and treat it as if it is your own personally?</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">--- Effectively, yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">
 
 And do that on the basis that you will call it a loan?</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">--- Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">' 
 
 118 Mr Weyers said that when the tax losses were absorbed they stopped drawing on Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">He was then asked and answered:
 'Is there any time window at all within which you anticipate any of the loans being paid back?</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">
 
 You could well die with them being unpaid, as it were?</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">--- Correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">
 
 ... 
 
 They are really on the never-never as it were?</sentence>

 119 Mrs Weyers was questioned about various payments of family and household expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">She agreed that there had been payments in connection with interior decorating at the Weyers' home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">She was then asked and answered as follows:
 '... Now, did you have a look at the trust deed, or form a view at all, even if you didn't look at the trust deed, as to whether or not that was something that really the trustee should advance money for?</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">--- Well, I think there's several references in the trust deed that enables the trustees to makes loans under whatever terms that they see fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">
 
 Alright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Now, in terms of whatever terms, what were the terms, say, of a loan for the funding of interior decorating at the house that you owned at Hawthorne?</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">... --- It was to be repaid on call, on demand.</sentence>

 You could each, in the fullness of time, pass to your graves without ever such a demand being made, couldn't you?</sentence>

 Indeed, that's the intention, isn't it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">--- I don't know what the intention is, but it's never been discussed.</sentence>

 Any interest at all to be paid on the loan which was used to fund those interior decorating works?</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">--- No.</sentence>

 120 It seems probable that the purpose of distributing funds to Nommack Nominees as trustee was to utilize the benefit perceived to flow from the Sydney trust's accumulated losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Such benefit could only be derived if the funds were received by Nommack Nominees as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">However the funds were not thereafter treated as trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">Funds were "lent", interest-free, to Mr and Mrs Weyers, with no expectation that they would ever be repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">It is said that although Mr and Mrs Weyers were qualified to be beneficiaries of the Sydney trust (having made the appropriate donations on 23 June 1995, they were not beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">In those circumstances, it is difficult to see how the making of interest-free, non-repayable loans was a proper exercise of the trustee's powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">121 Clearly, all parties (Cherrybrook, Nommack Nominees in its own capacity and as trustee, and the Weyers) had two objectives:
 &#8226; to utilize the perceived accumulated losses in the trust; and
 &#8226; to make funds available to the Weyers for their exclusive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">122 Both aspects were critical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">It would be impossible, even in the short term, to derive funds from Forrester and not disclose such receipt to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">The Sydney trust accounts for the years 1990 to 1994 were prepared so as to evidence a loss to the trust which had not previously been identified as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">The obvious purpose was to achieve a tax advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">In the face of such substantial losses, and having regard to the returns for the years prior to 1990, it would have been difficult to explain how there could have been any distribution of income or capital to beneficiaries in the years after 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">It was also obviously advantageous to characterize payments to the Weyers as loans rather than distributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">123 The parties did not, in their submissions, distinguish between the various sources of funds received by Nommack Nominees in relevant years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">Primarily these funds came from Forrester or Forrester Kurts, its successor, or otherwise from the trust's business activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">I should say that the contract between Nommack Nominees and Forrester Kurts does not indicate that Nommack Nominees was contracting as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">However I infer that it was doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">In the 1995 year, one other substantial amount was received from Cherrybrook as trustee of the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">The family trust deed provided for three classes of beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">Primary beneficiaries were identified in the first schedule as Robert Weyers, Barbara Karen Weyers and each of their children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">Secondary beneficiaries were 'The next of kin of the primary beneficiaries' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">Tertiary beneficiaries were the Australian Red Cross Society (Qld Division), the National Heart Foundation of Australia (Qld Division) and 'any company or corporation (not being the settlor or the Trustee or an excluded person as hereinbefore defined) of which any one or more of the primary beneficiaries or any one or more of the secondary beneficiaries is a member or over which any one or more of the primary beneficiaries or any or one or more of the secondary beneficiaries have control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">' 
 124 Mr and Mrs Weyers are members of Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">I infer that it is a tertiary beneficiary of the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">At the time of the distribution Mr and Mrs Weyers were directors of both Cherrybook and Nommack Nominees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">Both were employed by Nommack Nominees for salaries which were inadequate to meet their needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">It seems likely that the distribution from Cherrybrook was derived from the supply of Mr Weyers' consultancy services by Cherrybrook to Forrester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">It is probable that the distribution to Nommack Nominees was designed to serve both of the above objectives --- to gain a tax advantage and to facilitate payment to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">It cannot seriously be suggested that it was contemplated that Nommack Nominees might pay it to anybody else.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">It certainly did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">I infer that both trustees acted at all times in accordance with Mr and Mrs Weyers intentions, perhaps guided by Mr Steele's advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">125 The methods used to achieve the two objectives produced inconsistency in the treatment of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">The tax advantage could only be obtained by paying the money to Nommack Nominees as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">If the money was received in that capacity, any disposition of it to the Weyers by way of loan was likely to be inconsistent with the trust, particularly if the Weyers were not beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">This difficulty probably led the Weyers to make the donations to relevant charities, thus qualifying them as potential beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">Such inconsistency also led to the distribution of the PPS credits and the subsequent attempts to reverse that distribution, and the attempts to establish that they were not beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">In the end the question is whether the Weyers, Cherrybrook and Nommack Nominees intended that the distribution from the family trust be available to the Weyers or that it be property of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">126 I find it difficult to accept that any competent lawyer or accountant would seriously have entertained the idea that the Sydney trust came with legitimate accumulated losses, given that those losses represented debts which had never been paid and would never be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">Any reasonably intelligent member of the community, let alone a person with legal or accounting training, would immediately have wondered why there should be such a substantial tax advantage in the detritus of a failed transaction which had occurred so long ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">I cannot avoid the conclusion that Cherrybrook distributed profits of the family trust to Nommack Nominees in order to facilitate their payment, tax free, to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">We know that they could not survive on their salaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">Although it was contemplated that Nommack Nominees would account for the money as trust funds in order to utilize the perceived benefit of accumulated losses, the real intention was that the funds become the property of the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">The trust and its allegedly accumulated losses were used as window dressing in order to create the illusion that the money had been returned for tax purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">127 With the exception of the claimed tax benefit, the only other function to be performed by Nommack Nominees was as banker for the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">The money in its hands was treated as effectively theirs, to call on as they wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">Nobody seems to have treated Nommack Nominees as having any duties as a trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">To my mind, the relationship was that of debtor and creditor or banker and customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">If there was any trust relationship, then Nommack Nominees held as bare trustee for the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">128 It is true that at the end of the 1995 year, about $100,000 remained on loan by Nommack Nominees as trustee to Cherrybrook as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">That may have been part of the distribution from the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">That does not detract from my view concerning the parties' intentions in making the distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">In any event, if the Weyers drew more from the Sydney trust's business income and less from the family trust distribution, the result would be the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">That is because I am of the view that all other moneys paid by Nommack Nominees to the Weyers were paid as distributions from the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">I will now give my reasons for that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">129 Nommack Nominees must have incurred outgoings in connection with its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">Those outgoings had to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">Nommack Nominees as trustee entered into the contract with Forrester and, presumably, was entitled, in that capacity, to moneys payable pursuant thereto.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">I infer that the same arrangement existed in connection with the dealings with Forrester Kurts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">In those circumstances, it is not easy to infer that such receipts were held solely for use by the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">I am inclined to accept that such moneys and other moneys received in connection with Nommack Nominees' business activities were received in its capacity as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">However the profits were not treated as trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">Nommack Nominees seems to have treated itself as obliged only to account to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">No consideration was given to the nominated beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">The question is whether Mr and Mrs Weyers became beneficiaries of the Sydney trust pursuant to its terms or whether trust funds were misapplied in unauthorized payments to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">130 I found Mr Steele's explanations for the distribution of the PPS credits to Mr and Mrs Weyers to be unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">It is very easy to explain an inconvenient event by asserting that it was an error, particularly eight or nine years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">If that explanation stood by itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">I may have been inclined to accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">However Mr Steele said that he understood that Mr and Mrs Weyers became beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">That was the purpose of the donation made by Mr Weyers to the Australian Red Cross (Qld Division) and that made by Mrs Weyers to National Heart Foundation of Australia (Qld Division), both of which were receipted on 23 June 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">The coincidence of these donations, so close to the end of the 1995 tax year, and the inclusion of the PPS credits in their returns for that year, is hard to accept as accidental.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">As Mr and Mrs Weyers acted on Mr Steele's advice, I infer that it was intended that they be beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">131 The position therefore was that Mr Steele understood that Mr and Mrs Weyers were beneficiaries, but prepared the trust accounts, year after year, on the basis that they had borrowed ever-increasing amounts from the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">This ceased in 2002 when the perceived accumulated losses were exhausted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">Thereafter a different structure was adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">Although the trustee had power to lend under the trust deed, I doubt whether an interest-free loan, with no expectation of repayment, would be a proper exercise of that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Such payments to a beneficiary would be more properly described as distributions than loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">This was not a case in which any legitimate purpose was served by retaining an ultimate right to call for repayment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">There is no suggestion that there could have been any circumstances in which the loans would have been called in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">Once the accumulated tax losses are set aside, it is clear that the Sydney trust was making substantial profits (save in 2001).</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">There is no evidence that the funds were ever likely to be needed to pay creditors or for capital investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">The history of the trust to 2002 demonstrates this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">Even now, there has been no suggestion that the "loans" will be called in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">Subject only to the question of whether or not Mr and Mrs Weyers were, in fact, appointed beneficiaries under the trust deed, I consider that, whatever they were called, these payments were by way of distribution of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">132 As to the question of appointment, the relevant provision of the trust deed is cl 2(d) which authorizes the trustee, with the consent of the guardian, if there is such a person, to appoint as a general beneficiary, anybody who has donated $2 or upwards to one of the three identified charities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">There is no requirement that the appointment be in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">It is accepted by the tax payers that there was, at the relevant time, no guardian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">The absence of any writing is to be considered in light of cl 10 which requires that certain determinations, not including those under cl 2, be recorded in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">It is true that cl 10 requires that any disposition of income pursuant to cl 6 be evidenced in writing, but that is a different question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">If the transaction was properly one of distribution, then the failure to comply with a formal requirement cannot change its nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">It is said by the taxpayers that there is no evidence of any determination by Nommack Nominees to make a distribution to either Mr or Mrs Weyers, and that appears to be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">However, as far as I am aware, there is also no particular evidence of any approval of loans, save in the annual accounts, presumably adopted by the board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">In the circumstances I infer from the fact that Nommack Nominees has made payments, properly characterized as distributions, that it exercised the power pursuant to cl 2(c) to appoint Mr and Mrs Weyers as general beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">The affairs of the trust appear to have been conducted upon the basis that only their interests were relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">133 I infer that the moneys received by Mr and Mrs Weyers from Nommack Nominees (other than to the extent that Nommack Nominees derived such funds from Cherrybrook) were distributions to them as beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">The funds received from Cherrybrook were held on behalf of the Weyers and were taxable in their hands as distributions of profit from the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">
 SECTION 99B 
 
 134 Alternatively, the Commissioner relies upon s 99B which provides: 
 
 
 '(1) Where, at any time during a year of income, an amount, being property of a trust estate, is paid to, or applied for the benefit of, a beneficiary of the trust estate who was a resident at any time during the year of income, the assessable income of the beneficiary of the year of income shall, subject to subsection (2), include that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">
 
 (2) The amount that, but for this subsection, would be included in the assessable income of a beneficiary of a trust estate under subsection (1) by reason that an amount, being property of a trust estate, was paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary shall be reduced by so much (if any) of the amount, as represents - 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) corpus of the trust estate (except to the extent to which it is attributable to amounts derived by the trust estate that, if they had been derived by a taxpayer being a resident, would have been included in the assessable income of that taxpayer of a year of income); 
 
 (b) an amount that, if it had been derived by a taxpayer being a resident, would not have been included in the assessable income of that taxpayer of the year of income; 
 
 (c) an amount - 
 
 
 
 
 (i) that is or has been included in the assessable income of the beneficiary in pursuance of section 97 ; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) in respect of which the trustee of the trust estate is or has been assessed and liable to pay tax in pursuance of section 98 , 99 and 99A ; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) an amount that is or has been included in the assessable income of any taxpayer (other than a company) under section 102AAZD ; or 
 
 (e) if the beneficiary is a company --- an amount that is or has been included in the assessable income of the beneficiary under section 102AAZD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) In pars 2(d) and (e): 
 "Company" means a company other than a company in the capacity of a trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">' 
 
 
 
 135 The taxpayers make three points concerning the operation of s 99B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">Firstly, they submit that the section should be read down to recognize the difficulties identified by Hill J in his decision in Traknew Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 21 ATR 1478.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">His Honour said at 1492:
 'The application of s 99B also presents difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">Literally, the section is capable of applying in the circumstances of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">However, the section was not enacted to render assessable payments or applications to the benefit of discretionary beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">Such payments or applications were already made assessable income by force of s 97 alone or in combination with s 101 , leaving aside a case where s 98 applies but the presently entitled beneficiary is under a legal disability where the trustee is assessable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">' 
 
 136 His Honour then went on to consider the history of the enactment of the section, suggesting that it is concerned primarily with the derivation of accumulated income from a source outside of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">His Honour did not finally decide whether or not it was appropriate to adopt a narrow construction of s 99B in order to give effect to that perceived parliamentary intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">In view of my conclusions concerning other aspects of the matter, it is not necessary that I address this question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">
 PART IVA AND SCHEDULE 2F 
 
 137 The Commissioner also relies upon Pt IVA of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">However the identified schemes (identified in par 7.1 of the Commissioner's amended statement of facts issues and contentions) depend for their efficacy upon the carried-forward losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">I have found that there were no such losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">It may be possible to identify one other scheme, not involving such losses, to which Part IVA could apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">However no such case was advanced by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">It would be unfair to the taxpayers were I to proceed in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">In any event, I understand that the Commissioner relies on Part IVA in the alternative to the case which I have determined in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">It is also unnecessary to consider the operation of Schedule 2F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">
 ARE THE AMENDED ASSESSMENTS EXCESSIVE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">
 
 138 Whether or not the amended assessments are excessive depends upon the way in which Nommack Nominees' income is distributed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">There are four possibly relevant taxpayers: Mr and Mrs Weyers, Nommack Nominees in its own right and Nommack Nominees as trustee of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">The amended assessments affecting the last-mentioned taxpayer are not in issue before me, but my findings lead to certain inferences concerning those assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">139 I have concluded that the whole of the distribution by Cherrybrook, nominally to Nommack Nominees as trustee, in the 1995 year ($156,887) was actually to Mr and Mrs Weyers and should have been included in their assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">It is quite clear from their evidence that their drawings were used for joint, as well as individual expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">It would be pointless to speculate about whether Mr or Mrs Weyers would have had greater personal expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">No doubt a large part went to maintaining their children and their household.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">That income should be treated as having been distributed equally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">140 As to income derived by Nommack Nominees as trustee, to the extent that it was purportedly lent to either Mr or Mrs Weyers, it was in fact distributed income and should have been included in their assessable incomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">The treatment of any undistributed amounts is not so easy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">I have found that Nommack Nominees' business income was derived by it as trustee, although it seems that it was thereafter treated as effectively the property of Mr and Mrs Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">One might infer that all profits were effectively distributed to them but not drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">Alternatively, one might infer that only those amounts actually paid were so distributed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">I am inclined to the second view, only because prior to any drawing by the Weyers, there had been no positive action inconsistent with Nommack Nominees' duty as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">I am therefore reluctant to infer any such conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">Undistributed trust income should be included in the assessable income of Nommack Nominees as trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">As I understand it, that leads to the conclusion that Nommack Nominees had no assessable income in its own right in any relevant year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">After publishing these reasons, I will entertain further submissions concerning these provisional views, should the parties wish to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">
 POWER TO AMEND THE WEYERS' ASSESSMENTS FOR 1995, 1996, 1997 AND 1998 
 
 141 Section 170(2) provides:
 'Subject to this section, where there has been an avoidance of tax, the Commissioner may: 
 
 
 
 (a) if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the avoidance of tax is due to fraud or evasion --- at any time; ... 
 (b) ... 
 
 
 
 amend the assessment by making such alterations in it or additions to it as the Commissioner thinks necessary to correct the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">' 
 
 142 In the case of Mr and Mrs Weyers, the Commissioner has purported to amend the assessments in the years 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, notwithstanding the fact that the four year period had expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">He could only do so if he held the opinion that there had been an avoidance of tax due to fraud or evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">In a letter dated 11 December 2003, the Commissioner indicated that he had formed such an opinion 'with emphasis on the word "evasion" ' and gave the following reasons:
 'The Commissioner has formed this opinion because you paid $160,000 for a trust without any assets, save for (possibly) tax losses and with a Fund Deficiency of Capital of $2,655,292.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">
 
 The only documentation received when the trust was acquired in December 1994 was the Trust Deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">The evidence available to the Commissioner indicates that you did not obtain any financial records from the former trustee to verify that the tax losses exceeding $2.6 million were actually available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">The Facilitation Agreement expressly provided for the provision of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">
 
 Moreover, the onus of proof that there had not been an avoidance of tax due to fraud or evasion rests with you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">In this case, it has not been satisfied despite a specific request for a submission why the Commissioner should not, given the facts already available to him, be in a position to consider that tax has been avoided as a result of fraud or evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">' 
 
 143 The nature of the Commissioner's request for information appears elsewhere in the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">By their notices of objection Mr and Mrs Weyers denied fraud or evasion and alleged that the amended assessments were not 'genuine attempts to ascertain the taxpayer's taxable income and the tax payable on that taxable income' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">The objection was disallowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">144 The power to reassess is enlivened by the Commissioner's formation of the relevant opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">In Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360, Dixon CJ said, concerning the formation by the Commissioner of an opinion as to a different matter:
 'But it is for the commissioner, not for me, to be satisfied of the state of the voting power at the end of the year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">His decision, it is true is not unexaminable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">If he does not address himself to the question which the subsection formulates, if his conclusion is affected by some mistake of law, if he takes some extraneous reason into consideration or excludes from consideration some factor which should affect his determination, on any of these grounds his conclusion is liable to review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">Moreover, the fact that he has not made known the reasons why he was not satisfied will not prevent the review of his decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">The conclusion he has reached may, on a full consideration of the material that was before him, be found to be capable of explanation only on the ground of some such misconception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">If the result appears to be unreasonable on the supposition that he addressed himself to the right question, correctly applied the rules of law and took into account all the relevant considerations and no irrelevant considerations, then it may be a proper inference that it is a false supposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">It is not necessary that you should be sure of the precise particular in which he has gone wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">It is enough that you can see that in some way he must have failed in the discharge of his exact function according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">' 
 
 145 Drummond J said in Kajewski v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 455 at [107]:
 'The applicants have sought to show that the Commissioner erred in forming the opinion that there was an avoidance of tax due to fraud or evasion because the applicants, their advisers and other witnesses had given evidence in this court to the effect that there was no such fraud or evasion, evidence it is said which this Court should accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">In rejecting the applicant's attack on the amended assessments because they are excessive, I have explained why this part of the applicant's case is, on the evidence before me, unfounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">But, in any event, for the reasons given, the issue of fraud and evasion is not at large for this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">In accordance with Avon Downs and Kolotex [(1975) [1975] HCA 5 ; 132 CLR 535] the Commissioner's opinion that there was fraud or evasion involved must stand unless the applicants can show that the Commissioner, in forming that opinion, fell into the kind of error therein referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">Only if the applicants can establish, by reference only to the material that was before the Commissioner, that his opinion was vitiated by some such deficiency in the approach he took in reaching that opinion would it be open to this court to form its own view on the question of fraud or evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">Consistently with their submissions that the appeal to this court is by way of hearing de novo , the applicants did not seek to mount the kind of attack on the Commissioner's determination that there was fraud or evasion involved that must be made before this court can consider that issue for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">No challenge to the formation by the Commissioner of the opinion necessary to enliven his power under s 170(2) to issue the amended assessments here in question within the principle in Avon Downs was raised by the applicants, let alone made out at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">' 
 
 146 It is for the taxpayer to identify grounds upon which the formation of the Commissioner's opinion may be impugned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">The Commissioner need not justify the decision, save in response to an appropriate attack upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">147 The taxpayers complain that the Commissioner has not, in these proceedings, identified the officer who formed the relevant opinions or the matters said to involve "dishonesty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">However the Commissioner, at an early stage in the correspondence, explained his reasons for forming the view that there had been avoidance due to evasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">Those reasons either withstand scrutiny or they do not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">The taxpayers also complain that in providing particulars, the Commissioner purported to rely upon all of the matters in his statement of facts, issues and contentions, other than the assessments and subsequent events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">That may not have been a particularly helpful way of responding to a request for particulars with respect to a narrow issue such as this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">However the Commissioner was an outsider to all relevant transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">It is not surprising that he should cast his net widely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">In those circumstances the complaint is a little precious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">148 The Commissioner appears to have formed the opinion that there had been evasion rather than fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">The use of old tax losses of an apparently abandoned trust with which the taxpayers had no previous association is, by itself, a reasonable basis for suspecting avoidance through evasion It is suggested that the Commissioner applied the wrong test in that he did not consider whether any fraud or evasion occasioned avoidance of tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">However that is the precise opinion which he formed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">See the letter of 11 December 2003 at p 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">The Commissioner's reasons demonstrate that he formed the view that the Weyers, or persons associated with them, had probably become beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">That is a not unduly cynical view, given that they paid $160,000 to acquire it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">The Commissioner enquired as to any nomination of new beneficiaries and as to any resolutions concerning income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">There was no response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">The Commissioner was also aware, as appears from his reasons, of the distribution of the PPS credits, indicating that the Weyers were beneficiaries of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">In his reasons he placed emphasis upon the fact that the Weyers had acquired, for $160,000, a trust structure which had no assets and an apparent deficiency of liabilities over assets of $2,655,292.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">He understood that the only documentation received was the trust deed, and that no financial records verifying the loss had been sighted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">149 The Commissioner was entitled to place significant weight upon the failure by the taxpayers to respond to his request for further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">There may have been a valid reason for acquiring a trust with accumulated losses for a relatively substantial amount of money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">If so, one would expect the taxpayer to respond to such an inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">In the absence of such response, it was reasonable to infer that the Weyers did not wish to explain to the Commissioner the purpose for which they had acquired the trust or their use of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">It would also be a reasonable inference that the trust was acquired for use in avoiding tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">150 I see no ground for interfering in the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">These reasons apply to both Mr and Mrs Weyers and to the amended assessments for each of the years 1995 to 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">
 ADDITIONAL TAX 
 
 151 That leaves for consideration only the question of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">As Nommack Nominees has no tax liability in its own right, the assessment of it to additional tax should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">Additional tax assessed against that company as trustee of the Sydney trust will presumably be dealt with in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">I need only consider the additional tax assessed as payable by Mr and Mrs Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">The relevant provisions are ss 226G, 226H and 226J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">Section 226G provides:
 'Subject to this Part, if: 
 
 (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
 
 
 (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the failure of the taxpayer or of a registered tax agent to take reasonable care to comply with this Act or the regulations; 
 
 
 
 the taxpayer is liable to pay by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the shortfall or part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">' 
 
 152 Section 226H provides:
 'Subject to this Part, if: 
 
 (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
 
 
 (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the recklessness of the taxpayer or of a registered tax agent with regard to the correct operation of this Act or the regulations; 
 
 
 
 the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 50% of the amount of the shortfall or part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">' 
 
 153 Section 226J provides:
 'Subject to this Part, if: 
 
 (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
 
 
 (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the intentional disregard by the taxpayer or by a registered tax agent of this Act or the regulations; 
 
 
 
 the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 70% of the amount of the shortfall or part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">' 
 
 154 The Commissioner has assessed Mr and Mrs Weyers to penalty tax pursuant to s 226J at the rate of 75 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">On my findings both Mr and Mrs Weyers had a tax shortfall for each of the relevant years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">In each year the shortfall was caused primarily by two things, namely:
 &#8226; the purported utilization of accumulated tax losses in the Sydney trust; and
 &#8226; failure to return distributions from the Sydney trust and, in the 1995 year, from the family trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">155 I accept that Mr and Mrs Weyers were advised by Mr Steele and/or Mr Priddle and/or Mr Collie that the various steps taken were both lawful and effective to reduce their income tax liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">It is in the nature of the relationship between a client and his or her solicitor or accountant that he or she can rely upon the advice given, save where the client would be expected to know that the advice was not worthy of such reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">It may be, too, that Mrs Weyers put her affairs into the hands of her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">She seemed to know significantly less about the transactions in question than did he.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">In assessing their conduct it must also be remembered that the Sydney trust was acquired in late 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">Public awareness of the dangers of tax avoidance schemes may not have been as high as it now is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Nonetheless one wonders about the Weyers' acceptance that they were to obtain such a substantial advantage (in effect the amount of tax on $2.6 million, received over eight years) for an investment of $155,000, plus legal and accounting expenses and outgoings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">156 Mr Weyers was an experienced businessman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">In 1991 he and his wife made a deliberate decision to trade through a corporation as trustee of a family trust, with the aim of avoiding personal liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">It is reasonable to infer that they also enquired as to other consequences and incidents of such a structure, including the distinction between personal assets, corporate assets and trust assets and the legal duties of company directors and trustees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">They certainly should have done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">It would surely be reckless to enter into such arrangements without inquiring as to the relevant duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">In 1994 they cannot have been entirely unaware of the consequences of acquiring the Sydney trust and adopting it as the principal organ through which they conducted their business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">By that time neither the notion of incorporation nor that of a trust can have been entirely alien to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">It is also of concern that no inquiry was made as to the mechanism by which the acquisition of the Sydney trust was said to lead to such a substantial tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">A client is not obliged or entitled to accept bland assurances by his or her professional advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">Bland assurance is not the same thing as professional advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">A taxpayer may simply accept advice that he or she will achieve a tax benefit if he or she acquires a particular entity, but such acceptance is at the taxpayer's own risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">If the advice is wrong, there will be consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">If the advice is about taxation, one consequence may be exposure to the additional tax regime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Mr and Mrs Weyers must have been aware that if such advice was wrong, the result would be that their respective incomes would be understated, and that understatement may lead to penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Their conduct in connection with their tax affairs ought reasonably to have reflected the seriousness of the consequences, for them and for the revenue, of wrong advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">157 As a minimum requirement I would have expected the Weyers to have inquired as to the history of the Sydney trust and as to the mechanism by which the loss had been incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">In the absence of such knowledge, they could not honestly claim the losses in reduction of their taxable incomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">Undoubtedly the taxation legislation of this country is arcane, if not incomprehensible, to most people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">It is unfortunate that it should be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">Nonetheless the ideas which underlie it are fairly simply and known to most people, particularly those who are in business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">The idea of carrying forward losses from earlier years is not difficult to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">What is difficult to understand in this case is why a debt incurred in 1988 and never paid, nor ever likely to be paid, should lead to a substantial tax benefit in the years 1995 to 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">Had the Weyers enquired as to the trust's trading history, they would have discovered the doubtful nature of the claimed loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">That knowledge would have prompted questions concerning the mechanics by which any tax advantage was to be obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">158 Mr Weyers was at least unsure as to the course of conduct which he and Mrs Weyers adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">He claims to have been reassured by Mr Steele that it was all his money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">That statement was substantially correct, but it was not the position which was presented to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">The Commissioner was told that the money really belonged to the trust and was lent to Mr and Mrs Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">The reasonable lay person would not be satisfied by an explanation which depended upon the proposition that he was lending money to himself and thereby avoiding tax liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">Apart from questions concerning the accumulated losses, the fundamental question which they ought to have asked was why the transactions involving "his" or "their" money were being recorded as loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">A second question might have been why, if such payments were loans, they were not to be repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">159 It is tempting to seek to exonerate Mrs Weyers from these criticisms on the grounds of her assumed lack of business experience and reliance on her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">However it would be anachronistic to assume that a female taxpayer's duty in connection with the revenue is somehow of a lower order than that of a male taxpayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">Indeed, if her experience is less, her duty to enquire may be greater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">160 Sections 226G, 226H and 226J provide a graduated scheme of penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">Each section identifies a slightly different form of conduct and a slightly different level of culpability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">Section 226G addresses a failure to take reasonable care to comply with the Act or regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">Section 226H addresses recklessness with regard to the correct operation of the Act or regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">Section 226J concerns intentional disregard of the Act or regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">For the purposes of s 226G it is necessary to identify conduct falling short of that expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Section 226H requires the identification of conduct with disregard for the consequences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">Section 226J requires intended disregard of the Act or regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">161 Mr and Mrs Weyers made no personal attempts, as far as I can see, to satisfy themselves as to the existence of the claimed losses in the Sydney trust or to acquire a broad understanding of the mechanism by which they claimed to be entitled to set off the income of the Sydney trust against such losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">They made no attempt to identify why money was treated as lent to them when it was said to be Mr Weyers' money and not repayable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">Had the Weyers insisted that Mr Steele give rational explanations of these matters, he would have been unable to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">Either he or the Weyers would then have been compelled to seek appropriate, hopefully independent, advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">Had competent advice been obtained, it would have addressed the issues which I have addressed in my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Any competent advice would, in my view, have raised serious doubts about both the accumulated losses and the system of distributing income to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">Had such advice involved a reasonable explanation, in lay terms, of why the accumulated losses might be available and why it might be arguable that the payments to the Weyers were loans, then it would have been difficult to conclude that the Weyers had failed to take reasonable care to comply with the Act, notwithstanding my findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">However the Weyers' actual conduct fell well short of being reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">The case for the assessment to additional tax under s 226G is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">I turn to s 226H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">162 Section 226H addresses shortfalls caused by recklessness with regard to the correct operation of the ITA Act or the regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">That Act is concerned with the assessment of taxable income and tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">Assessment depends upon the disclosure of income, including trust income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">The Weyers must have known that the correct operation of the Act depended upon their accurately disclosing all relevant sources and amounts of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">They did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">They must have realized that the consequences of their use of the claimed losses and of the treatment of distributions as loans would reduce their taxable incomes and their tax liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">Indeed, that was the avowed purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">A taxpayer must know that factual accuracy in relevant tax returns is essential to the correct operation of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">If a taxpayer elects to rely on the outcome of past transactions of which he or she has no direct knowledge, then he or she must take steps to ensure that all relevant factual assertions are true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">If they are not, then the Act will not operate correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">To fail to make such enquiries is to disregard that consequence and, in my view, is reckless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">163 As to the claimed loans, the idea of a loan is not difficult to understand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">The legal concept does not differ from common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">To assert that one has lent oneself one's own money is absurd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">It makes correct operation of the ITA Act impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">It is at best reckless with regard to the correct operation of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">Assessment to additional tax pursuant to s 226H was justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">164 I turn to s 226J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">Mr and Mrs Weyers must have been aware of the obligation to return all income accurately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">Had they investigated the claimed losses or considered whether the amounts which they received were really loans, they would have realized that by purporting to set off taxable income against such losses and returning those payments as loans, they were intentionally disregarding the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">However I am inclined to the view that they chose not to consider the consequences of their actions, save to ensure that they acted on advice which appeared to facilitate a favourable result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">Their conduct was reckless rather than deliberate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">165 To this point I have focussed solely upon the conduct of the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">However a taxpayer may be assessed to additional tax if a tax shortfall is caused by relevant conduct of a tax agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">Mr Steele was a tax agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">A tax agent presumably comes to taxation matters with some understanding of the structure of the Act and experience of its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">Mr Steele was aware of the need to ensure that the Weyers' tax returns accurately reflected their income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">He knew of the circumstances in which the Sydney trust was acquired, and that the purpose was to enable the Weyers to minimize their tax liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">He knew that Mr Collie had an interest in the transaction by which Mr and Mr Weyers obtained control of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">He seems to have been content to act on the advice of Messrs Priddle and Collie and to allow Mr and Mrs Weyers to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">166 His knowledge of the prior history of the Sydney trust appears to have been based on the documents received from Mr Arnold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">He apparently accepted them at face value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to take that course, but in these circumstances, it was inappropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">Inevitably, accounts reflect matters of opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">Mr Steele should have realized that those who sold the trust to Mr Collie had an interest in presenting the accounts in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">He ought to have taken steps to verify the contents as best he could, at least before effectively representing their truth to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">If he could not verify their truth, he should not have relied on them in preparing the Weyers' tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">Had the Weyers instructed him to act on a particular basis, the position may have been otherwise, but it is clear that they acted on his advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">It may be that he simply trusted Mr Collie and Mr Arnold (or his accounts).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">For that reason I would be inclined to treat this aspect of his conduct as reckless rather than as intentional disregard of the ITA Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">167 However it is not so easy to take such a view of his conduct in connection with the payments to the Weyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">He knew that they were obliged accurately to return their income, including trust income from both the family trust and the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">It is possible that Mr Steele thought that the money from the family trust had really gone to Nommack Nominees, although I have formed a different view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">However I find it hard to believe that he understood the payments to, or for, the Weyers, either in 1995 or any other year, to have been by way of loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">He believed the Weyers to be beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">To describe such amounts as loans, when they were not to bear interest or to be repaid, is to misuse language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">I accept Mr Weyers' account of his discussions with Mr Steele.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">In particular, I accept that Mr Steele told Mr Weyers that the money which he and his wife were drawing was his or their money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">That was not merely a figure of speech or over-simplification for the benefit of a lay client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">His meaning could only have been that the Weyers could use Nommack Nominees' money in their absolute discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">168 I return to the requirement of the ITA Act that a taxpayer disclose trust income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">It does not really matter whether the moneys distributed by the family trust went to Nommack Nominees as banker, as bare trustee or as trustee of the Sydney trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">To the extent that such moneys and other income of the Sydney trust was distributed to the Weyers, it was income derived from one or other of the two trusts and should have been returned as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">I cannot avoid the conclusion that Mr Steele must have known that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">He intentionally disregarded the requirement for disclosure of such income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">That caused the Weyers' tax shortfalls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">The assessment to additional tax pursuant to s 226J was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">169 After publication of these reasons I will adjourn the matter to enable the parties to prepare draft orders and to identify any further findings of fact which they might reasonably require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">I will hear submissions as to costs.</sentence>
