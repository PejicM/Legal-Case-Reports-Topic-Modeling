1 This judgment considers a number of issues which flow from findings made in [90] to [92] of the reasons for judgment delivered on 6 January 2006 in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The background circumstances are explained in those reasons and will not be repeated, save for [90] to [92] which read as follows:
 
 The issue concerning AIMS is now addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">CGU argued that CCAS should not have agreed to pay the applicants their costs of suing AIMS as part of the settlement because the policy did not cover AIMS for its own wrongdoing, but only for the wrongdoing of the trustee as defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">CGU contended that AIMS was sued for its own wrongdoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">As the cross-claimants did not lead any evidence of the applicant's separate costs attributable to suing AIMS they had not shown, so it was contended, that the settlement was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The policy only provides indemnity in respect of wrongful acts committed by the trustee (cl 1.1 and cl 1.2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">AIMS was not within the definition of trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">There is no warrant in the policy for construing 'officer' in cl 5 by reference to s 9 of the Corporations Law as contended for by the cross-claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Further, the claims made against AIMS, even where they involve vicarious or accessorial liability, cannot properly be described as claims arising from acts committed by the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The allegations concerned conduct of AIMS itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Finally, the cross-claimants did not lead evidence as to the amount of the costs paid to the applicants which were attributable to the claim against AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I accept each of CGU's arguments save for the final step, namely, that as a consequence, the settlement should be found not to have been reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In a written submission in reply, the cross-claimants contended that the Court should assume that the costs incurred by the applicants in suing AIMS were insignificant especially given that the factual basis of the claims against all the respondents were generally common to all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On this assumption, the cross-claimants argued, the settlement should be found to have been reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">However, it would not be proper to make such an assumption without evidence to support it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">There is no such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On the other hand, it may be unjust to determine that the entire settlement was unreasonable by reason of this gap in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In the written submissions in reply the cross-claimants argued that the Court should order that the applicant's costs of suing AIMS should be taxed or otherwise determined and then deducted from the settlement figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">CGU did not have liberty to respond to the submissions in reply and thus has not been heard on this proposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Unless the parties can agree on this issue, the case will be re-listed to hear submissions on the appropriate orders which should be made consequent upon the conclusions reached above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

2 Following the delivery of judgment on 6 January 2006, CCAS contended that notwithstanding the reasoning in [90] to [92] it was unnecessary for it to call evidence to establish the reasonableness of that part of the settlement whereby CCAS undertook to pay the costs of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">For example, it contended that it was open to the Court on the evidence already adduced to infer that the settlement was reasonable, and, alternatively it contended that the onus lay on CGU to prove that the settlement was not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It also argued that if it was necessary to call evidence then it was entitled to do so because it had not closed its case on the issue of the reasonableness of the settlement agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">However, in the event that these arguments did not avail it, CCAS applied to the Court for leave to reopen its case to adduce evidence of the reasonableness of the settlement agreement as to the payment of the costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">3 It is convenient at this point to consider CCAS' application to reopen the case on the assumption that its case was closed, that it bears the onus of establishing that the settlement agreement was reasonable, and that it has not yet done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">THE APPLICATION TO REOPEN 
 
4 CGU opposed the application to reopen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It contended that it had outlined its position at the beginning of the case, namely that the payment of the applicants' costs of suing AIMS rendered the settlement unreasonable, that there was no attempt by the cross-claimants to lead evidence of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, and consequently, the settlement agreement had not been shown to be reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">5 The issue was addressed initially by counsel for the cross-claimants in opening on the first day of the trial as follows:
 
 MR DAVIS: Your Honour, moving on, Mr Murdoch, on 1 September when your Honour called us before you to ensure that the train was on the tracks, made a point of the fact that the applicants' costs were not taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It's completely irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Some costs were in fact subject to a certificate of taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The certificate of taxation is found in the court book, CB2079.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It was a certificate by Registrar Bardsley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That was the amount of $89,000 which I'll come to how that arose, but the 450 - the absence of taxation is nothing to the point in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">HIS HONOUR: I suppose that even at this stage it would be possible to, if I found in your favour on the question of the liability of CGU to pay those costs, it would still be open, would it not, to have the registrar assess them?</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">MR DAVIS: Yes, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Our primary submission is that the costs should be allowed in this amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes, I understand that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">MR DAVIS: But in default of that, provided there's a liability to pay costs - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Mr Davis, I'm responding to your point that Mr Murdoch's position is that there was no taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">MR DAVIS: Yes, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">HIS HONOUR: What I'm saying is, is a solution to that problem the possibility that the registrar could now undertake an assessment - I think under the rules - it may not be the process of taxation of those costs, but it might be a way of assessing - in other words, it's a quantification under the policy, using not my time or any debate that - see, Mr Murdoch might be wanting to satisfy his clients that they're not paying over the odds on that particular quantum, and if there was a procedure available which enabled that to be done, then that might be sufficient to answer the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">MR DAVIS: May I respond to that, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There are two points that arise from that, if I may.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The first point is that the applicants' costs have been assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">They have been assessed in the appropriate way which is in a proceeding between the applicants and my clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The second point - so our primary case remains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There's evidence of the reasonableness of the costs, otherwise what is Registrar Bardsley's estimate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">But moving on from that, if I'm wrong about it, then what your Honour says makes very good sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In other words, if your Honour were to find contrary to my primary submission which is that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and none has been called, the registrar's estimate should stand as an assessment, which is my primary submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">If I'm wrong about that, then it would be for your Honour to refer the matter out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">I doubt that it could be done under the rules, it would have to be done by direction of your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The reason it couldn't be done under the rules is the taxation - - - 
 
 HIS HONOUR: No, it wouldn't be a taxation under the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It would be - - - 
 
 MR DAVIS: Precisely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">HIS HONOUR: It would be an assessment in effect of damages as - - - 
 
 MR DAVIS: Precisely, by a referee costing consultant or by a registrar, as your Honour saw fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">But my primary submission is that's unnecessary, for the reasons I've expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">I can't advance them further at this stage, your Honour, other than to say, in my submission, it's a very good argument that the registrar's assessments be good evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It was always open to Mr Murdoch to contradict it, always.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">So, my submission about the registrar's estimate falls within the umbrella of the general principle that a reasonable settlement is all that you have to prove, and we say we establish reasonableness by the registrar's estimate, and all I've been saying is that it would be very curious if that weren't right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">...
 

6 Senior counsel for CGU put the position in response on the following day as follows:
 
 ... Now our proposition is this, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The proceeding that was brought by all of those applicants was a proceeding not just against the trustee or Mr Lawson and Mr Twomey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It was a significant proceeding against CCA [AIMS].</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">But the orders that the trustee acceded to that your Honour made, having been invited to do so by the settlement between the parties, was an order that the trustee pay all of the applicants' costs which included the applicants' costs in relation to the significant proceeding that it bought against CCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Now we say, your Honour, that is an entirely unreasonable thing to do for the trustee or the trustees to take upon themselves the burden of paying the costs of the trustee which were, the costs of CCA, which were incurred as a result of a claim which was made against CCA - - - 
 
 ...
 
 MR MURDOCH: ... And, secondly, in this proceeding the trustee has not essayed to try to tell your Honour how much of those costs which they have paid might have been costs attributable to the applicant's costs of running its case or developing its case against CCA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">We say in those circumstances that situation remains one whereby it is unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">...
 
 ...
 
 HIS HONOUR: Well, if you succeed in persuading me that the settlement was unreasonable by virtue of having taken into account the applicants' costs of fighting the employer, and that the employer was in any event not covered by the policy, where does it leave - but that you were otherwise liable, ultimately that means your client pays something but not everything claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">MR MURDOCH: It might.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">We would say the antecedent question is, has the trustee in those circumstances proved that the settlement was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">If they haven't, if one can see on its face that it can't have been for that reason and they have not sought in this proceeding to advance evidence which could give the Court any degree of comfort about how the sum that they did pay might have a certain further sum extracted from it, having regard to the proportion of costs that the applicants incurred in fighting the employer, then it will simply have failed to prove its case in relation to the issue of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">HIS HONOUR: It is not a very attractive outcome on the assumptions that have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">MR MURDOCH: I understand that, your Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">A fallback position then would be whether, if my learned friend were to ask for some form of declaratory relief, whether the Court could fashion an order for declaratory relief and then make provision for there to be some form of assessment or accounting which would then produce what the Court might think was a more palatable and equitable result; of course, all of this depending upon whether the trustee in any event is able to demonstrate that the contract of insurance responds which we say it doesn't.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">

7 In view of the submissions of CGU, it was unwise of CCAS not to call evidence as to the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS in order to meet the eventuality that CGU's argument might be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">8 CGU then contended that it would suffer embarrassment and prejudice if the application to reopen was granted, and hence it would be unfair for the Court to allow the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The unfairness lay in the fact, so it was submitted, that the original bill of costs of the applicants did not deal separately with the applicants' costs of suing the respondents other than AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A calculation of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS would have to be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">CGU attempted to obtain access to the files of the solicitors for the applicants in order to undertake this exercise but such access was denied by the solicitors for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">9 On the other hand, the evidence on which CCAS seeks to rely, if granted leave to reopen its case, is evidence from Ms Catherine Dealehr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She is a solicitor practising as a legal costs consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">She prepared the original bill of costs for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In her affidavits, she analyses the original bill, and by application of her recollection of the files of the applicants' solicitors, produces an opinion of the amount of the separate costs of the applicants suing AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">10 At this point in the argument I did not rule on the application to reopen the case, but rather heard the evidence which would be called if the application were granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Ms Dealehr was extensively cross-examined by senior counsel for CGU particularly in relation to her methodology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">By way of answer, CGU relied on an affidavit sworn by Ms Judith Hedstrom, also a solicitor practising as a legal costs consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">11 CGU has not persuaded me that it would suffer prejudice if the evidence of Ms Dealehr were admitted on a reopened case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">CGU is in no different position now than it would have been had the evidence been called in the course of the original hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The cross-claimants would have been entitled to call such evidence at the trial without seeking leave of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The necessity for reconstruction of the applicants' costs of suing AIMS existed then as it does now.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">That situation applied from the time of the making of the settlement agreement and does not arise from the reopening of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">12 Further, because the decision on the reopening application was postponed until after the taking of evidence which would be relied on if the application were granted, it has been possible to assess the quality of the case which CGU would make against the reasonableness of the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">As will be referred to later in these reasons, the case is cogent and forceful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">13 The Court has discretion whether to allow the case to be reopened or not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That discretion must be exercised in the interests of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">An important consideration against allowing an application to reopen is the need to bring finality to litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It is also relevant to examine the circumstances in which the need to reopen arose and in particular whether the cross-claimants deliberately chose not to call evidence at the first instance which it wished to call in the reopened case: see Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1992] HCA 36 ; (1992) 176 CLR 256.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">As previously mentioned, the cross-claimants deliberately chose not to call evidence as to the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS despite clear indications from CGU that it would rely on this gap in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">But the interests of justice require that these factors be taken into account against the competing interests of the parties to the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">In this case if the application is refused, CCAS loses the chance of arguing that the settlement was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The interests of justice in this instance lie in allowing CCAS to make that case because the only prejudice suffered by CGU is the delay in the completion of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Any additional costs which are attributable to the way in which the CCAS has conducted the case can be awarded to CGU and thereby address any prejudice suffered by CGU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Subject to the next question to be considered, I would grant leave to CCAS to reopen its case for the limited purpose of calling evidence and addressing argument on the reasonableness of the agreement to settle the costs of the applicants by payment of $450,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">THE LUMBERMENS POINT 
 
14 Aside from the discretionary argument just considered, CGU argued that CCAS should not have leave to reopen its case because there was a legal impediment in the way of CCAS ever establishing that the settlement agreement relating to the applicants' costs was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The settlement included a payment of the applicants' costs of suing AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">This was a liability which was not insured against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It was necessarily unreasonable for CCAS to saddle CGU with a settlement which included an element which was outside the indemnity provided by the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">15 CGU argued that the judgment of Colman J in Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company v Bovis Lend Lease Limited [2004] EWHC 2197 (Comm) supported this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In that case a builder, Bovis, sued an owner, Braehead, for about [sterling]37 million being the monies allegedly outstanding under a building contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Braehead counter-claimed for about [sterling]46 million for defective and non-compliant work and for about [sterling]49 million for mismanagement, together with [sterling]7 million claimed for liquidated damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The total of the counter-claim amounted to about [sterling]103 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The litigation was settled by an agreement under which Braehead agreed to pay Bovis [sterling]15 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">16 Bovis held a professional liability policy with Lumbermens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It made a claim on the policy following the settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Lumbermens refused to indemnify and bought proceedings for a declaration that it had no liability to indemnify under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Colman J upheld Lumbermens' argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He said that under a liability policy the insurer was not obliged to indemnify unless the liability of the insured was ascertained, in the case of the settlement, by the settlement agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Until the liability of the insured was ascertained the insured had no cause of action for an indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He said at [55]:
 
 ... a global settlement agreement of the nature of that found in the present case does not satisfy the requirement of ascertainment of loss under these liability insurance policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It does not impose on the assured any identifiable loss in respect of any identifiable insured eventuality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It merely identifies the overall price paid by the assured as consideration for a contract which conferred on the assured various different benefits including the dropping by Braehead of all claims in respect of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">

17 The facts of the instant case are distinguishable from those in Lumbermens .</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In Lumbermens it was not possible to determine from the settlement agreement whether any liability for mismanagement, the only liability which attracted indemnity, was part of the settlement sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Colman J described the position at [7] thus:
 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The method of calculation of that global sum was not identified in the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">In particular, there was no indication as to what extent if any Bovis's claim of [sterling]37,778,226 had been treated as validly in excess of [sterling]15 million or which if any of the many detailed elements of Braehead's counterclaim had been treated as valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Indeed, the terms of the Settlement Agreement gave no indication as to whether the parties agreed that there was any substance in any of the elements of Braehead's counterclaim that is to say whether there was any common position that the claim by Bovis fell to be reduced because it was partly intrinsically defective or because part of Braehead's counterclaim could be set off against Bovis's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Nor does it contain any indication as to whether any particular amount was paid to settle such part of the counterclaims as the Insurers could not dispute fell within the scope of the indemnity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">

18 In the present case the settlement agreement provided for CCAS to consent to orders that:
 
 
 (b) the Trustee pay the Applicants' costs of the Proceeding including reserved costs and costs of the amendments to the statement of claim, to be taxed on a party/party basis in default of agreement such costs to be paid forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">
 
 
 

Thus, in this case, the agreement itself specified the liability incurred by the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The agreement thereby ascertained the liability of CCAS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Hence, the lack of ascertainment of the liability incurred by the insured which was the reason for Colman J upholding Lumbermens' argument, does not exist in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Rather, the present controversy concerns the discharge by the settlement agreement of the liability of CCAS which was not covered by the indemnity provided by CGU.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">That liability, although not its amount, was obvious from the terms of the settlement agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">19 In any event, the principle formulated in Lumbermens has been the subject of controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">A little over a year after judgment in Lumbermens , Aikens J in Enterprise Oil Limited v Strand Insurance Company Ltd [2006] EWHC 58 (Comm) said at [166- 171]:
 
 Therefore, contrary to the view expressed by Colman J at paragraph 47 of his judgment in Lumbermen's , in my view those cases do not establish that it is a pre-condition for recovery under a liability policy that the insured has 'ascertained', by virtue of the wording of a judgment, or award or settlement agreement itself, the 'specific cost to the insured of discharging its insured liability'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In other words, in my view an insured does not have to show an amount of its loss to be claimed under an insured peril covered by the liability policy has been 'specifically ascertained' in the wording of a judgment, award or settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">I say this for two particular reasons, quite apart from the fact that neither case uses such language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">[original emphasis]
 
 The most important, if obvious, point is that an insurer always has the right to challenge whether the insured's right to indemnity under the policy has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Therefore it has the right to challenge whether the insured was, in fact and law, liable to the third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It has the right to challenge the quantum of the liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">And it must also have the right to challenge whether, on the facts of the case, the insured's liability to the third party is a loss within the scope of the liability policy, whatever is stated in a judgment, award or settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Apart from anything else, the insurer will not be a party to the judgment, award or settlement, unless specifically involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">I accept that in the case of judgments and awards, the conclusion of a competent tribunal on the merits as to liability and quantum is unlikely to be upset in an action on the liability policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">But I cannot see why, in principle, it should not be challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In the case of settlements, Colman J himself specifically accepted that an insurer is not bound by a settlement agreement between the insured and the third party as to liability, or quantum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">However, Colman J draws a distinction between two functions of 'ascertainment' by judgment, award or settlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">He describes one function as a 'source of evidence' as to liability and quantum of the insured to the third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">He says that cases affirming an insurer's right to challenge issues of liability and quantum in a settlement agreement are concerned only with that function of 'ascertainment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">
 But he states that the primary function of 'ascertainment' is to identify and 'thereby represent the assured's loss attributable to the relevant liability'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I cannot find that function identified in any of the cases to which Colman J refers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Moreover, it seems to me wrong in principle for the reason that I have already given, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">that a judgment, award or settlement between an insured and a third party is not concerned to 'ascertain' the loss of the insured under a liability policy; it is irrelevant to those parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">I accept that if the insured has negotiated a settlement which identifies certain heads of claim as being referable to certain causes of action that are within the perils insured under the insured's liability policy, then that will be evidence that the insured has suffered a loss that is covered by the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">But, as the case of MDIS Ltd v Swinbank shows, that can be challenged by underwriters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">If it is challenged, then the question of whether there has been a loss covered by the policy terms will be decided on evidence that is extrinsic to the settlement agreement itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">If that exercise is permissible, which it must be, then I cannot see the basis for saying that an insured has no cause of action against a liability insurer unless it can demonstrate that there was a pre-existing determination, in the settlement agreement itself, of the precise amount of its liability to a third party that is attributable to a peril insured under the liability policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Therefore, on principle, I think that it is open to an insured to assert and prove, by extrinsic evidence, that it is liable to a third party for a particular sum under a settlement that has been made and that the particular sum represents a loss covered by an insured peril under the liability policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Equally, if an insured had made a settlement which purported to identify a particular sum as representing the quantum of liability for a particular type of loss that equated to an insured peril under the liability policy, the insurer would be free to challenge the insured's liability to the third party, the quantum of the liability and whether the particular liability identified in the settlement did, in fact, constitute a loss covered by an insured peril under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">

These comments are obiter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Nevertheless they were adopted by Morrison J, also in obiter, in AIG Europe (Ireland) Limited v Faraday Capital Limited [2006] EWCH 2707 (Comm) at [69].</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">20 In the event that I am wrong in my view that Lumbermens is distinguishable, I would find the criticism of that case by Aikens J compelling and prefer the approach adopted by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I would apply it in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The result would be to permit CCAS to lead evidence of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS in order to establish that the settlement agreement included a liability which attracted the indemnity provided by CGU and was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">21 It follows from the above reasoning that CCAS has leave to reopen its case to establish that part of the settlement which represents the reasonable costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, and, hence, the amount of the indemnity which CGU has contracted to provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">THE REASONABLENESS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AS TO COSTS 
 
22 Ms Dealehr has been a legal costs consultant for nearly 20 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">She has had extensive experience in the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">When the consent order was made on 18 November 2003 consequent upon the settlement of the applicants' claims, Ms Dealehr was engaged by the applicants' solicitors to prepare the bill of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">She spent a month in the offices of the applicants' solicitors for the purpose and had access to their files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The bill which she produced was 353 pages long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It itemised each step in the litigation with detailed notation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The bill contained just over 2,300 separate items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">They were recorded after consideration of the material in the files of the applicants' solicitors and this recording was done approximately at the time when Ms Dealehr considered that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">23 There was no need to apportion the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS in this original bill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The order of the Court governed the way in which the bill was drawn, namely, to show the total amount of the applicants' costs of suing all the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">24 For the purpose of this stage of the case Ms Dealehr revisited the bill of costs in early 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">She swore several affidavits which described the exercise she undertook in order to extract from the original bill the costs separately attributable to the applicants suing each of the respondents and the common costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">She then reduced these costs by the percentage which reflected the difference between the amount of the original costs, namely $566,629.96 and the agreed figure of costs of $450,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The final division of the original bill of costs was:
 CCAS $118,767.18 Lawson &amp; Twomey $94, 493.63 AIMS $45,982.57 Common Costs $307,386.58 TOTAL $566,629.96 
25 In her examination and cross-examination, Ms Dealehr displayed a clear recollection of the detail of the material upon which the original bill was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">To the extent that this factual basis is relevant to the present issues, I am confident that Ms Dealehr's evidence is reliable even though about two years have passed since she drew the original bill of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">26 CGU challenged the methodology used by Ms Dealehr in apportioning the separate costs between the respondents in particular in two areas, namely in relation to the costs of perusals and in relation to the costs of the pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The two major challenges were justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">27 The total costs allowed in the original bill for instructions for brief (excluding disbursements) was $312,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">This is that portion of the total costs of $566,629.96 which relates to the costs of the applicants' solicitors dealing with the applicants' side of the case as distinct from their dealing with the parties on the opposite side of the record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Most of the costs of instructions for brief relate to the perusals by the applicants' solicitors of documents discovered by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Ms Dealehr divided the instructions for brief so that $78,046 was attributed to CCAS, $78,277 to Lawson &amp; Twomey, whilst only $14,302 was attributed to AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The reason for this allocation was that CCAS on the one hand and Lawson and Twomey on the other hand provided discovered documents to the applicants first and those documents were perused by the applicants' solicitors before they received any documents from AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Afterwards AIMS provided far fewer documents and these were perused separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The costs of the first perusal were divided equally between CCAS on the one hand and Lawson and Twomey on the other because the documents came from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">But this approach paid no regard to the fact that most of the documents produced by the respondents were relevant to the claims against all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I find that the proper allocation of the costs of perusal for the discovered documents was an equal allocation between the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It is appropriate to treat Lawson and Twomey as one because they were represented by one solicitor and the case against them was almost the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">28 Similarly, in relation to the costs of the pleadings, Ms Dealehr failed to make sufficient allowance for the portion of those costs attributable to the applicants suing AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Initially she allocated the costs of pleadings to common costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">On reconsideration shortly prior to trial, she allowed 25% of these costs as common costs, 50% in relation to the claim against CCAS, 15% in relation to the claim against Lawson and Twomey and 10% in relation to the claim against AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In cross examination Ms Dealehr was pressed with the competing view that this allocation did not properly reflect the fact that a large number of the allegations in the statement of claim were made against AIMS and that AIMS contested most allegations made against it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">I accept CGU's criticism of Ms Dealehr's methodology in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">29 The point which CGU sought to make from these challenges to Ms Dealehr's methodology was that the methodology was so unreliable that it could not support a fair calculation of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">In support of this case, Ms Hedstrom gave evidence for CGU that it was extremely difficult to determine the separate costs of suing each respondent from the bill drawn in the form of this bill which did not separate the costs of suing the separate respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">30 Whilst I accept that ordinarily this would be an extremely difficult task, in view of Ms Dealehr's familiarity with the items in the bill and the material which explained it, there is a basis from which the Court is able to form an impression of the appropriate allocation of these costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">I am left with the impression that Ms Dealehr's calculations had some tendency to favour minimising the costs of the applicants attributable to suing AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Overall, taking into account the two major challenges made by CGU and several less important challenges, I find that the costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, apart from common costs, amounts to two thirds of the separate costs of the applicants suing the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">31 There remains the question of the common costs identified by Ms Dealehr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">There is a defensible argument that CGU should bear all of the common costs because those costs would have been incurred even if AIMS had not been sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">There is an opposite defensible argument that CGU should not bear any of the common costs because they would all have been incurred if AIMS alone had been sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">But neither of these alternatives reflects a reasonable view of the actual circumstances in which the applicants sued all the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">It is possible for the Court to allocate the common costs in a reasonable way on the basis of an impression of the work done and difficulty encountered in conducting the case against each of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">A reasonable division in the circumstances of this case is equality between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Again, it is appropriate to treat Lawson and Twomey as one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">A reasonable division then would be to divide the common costs three ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">32 Thus, taking into account both the separate costs and the common costs the reasonable costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS is two thirds of the $450,000 settlement figure namely $300,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">THE ONUS OF PROOF SUBMISSIONS 
 
33 It is desirable to address some submissions advanced by CCAS which may be relevant if I am wrong to have allowed CCAS to reopen its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">34 At [90] to [92] of the reasons for judgment delivered on 6 January 2006 it was determined, prior to the admission of any further evidence on the reopened case, that CCAS had not established that the settlement in relation to the applicants' costs of suing the respondents other than AIMS was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The question then is what consequence would follow from this determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">35 As I understood the argument, CCAS contended that it was immaterial whether CCAS failed to establish that the settlement was reasonable because the onus of proof lay on CGU to demonstrate that the settlement was not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">As CGU had not done so prior to the application to reopen, there should be judgment for CCAS on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">36 Where an insured claims indemnity from an insurer for liability to a third party based on a settlement of that liability with the third party, the insured is entitled to indemnity if the settlement is reasonable: Unity Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd v Rocco Pezzano Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 38 ; (1998) 192 CLR 603 ( Unity Brokers ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Counsel for CCAS seemed to argue that the insured need only establish that the settlement was concluded and then the onus shifts to the insurer to establish that the settlement was not reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The argument appears wrong on its face because the reasonableness of the settlement is a critical part of the case to be made by the insured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">It is a necessary element of its claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Furthermore, it depends on information which is normally within the knowledge of the insured and outside the knowledge of the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">However, counsel for CCAS submitted that the proposition was supported by the majority decision in BNP Paribas v Pacific Carriers Ltd [2005] NSWCA 72.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">He relied on [263] in the judgment of Giles JA, with whom Sheller JA agreed, as follows:
 
 In the present case a reasonable settlement was foreseeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The burden was on BNP [the indemnifier] to prove the level at which it became unreasonable for PCL [the claimant for indemnity] to fail to settle the London arbitration, but on the view that I have taken on the basis that Bolton was likely to fail in the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The level is less than the settlement in fact reached, and on the incomplete evidence is something to be arrived at in a fairly broad manner; there being a loss, the court must do its best.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In my opinion, PCL could reasonably have settled the London arbitration for a sum up to the order of seventy per cent of SSOE's claims, in round terms $US2,000,000 plus interest should replace the $2,900,000 plus interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">(explanation added)
 

37 However, this paragraph is the second half of a two part story.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">At [249] in reliance on Unity Brokers , Giles JA, with whom Sheller JA again agreed, said:
 
 PCL had the burden of establishing that the settlement of the London arbitration was reasonable;
 

38 Many other references in the judgment demonstrate that their Honours regarded the onus of establishing that the settlement was reasonable was an onus which lay on the claimant; see, for example, [183], [184], [187].</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">And, in a separate judgment, Handley JA took the same approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">For instance at [14] he said:
 
 The judgments in Unity Brokers confirm that the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that the settlement was reasonable ...
 

And at [17] he said:
 
 A party relying on a settlement as proof of his loss has the onus of proving that it was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">

39 It follows that CCAS carried the onus of establishing that the settlement as to costs was reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Prior to reopening it had not done so: see [90] to [92] in the reasons for judgment of 6 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">On the contrary, the evidence relied upon by CCAS itself established that the settlement as to costs was not reasonable because it included an obligation to pay the costs of the applicants of suing AIMS and that liability was not one against which CGU was bound to indemnify CCAS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Further, at that point, CCAS had not led evidence which would have allowed the Court to determine, even on a robust approach, the amount of the settlement which represented the applicants' costs of suing the respondents other than AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Indeed, prior to the evidence of the quantum of the costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, counsel for CCAS urged the Court to conclude that those costs were insignificant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">When, later, the affidavit of Ms Dealehr was filed, it became clear that those costs according to CCAS amounted to more than $30,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">That amount is not insignificant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">And, after full consideration of all the evidence called on the reopened case, I have concluded a much less insignificant figure, namely, $150,000, represents the costs of the applicants suing AIMS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Consequently, if CCAS were not permitted to reopen its case, it would have failed to discharge its onus and judgment would be given for CGU on this aspect of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">CONCLUSION 
 
40 The parties are by 18 July 2007 to bring in short minutes of orders reflecting the conclusions reached in the reasons of judgment delivered on 6 January 2006, and these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
