 Introduction 
 
1 Merlin BV is a company incorporated in Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It is apparently a not-for-profit company which was established in 2007 to operate as a non-exclusive licensing agency, and to protect the intellectual property of independent record labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">It currently represents over 10,000 record labels from around the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 By a Notice of Motion filed 2 April 2008 Merlin seeks orders under O 46 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules for leave to inspect and copy a large number of documents on the Court file in respect of proceedings in the matter of Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 65 IPR 289.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Those proceedings are commonly known as "the Kazaa proceedings" which are said to have been the largest copyright case ever brought before an Australian court, and amongst the largest intellectual property cases in the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 The Notice of Motion as originally filed sought access to an extraordinarily wide range of material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It appears on its face to extend to almost every document in the now defunct court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However, Merlin subsequently confined the application in a way that I will refer to later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Even then, the application seeks a large body of material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">5 Merlin's application was opposed by a number of parties to the Kazaa proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The principal opponents were a number of record companies in the EMI, Sony BMG, Universal and Warner Groups ("the Record Companies") who were applicants in the Kazaa proceedings and by the sixth to ninth respondents in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The sixth to ninth respondents are referred to as the "Altnet Respondents".</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 The application raises an important question of principle which does not seem to have been dealt with in any earlier authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Although Dr Bell invoked the principle of open justice, referred to in cases such as Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 225 ALR 256 , ultimately he put the application on the footing that it was for access to justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 The purpose for which Merlin seeks access to the documents is to obtain information concerning possible infringements of its members' copyright in the same period as was covered by the Kazaa proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Merlin seeks to obtain evidence of copyright infringement by the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings, by the same conduct as was in issue in those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">8 The essential issue which arises is whether a non-party ought to be given access to a defunct court file in order to gather evidence for a case it (or, more accurately, some of its members) may wish to bring against the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings in circumstances in which the non-party cannot satisfy the requirements for an order for preliminary discovery under O 15A of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">9 A number of discretionary considerations are raised by the Record Companies and the Altnet Respondents including delay, prejudice and the failure of Merlin to offer any of the protections, including compensation, as would be provided by an application under O 15A, or upon the service of a subpoena.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Kazaa Proceedings 
 
10 The Kazaa proceedings were commenced by way of the largest number of Anton Pillar orders ever made in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">There were simultaneous raids on twelve locations in three states of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">At the time of the execution of the Anton Pillar orders, sixty members of the firm of solicitors representing the Record Companies and associated applicants were engaged in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">11 The Kazaa proceedings concerned copyright infringement by the respondents in 98 specified sound recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">When the proceedings were commenced, other sound recordings were included in the claim but the proceedings were ultimately confined to the number referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">12 Sixty one affidavits, many of them lengthy, made by 34 witnesses, were read at the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Seventeen witnesses gave oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The trial judge, Wilcox J, observed that whilst an enormous quantity of evidence was tendered, little of it was the subject of objection by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 The judgment of Wilcox J was handed down on 5 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">His Honour found that each of the 98 recordings had been able to be downloaded, and had been downloaded, through the file-sharing facility of the Kazaa system: Universal Music v Sharman at [17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">His Honour also found at [181] that a major use of the Kazaa system was the transmission of copyright material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">At [186], Wilcox J made a finding that the Kazaa file sharing system:
 
 ... necessarily involved copyright infringement on a massive scale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 

14 His Honour's findings were expressed in summary form in [194] as follows:
 
 In short, I find that all the respondents knew the predominant use of Kazaa was for the sharing of copyright-infringing material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">None of them had an interest to prevent or curtail that predominant use; if anything, the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Each of the respondents was at least acquiescent in the use of Kazaa for copyright-infringing activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 

15 Following his Honour's orders, Sharman Networks Ltd, the second respondent in the Kazaa proceedings agreed to pay US$115 million to the Record Companies and movie studios who had brought the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 An appeal was lodged against his Honour's judgment but the proceedings were apparently settled in about August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The documents sought 
 
17 In an affidavit sworn in support of Merlin's application by Ms Julie Robb, solicitor, on 15 April 2007, the deponent refers to inspections that have so far been made by her firm of documents on the Court file that are publicly available under O 46 r 6(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">18 Ms Robb goes on to say that as a result of those inspections, and her reading of the judgment of Wilcox J, eight documents or classes of documents:
 
 may contain information that Merlin seeks in order to prosecute its members' claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 

19 The eight documents or classes are as follows:
 
(a) affidavit of Anthony Johnsen dated 29 September 2004;
 
(b) affidavit of Philip Morle dated 24 November 2004;
 
(c) the digital music files produced by Mr Morle as part of the discovery process, whether in the form that existed on the computers at his premises, or in the form they had been recovered by the forensic technician;
 
(d) the digital music files produced by the Sharman parties as part of the discovery process;
 
(e) affidavit of Tom Mizzone sworn 1 December 2004;
 
(f) all affidavits of Ms Ball of Gilbert + Tobin concerning the evidence of specific infringements collected by her;
 
(g) the digital music files collected from university campuses on the execution of Anton Piller orders on 6 February 2004 copied by Mr Lyons from computers at the offices of Baker &amp; McKenzie; and
 
(h) all affidavits of Mr Lyons related or referring to this material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">20 Ms Robb also says in her affidavit that she believes any method other than access under O 46 r 6 would be attended by significantly greater cost and difficulty, including costs to be incurred by third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">She goes on to say:
 
 I have considered whether Merlin could commence proceedings for preliminary discovery under Order 15A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">However, I am concerned that, without access to the material it presently seeks, Merlin cannot identify which of its members would be the proper applicants to such proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 

21 However, the documents sought on the application were further narrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The documents were described in Exhibit A1 in this application as follows:
 
 
 (a) all affidavits and exhibits identified in paragraph 24(a), (b), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Mr Williams' affidavit [sworn 17 April 2008]; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the digital music files referred to in paragraph 24(d) of Mr Williams' affidavit; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the "Applicants' Main Tender Bundle", the index to which is reproduced at pages 42 to 60 of Exhibit MJW-1A to Mr Williams' affidavit; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the appeal books filed in the appeal from the Main Proceedings; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) the transcripts of the Main Proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 
 

22 For convenience, I will reproduce the paragraphs of Mr Williams' affidavit listed in Exhibit A1 as follows: 
 
 
 (a) Affidavit of Johnson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The body of affidavit makes no reference to any recordings by the artists set out at paragraph 2.6 of Ms Robb's affidavit sworn 15 April 2008 ( Merlin Artists).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">There are 4 references in Exhibit AEJ-1 to recordings by the Merlin Artists (pages 5, 8 and 16).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 (b) Affidavit of Phil Morle .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The body of the affidavit makes no reference to any recordings by the Merlin Artists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Exhibit PDFM-1 contains lists of the files that were discovered by Mr Morle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There are 43 references to recordings by the Merlin Artists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 


 ... 

 
 
 (d) Digital music files discovered by the Sharman respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Sharman discovered 2 recordings by the Merlin Artists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) Affidavit of Tom Mizzone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The body of the affidavit of [sic] makes no reference to any recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">There are also no references to the Merlin Artists in Exhibit TM-2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In the time available the Record Companies have not be [sic] able to review Exhibit TM-3 to determine whether there are any recordings by any of the Merlin Artists in Exhibit TM-3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) Affidavits of Ball.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The body of the affidavit of Elise Ball sworn 27 January 2004 makes no reference to any recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">There are 9 references to Merlin Artists on a screenshot which is contained on page 36 of Exhibit EEB-3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) Digital music files seized from the Universities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">These will not be on the Court file because the seized information was held by the independent solicitor following the execution of the orders and subsequently a limited class of data relating to the case brought by the Record Companies was extracted by a computer forensic expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Of the extracted files, there are only 2 references to one of the Merlin Artists (Billy Bragg) that appear on Exhibit NJC-3 to the affidavit of Nigel Carson sworn 12 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 
 
 
 
 (h) Affidavits of Mr Lyons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The bodies of the affidavits make no reference to any recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">There are no references in the non-confidential exhibits to Mr Lyons' affidavits to any recordings by any of the Merlin Artists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 


 
23 According to Merlin's written submissions, the key information which is sought through the current applications is as follows:
 
 
 &#8226; Results of searches conducted between June and September 2004 of works in the ARIA top 50 or 100 most popular records which had been made available for file sharing and downloading by Kazaa members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">At least some of these results are contained in affidavits of Mr Ellis [filed in the Kazaa proceedings] : Judgment [64] --- [66], Robb 5.7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">This information was publicly available and non-confidential when gathered by Mr Ellis, but cannot now be replicated; 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; Data images of music downloads which Merlin understands the Applicants deployed [in the Kazaa proceeding] for the relevant period of alleged infringement and which would be likely to evidence "downloading" of sound recordings owned by Merlin members: Sharman Judgment [237] --- [242] and Robb 5.10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Although the witness Mr Mizzone was concerned about the confidentiality of the technical means deployed to gather this data, the data itself and the results of his inquiries were in an open affidavit: Judgment [238].</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
 
 
 

 Order 46 rule 6 
 
24 I do not propose to reproduce the text of O 46 r 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It is sufficient to say that this Rule regulates the extent to which a non-party can have unfettered access to documents contained in Court files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It does so by drawing a distinction between specified classes of documents which may be inspected without prior leave of the Court and other specified categories which a non-party "must not inspect" except with leave of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">25 The first types of document are listed in O 46 r 6(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The second are listed in 
O 46 r 6(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The documents in the first class include pleadings and written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Even then, access is subject to some restriction because the document may be inspected unless the Court or a Judge has ordered that it is confidential: O 46 r 6(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">26 The documents which fall into the second class include affidavits and unsworn statements of evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">27 Except with the leave of the Court or a Judge, or other permission as prescribed in 
O 46 r 6(4), a non-party must not inspect a document that is not referred to in sub-rule (2) or (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Thus, documents such as tender bundles and other exhibits may only be inspected with leave under this sub-rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">28 Special provision is made for access to transcripts of proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Transcripts may not be inspected except with leave: O 46 r 6(8).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">29 A non-party may only copy a document that has been produced for inspection if the Registrar gives permission to do so and the person pays the prescribed fee: O 46 r 6(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The relevant principles 
 
30 With the exception of one authority to which I will refer later, the principles which govern the exercise of the discretion to grant access by a non-party under O 46 r 6 are to be found in cases dealing with applications by media organisations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">31 This is hardly surprising because the principle which informs the exercise of the power is that of open justice, the underlying rationale being the belief that exposure to public scrutiny is the surest safeguard against abuse of power of the courts: see Seven Network at [21]ff; Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 2) (2006) 232 ALR 398 at [16]ff; Rich v Harrington (2007) 99 ALD 297 at [17]ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">32 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 3) [2002] FCA 609 , Finkelstein J said at [7] that the proper approach is that access should be allowed unless the interests of justice require a different course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">His Honour went on to say that there is a strong presumption in favour of allowing any member of the public who wishes to do so to inspect any document or thing that is put into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">33 Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the abovementioned statements of principle by Finkelstein J: Seven Network at [25].</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">However, I do not think it follows that the principle is as broad as was submitted by Dr Bell SC for Merlin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Dr Bell's submission was that, at least with respect to documents which have been admitted into evidence, exceptional circumstances are required for an application under O 46 r 6(3) to be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It is also true that Sackville J has expressed his agreement with the passage of the judgment; Seven Network at [25]; see also Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations [2006] FCA 606 at [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">35 As Sackville J observed in Seven Network at [24], O 46 r 6 does not confer a right on a non-party to obtain access to documents admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Leave from the Court is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">His Honour referred with approval to the statement made by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512 at [29] that open justice is a principle, not a "freestanding right".</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">36 The guiding principle seems to me to be as stated by Sackville J in Seven Network at [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">His Honour there said that, unless the interests of justice require otherwise, the Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">37 Sackville J went on at [27] to make the important point that in each application the Court will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">A convenient "touchstone" will be whether the documents have been admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Access to that material:
 
 ... can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate, the court's determination of the issues arising in the proceedings : see Seven Network at [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">

38 This was the view taken by French J in Richstar at [18] where his Honour agreed with the observations of Sackville J in Seven Network to which I have referred in the two preceding paragraphs of my judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">So too did Branson J in Rich v Harrington at [23].</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Her Honour said that this approach recognises that the discretion under O 46 r 6 must be exercised having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">39 Branson J went on to say at [24] that where a non-party seeks access to material which has been relied upon by a judge, the proper approach tends more strongly in favour of public disclosure; access should be allowed save where the interests of justice require a different course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">That is not identical with the exceptional circumstances test stated by Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">40 ACCC v ABB is the only Australian authority to which I have referred in which access was granted to a non-party who was not a media organisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The applicant was a non-party who sought access to a statement of agreed facts and joint submissions of the parties in proceedings brought by the Commission against a company and its executives for civil penalties for contravention of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act 1 974 (Cth): see ACCC v ABB at [1].</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The applicant sought access to those documents to determine whether it should bring an action to recover losses suffered as a consequence of the admitted breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">41 The extension of the principle of open justice to those circumstances is perfectly understandable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Commission's proceedings were brought in the public interest and parties affected by the contravention ought to be given access to determine whether a private action for damages caused by the contravention would be justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The documents sought were confined in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The applicant did not seek to trawl willy-nilly through the court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">42 The question of whether access should be granted to Merlin arises in different circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The authorities to which I have referred indicate, in my view, that the discretion is one to be exercised in the interests of justice, having regard to all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">43 Where leave is sought to inspect documents that have not been read in open court, or at least tendered in evidence and considered by the judge as evidence or submission, the rule in my opinion is that leave will ordinarily be refused to inspect that material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This approach is consistent with that suggested by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio Network Pty Ltd v ABA [2002] FCA 1408 at [21] ; cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">ACCC v ABB at [6].</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">44 It is true, as Finkelstein J said in ACCC v ABB at [6] that O 46 r 6(3) does not distinguish between documents that have been admitted into evidence and those which have not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">But as Santow J observed in eisa Ltd v Brady [2000] NSWSC 929 , there is a risk of serious injustice if untested allegations can be published to the world at large: cited in Macquarie Radio Network at [21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">English authorities 
 
45 In Dobson v Hastings [1992] Ch 394 at 401-402, Sir Donald Nicholls VC considered that the Rules of the Supreme Court indicate that save when permitted under the rules, documents on the court file are not intended to be inspected or copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He said that:
 
 ... a court file is not a publicly available register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It is a file maintained by the court for the proper conduct of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Access to that file is restricted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Non-parties have a right of access to the extent, but only to the extent, provided in the rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 

46 It seems to me that these observations are equally applicable to the scheme established under O 46 r 6, as construed in authorities such as Seven Network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">
 
47 In GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd v Liverpool and London Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 984 at 995, Potter LJ said that when evidence, including court bundles, are read out in court they "enter the public domain" and a member of the press or public may quote from the document:
 
 ... but the right of access to it for the purposes of further use or information depends upon that person's ability to obtain a copy of the document from one of the parties or by other lawful means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">
 

48 Nevertheless, the approach taken by his Lordship was not as narrow as this passage might suggest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">FAI General Insurance Co Ltd sought access to counsel's written submissions in the proceedings to identify documents that might be the subject of a subpoena in parallel litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">His Lordship at 996 regarded this as a legitimate purpose for the grant of access to the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">49 In Dian AO v Davis Frankel &amp; Mead (a firm) [2005] 1 All ER 1074, a non-party applied to the court for permission to inspect and copy the court file in proceedings which had been concluded by compromise some eight years earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The non-party made the application in the hope of obtaining information which would be of use to it in litigation which was on foot in the British Virgin Islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">50 Moore-Bick J granted access to affidavits and pleadings notwithstanding the substantial delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Of course, he did so under the relevant English rules of court but a number of his observations are in my view applicable to the regime established under O 46 r 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">51 First, the principle of open justice is primarily concerned with monitoring the decision-making process as it takes place, not with reviewing the process long after the event: Dian at [30].</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">52 Second, an application for permission to use the court file as a source of potentially useful information to assist in other litigation does not engage the principle of open justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nevertheless, one consequence of the application of the principle of open justice is that persons who are present in Court may obtain access to information that they may be able to use to their advantage in other litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">But this is merely a consequence of doing justice in public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It is not one of its primary objects: Dian at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">53 Third, the rules do not contemplate permission to inspect the file as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The documents which an applicant wishes to inspect must be identified with reasonable precision: Dian at [32].</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Home Office v Harman 
 
54 There is an implied undertaking by parties to litigation that documents produced by one party to another in the course of discovery will not be used for any purpose other than in relation to the litigation: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10 at 32 (per Mason CJ), citing inter alia Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] 1 AC 280 (" Home Office v Harman ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">55 The effect of O 15 r 18 of the Federal Court Rules is to abrogate this principle insofar as it would apply to a document after it has been read to or by the Court or referred to in open court in such terms and to disclose its contents, unless the Court otherwise orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">56 Nevertheless, the implied undertaking continues to apply to documents produced on discovery; it also applies to witness statements, affidavits and other documents produced by one side to the other for the purposes of the litigation: Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Limited (1992) 38 FCR 217 at 221-223 (per Wilcox J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">57 Leave of the court to be released from the undertaking in order to use the documents in other proceedings will only be granted in "special circumstances"; they include the nature of the document, the absence of prejudice to the author and the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in the second proceeding: Springfield Nominees at 225.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">58 What underlies the implied undertaking not to use documents obtained in the course of litigation except for the purpose of that proceeding is that a party ought not to use an advantage obtained for the limited purpose of the litigation for a collateral or ulterior purpose: Home Office v Harman at 302 per Lord Diplock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">59 In his speech in Home Office v Harman , Lord Diplock referred at 303 to the inevitable side effect of administering justice in open court and the corollary that persons present in court may use documents that are read out in court for purposes other than the attainment of justice in the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The observations of Moore-Bick J in Dian at [31] are to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">60 It seems to me to follow from Home Office v Harman that although non-parties are not subject to the implied undertaking, they are subject to the same type of restriction in relation to documents that have not been read in open court, or at least considered by the judge as evidence or submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">After all, why should a non-party, by the side-wind of access to a court file, be free from the constraint which applies to the persons who supplied the contents of the file?</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">61 It also seems to me that this restriction informs the requirement of leave to inspect the categories of documents referred to in O 46 r 6(3) and the approach taken in the authorities which draw a distinction between access to documents admitted into evidence and those which are not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Whether Merlin ought to be granted leave 
 
62 Merlin seeks leave to inspect and copy a large volume of specified documents, only some of which appear to have been admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">63 Although Sackville J said in Seven Network at [27] that a convenient "touchstone" for the grant of access is whether the material has been admitted into evidence, the effect of his Honour's judgment is that this is a general rule which will serve the interests of open justice; but all the circumstances must be considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">64 Here, the application is not made in furtherance of the principle of open justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">It uses, as a springboard, the corollary to which Moore-Bick J referred in Dian , namely that persons present during a court hearing may learn of information they can use to their advantage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">But in truth it goes further because it seeks "access to justice" based upon the modern approach to commercial litigation with its emphasis upon creation, and preservation of large volumes of written material, much of which is not read out in open court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Finkelstein J referred to this in ACCC v ABB at [4] --- [5].</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">65 The difficulty with Merlin's application is that, even in its modified form, it is not confined to affidavits which were admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It extends to discovery documents and files obtained on the execution of Anton Piller orders, which do not appear to form part of the court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">66 All of the documents referred to in O 46 r 6(2) and (3) are documents which are typically filed in the Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Order 46 r 6(4) and (5) deal with other documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">67 In my view, the prohibition against a non-party inspecting exhibits, tender bundles and other documents which may be located in the Registry is covered by O 46 r 6(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">They fall within the expression in that sub-rule "any document in the proceeding that is not referred to in sub-rule (2) or (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">" Access may only be granted with leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">68 It seems to me that the distinction drawn in O 46 r 6(4) recognises that access may be sought to documents which are not filed or lodged with the Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Typically, these documents will be exhibits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Access may be sought while they are in the Registry, but ordinarily they will only remain there during the course of the trial and for a period of 21 days after judgment, that is to say after the appeal period has expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">69 The usual practice used to be for the court to order that exhibits may be returned after the expiration of the appeal period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">No doubt this was done in recognition of the fact that exhibits are the property of the party who tendered them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It is not the function of the Registry to preserve exhibits long after the expiry of appeal periods or after appeal books have been prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">70 I have not been able to determine whether an order for the return of exhibits was made in the Kazaa proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">But even if it were not, I would not be prepared to grant access to documents, other than affidavits or documents falling within O 46 r 6(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">This is because the exhibits and other documents are the property of the parties who tendered them, in proceedings now long since defunct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">If they are still present in the Registry, this is only because the Registry has failed to return documents no longer required for the proper purpose of the functions of the Court: see [45] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">71 Nor is "access to justice" an appropriate gateway for an application to exhibits, discovery documents and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The Court has ample power to order pre-trial discovery under O 15A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Ms Robb has acknowledged that Merlin may have difficulty in making an application under that Rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">72 It seems to me that the appropriate exercise of my discretion in the present case is to order access to the affidavits identified by Merlin but not to the other documents: see [21](a) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Access will be granted only to the body of the affidavits because the exhibits remain the property of the parties for the reasons mentioned above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Access will not be granted to those parts of the affidavits which were not read, or to which objection was upheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">73 This seems to me to be consistent with the approach taken by Cowdroy J in Churche v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (No 3) [2006] FCA 1168 at [26] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">His Honour granted access to affidavits admitted into evidence, but access was otherwise refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Access was granted to annexures but they form part of the affidavit and are to be distinguished from exhibits in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">74 Dr Bell pointed to [64] --- [66] of the judgment of Wilcox J in which his Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Johnsen, stating that it contained evidence of routine downloading of ARIA Top 50 and Top 100 recordings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Dr Bell referred me to the decision of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [30] to support the proposition that access to the exhibits to the affidavits ought to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">But the observations of Heerey J in Dawson Nominees v Multiplex are not a charter for access to documents by non-parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">His Honour's remarks were made in the context of existing proceedings where the documents had potential relevance to the issues in the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">75 So too in Dian , the documents were sought for the purpose of obtaining information of potential use in litigation that was already on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It was not to determine whether a case may be launched, and if so, by whom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">76 Mr Cobden submitted that I ought not to grant access to Ms Ball's affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">It is true that Ms Ball made copies of sound recordings in circumstances in which she obtained the protection of s 104 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">However, I do not think that the grant of access to those parts of her affidavit which were read in evidence would put her in breach of that provision, or in breach of the implied undertakings pursuant to which she obtained and used the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">77 I will not allow access to the digital music files discovered by the Sharman respondents, or to the digital files seized from the universities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">They are not part of the Court file and they do not appear to have been admitted into evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Particular caution is required before granting access to this class of documents: Re Bond; Ex parte Hongkong Bank [1999] FCA 403 at [4] (per Hely J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">78 The "Applicant's' Main Tender Bundle" may have been admitted into evidence but it was a compilation of exhibits and is therefore covered by what I said above about the property in those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">79 The same approach is applicable to the appeal books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Access will be obtained by Merlin to the body of the affidavits but the balance of the appeal books (other than pleadings and other documents otherwise available under O 46 r 6(2)) merely reproduce exhibits and transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">80 I will grant access to the transcript but will not permit photocopying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">81 I recognise that there are references in some of the exhibits mentioned above to recordings made by Merlin artists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">But these references were apparently to matters which did not form part of the subject matter of the Kazaa proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">I do not see that open justice requires access to those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Nor does "access to justice" support it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">82 Finally, I have considered the submission that access ought to be refused to any of the documents on the ground of delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">One of the parties submitted that the delay would cause prejudice to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">This would appear to be based upon the difficulty of meeting claims of copyright infringement arising from evidence about the downloading of material some four years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">However, I do not think that the suggestion of prejudice was supported by evidence which would justify the refusal of access to affidavits that were admitted into evidence or to the transcript of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">83 The parties are to bring in short minutes reflecting my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">I will hear brief argument on costs and on conditions for access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">I certify that the preceding eighty-three (83) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
