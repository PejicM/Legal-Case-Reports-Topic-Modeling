<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 By a notice of motion dated 16 May 2006, Mr Barry Armitage applies to set aside certain orders made in this proceeding on 3 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The orders made on 3 February 2006 were as follows:
 

 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant prepare a bill of costs in respect of the motion, notice of which was filed on 4 August 2004, and such bill of costs be taxed by Registrar Bardsley at 10.15 am on 13 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The first and second respondents pay forthwith the applicant's costs of and incidental to the motion, notice of which was filed on 4 August 2004, on an indemnity basis, to be taxed pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">If the first and second respondents do not pay the applicant's taxed costs within 14 days from the date of service upon them of a certificate of taxation, then the applicant have leave to enter judgment against the first and second respondents for $334,000 and interest thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The motion, notice of which was filed on 4 August 2004, be otherwise dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">" 
 

2 At the hearing of the motion on 15 June 2006, Mr Armitage directed his challenge to paragraphs [2] and [3] of these orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In support of his motion, Mr Armitage relied on his affidavit sworn on 16 May 2006 (which referred to his earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">After the hearing, he filed a further affidavit sworn on 20 June 2006, and written submissions, both of which were filed pursuant to orders made on 15 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In opposition to the motion, the applicant relied on the affidavits of Anna Maria Krycer affirmed on 30 May 2006 and 9 June 2006, the affidavit of Ayten Demirovski affirmed on 30 May 2006, and on written submissions filed before and (pursuant to order) after the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
 
3 The orders of 3 February 2006 were made following the hearing, on various dates, of the applicant's motion for default judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The applicant's motion was based on what she claimed was a substantial history of delay by the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 Mr Armitage sought to appeal against the 3 February 2006 orders by way of a notice of appeal filed on 24 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His notice of appeal included the following ground of appeal (among others):
 
 "That the Appellant (Respondents) herein [sic] have been denied natural justice in that --- 
 
 
 (a) their legal representative was allowed to withdraw from the proceedings without them being given the opportunity to be heard 
 (b) they were not afforded an opportunity to be heard by the court following the withdrawal (without notice to them) of their legal representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">" 
 

At a directions hearing on 22 March 2006 before Ryan J, the respondent to the appeal (the applicant in the substantive proceeding) noted that Mr Armitage required leave to appeal and an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">His Honour made orders adjourning the date for settling the index until the Court dealt with any application for leave to appeal and, subsequently, he adjourned Mr Armitage's application for an extension of time, indicating that he considered that it might be appropriate for Mr Armitage to make an application in this proceeding pursuant to O 35 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 ("the Rules").</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Armitage's motion was filed following this indication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">THE REASONS FOR THE ORDERS OF 3 FEBRUARY 2006 
 
5 On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 (" Wu ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I found (at [52]-[53]) that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">My reasons for judgment record that:
 
&#8226; The applicant (hereafter referred to as Ms Wu) was required to bring an application to the Court for an order for substituted service as regards Mr Armitage ([7]-[8]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">&#8226; Ms Wu applied twice by motion for orders that the respondents, including Mr Armitage, provide their lists of documents and the respondents, including Mr Armitage, breached orders of 8 October 2003 and 16 December 2003 for the provision of these lists ([10]-[13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">From September 2003 until 14 April 2004, Mr Armitage and the other respondents retained a solicitor (Mr Joseph Guss) ([8] and [15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">&#8226; Mr Armitage failed to make documents available for inspection, despite orders by the Court on 8 October 2003, 16 December 2003 and 9 June 2004 ([10]-[17]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Following an order for further discovery on 4 March 2004, Mr Armitage filed an affidavit stating that the first respondent's accounts and statutory records were "mistakenly removed by a waste paper removalist with various other papers and records" and that he was unable to locate his file in respect of Ms Wu's application for an Australian visa and her alleged investment in the first respondent ([14]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">&#8226; After 14 April 2004, Ms Wu's solicitor's attempted to contact the respondents, including Mr Armitage directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">By a letter dated 21 April 2004, Mr Armitage informed Ms Wu's solicitors that he was "unable to facilitate" the inspection of the discovered documents because they were "located at the office of Joseph Guss" ([15]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">&#8226; On the first occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, counsel appeared for Mr Armitage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel advised that she was instructed by solicitors who expected to act in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This expectation was not fulfilled ([17]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">&#8226; On the second occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, different counsel appeared for Mr Armitage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Counsel advised that he was instructed by solicitors, who subsequently advised the Court that they were no longer retained to act for Mr Armitage (or any other respondent) in the proceeding ([19]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">&#8226; Although it was made clear in court on 13 October 2004 that it was open to the respondents to serve a subpoena on their previous solicitor (Mr Guss) to produce the discovered documents to the Court the respondents did not take steps to do this until 3 December 2004 ([19] and [21]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">&#8226; On 3 December 2004, George Liberogiannis and Associates went on record as solicitor for the Armitages, including Barry Armitage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Mr Liberogiannis did not, however, appear on the return of the subpoena.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The subpoena was not discharged against Mr Guss until 16 February 2005 ([21]-[22]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">&#8226; At the adjourned hearing of the motion for default judgment on 27 April 2005, Mr Liberogiannis sought leave to withdraw as the solicitor on the record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">His evidence was that Barry Armitage and his son had failed to keep appointments with counsel and to provide him with instructions for the conduct of the matter, notwithstanding his numerous calls to their cell phones and place of residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His firm filed a notice of ceasing to act for Barry Armitage and his son on 28 April 2005 ([24]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">7 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons stated in Wu at [54] and following, I declined to make orders in terms of the motion for default judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">At [54]-[55], I said:
 
 "I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">" 
 

8 I indicated that, having regard to these matters and the nature of the case, including the respondents' defence and supporting affidavits, the respondents should have a chance to defend themselves and that any prejudice to Ms Wu could be met by an appropriate costs order, subject to an entitlement to enter judgment in the event of non-compliance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">9 I ultimately held (at [60]) that Mr Armitage and the first respondent should pay costs on an indemnity basis because they had repeatedly failed to comply with the orders of this Court; and Ms Wu's motion for default judgment was precipitated by these recurring breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Further, I noted that their conduct had delayed the hearing of the motion and increased the costs associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In this regard, I referred to the last minute and short-term retainer of legal representatives, the failure to take steps promptly to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, and the failure to cooperate with their own legal advisers or to attend court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">SUBMISSIONS AND EVIDENCE 
 
10 Mr Armitage's earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri are mentioned in Wu at [27] and [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Mr Armitage's lengthy affidavit of 16 May 2006 deposes to matters of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It also contains what are in truth submissions on his motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Mr Armitage claimed (amongst other things):
 
&#8226; Mr Armitage was unable to collect his documents relating to this matter from previously retained counsel (Mr Dennis Baker) until 4 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">He had not previously seen some of these documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">&#8226; Prior to the hearing on 27 April 2005, Mr Armitage had no knowledge of the affidavit of Anna Maria Krycer of 12 April 2005; that Mr Lieberogiannis intended to seek leave to withdraw from the proceeding; and that he would be unrepresented at that hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">He claimed that he was denied an opportunity to respond to Ms Krycer's affidavit and Mr Lieberogiannis' evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">&#8226; After receiving a copy of the 27 April 2005 order (granting leave to Mr Lieberogiannis to cease to act) Mr Armitage asked Registry "what was happening with the proceedings" and was told that "no other date had been appointed, and that it appeared that there was no further action or procedure contemplated".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">He returned to the Registry on two further occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">He assumed the action was not proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">&#8226; When the respondents retained Mr Guss, they gave Mr Guss all relevant documents and did not retain any copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In early April 2004, there was a dispute between Mr Guss and Mr Armitage (and other respondents), as a consequence of which Mr Guss ceased to act for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Mr Guss claimed a lien over the respondents' documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Mr Armitage photocopied the documents on the Court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">&#8226; After Mr Guss ceased to act, the respondents decided to draft instructions, affidavits and other documents needed in the proceeding and to engage counsel "to finalise documents and make any necessary Court appearances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Ultimately, a barrister's clerk "agreed to arrange for solicitors (not then known to the Respondents) to provide the 'Back Sheets' required to brief counsel".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Mr Armitage added:
 
 "In practice, the arrangement ... did not provide a proper level of legal services and ... Mr Baker agreed to provide a 'budget-type' representation for the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">" 
 
 
 &#8226; Mr Liberogiannis agreed to act as solicitor on the record, "with the Respondents providing all secretarial-type support, full written instructions, and the like".</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Mr Baker agreed to supervise the work and retain the documents relevant to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Baker therefore held all relevant documents and the respondents retained no copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">&#8226; Mr Armitage and his son (the third respondent) attended Mr Baker's chambers frequently, "often on two occasions a week".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Mr Armitage deposed: 
 
 "In the period leading up to 27 April 2005 I was aware that the matter was to come back before the Court fairly soon, but I was not aware of the nature of the anticipated proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">" 


 
 &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son were unable to keep an arrangement to meet Mr Baker on 22 April 2005 and left a message that they would attend on 26 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">They did not attend Mr Baker's chambers on 26 April 2005 because their car "broke down in the countryside" and they did not contact Mr Baker because "we were in an area of poor mobile telephone reception".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not find out about the 27 April hearing until after the scheduled time of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">He added that "[w]e immediately tried to contact Mr Baker and he told us we should speak to Mr Liberogiannis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">&#8226; Mr Armitage and his son made unsuccessful attempts to contact Mr Liberogiannis, whom he ultimately met "by chance" early this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">&#8226; Hereafter, the respondents intended to act on their own behalf and "to retain full control and ensure that all matters requiring attention are dealt with promptly".</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">&#8226; Mr Armitage had severe health problems and associated difficulties, including inability to give "sustained personal attention to ... this litigation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">&#8226; Mr Armitage resigned as director of the first respondent because it could be insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not intentionally avoid service of the documents initiating this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not attend court because of his health, the fact he had legal representation, and because Ms Wu, through her solicitors, had threatened him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware of Ms Wu's desire to inspect the discovered documents until he received a letter dated 20 April 2004 from her solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">He responded the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware until late November or early December 2004 that the Court had indicated that it would give leave to issue a subpoena to Mr Guss to obtain the documents for Ms Wu's inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">He claimed that Mr Guss still held relevant documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">&#8226; Mr Armitage did not know that Mr Liberogiannis had failed to attend on the return of the subpoena.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He did not knowingly breach any order of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He "should not be held responsible for ... delays ... during the time" when Mr Guss and Mr Liberogiannis acted for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">

11 In addition, Mr Armitage challenged the reliability of the evidence of Ms Xia but it is unnecessary to provide the details of that challenge here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He also expanded on his claim that the initiating application and statement of claim in the proceeding were "based on a serious fraud and constitutes an abuse of the processes of this ... Court".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">He asserted that Ms Wu had made fraudulent claims in relation to her migration objective and investment claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He responded to Ms Wu's claims against him at some length and alleged that her former and present solicitors had acted improperly in various ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It is unnecessary to set out the details of these various allegations here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">12 In his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage further contended that the costs order of 3 February 2006 was unjust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">This was because the primary matter in dispute had been the production of documents, over which he had no control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Also, so he said, Ms Wu's claims were fraudulent and, if he were required to meet the costs order before the determination of the proceeding, he would be prevented from defending himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Armitage specifically noted that paragraphs 36 and 38 of the statement of claim alleged that he acted dishonesty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">13 At the hearing of the motion, Mr Armitage said that he was unable to meet the costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">He subsequently supported this claim by his affidavit filed on 20 June 2006, which attached what he described as "a true and complete statement of [his] means".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">According to this statement, Mr Armitage is in receipt of a disability support pension and has no property that would enable him to meet the costs order of 3 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">14 Also at the hearing, Mr Armitage denied that his allegations of fraud against Ms Wu and her solicitors were scandalous and foreshadowed that he would seek to amend his pleadings or issue a cross claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Mr Armitage said that he did not received the notice of hearing concerning the delivery of judgment, which was sent registered mail by the Court, until 15 --- 30 minutes after judgment had been delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Mr Armitage also said that he spoke to my associate subsequently and that my associate said that a copy of the judgment would be posted to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Court file indicates that this was done although Mr Armitage said that he never received a copy of the judgment from my Chambers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Mr Armitage said he subsequently asked for a copy of the judgment at the Court Registry but that the copy given him had a part of each page missing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He had to ask the Registry for another copy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">He attributed the fact that he did not receive the copy sent by the Court to the fact that he changed his residence about this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Mr Armitage said that he should not be held accountable for his solicitors' dilatory conduct because he did not know the lawyers well and he was not "getting the priority service that may have been required".</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">In any event, he had a reasonable expectation that his lawyers would do the right thing by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">He thought it unfair that Mr Liberogiannis had withdrawn as he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">In reply, Mr Armitage stated that until he read the judgment he "thought everything was under control and being handled adequately".</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">15 In written submissions filed after the hearing, Mr Armitage submitted that the evidence that Mr Liberogiannis gave at the hearing on 27 April 2005 was "inaccurate misleading and incomplete at least insofar as it relates to the extent of conference contact" between him and Mr Armitage and his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Mr Armitage said:
 
 "Mr Liberogiannis made no contact with me prior to 27 April 2005 that would lead me to believe that he had any intention of withdrawing from the proceedings on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">" 


Mr Armitage submitted that no costs order should be made until all issues were determined at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">16 In her affidavit of 9 June 2006, Ms Krycer stated that a registrar conducted a hearing for the taxation of the costs of Ms Wu's motion on 21 March 2006 and that, at the hearing, Mr Armitage appeared and objected to the bill of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Ms Krycer said that, after Mr Armitage served a list of objections, there was a further hearing, which she and Mr Armitage attended, and the registrar had taxed the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">She said that Mr Armitage filed a notice of motion and a statement of objections for reconsideration on 13 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The registrar gave his decision and reasons on reconsideration on 4 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Ms Krycer said that a certificate of cost was served on Mr Armitage by letter dated 31 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Ms Krycer also gave evidence concerning Mr Armitage's notice of appeal and related matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">17 Counsel for Ms Wu opposed Mr Armitage's motion, noting that Mr Armitage was represented by counsel on the hearing of Ms Wu's motion on two occasions when the motion was part heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It was only on the third and final occasion, when the hearing of the motion was completed, that Mr Armitage's solicitor obtained leave to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Counsel submitted that the relevant principles were contained in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363 (" Black on White ") and Microsoft Corporation v Crosslink Marketing Group [2005] FCA 1817 at [21] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He argued that there were no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify setting aside the orders in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In this regard, he pointed out that Mr Armitage was heard, through his counsel, on the motion on two occasions and the affidavit material on which he relied was before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The fact that his solicitor "went off the record" on 27 April 2005 "did not make any difference to the Orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Further, counsel submitted that, having regard to the contents of Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006, it is not reasonably probable that he would have obtained orders other than the orders made on 3 February 2006 had that affidavit been before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Finally, Mr Armitage's affidavit did not, so counsel submitted, establish fraudulent conduct and satisfy the requisite tests for setting aside on the ground of fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">18 In oral submissions, counsel contended that Mr Armitage essentially sought to blame his solicitors and that this was no answer to the orders made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Further, counsel submitted that Mr Armitage had not adequately explained why he was not present at the hearing on 27 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Counsel submitted that his explanation was implausible and that the Court should so hold, having regard to Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Counsel further submitted that it would be unfair if Ms Wu were to lose the benefit of the order because she had taken "significant steps ... since 3 February 2006 to have the costs taxed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Counsel argued too that Ms Wu should not lose the benefit of a self-executing order because it has been and continues to be "enormously difficult for [her] to progress this matter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Counsel said that Ms Wu's hardship was especially relevant "in circumstances where Mr Armitage now represents himself and incurs no costs while [she] continues to do so".</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">19 In written submissions dated 21 June 2006, Ms Wu submitted that the evidence of Mr Liberogiannis showed his communication, and attempted communication, with Mr Armitage and his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The submissions noted that Mr Liberogiannis gave evidence that he had gone to the residence of Mr Armitage, which was also his address for service at the relevant time; and that, at that residence, Mr Liberogiannis spoke to someone but she denied any knowledge of Mr Armitage and his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">The submissions also noted that Mr Liberogiannis said that he made six attempts to speak by telephone with Mr Armitage between 21 and 27 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Ms Wu contended that the delay and non-compliance with orders on the respondents' part had "very significantly increased the costs" of her motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">20 In written and oral submissions, counsel for Ms Wu argued that, pursuant to O 14, r 8 of the Rules, paragraphs 63, 64, 103-106 and 128-135 of Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006 should be struck out or taken off the file, on the ground that they were scandalous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">CONSIDERATION 
 
21 Order 35 rule 7(2) provides that:
 
 "The Court, where it is not exercising its appellate or related jurisdiction under Division 2 of Part III of the Act, may if it thinks fit vary or set aside a judgment or order after the order has been entered where --- 
 
 
 
 (a) the order has been made in the absence of a party, whether or not the absent party is in default of appearance or otherwise in default and whether or not the absent party had notice of the motion for the order; 
 (b) the order was obtained by fraud; 
 (c) the order is interlocutory; 
 (d) the order is an injunction or for the appointment of a receiver; 
 (e) the order does not reflect the intention of the Court; or 
 (f) the party in whose favour the order was made consents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">" 
 
 


 
22 First, I accept that the orders made on 3 February 2006 were interlocutory in nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">"[A]n order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se, although it may, of course conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made, is interlocutory only": Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440 per Taylor J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">It is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">23 Secondly, I accept that Mr Armitage was not in court when the relevant orders were made on 3 February 2006 and that he was absent from a part of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That is, Mr Armitage was represented by his counsel at the hearing of the motion on 23 August and 13 October 2004, but was effectively unrepresented at the hearing on 27 April 2005, when his solicitor successfully obtained leave to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Accordingly, it is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">24 Thirdly, although Mr Armitage sought also to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b), he has not adduced sufficient evidence to make out a case that the order was obtained by fraud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Plainly, any allegation of fraud is extremely serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Before an order can be set aside on the ground of fraud, there must be sufficient evidence of the facts that establish the alleged fraudulent conduct and the part played by the party having the benefit the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The fraudulent conduct must be "directly material" to the order and the evidence of the fraud must be evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered with reasonable and proper diligence before the order under challenge was made: see Monroe Schneider Associates (Inc) v No 1 Raberem Pty Ltd (No 2) (1992) 37 FCR 234 at 242.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006 did not satisfy these requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Accordingly, it is not open to him to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">25 Some care must be taken in dealing with the authorities that concern the setting aside of judgment or orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The force of judicial observations in this area depends on the circumstances in which application to set aside is made, including whether the judgment or order has been entered or is final or interlocutory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">For present purposes, it suffices to refer to the observations of the Full Court in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 552 that the jurisdiction to set aside orders made after they have been entered is "exceptional": see also Black on White at [14]-[16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">26 In substance, Mr Armitage's case is that he was not heard on 27 April 2005 for no fault on his part, because (1) he did not know that his solicitor was intending to seek leave to withdraw and that he would be unrepresented at the hearing; (2) he did not know the precise nature of Ms Wu's motion, partly because he did not know the contents of Ms Krycer's affidavit of 12 April 2005; and (3) having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature and effect of the orders under challenge, the justice of the case demands that the orders be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">27 As I have said, Mr Armitage was represented by counsel on earlier hearing of Ms Wu's motion on 23 August and 13 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It was only at the hearing of 27 April 2005 that counsel did not appear for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">The uncontradicted evidence of Mr Liberogiannis established that, in the days immediately prior to 27 April 2005, Mr Liberogiannis had made many attempts to contact Mr Armitage for instructions and that he had not been able to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Liberogiannnis did not say that he had done more than leave messages, via mobile phone numbers, stating he was intending to seek leave to withdraw.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Mr Armitage has given sworn evidence that he did not know that this was his solicitor's intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He has also given evidence that he and his son had retained counsel generally to appear on their behalf in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">28 Mr Armitage conceded that he knew that a hearing was likely "fairly soon"; that is around the 27 April date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Further, Mr Armitage's evidence was to the effect that he met frequently with counsel retained to run his defence to Ms Wu's action but that he did not meet with him in the days immediately prior to 27 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Notwithstanding that his explanation about his failure to meet with his lawyers prior to the hearing was less than satisfactory, I accept that he did not in fact attend any conference with counsel in the days immediately anterior to the 27 April hearing; and nor did he consult his solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It may be said that, having regard to his failure to meet with his lawyers around this time, Mr Armitage should have realised that they would be unable to represent him in court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">However, Mr Armitage was not the subject of cross examination and his evidence was uncontradicted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">On the evidence before me, I accept that Mr Armitage did not in fact know that Mr Liberogiannis would seek leave to withdraw and that he would be unrepresented on 27 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Further, I accept that he did not read the affidavit of Ms Krycer of 12 April 2005, as he claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Amongst other things, this affidavit dealt with procedural events in the proceeding from February 2005 and Ms Wu's proposed costs application against Mr Armitage and his son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">29 There are four other matters that militate in favour of the application that Mr Armitage now makes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">They are as follows:
 
 (a) The costs order that Mr Armitage seeks to have set aside was itself exceptional: it was for taxed indemnity costs payable forthwith, with a self-executing component in the event of default; 
 (b) Ms Wu's claims against Mr Armitage are serious claims, including allegations of fraud;
 (c) Mr Armitage deposes that he has not the financial means to meet indemnity costs and, by virtue of the order of 3 February 2006, he will be denied the opportunity to defend himself if he does not meet it; and 
 (d) Mr Armitage has filed a defence that, on its face and having regard to the affidavit material filed by him, is arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">

30 Ms Wu's central claims are that she lent the sum of $334,000 to the first respondent and has not been repaid; and that Mr Armitage made false representations to her about the first respondent and himself, by reason of which she has suffered loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Armitage has admitted that he negotiated with Ms Wu, assisted by Ms Minnie Xia, concerning a proposal to invest some $175,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">According to the defence, the terms of Ms Wu's loan included she had the option of withdrawing her investment by giving 3 months' notice at any time for up to 2 years from the date of her contribution; and she did not exercise the option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He has denied the false representations as alleged by her and claimed that communications with Ms Wu were entirely through Ms Xia, who advised Mr Armitage that they had arranged to take all documents to a Chinese speaking lawyer in Melbourne and that they had visited this lawyer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Further, in his affidavits, including his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage has denied the claims made by Ms Wu and contested the filed affaidavits of Ms Wu and Ms Xia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">31 While financial hardship is not of itself a weighty factor, courts are generally reluctant to preclude litigants from having a proper opportunity to present their cases: see, for example, Fancourt v Mercantile Credits Ltd [1983] HCA 25 ; (1983) 154 CLR 87 at 99; and Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I would be reluctant by my orders effectively to prevent Mr Armitage from advancing his defence, especially where he was absent from the court at the final stages of the hearing before the orders were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">32 There are, plainly enough, numerous matters that militate against Mr Armitage's application to set aside the orders of 3 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">They are as follows:
 
 (a) Mr Armitage was represented on the two prior hearings of Ms Wu's motion and the matter of costs was referred to at these hearings;
 (b) Mr Armitage's explanation for his failure to consult with his lawyers in the days immediately prior to the hearing was unsatisfactory, especially as he conceded he knew there was to be a forthcoming hearing and he said that he maintained frequent contact with his counsel; 
 (c) Mr Armitage has not denied knowledge of Ms Wu's motion or any affidavits relied on by Ms Wu in support of her motion other than Ms Krycer's affidavit of 12 April 2005; 
 (d) Mr Armitage had in fact filed affidavits in opposition to Ms Wu's motion; 
 (e) Mr Armitage has conducted his case, both through his lawyers and in his own right, in a way that has made it very difficult for Ms Wu to progress her case and has increased her costs; and
 (f) Mr Armitage has failed to defend the proceeding, including the motion, with due diligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">

33 There is no doubt that Mr Armitage has, by his conduct either in his own right or through his solicitors, compounded Ms Wu's difficulty in pursuing this litigation efficiently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">In so doing he has added to her costs burden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">As I have already said, through their lawyers, Mr Armitage and the first respondent repeatedly failed to comply with the orders of this Court; and Ms Wu's motion was precipitated by these recurring breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Further, costs were unnecessarily incurred by Ms Wu because these respondents failed, whether through their then legal advisers or otherwise, to take steps promptly to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">34 Mr Armitage stated on oath that the respondents made the arrangements that led to the retainer of legal representatives, who knew little or nothing of their case and took little or no responsibility for its ongoing conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Nor can they excuse themselves by relying on a series of "unfortunate events", as Mr Armitage sought to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">If it were otherwise, case management would prove virtually impossible: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 (" KM &amp; A Chadwick ") at [15] per Tamberlin J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">35 Ms Wu has, moreover, proceeded to the taxation contemplated by the orders in question, as indeed she was entitled to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In so doing she has incurred further costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">In this regard, I note, however, that Mr Armitage has been most assiduous in contesting the taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick .</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">39 Mr Armitage has submitted that he ought not be ordered to pay the costs of Ms Wu's motion on an indemnity basis, principally because until he received my reasons for judgment in February this year, he was not aware that he had breached orders and been dilatory in the conduct of his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">40 It may be recalled that Ms Wu established that her motion for default judgment had been properly brought and that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Ms Wu did not receive the relief she sought in her motion because, in the time that had elapsed since she first brought her motion, the respondents had either remedied their defaults or explained why they could not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Ms Wu is, however, to be regarded as having succeeded in substance because the defaults were not remedied until she brought her motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">41 The power of the Court to make an order for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Costs ordinarily follow the event and are awarded on a party-party basis, unless there are particular or special circumstances which warrant the Court departing from this practice and making some other order: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 232-233 per Sheppard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Since Ms Wu was in substance successful, she was and remains entitled to an order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">She continues to submit that an indemnity costs order is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">42 Whilst the Court has power to make an order for costs on an indemnity basis, the question is whether the Court should so exercise its discretion in the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">A court may award indemnity costs in respect of misconduct which causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties: Tetijo Holdings Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (Fed C of A, French J, WAG 55 of 1988, 3 May 1991, unreported) referred to with approval in Colgate-Palmolive at 233; Ugly Tribe Co Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 at [7] per Harper J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">As Mason P, with whom Meagher and Clarke JJA agreed, said in Rosniak v Government Insurance Office (1997) 41 NSWLR 608 at 616, "the court requires some evidence of unreasonable conduct, albeit that it need not rise as high as vexation" before departing from the usual party and party costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The procedural history provides sufficient evidence of unreasonable conduct on the part of Mr Armitage, through his legal representatives or personally, to continue to justify an indemnity costs order on Ms Wu's motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">43 In my reasons of 3 February 2006, I found that not only had Ms Wu properly brought her motion but also that by their conduct (e.g., the last minute and short-term retainer of legal representatives, the failure to take steps promptly to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, the failure to cooperate with their own legal advisers and/or to attend court) the first and second respondents had delayed the hearing of the motion and increased the costs associated with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Mr Armitage did not dispute that his case had been run in an unsatisfactory manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">He conceded that the respondents' arrangements for legal representation had hindered the progress of the litigation, which included the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">44 Mr Armitage blamed his lawyers, his lack of financial means and his ill health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">As I have said, however, a party is responsible for taking steps to ensure that he is kept informed of what is done, or not done, in his name in the course of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Lack of finance does not diminish this particular responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Mr Armitage's ill health may have made his task more difficult but, in the course of this year, Mr Armitage has shown that he is well able to represent his interests in the court system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Further, Mr Armitage is not acting alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The third respondent, who is his son, has, on Mr Armitage's own account, been assisting him in the conduct of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">45 Mr Armitage is now an unrepresented litigant and has been so since Mr Liberoginnias ceased to represent him on 27 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Prior to that date, he had legal representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Like many unrepresented litigants, he is impecunious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Generally speaking, courts are more reluctant to make orders for indemnity costs against litigants in person than against legally represented litigants, although, in an appropriate case, they will make such an order: see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [57] and [60] per O'Loughlin, Whitlam and Marshall JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Further, impecuniosity is generally not a sufficient reason to deprive a party otherwise entitled to a costs order of the benefit of such an order: compare Selliah v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 469 per Nicholson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">46 It is plain enough that the conduct of the litigation by Mr Armitage and those representing him in relation to the motion has been most unsatisfactory and increased Ms Wu's costs with regard to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">This justifies an award of indemnity costs on the motion in Ms Wu's favour; and no countervailing reason has been shown for not making such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">47 Order 62 rule 3(2) permits the Court to order that costs be paid forthwith notwithstanding that the proceeding has not concluded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Weinberg J reviewed the authorities in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 , concluding at [38] that "[t]he discretion which is vested in the Court to order that a party's costs be taxed and paid forthwith should be exercised only where the interests of justice in the particular case require that there be a departure from the general practice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">See also Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 per Branson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) [2004] FCA 347 at [21] , Sackville J said that that "[i]t appears to be broadly accepted that some reason must be shown to depart from what Lehane J in Vasyli described as the 'clear practice of the Court'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">At [22] his Honour referred to the variety of circumstances that had thus far been regarded as justifying departure from the general rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">48 The interests of justice must of course depend on the circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Prior to 3 February 2006, the history of this motion apparently demonstrated a course of conduct on Mr Armitage's part deliberately designed to impede the progress of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">I refer, amongst other things, to legal advisers that were poorly instructed and retained only briefly, the history of the subpoena to Mr Guss, and the failures by Mr Armitage or his representatives to appear as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">This led me to depart from the usual position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">By his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage has sought to explain these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Whilst his explanations are not entirely satisfactory, for present purposes, I do not find that his conduct was deliberately obstructive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Further, if required to pay indemnity costs forthwith, his evidence is that he may lose the chance to present his defence to the serious allegations made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Further, the present case is not complex and, despite its unfortunate history, might be brought on for hearing reasonably speedily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">I would not therefore order that Mr Armitage pay the indemnity costs "forthwith".</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">49 Ms Wu has, however, proceeded to have the costs referrable to her motion taxed, as she was entitled to do under my order of 3 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">She has expended time, effort and money in so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Since I would make an order for indemnity costs in her favour, she should not lose the benefit of this entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I would therefore order indemnity costs in her favour in the sum of $26,666.02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">This was the amount fixed as her indemnity costs under a certificate of taxation of 4 May 2006 that issued after her solicitors prepared a bill of costs and proceeded to taxation pursuant to paragraph [1] of the orders of 3 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">I would also order that the taxation that has been had under Order 62 of the Rules stand as the taxation of Ms Wu's indemnity costs under the costs orders that I propose to make in respect of her motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Pursuant to O 3 r 3 of the Rules, I would, however, order that the time referred to in O 62 r 45(3) be extended to a date to be fixed after the determination of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Further, I would order that, pursuant to O 62 r 45(6) and O 35 r 8, there be no interest calculated on the award of costs from 4 May 2006 until a date to be fixed after the determination of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">50 The parties did not seek to distinguish the second respondent's position from that of the first respondent, which was unrepresented at the hearing of this motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">51 As indicated above, counsel for Ms Wu argued that, pursuant to O 14 r 8 of the Rules, certain paragraphs of Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006 should be struck out or taken off the file, on the ground that they were scandalous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">These paragraphs allege serious improprieties against Ms Wu and her solicitors, past and present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">These allegations are not reflected in the current pleadings and are, for this reason, irrelevant to the case as it presently stands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">52 I would order that paragraphs 63, 65, 103-106 and 128-135, as well as that part of paragraph 64 that refers to threats and intimidation, in the affidavit of Mr Armitage of 16 May 2006 be struck out unless Mr Armitage seeks leave, within 28 days, to file and serve an amended defence and/or cross claim to reflect the allegations in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Associate:
