 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 
 
 1 Comandate Marine Corporation has applied pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) for leave to appeal from my orders made on 22 August 2006 and, consequently, upon the order I made continuing an anti-anti-suit injunction on 13 July 2006 which I left undisturbed in giving my decision on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The parties have agreed, in effect, with one significant exception, a regime under which leave to appeal should be given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Court has put in place the mechanism for an urgent hearing of the appeal in the event that leave is granted, so that it is likely to be heard before the end of October 2006 on dates convenient to the parties and their counsel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The one issue on which the parties are not agreed is whether there should be a condition imposed on the grant of leave to appeal which has the effect of requiring Comandate Marine to obtain the discharge of two orders made by courts in the United States of America and in England.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Pan has proposed that, in order to obtain the discharge of those two sets of orders, it should provide security for Comandate Marine's costs of obtaining the discharge of the orders and their reinstatement without opposition, subject to Pan's right to apply once the status quo is restored to the respective courts for the discharge of the orders on any proper ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 BACKGROUND 
 
 3 The first order was an order made by Judge Crotty of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on 16 June 2006 which operated as an attachment against all of Pan's property including any moneys that were electronically transferred to or by Pan and another company called Austral Asian Maritime Group Pty Ltd, about which there is no evidence before me, to an amount of USD 4,200,000 plus interest and costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 On 22 June 2006, I granted Pan an anti-anti-suit injunction for reasons which I then gave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Subsequently, Comandate Marine moved to refer the proceedings to arbitration and I heard that application on 13 and 14 July 2006 and gave judgment on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">After I had reserved judgment in that application, Comandate Marine obtained, ex parte, the second order from Colman J in the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court in London on 27 July 2006 which had the effect of operating as a Mareva order over all of Pan's assets and operations worldwide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The order prohibited Pan from removing from England and Wales any of its assets up to the value of USD 4.5 million and from disposing of or dealing with its assets anywhere in the world if its unencumbered assets in the United Kingdom did not exceed that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">There were exceptions to Colman J's order to the effect that it did not prohibit Pan from spending a reasonable sum on legal advice and representation in proceedings, including the proceedings from which leave to appeal is sought, but the exception operated generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 On 29 August 2006, after the application for leave to appeal had been filed, the English solicitors acting for Comandate Marine wrote to their English counterparts taking a stance that the Tribunal in the London arbitration had quite rightly, so they said, confirmed that it was not required to have regard to the Australian proceedings, being my judgment, which held that those proceedings were not operative and that Comandate Marine had no obligation whatsoever to discontinue the London arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The letter went on to say: 
 
 'Your clients on the other hand have an obligation to comply with the terms of the freezing injunction of Coleman J [sic] which they persist in ignoring and/or attempting to circumvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">' 
 
 
 6 Subsequently, Comandate Marine has accepted that, for the purposes of securing a grant of leave, it should submit to an order that it take no further steps in the London arbitration until the final determination of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">However, it continues to insist upon its right to have the attachment order in the United States and the freezing and the Mareva type orders in England enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 ARGUMENT 
 
 7 Comandate Marine submits that it is not a proper exercise of the discretion to impose conditions on a grant of leave to appeal to require it to submit to terms that it seek to discharge the two foreign orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Alternatively, on its application for a stay of proceedings, it says that it should not be required to submit to such a condition and that it is inappropriate for the Court to require it to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Comandate Marine argued that by imposing a condition that had the effect of requiring it to obtain the discharge of the restraining orders, part of the subject matter of the appeal it seeks to bring would be destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">However, it pointed to no evidence, apart from the terms of the orders themselves and the inference that it says I should draw from the making of the ex parte order by Colman J, that he had sufficient evidence that there was a risk of dissipation of assets by Pan to warrant the grant of the order, that it will suffer material prejudice were I to impose the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 Comandate Marine also argues that I would be interfering with the jurisdiction of the two courts in the United States and England were I to impose the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It says that it would be prejudiced by losing the benefit of those orders were the condition imposed in circumstances where, if my judgment be reversed on appeal, it will have lost the benefit of the orders for the period in which they are vacated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">At one point it was suggested that by imposing the conditions the appeal would be stultified because Comandate Marine would be required to give up a valuable right to those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I cannot see how that could be so, because the right which would be vindicated in the appeal would be to have, if I am wrong, the arbitration held and the consequential relief that could be granted by not only the arbitrators but other courts in aid of the arbitration would be available to Comandate Marine in that event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">9 Comandate Marine argued that I would be going beyond the preservation of the subject matter of the appeal if I were to exercise a discretion to impose the contested condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 LEAVE TO APPEAL 
 
 10 The principles that govern the grant of leave to appeal are well established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">An applicant for leave must establish that the decision in question is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave and he, she or it must also show that substantial injustice will result from a refusal of leave to appeal: Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 231 [29] per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">11 As I have said, in this case, the parties are agreed and I am satisfied that the normal basis for which leave to appeal ought be granted has been met by Comandate Marine in the sense that the matters which it wishes to agitate, were leave granted to appeal from my decision, are not the subject of any appellant authority directly on the point in Australia, and, so far as the question of whether there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) and in the New York Convention, in common law courts on the point on which I was asked to rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It is clear that if I am wrong and leave is not granted, there would be a substantial injustice to Comandate Marine in the sense that it would have lost the benefit of an immediate arbitration which it had already commenced at the time the motion before me was brought, but it will then have been subjected to a full hearing in this Court of matters which were properly the subject of the arbitration agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 ARGUMENT ON CONDITIONS 
 
 12 So in that sense, it is common ground between the parties, and commonsense in my view, that the principles that govern the grant of leave in the ordinary case have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">But, because the application for leave to appeal is against an interlocutory decision, albeit having in practical terms final characteristics, the Court retains a discretion as to how to preserve and balance the respective rights of the parties in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In effect, Comandate Marine wishes not only to have its proceedings on appeal brought on and heard urgently, and is prepared to submit to an order that it take no further steps in the arbitration, but it wishes to keep the benefit of orders that it has sought and obtained from the United States and English courts that are solely intended to benefit it in the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 On 28 August 2006, Norton White, Comandate Marine's Australian solicitors wrote to Ebsworth &amp; Ebsworth, Pan's Australian solicitors, saying that the English freezing order and the United States attachment order were both obtained 'in support of the London arbitration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">14 When the matter returned to Court this morning, there was debate over whether or not the contested condition should be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The matter was stood down until this afternoon and, at that time, Comandate Marine applied to have, in the alternative to, or in supplementation of, its application for leave to appeal, a stay of my order, in effect dismissing its application for relief under the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) staying the proceedings that Pan had brought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I have been taken to no evidence in the application today, although I invited Comandate Marine's counsel to do so, which suggests that Comandate Marine would not suffer any prejudice of a tangible nature, other than the loss of the benefit of the two sets of orders by the United States and English courts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Comandate Marine did not suggest, nor did Pan, that either order had been engaged to benefit Comandate Marine at the present time by obtaining or affecting assets of Pan's as security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 Comandate Marine asked me to infer that the mere making of the order by Colman J showed that there was some risk that Pan would dissipate its assets so as not to have them available to meet any arbitration award were the arbitration allowed to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">There is, however, no evidence whatever before me, that apart from the inference I am asked to make apart, Pan would dissipate its assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Were that position one which in the future became a reality, no doubt this court could take steps to protect the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I do not think that any order I make today should foreclose to Comandate Marine the right to establish that its position should be protected in this Court if there were a proper basis for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 However, Comandate Marine has moved for its stay today instanter on the evidence it has chosen to put before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It made a forensic choice in doing that not to lead evidence of any actual prejudice it would suffer, that is to say that Pan is currently in a position where its assets may be dissipated but is restrained from doing so by the existence of the freezing order of Colman J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">What Comandate Marine is really seeking to do is to preserve the benefit of its having an arbitration on foot in which it obtained the orders from the overseas courts while appealing against my order which has the effect of saying that the basis upon which those orders were sought was no longer in existence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Whether it was ever in existence at the time the proceedings were started in the England may be a debatable point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Clearly, the right to seek the order in the United States court was in existence at that time the order was obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">That occurred a week before Comandate Marine began the proceedings to arrest the Boomerang 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 PRINCIPLES FOR IMPOSING CONDITIONS 
 
 17 In granting interlocutory relief, including leave to appeal against an order, the grant of a stay or, in a practical sense, where the effect of the order sought would be to stay some part or all of the order under appeal, the Court must balance the respective rights of the parties as best it can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Because the appeal should be allowed to be instituted, each side will be in a position of some uncertainty as to the precise legal rights that they have, notwithstanding that there has been some, albeit still then contested, judicial determination along the way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">18 I am of opinion that there is the power in the Court to impose conditions on a grant of leave to appeal in circumstances where, like the present, the appeal is interlocutory but there are other proceedings on foot, the benefit of which the unsuccessful party seeks to maintain while at the same time seeking to challenge the result which would have the effect of negating the factual substratum underlying those other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Such a power seems to me to fall within the inherent power of a superior court of record to condition orders that it makes inter partes to accord with the requirements of the demands of justice, just as the power to grant a stay is not confined to closed categories of cases of which vexatious suits is one illustration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It is a power which is exercisable in any situation where the requirements of justice demand it: Tringali v Stewardson Stubbs &amp; Collett Pty Limited (1966) 66 SR NSW 335 at 344.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The power to impose conditions should be similarly approached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">19 In Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 Mason CJ and Deane and Dawson JJ discussed the inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process and said that that power extended to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They relied on what Lord Diplock had said in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529 at 536, that the inherent power which any court of justice must possess is to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">20 A similar view as to the power of a stay was expressed in applying what Lord Diplock had said by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 425 at 428 [7] - [9] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 DECISION 
 
 21 I am of opinion that the continuation of the foreign restraining orders would reflect a juridicial basis which is inconsistent with the position that I have found, and would create an alteration of the position that the arbitration agreement is inoperative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I am of opinion that in crafting orders, conditioning the grant of leave so as to obviate the necessity for Pan to litigate both in the United States and England to set those restraining orders aside and to provide that they can, in effect, be automatically reinstated, will mean that the institution of the appeal will not be able to be seen as being unduly vexatious or oppressive, within the meaning of the authorities to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">22 Right-thinking people would regard it as very odd that the appellate processes of the court could be invoked by one party who says a decision is wrong, which held it had no right to arbitrate, who on the other hand, asserts that it can keep in place ex parte orders obtained in aid of that arbitration from courts overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It does not seem right that Comandate Marine can pursue an appeal in this jurisdiction leaving Pan to pursue litigation overseas to secure the benefit of its result here, in circumstances where one is dealing with commercial litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In the present case appropriate protective orders can be made and there is no evidence before, me despite an invitation to identify any, to show that there is any prejudice to Comandate Marine in this result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">23 Doing the best I can to balance the rights of both of the parties, I am of opinion that it is appropriate to impose a condition on the grant of leave that Comandate Marine give up its current orders in aid of the arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It seems to me that those orders currently, other than requiring Pan not to dissipate its assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business which it is obliged to do under Australian law in any event, on the evidence before me, do not actually secure any real right of Comandate Marine or give it a benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">So, I do not consider that it will suffer some substantial prejudice by being required to adhere to the position that there is no arbitration currently on foot by reason of the determination that I made on 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">24 This is an application to commence an appeal in commercial litigation which ought be approached commercially in the exercise of discretions attending a grant of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">I am of opinion that where the court is in a position to give an urgent hearing of the appeal, as will occur, and where there is no practical prejudice, on the evidence, suffered by the vacation of the two orders that have been obtained only for the purposes of the arbitration, I ought to require Comandate Marine to take steps to discharge them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Comandate Marine argued that that was interfering with the jurisdiction of the United States District Court and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">25 That is not a correct analysis of the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Comandate Marine is a party to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is the person applying to the court for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The court acts in personam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">No order I make has the effect of doing anything to affect the orders made by either the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or the Queens Bench Division, Commercial Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The orders that I would make would be orders affecting Comandate Marine as a party to proceedings before this court and in the protection of the processes of this Court and the rights of the parties before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">26 One potential consequence of refusing leave to appeal in weighing the prejudice that Comandate Marine might suffer, is that it would lose the benefit of the arbitration were it entitled to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The detriment to Pan, if leave is granted, is that if these two restraining orders are kept on foot, it loses any fruit of its victory so far as that is concerned and becomes subject to a regime not in the control of this court about the way it deals with its assets for an arbitration process that this Court has said does not exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">If Pan is obliged to give security to put Comandate Marine in funds to obtain first the discharge and later the restoration of those orders, in the event that the appeal is allowed, any injustice to Comandate Marine on a practical level will be undone because it will then be able to regain orders that it can enforce in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">As far as I can understand, from the evidence before me and from the evidence to which I was taken and specifically invited counsel for Comandate Marine to take me to, those restraining orders are not being positively enforced to the benefit of Comandate Marine, except to the extent that they operate as a general restraint on Pan in the way it might otherwise conduct itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">27 I do not see that that general restraint, namely that it should not dissipate its assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business, is anything different to the obligations it would have under Australian law and I see no evidence before me to suggest that it is acting otherwise than in the ordinary course of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">28 Doing the best I can to balance the respective detriments of each party, as necessarily must occur where some interlocutory regime should be put in place pending the hearing of an appeal, I think it is appropriate to make a conditional grant of leave requiring Comandate Marine to take steps to discharge the two restraining orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 DRAFT ORDERS 
 
 29 I therefore would propose to make orders along the lines suggested in the draft orders prepared by Pan, but I will hear the parties on the form of those orders in light of the decision to which I have come.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 (COUNSEL ADDRESSED)
 
 30 Comandate Marine has also applied for a stay of my orders made on 13 July 2006 continuing the anti-anti-suit injunction and on 22 August 2006 dismissing its motion for a stay in reference to arbitration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">31 I am of opinion that the grant of leave on the conditions on which I propose to make it is an appropriate means of protecting Comandate Marine's interests and a stay of the orders would not be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is no evidence of any injustice to Comandate Marine and there is clear evidence of injustice that would be done to Pan were I to grant such a stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">32 The effect of the stay would mean that Comandate Marine would be free to take proceedings in England which would have the effect of stultifying the very relief I granted by the anti-anti-suit injunction on 22 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">I can see no legitimate basis upon which I could accede to the application to stay that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">And, the application to stay an order dismissing the notice of motion seems to me to be an exercise in futility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The only relief that was obtained was a refusal to do something.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">I do not see any purpose in staying such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">33 As to the costs that might be sought, in the event that there is some issue that requires those costs orders to be stayed, as I understand it, the practice of the court is not to allow them to be taxed until the finalisation of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Comandate Marine can make an application in due course to stay those orders pending the hearing of other matters, if it needs to, but I understand the ordinary operation of the rules to mean that those orders cannot be enforced until the final determination of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I therefore refuse the application for a stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 (COUNSEL FURTHER ADDRESSED)
 
 34 The orders I make are those contained in the short minutes of order as amended initialled by me, dated today and placed with the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">I will not make any order for costs beyond the order in paragraph 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 STAY APPLICATION 
 
 35 Comandate Marine asks that I stay the orders I have just pronounced pending its making an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I am of opinion that it is not in the interests of justice that I do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">If Comandate Marine wishes to pursue an application for special leave it can move in the High Court and seek such relief as the court may think appropriate in the period before the order for the grant of leave expires.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">36 In my opinion it would render nugatory the processes of this Court in providing an expeditious hearing of the appeal were I to accede to the order sought by Comandate Marine, the more so because I made clear and counsel for Comandate Marine clearly understood that I was being asked in this motion to exercise the appellate jurisdiction as a single judge rather than have a bench of three members of the court deal with the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">37 In those circumstances it seems to me that the orderly administration of the processes of the court and the interests of the parties to have the proceedings conducted in an efficient, just and appropriate way would be unduly interfered with by the grant of a stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In my opinion there is no irreparable prejudice that would be averted on the evidence before me were any stay to be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">For those reasons I refuse the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
