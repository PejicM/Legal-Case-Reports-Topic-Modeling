 THE APPLICATION   1 This is an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court by way of an appeal under section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") by which the Tribunal determined that particular documents of the Applicant were not exempt on the contended ground of legal professional privilege, from access to the Respondent pursuant to Part III of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act ").
Can you please also ensure that Kristina King's notes (handwritten by Kristina) of the Conciliation meeting at the AAT in June 2002 and Comcare notes of the Directions Hearing at the AAT at the end of 1998 or 1999 are included.
"     10 On 4 June 2003, Ms Foster requested Comcare to conduct an internal review of that decision and on 30 July 2003 Comcare, having undertaken the review, decided to provide access to and copies of 16 further documents to Ms Foster and refuse access to all the remaining documents previously withheld in reliance upon section 42(1) of the FOI Act .
THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL  16 On 11 November 2004, the Tribunal set aside the decision arising out of Comcare's internal review and determined that:   (a) a number of the documents identified in the Schedule marked Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 [17 (paragraph 25 of the Reasons)] were not exempt for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act; (b) apart from any document properly attracting legal professional privilege for the purposes of section 42 of the FOI Act , a number of documents identified within Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1 could not be characterised as "internal working documents" for the purposes of section 36(1) of the FOI Act and that release of those documents would neither reveal the deliberative processes of Comcare nor be contrary to the public interest;  (c) the surveillance videos described at E124 of the Schedule, Annexure "KAK1" to Exhibit 1, related to Ms Foster's claim for compensation, contained personal information about her and were not exempt under either section 36 or section 42 of the FOI Act ; and (d) as to investigation reports, the Tribunal upheld exemptions in reliance upon sections 36 and 37 of the FOI Act .
I am satisfied that the claimed documents are exempt pursuant to section 42 except the following documents:       (a) E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8, E9, E10, E11, E14, E15, E20, E21, E22, E24, E25;         (b) The following folios of document E26 --- 047, 053, 054, 055, 056, 057, 058, 059, 063;         (c) E27, E28, E29, E32, E33, E36, E37, E39, E41, E42, E43, E44, E45, E47, E50, E51, E53, E54, E55, E57, E59, E61, E63, E64, E65, E66, E67, E68, E69, E76, E77, E78, E79, E80, E81, E84, E85, E86, E90, E92, E93, E96, E97, E99, E100, E101, E103, E104, E105, E106, E108, E112, E118, E121, E123, E124.
In Esso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 at page 70, para [52] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ observed:  "A claim for privilege is not conclusively established by the use of a verbal formula.
Although views might differ ( Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Limited &amp; Ors (1996 --- 1997) [1997] HCA 3 ; 188 CLR 501 ( "Propend Finance" ) per Gummow J at page 564) as to whether the privilege is to be characterised as a practical guarantee of fundamental, constitutional or human rights ( Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 490), a substantive rule of law ( Carter v Northmore Hale Davy &amp; Leake [1995] HCA 33 ; (1995) 183 CLR 121 at 161) or a traditional common law right which is not to be abolished or cut down otherwise than by clear statutory provision ( Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24 ; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17-18), it is now clear that legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law available to a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, including representation in legal proceedings: The Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 (" Daniels Corporation" ) at page 552 [9] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.
32 Legal professional privilege is not merely a rule of evidence but an important common law immunity not confined to the processes of discovery and inspection or the giving of evidence in judicial proceedings: Daniels Corporation at 552 and 553 [10] and [11]; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49 ( "Esso Australia" ), Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 73 [61].
36 In the joint judgment of Stephen, Mason and Murphy JJ in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 687-688, the adoption of a sole purpose test was in part influenced by a concern that where a multiplicity of purposes existed for the preparation of documents, many routine documents passing between management officers within an agency or corporation would also be provided to internal lawyers for a purpose of obtaining legal advice and that many such routine documents would become privileged "merely because one of their intended destinations was the desk of a lawyer" : Esso Australia at page 67 [43] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ.
The antiquity of the importance of the relationship between the legal adviser and client in the administration of justice and the preservation of rights and interests according to law was recognised in Shakespeare's dialogue between the conspirators, Cade and Dick in Henry VI, Part 2 when Dick in response to Cade's description of the tyrannical and discretionary character of life and rights in England under Cade's proposed rule, responded, "The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers' .
The evidence was that Comcare had retained independent legal advisers, the point of intersection between Comcare and the independent advisers was Ms King or other officers within the "Appeals and Review Team", that Ms King had administrative responsibility for managing the claims by Ms Foster and Comcare's response to those claims, that Comcare was seeking advice, independent of Comcare, on Ms Foster's claims and Tribunal proceedings and that advice from the independent lawyers is kept physically separate from other material such as administrative material passing between internal officers within Comcare.
42 Ms Foster contends, in reliance upon Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 - 123 and Propend Finance particularly at pages 515 --- 516 per Dawson J that no privilege can subsist for physical objects other than documents and since the privilege is a function of communications between a lawyer and a client for the relevant dominant purpose, it is the communication which is the subject of the immunity and not the document or thing.
In Propend Finance , Dawson J made the observation at page 515 that to say a document is privileged is merely a "shorthand way" of saying that the "communication" constituted by the document is privileged which was an expression of opinion consistent with the view His Honour had expressed in Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 at 122 when his Honour said the privilege attaches only to communications "made for the purpose of giving or receiving advice or for use in existing or anticipated litigation" .
Ipp J with whom Pidgeon and Wallwork JJ agreed observed that in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674, Jacobs J had said at page 690, "Communications with one's legal adviser are privileged from disclosure and ... that privilege extends not only to communications actually made but to material prepared for the purpose of communication thereof to the legal adviser" .
