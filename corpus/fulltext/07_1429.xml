1 When I handed down my decision in Rawley Pty Ltd v Bell (No 2) [2007] FCA 583 , such was my dissatisfaction with the course and conduct of this matter that I indicated a provisional inclination not to make orders as to costs in either of the applications that I had there dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Nonetheless, I invited the parties to put on submissions as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They did so voluminously, save for Mr Bell who indicated he would abide by the orders of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Having considered the parties submissions and having reviewed the costs issues in light of what are well accepted principles that properly inform the exercise of my discretion under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), I am satisfied that to deny the successful respondents any costs at all would, in the circumstances, be punitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">It is not a proper use of the power to award costs to punish either a successful or an unsuccessful party: cf Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 566-567.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">THE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES 
 
2 It is well accepted that the general discretion conferred by s 43 is absolute and unfettered but that it must be exercised judicially and cannot be exercised on grounds unconnected with the litigation: see Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 727 at 732.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Nonetheless, it is equally well accepted that in the exercise of that discretion:
 
 (i) ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order; 
 (ii) where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed; and 

(iii) a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties' costs of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In this sense "issue" does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at [11] approving Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 69 ALR 660; ATPR 40-748 at 48,136.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">See generally Dal Pont, Laws of Costs , ch 8 (2003).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 What can constitute "special circumstances" capable of disentitling a successful party from a costs award has been the subject of helpful consideration by Nicholson J in Instant Colour Pty Ltd v Canon Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 1097.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I am content for present purposes to reiterate what his Honour there said of the authorities on this matter:
 
 
 "(a) In Ritter v Godfrey [1920] 2 KB 47 at 60, Atkin LJ stated 'principles upon which a judge is to discern whether the necessary materials exist' for the exercise of discretion as to costs as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 'In the case of a wholly successful defendant, in my opinion the judge must give the defendant his costs unless there is evidence that the defendant (1) brought about the litigation; or (2) has done something connected with the institution or the conduct of the suit calculated to occasion unnecessary litigation and expense; or (3) had done some wrongful act in the course of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">' 
 
 
 
 
 Atkin LJ continued:
 
 
 
 
 '(2) I think, would include improper conduct in or connected with the litigation calculated to defeat or delay justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Such conduct would also be included in (3) which, I think, further extends to cases where the facts complained of, though they do not give the plaintiff a cause of action, disclose a wrong to the public: King v Gillard [1905] 2 Ch 11, by which I understand some criminal or quasi criminal misconduct, eg a fraud or crime or preparation for a fraud or crime, or possibly some act of serious oppression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Such conduct must, however, be in the course of the transaction complained of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) In Donald Campbell &amp; Co Ltd v Pollak [1927] AC 732 at 811-12, Viscount Cave LC adversely criticised the correctness of Atkin LJ's guiding principles but on the basis they were too restrictive: Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Co Ltd [1991] 1 VR 129 at 153 per Kaye J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">As Viscount Cave LC formulated it, the discretion cannot be exercised against a successful party 'except for some reason connected with the case': Donald Campbell (supra).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) In Australia it has been accepted the general discretion of a trial judge as to costs ought not be fettered by the rules formulated by Atkin LJ: Verna Trading (supra) at 154 and see: Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 11-12 per Bray CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) The principle as to the exercise of the discretion is the same in the case of plaintiffs and defendants, but it is clear that considerations sufficient to justify a refusal of costs to a plaintiff are not necessarily sufficient in the case of a defendant, for the former initiates the litigation while the latter is brought into it against his will: Ritter v Godfrey (supra) at 52-3 per Sterndale MR, approved in Donald Campbell (supra) at 811-12 per Viscount Cave LC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) More compelling circumstances are required for the exercise of discretion as a result of which a successful defendant is not only denied his costs but also compelled to pay the whole or part of the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This is so for the reason the proceedings are initiated by the plaintiff and the plaintiff fails to gain the relief which he sought: Verna Trading at 154.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) In more recent English authority - Scherer v Counting Instruments Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 615 at 621 - Buckley LJ, in summarising the principles governing the making of cost orders, included the principle that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 'the grounds must be connected with the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This may extend to any matter relating to the litigation and the parties conduct in it, and also to the circumstances leading to the litigation, but no further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) In Jamal v Secretary, Department of Health (1988) 14 NSWLR 252 at 271-2, Mahoney JA recognised that in respect of costs on an appeal, conduct in relation to the matter under appeal may be discreditable to an extent warranting deprivation of costs: see Jones v Merionethshire Permanent Benefit Building Society [1892] 1 Ch 173 at 187-8 and Borthwick v Evening Post (1888) 37 ChD 449 at 465.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">"
 
 
 THE LITIGATIONS 
 
4 Two separate proceedings were heard and determined in Rawley (No 2) .</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The nature of those proceedings are outlined (in the Rawley matter) at [30]-[35] of my reasons and (in the Chehade matter) at [281]-[286].</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">As each matter raises different considerations in relation to the award of costs, it will be necessary to deal with them separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">(i) The Rawley matter 
 
5 There were two respondents in this matter, Mr Bell, who represented himself throughout the hearing, and Mr Sladojevic, who had changing legal representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">6 The claims made against Bell were (i) for misleading or deceptive conduct contravening, ultimately, s 995 of the Corporations Law when making representations to investors and for non-disclosure in relation to their proposed acquisition of shares; (ii) in negligence; and (iii) for breach of fiduciary duty as a promoter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He was in the event successful in his defence of all of these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">7 While I found that he had made representations which contravened s 995, I also found that they had not been relied upon by the investors, hence they were not causative of any actionable loss: see generally [209] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The various alleged non-disclosure claims either were not pressed or were not made out: see [198]-[208].</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The negligence claim similarly failed [243]-[245].</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">As to the fiduciary/promoter claim, I held it was difficult to comprehend and had no proper basis: [246]-[279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">8 Similar, partially overlapping, claims were made against Sladojevic (save in negligence) and I reached like conclusions in relation to them including, importantly, that while he was guilty of contraventions of s 995, the misrepresentations he made were not relied upon by the investors in making their investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 I am satisfied that, in relation to the non-disclosure claims actually pressed, the fiduciary claims and, in Bell's case, the negligence claim, the ordinary rule of costs following the event should apply in favour of Sladojevic and of Bell (to the extent, if at all, he incurred costs in relation thereto).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">10 I am not so satisfied that the same follows as of course in relation to the misrepresentation claims that were ultimately pressed or to the abandoned non-disclosure claims to the extent that they were founded on the Georgiadis letter employed in the "second Vinet strategy": see reasons [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Are there special circumstances?</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
11 I confine my comments here to whether Sladojevic ought bear some of his own costs notwithstanding he was ultimately successful in defending the proceedings against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I do so for two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">First, as Bell appears to have been unrepresented throughout (he has not suggested to the contrary and has not made submissions on costs) his costs in any event will be limited to out-of-pocket expenses: cf Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14 ; (1994) 179 CLR 403; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs , [7-24] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In these circumstances, the issue of ouster of the ordinary rule of costs following the event is of no marked significance in his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Secondly, the conduct said to give rise to "special circumstances" was, primarily, that of Sladojevic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">12 I should preface what I have to say with the observation that I do not consider that the applicants acted unreasonably in continuing to prosecute the proceedings notwithstanding that Sladojevic's legal representatives had asserted to them from as early as March 2004 that they would fail, in what were their then claims, on the grounds of reliance and causation for reasons similar to those informing my ultimate findings in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The applicants' lighting upon what was referred to as the Georgiadis letter in 2005 (a Sladojevic strategy letter: see reasons [61]) --- it was not apparently discovered by Sladojevic --- led to a significant enlargement of their claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Notwithstanding that both Sladojevic and his legal representatives asserted at the time that its contents were fiction --- they would have been damning if true --- I am satisfied that in the circumstances the applicants unwillingness to accept those assertions at face value was not unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Such facts as had been pleaded by Sladojevic in his 2002 amended defence were calculated to put his credibility in issue from the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The letter could only have compounded the applicants' suspicions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">13 I do not intend to reiterate in any detail the findings I have made, and the basis thereof, in relation to Sladojevic's evidence generally, to his strategies, to false denials given (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">on the provenance of the "Tiltform Australia" proposal of 25 June 2000) and false assertions made, and to their respective affects on and in the conduct of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Suffice it to say I found that he engaged in opportunistic and self serving behaviour and resorted to falsehood: cf reasons [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Far from being honest and open, such were the doubts his conduct and evidence raised about his credibility, that the applicants were, in my view, entitled to treat his assertions with suspicion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">As I held, "his evidence on any subject not corroborated by independent documentary evidence or a reliable third party ought be regarded with caution": [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Equally, his abandoning of parts of his affidavit evidence in the face of clear contrary evidence was opportunistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">It merely added to the sum of misinformation, confusion or time wasting in the trial for which he was responsible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">And there was a deal of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">As I said of the Vinet strategies, "documents created for the purposes of them have added very significantly to misinformation relied upon the conduct of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Amendments were made to the pleading and cross-examination conducted on the premise that the information conveyed in such documents was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">This resulted both in time wastage and quite a deal of confusion and contradiction for which Sladojevic principally ... bear[s] responsibility": reasons [62].</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">14 Mr Sladojevic did more than simply put the applicants to their proof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">He contrived and/or occasioned difficulties and diversions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Contrary to what is asserted of his behalf, his conduct did unreasonably impact on the economy and efficiency of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is, in my view, unsurprising that the non-disclosure claims prompted by the Georgiadis letter were not withdrawn until the end of the trial and after Sladojevic's cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">15 I do not consider it profitable or appropriate to attempt to apportion costs by reference to the applicants' success or lack of success on the misrepresentation and non-disclosure issues --- the more so as those issues were not separable in any event from the issues of reliance and causation: cf Instant Colour Pty Ltd , at 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">16 As I have earlier indicated, there are parts of the applicants' claims for the costs of which Sladojevic is entitled to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">For example, the fiduciary claim, as I foreshadowed at the very beginning of the trial was quite misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Its failure was inevitable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">This said, I am satisfied that because of his conduct in connection with the litigation or with what reasonably was litigated by the applicants in the circumstances (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">the Georgiadis letter), I am satisfied he should incur a significant abatement of the costs to which he would otherwise be entitled as a successful defendant in respect of the claims based on misrepresentation and those relating to non-disclosure which were abandoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Sladojevic's conduct permeated this part of the Rawley litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">17 As I indicated at the beginning of these reasons, punishment is not a permissible purpose in the exercise of my discretion to deny a successful party his or her costs in whole or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I am particularly conscious of that in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I am also conscious that, in apportioning costs to reflect consequences occasioned by a successful defendant's disentitling conduct, I can only proceed by way of impression having regard to how the litigation itself unfolded and of the conduct of the parties in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There can be no "mathematical precision" in the resultant allocation of costs: cf Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 at [13] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">18 In the circumstances I consider that appropriate costs orders in the Rawley matter would be that the applicants (i) pay 50 per cent of the second respondent's costs of the application; and (ii) pay Mr Bell's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">(ii) The Chehade matter 
 
19 While in no way casting doubt on the seriousness to Mr Chehade of his claim, it had a much smaller evidentiary compass than the Rawley matter and occupied a relatively small part of the time taken in the joint proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">20 I will not outline again the claims made by Chehade other than to say that the conduct of Sladojevic and Bell relied upon to found them did not replicate that in the Rawley matter, though the wrongs alleged to have been committed were similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I, equally, will not repeat what I said of him as a witness: see reasons at [289]; other than to say that I concluded that his evidence should be treated with real caution, absent independent documentary corroboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">21 Chehade's case failed comprehensively --- I found him to be the author of his own harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The case, furthermore, was relatively unaffected by the disentitling conduct of Sladojevic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">While the submissions made on his behalf on the costs issue have sought to coat-tail those made in the Rawley claim, I am satisfied that a quite different order as to costs should be made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">22 There is no reason demonstrated for departing significantly in his case from the ordinary rule of costs following the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">This said, I accept that the preparation and conduct of his trial was affected in some degree by the reasonable view of his advisers to prosecute claims based on non-disclosure of matters linked to the Georgiadis letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Beyond this though, I do not consider any further abatement should be made of the costs order to be made in Sladojevic's favour as a successful defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Accordingly I will order that Chehade (i) pay 90 per cent of Sladojevic's costs of the application; and (ii) pay Bell's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">23 While I consider that the costs to be attributed to the Chehade matter ought be significantly smaller than those attributable to the Rawley matter, I am not in a position informedly to make an appropriate apportionment between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Therefore, in each matter I must leave the quantification and fixing of costs to taxation in default of agreement between the relevant parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.</sentence>
