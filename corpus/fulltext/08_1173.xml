 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This appeal concerns the tax payable by Mr Watson on his income for the financial year ended 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr Watson appeals from a decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) made on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The Commissioner decided in relation to the financial year ended 30 June 2004 that payments Mr Watson received under a personal income protection insurance policy were not assessable income from his business activity as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His business activity otherwise operated at a loss for that year of income, but it would not have done so if Mr Watson could have included the income from the personal income protection insurance policy as assessable income of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The loss suffered in the operation of the business was then treated as a deferred expense, capable of being carried forward, but not capable of being a deduction against his other assessable income, namely the income from the personal income protection insurance policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That decision was made under Div 35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (the ITAA 1997) headed "Deferral of losses from non-commercial business activities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 Mr Watson contends that the decision of the Commissioner was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">THE FACTS 
 
4 Mr Watson was born in 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In 1984, he commenced working as a self-employed financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He took out income protection insurance at that time, as he says partially to replace the commission or income which he would lose if he could not continue to work in his business through illness or injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He has maintained that insurance since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He has conducted his business as a sole trader at all material times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It involves advising clients on their life insurance and investment needs, recommending an insurance or investment strategy, assisting and implementing the resulting strategy, and monitoring the performance of that strategy and its continued appropriateness to the client's evolving needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Those activities generally fall within the description of a financial planning business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Watson received remuneration by those activities both from fees paid to him by his clients and from commissions paid by investment institutions with which he arranged for his clients to make investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 Initially, Mr Watson was an agent of the life insurance company National Mutual, but after some years he became an authorised agent of its subsidiary National Mutual Financial Planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">As a result, he was able to recommend financial products other than those provided by National Mutual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">From July 1992 he became a "sub-agent", but nothing turns upon that changed description or the changed structure of his relationship with National Mutual Financial Planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In 1995, following the de-mutualising of National Mutual, the French insurance company AXA took a controlling interest in National Mutual and from 1999 National Mutual Financial Planning became known as AXA Financial Planners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In July 2002, Mr Watson ceased being an authorised representative of AXA Financial Planners and became an authorised representative of Financial Lifestyle Solutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 From 1995, the policy terms for Mr Watson's income protection insurance were changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It is common ground that it is the form of policy for income protection cover taken from 3 January 1996 which is the applicable policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It is a policy of income protection known as "Professional Income Protection" or "PIP".</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 Unfortunately, later in 1996, Mr Watson fell ill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He was diagnosed as having a brain tumour for which he underwent surgery in November 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He had a period of total incapacity for work as a result, but then recovered well enough to return to his former business activities, but with somewhat reduced capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He had some short term memory difficulty, inability to concentrate and a tendency to confuse words and sporadic quite debilitating seizures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He was diagnosed with a further brain tumour in mid-2004 which was treated by radiotherapy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">He nevertheless returned to most of his business activities but at a reduced volume of activity, and he now concentrates on servicing existing clients rather than representing new clients because of his ongoing problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">8 Mr Watson made a claim under the PIP policy for periodic partial disability payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It appears to be accepted by the insurer, and not disputed by the Commissioner, that Mr Watson is partially disabled from working.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">At one point (unspecified as to date), he sought some advice from the insurer about his situation and was informed, according to his note, in the following terms:
 
 When a proposal is received by underwriting, their occupation is considered when accepting someone as a risk for an income protection policy with an own occupation clause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">If a person changes their occupation while on claim and earns income, then the income earned does reduce their benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The test for this is whether the income has been earned through person exertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Thirdly, if a client is working in their usual occupation but at a reduced income due to their disability, there is no obligation on the client to seek other work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

It is unclear whether that information has prompted Mr Watson to continue operating his financial planning business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It is also unclear whether that information, in the event that Mr Watson ceased running his financial planning business, fully and correctly describes the way in which the amount of his entitlements under the PIP policy would be assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">9 Ultimately, but not without some difficulty, the claim under the PIP policy was accepted and the amount of Mr Watson's entitlements under it resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Partial incapacity payments commenced on 1 October 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">For the last several years, Mr Watson has continued to receive payments at a rate applicable to his ongoing partial incapacity for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 In the financial years from 1997 to 2004, Mr Watson's gross fee and commission income in his business decreased somewhat, particularly from financial year ended 30 June 2000 and then quite dramatically in the last few years up to 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His business expenses remained more or less constant until the financial years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004 when they too had dropped quite significantly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">He had a shortfall of fee and commission income against business expenses in each of the financial years from 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In each of those years, and indeed for some years previously, he had received benefits under his PIP policy in the order of $25,000 per year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is not necessary to set out the precise details except for the year of income in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">11 In the financial year ended 30 June 2004, Mr Watson's income from his financial planning business (putting aside his partial disability payments under the PIP policy) was $9896, and his expenses $14,554, producing a net loss of $4938.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He sought to include as the income of the business his payments from his income protection policy of $25,719.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">That would then have meant Mr Watson's taxable income for that year included business income of $35,615 and, after business expenses and other deductions, his taxable income would have been $20,781.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Commissioner excluded the partial disability payments under the PIP policy from his business income and determined for that financial year to defer the business loss of $4938 in accordance with Div 35 of the ITAA 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Consequently, the Commissioner assessed Mr Watson's taxable income as including his full PIP policy income of $25,719 (subject to any other appropriate deductions).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">12 There are a few other matters of fact to note, as they were referred to in the submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Mr Watson gave evidence that his financial planning business activities included what he described as "non-financial planning business activities" but more accurately are incidental and related activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Those activities included obtaining the appropriate licences and professional and statutory registrations, undertaking training in financial planning, securing premises and equipment and consumables to carry on the business, incidental and necessary travel, securing business finance and banking facilities, and obtaining insurance including for loss to premises or equipment, professional indemnity insurance, and of course his income protection insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">He said his main purpose in carrying on his business was to be financially self-sufficient by carrying on business as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">13 Finally, I note that since payments under PIP policy first commenced on 31 October 1996, under the terms of the policy, Mr Watson has not been obliged to make any further premium payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In his own accounts, he treated the premiums as an expense of his business and the policy as an asset of his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In his claims and dealings with the insurer, including extensive reporting activities, he has reported it in that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">He has also in the period before his illness and up to the time when his obligation to pay annual premiums ceased claimed, and been allowed, a deduction against the commission or fee income he derived from carrying on his business in respect of the premiums he has paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">THE PIP POLICY 
 
14 As there were submissions about the significance of the terms of the PIP policy, it is convenient at this point to note some of its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is described as "an income protection insurance policy" which, according to the schedule, insured Mr Watson to pay him weekly benefits if he suffered total disability through injury or sickness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The relevant clause provides as follows:
 
 If the person is totally disabled, we will pay you the weekly benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">We will pay you at the end of each fortnight for which you are entitled to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The person insured is totally disabled if, because of an injury or sickness, he or she:
 

&#61814; cannot do at least one of the income producing duties of his or her occupation;
 
&#61814; is not working; and
 
&#61814; is following the advice and under the regular care of a medical practitioner .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
The policy specified the rate of payment for total disability in the following terms:
 
 The amount we pay you depends on why we are paying you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The weekly benefit we pay if the person insured is totally disabled or suffers a specific injury or sickness, is based on a percentage (up to 75%) of his or her average income when you applied for this policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It is called "the benefit" and is set out in box 5 in the Schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It may vary in the ways set out in clauses 10 and 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">As long as the details given about the person insured's income on the Application form were full and accurate, the amount of your benefit won't go down, even if the person insured's actual income goes down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 (Underlining and emphasis in policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">)
 

That amount of the average income was specified at $410 per week when the policy was applied for, and has been adjusted according to the increasing claim option since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">15 There is then provision for the commencement and termination of payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Commencement of payments starts at the end of the waiting period of two weeks (specified in the schedule), commencing from when a medical practitioner first examines the person insured and certifies that he or she is totally disabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The waiting period is adjusted from time to time if there are brief intermittent returns to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Payments cease when the person insured stops being totally disabled, or when the benefit period or the cause of the disability ends, or of course when the insured person dies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">There is also provision for circumstances in which payments may be made following a return to work, depending upon whether the return to work is to be full-time work for at least six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">In that event, a claim for further payments would be treated as a separate claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">16 There is a separate clause dealing with partial disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It featured significantly in the submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It provides:
 
 If the person insured has been totally disabled for 14 days and then he or she does some work --- but is partially disabled --- we will pay you a reduced weekly benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">However, you will not be entitled to be paid before the end of the waiting period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">How much we pay 
 The amount we pay is worked out by applying the formula: A --- B x C 
 A
 
 
 
 A equals the person insured's pre-disability income .</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 
 
 
 
 B is the person insured's average weekly income during the period in which he or she is partially disabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 
 
 
 C is the amount in box 5 in the Schedule, as varied in any way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 
 Meaning of partially disabled 
 
 
 
 The person insured is partially disabled if, immediately after being totally disabled for at least 14 days, he or she is able to perform one or more income producing duties of his or her occupation but not all of them, or is working in another occupation, and --- because of the disability --- the amount the person insured earns for the work he or she does is less than the amount of his or her pre-disability income .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 The person insured must be under the regular care and attendance of a medical practitioner .</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">(Underlining and emphasis in original.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">)
 
 

It is not necessary to note the multiplier as the amount of the relevant partial disability payments is not in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">17 The terms "income" and "pre-disability income" are also defined in the following way:
 
 Income If the person insured owns part, or all, of a business or practice, income is money generated by the business due to the person insured's own activity, after all expenses in earning that income have been deducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">If the person insured is employed, his or her income is the total package, including commissions, regular bonuses and fringe benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Income does not include investment or interest income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">...
 
 Pre-disability income means the person insured's highest average weekly income in any 12 month period over the 3 years immediately before he or she became totally disabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">

18 There is provision for an increasing payment for total disability or partial disability by the lower of any annual percentage increase in CPI and 6% and in the case of partial disability, as well as increasing the benefit, the insured person's pre-disability income will also be increased in the same way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">THE LEGISLATION 
 
19 The 2003-2004 income tax return for Mr Watson was lodged on 13 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The assessment was issued on 5 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">It treated the "business loss" of $4938 as deferred non-commercial business loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Mr Watson objected to that assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The objection was disallowed on 7 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The application to this Court is made pursuant to s 14ZZ(c) and Div 5 of Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 , and in accordance with s 175A of the ITAA 1936.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">20 As counsel for Mr Watson said, the heart of this case is whether Mr Watson's income protection insurance income is income from his business activity so that s 35- 10 (2) of the ITAA 1997 does not defer "and effectively deny" deductions for some of his business expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">21 At the relevant time, Div 35 of the ITAA 1997 provided:
 
 This Division prevents losses of individuals from non-commercial business activities being offset against other assessable income in the year the loss is incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The loss is deferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It sets out a series of tests to determine whether a business activity is treated as being non-commercial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The deferred losses may be offset in later years against profits from the activity or, if one of the tests is satisfied or the Commissioner exercises a discretion, against other income.</sentence>

 Note: This paragraph is intended to provide for a case where a business activity would have satisfied one of the tests if it were not for the special circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the business activity has started to be carried on and, for that or those income years: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) because of its nature, it has not satisfied, or will not satisfy, one of the tests set out in section 35-30, 35-35, 35-40 or 35-45; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) there is an objective expectation, based on evidence from independent sources (where available) that, within a period that is commercially viable for the industry concerned, the activity will either meet one of those tests or will produce assessable income for an income year greater than the deductions attributable to it for that year (apart from the operation of subsection 35-10(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">
 CONSIDERATION 
 
22 The respective contentions identify a clear point of distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Put shortly, Mr Watson contends that the income by partial disability payments received from his PIP policy should have been included in the assessable income of his business for the financial year ended 30 June 2004 (as it had been in previous years).</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Then, by the application of one of the tests set out in ss 35-30 or 35-35, the rule in s 35- 10 (2) would not apply to the income year ended 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Each of ss 35-30, 35-35 and 35- 10 (2) relate to the circumstances in which, if the expenses attributable to the business activity exceed the assessable income from the business activity for the year, the loss should be disregarded in determining the taxpayer's taxable income, although the loss may be carried forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">23 The issue therefore is whether the payments for partial disability under the PIP policy received in that financial year are part of the assessable income "from the business activity" for that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">If they are, then under s 35-30(a) the assessable income from the business activity for that year would be at least $20,000, and would also exceed its expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Alternatively, the payments under the PIP policy, if included in each of the five years from 30 June 1999 to 30 June 2004 inclusive, would mean that at least three of those previous five years including that current year (in fact on the evidence it would cover each of the previous five years), the sum of the deductions would be less than the "assessable income" from the activity, that is the business activity, for that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It would then fall within the exception called the profits test in s 35-35.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">If either alternative applied, then the rule in s 35- 10 (2) would not apply and the expenses of the business would be fully deductible in that year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">24 Consequently, Mr Watson contends that the gateway provided by s 35- 10 (1) through which the assessment must pass before the deferral rule provided for in s 35- 10 (2) activates was simply not entered and the Commissioner erred in treating the deferral rule in s 35- 10 (2) as available at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It would also follow that the so called deferred excess of $4938 would not be a deferral of losses from a non-commercial business activity because the amounts attributable to the business activity for the year ended 30 June 2004 which could be deducted would not exceed the assessable income from the business activity, as the revenue of the business activity would include the income from the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">25 The PIP partial disability payments received by Mr Watson for the year ended 30 June 2004 are clearly part of his assessable income: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">That is common ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">So too is the nature of Mr Watson's business activity during that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">It was that of a financial planner, although (as he says) that required administration and regulation compliance activities, each of which did not directly result in the earning of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">That was the activity he engaged in during the financial year ended 30 June 2004, and in earlier years, for the purpose of profit: cf Commissioner of Taxation v Murry [1998] HCA 42 ; (1998) 193 CLR 605 at [54] ( Murry ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">26 The Commissioner contended that the partial disability income is not income from that business activity but is income from the PIP policy, because its source is a contractual entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The contention must be more refined than that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">For it is generally possible to ascribe each source of income of a business to a particular document or transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">In the case of a financial planning business, if fees are earned by commissions from entities with which funds are placed, then those fees will have a contractual foundation; so too will fees earned from clients of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Bank interest on deposited surplus funds is income from funds held in a bank under certain contractual terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">27 The Commissioner also contended that the use of the term "from the business activity" as distinct from the term "from the business" had some special significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">It was said that it was a narrower concept than the expression "from the business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">28 The contrast between the scope of the two expressions was said to be illustrated by BHP Petroleum (Timor Sea) Pty Ltd v Minister for Resources (1994) 49 FCR 155 ( BHP Petroleum ) and Watson v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 415 ; (2003) 128 FCR 564 ( Watson ) on the one hand, and cases such as Murry ; Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 ( Hope ), and Ferguson v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 ( Ferguson ) on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">29 In my opinion, the extrinsic materials do not indicate an intention to distinguish between those two expressions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">They are discussed by Stone J in Commissioner of Taxation v Eskandari [2004] FCA 8 ; (2004) 134 FCR 569 ( Eskandari ) at [14]-[17].</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I respectfully adopt her Honour's observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">I shall not repeat them in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The relevant legislative intention which appears to have underpinned Div 35 was to distinguish between "activities which are essentially private or lifestyle choices" and those which involve "genuine business activities" (see para 228 of "Review of Business Taxation --- a Tax System Redesigned", 1999).</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I also note, by way of illustration, that para 1.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Integrity Measures) Bill 2000 (Cth) by which Div 35 came to be in the ITAA 1997 says:
 
 Division 35 does not change the existing income tax concept of what constitutes the carrying on of a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The Division will apply within that environment to those individuals able to claim business deductions under the existing law on the grounds that they are carrying on a business and meet all existing tests of deductibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">

30 Paragraph 1.15, when comparing the key features of the proposed law and the current law, says that the change is to provide that the excess of deductions over assessable income from a business may be claimed against other income only if one of the tests is satisfied or the Commissioner exercises a discretion to permit it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">31 The cases referred to by senior counsel for the Commissioner about the nature of a business also do not support the contrast sought to be drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Murry at 604; Hope at 8-9; and Ferguson at 311 all describe in generally consistent terms what is involved in carrying on a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">They do not suggest that the activities undertaken in doing so, so that they may be called "business activities" are somehow outside or distinct from the business itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">32 The decisions of BHP Petroleum and Watson also, in my view, do not support the contrast between the two expressions in s 35.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">33 BHP Petroleum concerned the eligibility of certain taxpayers under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 (Cth) to have their projects combined so that expenditure on one of the combined projects could be set off against revenue from another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Section 20 empowered the Minister to "... issue a combination certificate" if satisfied, having regard to specified factors, that the projects "are sufficiently related to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a single petroleum project".</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The application for the "combination certificate" had to be made "from" a person or persons who were together entitled to at least half of the receipts from the sale of marketable petroleum commodities produced in relation to each of the projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The formal application, by oversight, omitted the name of one intended applicant whose entitlement was necessary to meet the one half eligibility criterion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">In the circumstances, the Court (Beaumont, Jenkinson and Heerey JJ) found that the application had in fact been made by all the intended applicants, so that criterion was satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Beaumont J at 170-171 explained that the word "from" had its ordinary meaning as indicating "the starting point, source or origin" of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">That source had been clearly exposed by other communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">I do not, however, see any observations in the reasons which support the claimed contrast between "business activity" and "business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">However, I think the meaning of the word "from" as discussed is equally applicable to that word in the phrase "from the business activity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">34 Watson concerned the claim of Mr Watson and his wife for benefits under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Section 1075(1) provided that "if a person carries on a business, the person's ordinary income from the business is to be reduced by ... losses and outcomings that relate to the business ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Mr Watson was refused benefits because the payments under the PIP policy were not part of his ordinary income from his financial planning business, so as to allow the reduction for the losses and outgoings of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Consequently, the statutory threshold for eligibility for benefits was exceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Watson argued, in that case, that the benefits under the PIP policy had the same character as the income they replaced, particularly as (he claimed) he had to continue to work in the business or in some other remunerative employment as a prerequisite to being paid partial disability payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Finn J at 569 upheld the conclusion that the payments under the PIP policy were not "ordinary income from the business".</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The contractual income was a surrogate for, and was payable because of, the reduced ordinary income from the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The distinction drawn by Finn J is helpful in addressing the present appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In that regard, Finn J did not appear to place especial weight on the word "ordinary" in his reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">However, I do not think his Honour's views support the contrast between "business" and "business activity" which was contended for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">35 Eskandari is the only decision concerning Div 35 of Pt 2 - 5 of Ch 2 of the ITAA 1997 to which my attention was drawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The taxpayer sought to set-off against his normal salary the losses incurred in his unrelated business activity as a registered migration agent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">It was common ground that, unless he could bring himself within the exception to the application of s 35 - 10 provided by s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i), s 35 - 10 would prevent him from setting off those losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Section 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) permitted the Commissioner to decide that the rule in s 35 - 10 does not apply to a business activity for a year or years of income if satisfied that it would be unreasonable to apply it because the business activity, in respect of the relevant income years, "because of its nature" would not satisfy one of the other tests imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Hence, the relevant issue was a narrow one: could s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) apply because of the nature of the business, namely that it was in its start-up phase and the anticipated revenue stream would not come about for some two years or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The taxpayer claimed that his new business had that nature because he charged only a modest initial fee, and then incurred significant expense, and would only receive the substantial part of his fee when the visa application was granted, possibly some years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Stone J decided that the term "because of its nature" referred to an inherent feature of the taxpayer's business activity in common with business activities of that type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Unless the "lead time" before a substantial success fee became payable was a common or inherent feature of migration agent businesses, rather than a consequence of how the taxpayer chose to charge, the exception in s 35 - 55 (1)(b)(i) could not apply and the Commissioner would not have a discretion to exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">36 Counsel for Mr Watson, at the other end of the spectrum of submissions, contended that there should be symmetry between the concepts of "taxable income" and "allowable deductions", in particular those deductions falling within the second limb of the income nexus test specified in s 8 - 1 (1)(b) of the ITAA 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">If the premiums paid on the PIP policy were accepted as deductions by the Commissioner (as they apparently were), on the basis that they were necessarily incurred in carrying on the financial planning business, then payments made under the PIP policy should also be regarded as income received in carrying on the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">37 Whilst that contention has a superficial attraction, I think it over-simplifies the position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The PIP policy was clearly to diminish the adverse consequences of illness or accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The benefits under the PIP policy provided protection against income loss from the inability to fully conduct the business, and so to earn income from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">So the benefits under the PIP policy are a partial indemnity for, and as a substitute for, the reduced commission and fee income which Mr Watson suffered by reason of his illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">There is no need for a direct monetary correlation between the amount of the benefits and the foregone or lost commission and fee income: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Smith [1981] HCA 10 ; (1981) 147 CLR 578 at 583.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">That does not, however, mean that the benefits under the PIP policy are part of assessable income from the business activity for the year in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">38 One submission of Mr Watson acknowledged that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">He accepted it was necessary to take the extra step of regarding the business activity as encompassing the "related or incidental activities" which, in turn, include his "insurance activities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">39 Counsel for Mr Watson then submitted that the business activity of Mr Watson included his "insurance activities" as well as the range of other incidental administrative and professional matters referred to in [12] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Counsel further submitted that the "insurance activities", by which he relevantly meant Mr Watson taking out the PIP policy and regularly paying the premiums on it and --- in the event of an insured risk occurring --- receiving the benefit of it, had the "significant commercial purpose" of securing a stream of income as a substitute for the business income that could be at risk if Mr Watson were injured or became ill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">He also said there was a purpose of profit or the prospect of profit, because the potential benefits if an insured event occurred could be up to 75% of Mr Watson's earnings from the business and were much greater than the premiums payable from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Counsel also relied upon the fact that, as the material showed, the PIP policy was taken out by many authorised representatives of National Mutual/AXA and by many other self-employed persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">40 There may be a mix of reasons for a self-employed person taking out an income protection policy such as the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">In the event of catastrophic injury or illness, where the insured person would be unable to conduct the business previously operated, total disability payments would be received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">It could not be said that such payments were for the purposes of the business; of necessity, if its operation were dependent upon the self-employed person, the business would cease to be operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Nor could it be said in that circumstance that such payments were income received from the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">If the insured event involves a period of total incapacity and the insured person then resumed running the business, insurance payments may have enabled the insured person both to maintain a personal cash flow during the incapacity and to meet ongoing commitments (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">rental, lease and interest obligations) in relation to the business so that it could be maintained during the incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Other facts may inform the understanding of the purpose or utility for the business of the policy: the nature of the business; whether there are other employees; who may be able to keep the business going to some degree despite the temporary or diminished capacity of the principal; whether the temporary or diminished capacity of the principal may be accommodated by the hiring of a temporary or part-time replacement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">There will no doubt be other potential combinations of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">41 Whether particular payments in a particular year of income under an income protection policy are income from the business activity will depend upon the particular facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In Carapark Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1967] HCA 5 ; (1996) 115 CLR 653 ( Carapark ), the benefits received by a holding company of an employer taken out on the life of an employee of a subsidiary company were part of its assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The Court (Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ) said at 663:
 
 ... in general, insurance moneys are to be considered as received on revenue account where the purpose of the insurance was to fill the place of a revenue receipt which the event insured against has prevented from arising, or of any outgoing which has been incurred on revenue account in consequence of the event insured against, whether as a legal liability or as a gratuitous payment actuated only by considerations of morality or expediency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">

The fact that it was the holding company which took out the policy and received the benefits, rather than the subsidiary employing company, did not alter that position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">As that passage indicates, the purpose of the taxpayer entering into the contract of insurance which produced the payment is relevant to identifying the relationship of the payment with the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">See e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Myer Emporium Ltd [1987] HCA 18 ; (1987) 163 CLR 199 at 217; cf Murry at 626 [54].</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">42 The potential benefits under the PIP policy ranged from a relatively brief period of payments for total disability to long term payments for total disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The Commissioner might readily have accepted the premiums paid as deductible expenses of the business of Mr Watson (as he apparently did).</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">That would no doubt have been on the basis that a substantial purpose was to secure the ongoing operations of the business during a period of relatively brief incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It does not follow that all benefits, in whatever circumstances, under the PIP policy are necessarily income received from the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">43 To say that the PIP policy was to provide a substitute for income lost in the event of an insured event occurring, or that it was to provide for a substitute revenue stream for that which otherwise would have flowed from the business, is not to answer the critical question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Nor, in my view, is it sufficient to show that a substantial purpose of the insurance was to secure a revenue stream so as to enable the business to continue during a period of temporary incapacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">So much may be accepted (or assumed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">44 It is the particular benefits in the particular insured events which are in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">45 Mr Watson was not in the business of insuring, or taking insurance, against total permanent disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Nor was he in the business of insuring, or taking insurance, against partial permanent incapacity, or at least permanent partial incapacity which so impaired him as to be unable to conduct the business otherwise than at a loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">His business was not taking out income protection insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">46 To draw that line is not to exclude from the business, or the business activities, related or incidental activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">There may be a range of income sources which qualify as assessable income from a business or from business activities even though they are in a sense incidental to its main activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In Kidston Goldmines Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 77 , the Court held that the investment of surplus funds from sales of gold on the short-term money market was an incident of the taxpayer's goldmining business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">That case also decided that the interest received was not, however, exempt from income tax under the then s 23(o) of the ITAA 1936 as it was not income "derived from the working of a mining property".</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It was not sufficiently proximate to the activities which directly generated income by gold mining.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The result turned on the particular statutory provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Other illustrations are provided by Carapark ; Lees &amp; Leech Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 136 ( Lees &amp; Leech ); Warner Music Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 197 ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [1952] HCA 65 ; (1952) 86 CLR 540 and G.P.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">International Pipecoaters Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1990] HCA 25 ; (1989) 170 CLR 124.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">To draw that line requires an assessment of the material circumstances at the relevant time or for the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">47 The purpose of Div 35 is clearly enough to limit the extent to which non-commercial losses from a taxpayer's business activities are used as tax deductions to reduce the tax paid on other income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The extrinsic materials indicate that it was designed to prevent the expenses of leisure activities or hobbies, or of activities ostensibly business-like but which are unlikely ever to make a profit, from generating tax deductible losses to be set off against other income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">In that context, Mr Watson's circumstances --- if the appeal is to be allowed --- would fall within the reach of s 35 - 10 (2) even though, in a sense, he would be an incidental object of its application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">He has not engineered his present circumstances to get the benefit of a deduction against other income for what is, in essence, non-commercial expenditure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">48 Nevertheless, it is necessary to apply s 35 - 10 (2) if, upon its proper construction and application and that of s 35 - 30 and s 35 - 35 , it applies to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">49 The relevant distinction which is drawn by s 35 is between assessable income from the business activity in a particular year and assessable income which is not from the business activity in a particular year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Income from a business activity must clearly have a connection with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Beaumont J (with whom Jenkinson and Heerey JHJ agreed) in BHP Petroleum at 170-171 applied the normal sense of a starting point, source or origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Finn J in Watson at 569 contrasted income from the business of Mr Watson and income that was a surrogate or replacement for income which might otherwise have been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">As noted above, such income may include income from incidental activities even though they are not, or not likely to be, recurrent (eg the interest on a temporary cash surplus, as in Kidston ; or the proceeds of a life insurance policy, as in Carapark ; or the cash incentive paid to take a long term lease, as in Lees and Leech .</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In certain circumstances, and in relation to a particular period, the assessable income of a business activity might also include for a time disability payments under a personal income protection policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">I do not need to decide that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">50 However, in my view, it is clear that in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 1994, Mr Watson's payments under the PIP policy were unrelated to his business as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">They were to substitute for the income he may have earned in the business but for his partial disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">But there was no element of the business to which they were connected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Their only relationship to the business is that eligibility for the payments depended on the fact of ongoing partial incapacity to conduct the business as Mr Watson had previously done, and that the PIP policy quantified the contractual entitlement by reference to Mr Watson's income from the business, adjusted as agreed in the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Those are merely events which the PIP policy was expressed to operate upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The relevant payments under the PIP policy, however, had no causative connection with the business so that they could be regarded as income from the business or from the business activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">51 Even if, initially, the benefits under the PIP policy could have been income from his business activity, at least while his capacity to continue to run the business was re-established, that is not the present position in respect of the relevant year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The taking out of the PIP policy may have been prompted by a range of sensible considerations, but the considerations for a taxpayer taking out such a policy will be but one piece of information relevant to the determination of whether benefits received under such a policy are part of the assessable income from a business activity in relation to a particular year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">52 The evidence is that Mr Watson's business expenses have been more or less constant for the years ending 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">In each of those years, his income from running the financial planning business (putting aside his insurance payments) has been significantly less than the expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">His partial disability is apparently indefinite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">He has not employed others, using the payments under the PIP policy, to work in the business to increase its income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">No activities by him in the business, including the incidental or ancillary activities (such as record keeping, filing, banking, research, general administration tasks, insuring business assets and the like), have related to him continuing to receive the partial disability payments under the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">If he ceased running the business, or if he sold the business, his entitlement to partial disability payments under the policy would not change --- although, depending on any other income earning activities he undertook, the quantum of those payments may be adjusted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">53 In his reply, Mr Watson alternatively argued that, because the insurer required Mr Watson to carry on his business so long as he was able, continuing his business became a condition of getting the insurance benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">For reasons given below, if that were the insurer's position, I do not think it would be warranted under the policy (although of course the insurer has not had the opportunity of putting argument on the issue).</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">I do not accept the premise that continuing the business, at what is now a significant annual loss, is a condition of eligibility for benefits under the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">54 Further, Mr Watson argued in his reply as another alternative that the expenses of $14,854 in the income year ended 30 June 2004 were all attributable to the fee and commission income of $9,896.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The test for deductibility of expenses is in s 8 - 1 of the ITAA 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The approach of the High Court in Ronpibon v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 15 ; (1949) 78 CLR 47 to the test for deductibility (in respect of s 51(1) of the ITAA 1936 --- the legislative predecessor) is still applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">However, the proposition that there should be a pro-rata apportionment of expenses between fee and commission income on the one hand and the payments under the PIP policy on the other is also premised upon the fact that Mr Watson was obliged to continue to operate the business as a condition of eligibility for those payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">In other words, he says he had to incur the expenses to receive the assessable income comprising the insurance payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">For the reasons discussed below, I do not accept the premise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">55 For those reasons, I conclude that, at least for the year of income in issue, the partial disability payments under the PIP policy were not assessable income from Mr Watson's business or his business activities as a financial planner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">56 Finally, I wish to make some observations about the terms of the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">57 I note the communication referred to at [8] of these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">As I there remarked, there was a suggestion in the evidence of Mr Watson that he understood that he must continue to run his financial planning business to be eligible to continue to receive benefits under the PIP policy at their current level.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">I do not think the PIP information from the insurer says that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">58 The definition of partially disabled is set out in [16] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The PIP policy says that the insurer will stop paying partial disability payments as soon as the insured person stops being partially disabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The meaning of partially disabled relevantly involves two elements:
 
(1) that the insured person is able to perform some, but not all, of the income producing duties of his or her occupation or is working in another occupation; and
 
(2) because of the disability, the insured person earns less for the work he or she does than the "pre-disability income".</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">It does not say that the insured person must be working in his or her pre-disability occupation to be "partially disabled".</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">It allows for the fact that he or she may not be doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">Consequently, if Mr Watson were to cease running his business because he could only do so at a significant loss, he would nevertheless remain partially disabled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It appears to be accepted that he is not able to perform all of the income producing duties of the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">It also appears to be accepted that, because of that disability, he earns less than his pre-disability income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">59 Indeed, under the definition of "total disability" in [14] above, Mr Watson may qualify for benefits under the PIP policy on that basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">There may be no significant difference: see [63] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Of course, Mr Watson for the reasons set out in [62] below should endeavour to secure or maintain a reasonable occupation or employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">60 On the assumption that Mr Watson remains at his current level of partial disability, he is entitled to payments calculated in accordance with the PIP policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">It is neither appropriate, nor possible, to decide what his precise entitlement would be if he were to cease running his financial planning business because he could not do so profitably, or to run it in a way that reduced his overheads and other outgoings to more closely relate them to his capacity to earn income from that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">There may also be other reasons why Mr Watson continues to run his business even though he cannot do so at a taxable profit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">61 The policy itself, and the explanatory material sent by the insurer on 2 January 2002, indicate that the formula to determine the benefit level for partial disability is calculated by reference to average weekly income from time to time during the period of partial disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">It does not oblige the insured person to maintain the business being conducted at the time the disability arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">62 There is an undated note taken by Mr Watson of a discussion with an officer of the insurer:
 
 Therefore, there is a requirement to work if capable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">If the insured person returns to work at a reduced capacity, the income protection is replacement income (business related income).</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">If expenses exceed other business income (ie ignoring the Income Protection benefit itself) then to sell off the business is against the intent of the insurance act and the insurance company would cease benefit until other work was obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">

In a practical sense, Mr Watson should take reasonable steps to "mitigate his loss".</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">That obligation is one applicable to the measure of damages in all contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">It does not apply as a term of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">Section 13 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) implies a term that each party to an insurance contract will act towards the other party with the utmost good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">It could be expected that Mr Watson should therefore act reasonably in relation to the business activities or employment which he chooses to undertake: Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">The element of reasonableness is also explained in cases such as Fidelity and Casualty Co of New York v Mitchell [1917] AC 592 ; Pocock v Century Insurance Co Ltd [1960] 2 Ll Rep 150; and Sergent v GRE (UK) Ltd [2000] Ll Rep 1R 77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">That obligation extends to an insurer in determining whether an insured was totally and permanently disabled: see Beverley v Tyndall Life Insurance Co Ltd (1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-453.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">Reference may also be made to regs 17 and 18 of the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985 (Cth) and to the decision in QBE Insurance Ltd v Jande (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cas 61-270.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Ultimately, the wording of the policy is the critical element.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">63 The current level of benefits under the PIP policy has apparently been acceptable to Mr Watson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">The definition of "income" in the case of a self-employed person is the "money generated by [that person's] business due to the person insured's own activity, after all expenses in earning that income have been deducted".</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">On the evidence, Mr Watson would have no income for the purposes of the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He would appear to be entitled to be receiving, and be receiving the maximum weekly benefits payable under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">It is not a requirement of the PIP policy that, to continue to be eligible to continue to do so, he must continue to operate his business at a significant annual loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">64 It is, of course, up to Mr Watson whether he continues to operate his business as at present, or adapts the manner of its operation in some way, or endeavours to pursue some other income earning enterprise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">It seems clear enough that he continues to be partially disabled from work, so it is a matter of applying the terms of the policy to calculate the amount of his ongoing entitlement to payments under the policy in the light of his ongoing earning capacity as reflected in his income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">65 In my judgment, for the reasons given, the appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mansfield.</sentence>
