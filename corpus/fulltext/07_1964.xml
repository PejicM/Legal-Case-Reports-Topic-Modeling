<sentences>
<sentence id="s0">
 
1 In 2006 the applicants instituted proceedings against the parties who are now the first and second respondents in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 30 January 2007 the applicants instituted proceedings against the parties who are now the third, fourth, fifth and sixth respondents in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The proceedings are listed before Jacobson J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">My understanding is that on 15 June 2007 his Honour made an order the effect of which was to provide for the consolidation of the two sets of proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The proceedings as presently constituted were the subject of a Consolidated Application filed 2 July 2007 and a Consolidated Statement of Claim filed 2 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Consolidated Application seeks relief in respect of alleged infringements of various sections of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), a section of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) and relief pursuant to ss 80 , 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in relation to alleged contraventions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The fifth respondent is Francis George Bernard Cragen, who is apparently the principal director of the third respondent, Impact Gaming Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 On 21 August 2007 an exhibition was held at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The exhibition was apparently known as the Australasian Gaming Expo, which I presume to be an exhibition in respect of products in the gaming industry, such as poker machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicants are, as I understand it, manufacturers of such machines and the third respondent is, as I understand it, involved in the business of repairing and supplying parts for gaming machines and making second-hand gaming machines available for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 I have been interrupted by senior counsel for the applicants to indicate that I need not be expansive in relation to the reasons for the costs order that I propose to make as it is not the intention, at least of the applicants or of the fifth respondent, to seek to challenge whatever order I may see fit to make in respect of costs, by way of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In the circumstances I will be brief but I will say a little more about the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">6 A chance encounter occurred when two officers of the applicants ran into the fifth respondent in a hotel at Darling Harbour near to the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre on 21 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is plain beyond argument that the fifth respondent did not pursue the two officers of the applicants whose names were Stephen Parker, sometimes referred to as Steven Parker, and Peter Gardner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The fifth respondent was in the company of a small number of people at the time the incident occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 In the space of five minutes an incident took place when Mr Gardner and Mr Parker happened into the bar where the fifth respondent was already standing drinking with the people who were with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">When the parties were some distance removed from one another the fifth respondent spoke in a derogatory manner of Mr Parker using words to the effect 'Parker, you little f...c..., you bastard, what are you doing to me?</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">' That was Mr Gardner's recollection of the communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Mr Parker's recollection of it was in these terms --- according to Mr Parker the fifth respondent said, 'You can f... off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">You are nothing but a f...c... Go away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">' 
 
8 The applicants have filed a Notice of Motion seeking injunctive relief against the fifth respondent restraining him, whether by himself, his servants, agents or otherwise, from approaching or communicating directly with the applicants or their non-legal representatives, including their employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 Before the motion was filed, but more than a month after the incident, a request was made for an undertaking by the fifth respondent not to have contact with the applicants' employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I will not go into the chain of correspondence in any detail beyond indicating that the fifth respondent viewed the applicants' demands as being unwarranted and proffered undertakings which were not acceptable to the applicants in their terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 Upon the motion coming before the Court today the fifth respondent sought an adjournment of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Following a short adjournment an accommodation was reached between the applicants and the fifth respondent as to the manner in which the motion should be disposed of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">An undertaking was given to the Court by the fifth respondent and on the basis of that undertaking the Notice of Motion was, by consent, dismissed leaving for determination the question of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">11 Each party has sought an order that the other pay the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It seems to me that it would be inappropriate to make any order for costs against the fifth respondent unless it could be demonstrated that there was some basis upon which the court would have, in the exercise of its discretion, ordered relief of the kind sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">12 I was taken by senior counsel for the applicants to an instance where Jacobson J granted this type of relief in Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith (2005) 64 IPR 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The conduct there complained of was conduct by a Mr Smith, who made direct approaches to officers of one of the applicants over a period of time on 8 and 9 August 2002 which his Honour described as the sending of a series of threatening SMS messages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A further order was made in respect of similar conduct in relation to another party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 It is said by the applicants that the conduct complained of was in the nature of contempt of court and that it was appropriate for threatened contempt to be the subject of restraint by injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Reliance was placed upon a passage from Lord Wilberforce's speech in Raymond v Honey [1981] UKHL 8 ; (1983) 1 AC 1 at page 10 where his Lordship said, 'any act done which is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice, or the lawful process of the courts, is a contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' The principle only needs to be stated for it to be apparent that it has no application whatsoever to the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It could hardly be said that the abuse meted out by Mr Cragen from a distance to Mr Parker on his arrival at the bar and a demand that he go away could be seen to be calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">14 I have also been referred by senior counsel for the applicants to the judgment of Deane J in a decision of the Full Court of this Court in Australian Builders Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers' Federation v Commonwealth of Australia (1981) 37 ALR 470, with which Bowen CJ agreed and Evatt J expressed his general agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In that judgment (at 474) his Honour identified three categories of contempt, one of which was contempt in 'abusing parties who are concerned in causes'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">15 It seems to me that the remark passed in the chance encounter in the bar could not answer the description of such a contempt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The presence of Mr Parker and Mr Gardner in the bar was not as parties to a case or in any way related to the presentation or preparation of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">A different outcome may well follow if one was concerned with (say) abuse of a litigant by another litigant in an elevator on the way to a level in the Law Courts Building where a case concerning the parties was about to commence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 Had I been called upon to deal with this matter on the merits I would have had great difficulty in granting relief such as has been offered by the fifth respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Indeed, I would not have been disposed to grant any relief at all on the material to which my attention has been directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It seems to me that the threats against the fifth respondent and the letters demanding undertakings from him have been unwarranted and he is entitled to his costs of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
