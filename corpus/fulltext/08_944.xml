 Introduction 
 
 1 On 29 September 1998 a native title determination application was lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal) by a number of applicants seeking a determination of native title over an area of some 66,698 square kilometres in the Western Desert lying in the centre of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application became a proceeding in the Federal Court (the Court) on 30 September 1998 by operation of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) (the Amendment Act 1998).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The application was amended on 9 September 1999 by further particularisation of the native title claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 24 September 1999 the Native Title Registrar accepted the application for registration under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) on the basis that it satisfied all of the conditions in ss 190B and 190C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The period of three months following the notification date referred to in ss 66(8) and 66(10)(c) ended on 4 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 18 July 2000 the application was referred, by order of the Court, to mediation by the Tribunal under s 86B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 The application is designated by the applicants as the Birriliburu Native Title Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It takes that name from Pirilipurru which is a soak in the central north of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The claim area itself lies in the centre of Western Australia, south east of Newman and north east of Meekatharra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It is crossed from the south west to the central north by the southern portion of the Canning Stock Route.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The site of the determination, Good Camp Rockhole, is in the south west corner of the claim area and about 150 kilometres north north east of Wiluna.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 The application names as applicants Billy Patch and a number of other persons on behalf of the Native Title Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Annexure 2 to the application sets out a list of some 181 names of persons included in the Native Title Claim Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 The applicants and the State of Western Australia (the State), who are now the only parties, have reached an agreement on the terms of a determination to be made in relation to part of the land and waters covered by the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They have agreed that no determination should be made over the balance of the land and waters and that the proceeding in relation to that area should remain on foot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The parties have filed with the Court a minute of a proposed consent order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">They have done this pursuant to s 87A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It proposes a determination pursuant to ss 87A and 94A of the Act that native title exists in relation to the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 The external boundaries of the proposed determination area are described in Schedule 1 to the Consent Minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Excluded from that area are three vested reserves, each of which has been the subject of a previous exclusive possession act as a result of which native title has been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">They were not claimed in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 The parties seek the determination under s 87A of the Act because strictly speaking it relates only to part of the land and waters covered by the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">However, that part covers 99.99% of the area under the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The balance of the land not affected by the determination comprises two areas in the south west of the claim area amounting to 105.10 square kilometres which were formerly covered by three exploration licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Those licences were current when the application was made but have since been surrendered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Applicants representing the claimants have made a new native title determination application over that area to which it appears s 47B will apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Those areas remain the subject of ongoing mediation with the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">For the reasons that follow, I am prepared to make the determination upon which the parties have agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Statutory framework 
 
7 The application for a consent determination is made primarily under s 87A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The parties, however, submit that it could equally be made under s 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">They say that the agreement they have reached relates both to "an area ... included in the area covered by the application" (s 87A(1)(b)) and "part of the proceedings" (s 87(1)(a)(ii); s 87(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In this connection reference is made to Brown (On behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025 at [14] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The parties note that following the repeal of s 87(1)(d) the Court no longer has first to consider whether an order should be made under s 87A rather than under s 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">They submit, however, that where it is possible for an order to be made under both sections it is preferable to use s 87A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">This is because the balance of the application is deemed to have been amended to remove the area covered by the proposed determination (s 64(1B)) and is exempt from the reapplication of the registration test (s 190A(1A)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The application would remain registered following the amendment and the Registrar would be obliged to amend the Register of Native Title Claims even though the registration test has not been applied (s 190(3)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In this connection the Court was referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Act 2007 (Cth) at [2.62]:
 If an order can be made under section 87A, the order should be made under that provision rather than section 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This is because an order under section 87A will give rise to other measures which will assist in promoting expeditious resolution of claims, including automatic amendment of the claim and exemption from the registration test being reapplied to the amended claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">8 I accept that it is preferable for the order proposed in these circumstances to be made under s 87A rather than under s 87.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Formal requirements of s 87A 
 
9 In their joint submission the State and the applicants have identified a number of formal requirements in s 87A, each of which they say has been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The requirements and the basis upon which it is said they have been satisfied are as follows: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The period specified in the notice given under s 66 of the Act has ended (s 87A(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The notification day referred to in ss 66(8) and 66(10)(c) of the Act ended on 4 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">There is an agreement for a proposed determination of native title in relation to an area included in that covered by the application (s 87A(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The terms of the agreement are reflected in the consent minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">All necessary persons comprising the applicant, the State and other parties to the proceeding whose interest is relevant to the determination area are parties to the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The applicant and the State are the only parties to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Both are parties to the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The terms of the proposed determination are in writing and signed by, or on behalf of, each of the parties (s 87A(1)(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The minute of the proposed determination is in writing and is signed on behalf of the State and the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Registrar of the Federal Court has given notice to other parties to the proceeding that the proposed determination has been filed with the Court (s 87A(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The terms of the proposed determination have been filed with the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The only parties to the proceeding are also the parties to the determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">There is therefore no need for notification under s 87A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 Substantive requirements of s 87A 
 
10 Section 87A(4) authorises the Court to make an order in, or consistent with, the proposed determination of native title without holding a hearing if the Court considers that: 
 
 
 (a) an order in, or consistent with, the proposed determination would be within its power; and 
 
 (b) it would be appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 

11 In their joint submissions the parties have made a number of points relevant to the power of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In short summary they are as follows: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The application is valid as having been made under s 61 of the Act as it stood prior to the amendments made by the Amendment Act 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">There is no pre-existing approved determination in relation to the area the subject of the proposed determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The form of the proposed determination complies with ss 94A and 225 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The parties are agreed: 
 
 
 (a) the conditions for the application of s 47A of the Act have been met in relation to Reserves 40859 and 40930 and General Purpose Lease I126373; and 
 (b) the conditions for the application of s 47B of the Act have been met in relation to areas which were not covered by an interest described in s 47B(1)(b)(i) or (ii), or subject to a resumption process as described in s 47B(1)(b)(iii), when the application was made, 
 

 with the result that any extinguishment of native title in relation to those areas must be disregarded in accordance with these provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">12 The parties submit that the requirements of s 87A are otherwise satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I accept that the proposed order is within power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">13 The appropriateness of the proposed determination does not require that the Court undertake an inquiry into the merits of the claim made in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The State, which has its own competent and well-resourced legal representation, is satisfied as to the cogency of the evidence upon which the applicants rely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">A comprehensive anthropological report was prepared by Dr Lee Sackett, at the request of the representative body and submitted to and considered by the State in September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The State was also given audio-visual materials relevant to the connection between the native title claim group and the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A supplementary report entitled "Custodianship in the Claim Group" by Dr Lee Sackett was supplied in July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">14 The connection report was assessed by the Director of Research in the Office of Native Title, Ms Debbie Fletcher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">She carried out the assessment during the period September 2006 to May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">She conducted a preliminary internal review of the connection material to identify fundamental issues, engaged an independent expert anthropologist to assess the material and obtained legal advice on the merits of the application in light of the connection material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Office of Native Title was satisfied that the information contained in the connection material met its guidelines and on that basis the Deputy Premier accepted the advice and recommendation of the Executive Director of the Office that the State should enter into negotiations toward an agreed determination of native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Office of Native Title was satisfied that the connection material supplied by the applicants supported the existence of a body of traditional laws and customs under which they held rights and interests within the area covered by the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">This was on the basis that: 
 
(a) the ancestors of the Birriliburu claimants held native title rights and interests in relation to the claim area at settlement, and by inference, at sovereignty; 
 
(b) there is evidence of continuity of acknowledgment and observance of traditional laws and customs in relation to the claim area by the claimants and their predecessors from settlement to the present day; and 
 
(c) the claimants form a sub-group of Western Desert society whose members have continued to observe a normative system of laws and customs by which the claimants hold exclusive native title rights and interests in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The native title claim group's connection to their country 
 
15 It is helpful to set out briefly the nature of the native title claim group's connection to the land and waters the subject of the application as set out in the joint submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">That is based upon the material contained in the connection reports prepared by Dr Sackett.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">16 The members of the native title claim group are said to be members of the broader Western Desert cultural bloc, which is the relevant "society" for the purposes of the determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">There are three Western Desert dialects associated with the determination area, namely: Putijara, Kartutjara and Mantjiltjara.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The soak after which the application takes its name is described by the claimants as "mix-up country" where the three dialects overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">17 Most of the claimants reside at Wiluna, Jigalong, Patjarr, Warnarn, Warakurna and Parngurr which are close to, but not inside, the proposed determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Together with people from other parts of the Western Desert they describe themselves as Martu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">They share a body of laws and customs with other Western Desert groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">They acknowledge shared beliefs and rituals and gather for ceremonial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Some of them are recognised native title holders in neighbouring Western Desert areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It is agreed between the parties, however, that the claimants are identifiable as a subset of the wider Western Desert society, being members of 17 family groups and other individuals recognised as custodians with rights and responsibilities in relation to the proposed determination area in accordance with Western Desert laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">They recognise, in accordance with their traditional laws and customs, that certain individuals and family groups are associated with particular areas of country within the proposed determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The final description of the native title holders has been altered between application and determination to define them by reference, inter alia, to descendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Following an inquiry from the Court, about the change, the State Solicitor's Office wrote a letter dated 17 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The solicitors for the applicants agree with the contents of the letter which stated, inter alia: 
 Both the Applicants and the State agreed that the description of the native title claim group in the amended application by reference to 181 named individuals was problematic, principally because of the absence of any reference to the descendants of those named individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That description wrongly implies, firstly, that the claim was made by the Applicants on behalf of individuals holding individual rights and, secondly, that native title will cease to exist on the death of the last surviving individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Also, the description of the native title claim group in the amended application does not differentiate between native title holders who hold rights through descent from an apical ancestor, and those 'custodians' who hold rights by reason of being particularly knowledgeable about country...</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The parties settled on the description of native title holders in the minute having satisfied themselves that the description accurately reflects the position as described in the connection materials (principally the connection report and the genealogies) and captures all native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">That process included the Applicants providing the State with a supplementary report by Dr Lee Sackett to address certain issues arising from the proposed description ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The parties identified a slight inconsistency between membership of the native title claim group as described in the amended application and the native title claim group as described in the minute, but those inconsistencies were explained by the Applicants to the State's satisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Ultimately, the parties formed the view that, for the purposes of the Native Title Act , nothing turned on those inconsistencies in any event ... 
18 The letter from the State Solicitor pointed out that the amended application had not been further amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The position of the parties was that provided the application were valid, the Court could proceed to make a determination in such form as it sees fit based on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It was not limited to making a determination in the form sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In any event, it argued that in circumstances in which the group of proposed native title holders is, in substance, the same group as the native title claim group, an amendment is unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I accept these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">19 A fundamental belief in the Tjukurrpa ("the Dreaming" or "the Law") is the basis of all understanding, according to the traditional laws and customs of the group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It is the source of laws and customs to which the members of the native title holders group adhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It governs their religious practices, social rules, systems of land tenure and other aspects of their life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">20 The association of individuals and groups with particular areas of country comes about through a variety of mechanisms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">These include conception, birth, growing up or initiation on the country, acquisition of knowledge through long residence or descent from a person who has had such a connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Landholding groups are not patrilineally-patrilocally structured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The members of the groups are landholders through their shared association with and to the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The groups are open and inclusive so people have potential access to a number of areas through the mechanisms mentioned above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">21 There are still living senior claimants connected to country by one or more of these means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Various of the custodians specifically named in Schedule 3 to the Determination have rights in country because they are recognised as particularly knowledgeable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The movement away from the proposed determination area as a result of European settlement has resulted in group membership and rights being asserted primarily through descent from a parent or grandparents associated with the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">There are now more fixed family group associations with country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">22 The parties are agreed that the narrowing of pathways to group membership and rights in land does not represent an interruption in the acknowledgment and observance of traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It may represent a change or adaptation of those laws and customs, but it is agreed that the change or adaptation is not of such a kind that the rights or interests now asserted are no longer held under traditional laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Descent remains the means by which people acquire rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">23 It is also common ground that although the applicants do not live on the proposed determination area, they continue to assert their rights and carry out their responsibilities in accordance with their laws and customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Conclusion 
 
24 I am satisfied that the proposed determination is both within power and appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I propose therefore to make it in terms of the minute submitted to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
