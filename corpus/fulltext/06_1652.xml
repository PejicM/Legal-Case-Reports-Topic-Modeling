<sentence id="s0">
 
1 In this proceeding the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the ACCC') sought various remedies against the second respondent ('Mr Carney') for contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The relief sought included declarations that Mr Carney had knowingly been concerned in contraventions of ss 46 and 47 of the Act and the imposition of pecuniary penalties for contraventions of those provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The ACCC alleged that Mr Carney was a person knowingly concerned in contraventions of the Act by the first respondent of which he was, at relevant times, the Managing Director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The proceeding, in so far as it involved the first respondent, was dealt with by Heerey J: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2004] FCA 376 ; (2004) ATPR 41-983.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The circumstances in which the contraventions by the first respondent occurred (and in which it was alleged Mr Carney was knowingly concerned) are explained in his Honour's reasons at [5] to [19] and need not be repeated here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Suffice to say the contraventions were serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">They related to the marketing of sporting products to supporters of Australian Football League clubs and involved attempts by the first respondent (which were to a significant extent successful) to exclude competitor's products from retail outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The ACCC discontinued the proceeding against the third respondent and he gave evidence against Mr Carney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 The trial of the proceeding between the ACCC and Mr Carney commenced on 28 August 2006 and was estimated at that time to take three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Carney represented himself and cross-examined each of the witnesses who was called by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 15 September 2006, at the end of the three week period allotted for the trial, only about half of the ACCC's witnesses had given evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It was estimated that up to a further five weeks would be necessary to complete the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The further hearing of the proceeding was adjourned until 27 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Before the trial was adjourned the parties had agreed to the suggestion that the matter be referred for mediation by a Court appointed mediator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">When the hearing resumed on 27 November 2006 the parties announced that the mediation had been successful and invited the Court to make a declaration and orders in accordance with agreed minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Those minutes read:
 'THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Between September or October 1999 and November 2000, the second respondent was a person involved in a contravention by the first respondent of section 47 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The second respondent pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty pursuant to section 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in respect of his conduct referred to in paragraph 1 above, in the amount of $20,000 by four yearly instalments of $5,000 each, the first such instalment payable on or before 30 June 2007, and the second, third and fourth instalments payable on or before 30 June 2008, 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2010 respectively, provided that if the second respondent defaults in any payment and the default continues for one month after written notice of the default, the total outstanding balance shall become immediately due and payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant and the second respondent bear their own costs of and incidental to the proceeding against the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The proceeding against the second respondent be otherwise dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' 
 

3 Having heard submissions I made the declaration and orders sought and indicated that I would publish my reasons at a later date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">These are those reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">4 The Court is not, of course, bound to make orders giving effect to terms of settlement agreed on between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The principles to be applied by the Court in determining whether to order the imposition of a pecuniary penalty for contravention of the Act, where parties propose a particular sum, are expounded in N W Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (1997) 71 FCR 285 at 290-5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">They are refined and elaborated upon in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 at [51] to [58]; (2004) ATPR 41-993 at [51] to [58].</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I am also mindful of the observations of Emmett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 819 at [46] to [56]; (2004) ATPR 42-011 at [46] to [56].</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In particular, I note the following observations made by his Honour in that case:
 
 
 '[53] ... there is a public interest in prompting settlement of litigation, particularly litigation that is likely to be lengthy and complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Thus, in giving weight to a joint submission on a proposal that would resolve a proceeding, the Court can have regard to the savings of resources both for a regulator, such as the Commission, and for the Court if the proposal were to be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The savings in resources, for example, are capable of being used by the regulator to increase the likelihood that other contraveners will be detected and brought before the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 
 
 
 
 [ 54] The view of a regulator such as the Commission as a specialist body is relevant in determining the question of penalty, although it is by no means determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Court will expect a regulator such as the Commission to explain to it the process of reasoning that has led to the resolution proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In particular, if a proposed penalty involves a discount from that which might otherwise be considered to be the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of cooperation, the Court would expect the Commission to explain the basis upon which the discount had been calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 ... 
 [56] The Court will be mindful that, where an agreed penalty is proposed, there may be elements of compromise involved in both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Thus, it may be that evidentiary difficulties perceived by the Commission would warrant the abandonment of some claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Certainty of outcome for both parties may be a very significant factor in the reasoning process that leads to agreement on penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">For reasons such as those, if the Court is not disposed to impose a penalty proposed by the parties, it would be appropriate to give the parties the opportunity to withdraw consent for all of the proposed orders and to permit the proceeding to continue on a contested basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">"

<sentence id="s40">5 The ACCC opened its case against Mr Carney on the basis that the same evidence would be relied upon in relation to the allegations that he was knowingly involved in the first respondent's contraventions of ss 46 and 47 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The proposed orders would declare that he was knowingly involved in a contravention of s 47 and impose a monetary penalty for such contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The proceeding would otherwise be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The proposed penalty is very much at the lower end of the proper range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">6 In determining to accept the proposed monetary penalty in this case I have had regard to the following considerations:
 
 &#8226; The likelihood that, if the trial were to continue about five more weeks would be needed in order to complete the evidence and hear final submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">&#8226; The resources (both financial and legal) which would have to be deployed if the proceeding continued to judgment and the public interest in the ACCC's resources being applied to other investigations and prosecutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">&#8226; The complexity and uncertainty involved in conducting proceedings under Part IV of the Act and the difficult legal and factual issues involved in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">They include the need to identify the relevant product market, market power for s 46 purposes and the effect upon competition of the alleged conduct for s 47 purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">&#8226; Mr Carney has accepted that he was involved in the first respondent's contravention of s 47 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">&#8226; Mr Carney has not previously been found to have contravened the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">&#8226; At relevant times the first respondent did not have any 'in house' legal advisors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It relied on its external solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Mr Carney had arranged for those solicitors to conduct staff seminars and to prepare a manual to instruct staff on the requirements of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">&#8226; Mr Carney is not presently in receipt of regular income and has a limited capacity to meet any penalty which might be imposed by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">&#8226; The public interest in promoting settlement of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">&#8226; The view of the ACCC that the proposed penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">

7 In agreeing to make the declaration and orders proposed by the parties I have also had regard to the evidence received during the first three weeks of the trial to the extent that it was not contested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I also treat Mr Carney's consent to the making of the orders as 'an admission of all facts necessary or appropriate to the granting of the relief sought': see Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v The Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Associate:
