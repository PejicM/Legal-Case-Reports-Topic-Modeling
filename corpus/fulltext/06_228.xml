<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Monsanto is the proprietor in Australia of a patent for a synthetic plant gene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The gene enables a plant to produce a protein that protects the plant from insect attack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The protein is described as a "vegetative insecticidal protein" or "vip" for short.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Monsanto believes that its patent may be infringed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">But there are two problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">First, Monsanto does not know the identity of the infringer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Second, it is not sufficiently certain that there has been infringement so as to warrant the commencement of an action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It therefore brings this application seeking both "identity discovery" under O 15A, r 3, to identify the infringer and "information discovery" under O 15A, r 6, to determine whether it has a good case for infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 The application is made in the following circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The respondent, Syngenta Seeds Pty Ltd, is part of an international group based in Switzerland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The group operates in the area of agricultural research and development.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Members of the group have published articles about and obtained patents for synthetic plant genes, including genes that produce insecticidal proteins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The use in Australia of genetically modified organisms is regulated by the Gene Technology Act 2000 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In October 2003, Syngenta applied for and was granted a licence to conduct trials for cotton plants that contain a gene for an insecticidal protein which is identified as vip3A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Monsanto suspects that the sequence for the synthetic vip3A may fall within one of the claims of its patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It holds this suspicion because the gene sequence of vip3A which Syngenta has disclosed in several of its publications falls, or is alleged to fall, within one of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Information discovery is sought to determine whether this suspicion is well-founded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 There is a problem with obtaining relief under r 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Several conditions must be satisfied before an order for information discovery can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">One condition is that "there is a reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief ... from a person whose description has been ascertained": r 6(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Monsanto is able to satisfy the first limb of r 6(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There is no need for it to make out a prima facie case for relief; a good arguable case will do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">But -- and here we come to the problem -- Monsanto is not able to satisfy the second limb because it cannot identify, by description or otherwise, the person from whom it believes it can obtain relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Initially Monsanto was proceeding upon the assumption that the person was Syngenta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It turns out, however, that this assumption is incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Through an affidavit filed by its solicitor (Monsanto is prepared to accept as true what the solicitor has said) Syngenta says that (1) it has not conducted and has no plans to conduct any trials or plantings of genetically modified cotton plants or seeds; (2) it has not made and has no plans to make any use of the licence obtained under the Gene Technology Act ; and (3) it has not imported and has no plans to import any genetically modified cotton plants or germ plasm containing the vip3A gene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Thus, while Syngenta did appear to be a good candidate for defendant status in an infringement action, things have moved on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">To obtain an order for information discovery some other person must first be identified as the one from whom Monsanto will seek relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">If an order is made under r 3, the person may be identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">But until that occurs there is no jurisdiction to make an order under r 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">5 Turning then to the application under r 3, it is necessary to sketch out some further facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Monsanto knows that CSIRO has obtained at least four approvals under the Gene Technology Act to plant genetically modified cotton plants that will express the vip3A gene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">It also knows that CSIRO has planted genetically modified cotton plants containing the vip3A gene pursuant to two of those licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The source of that knowledge is information which has been published by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">6 In July 2005 Monsanto, by its solicitors, wrote to CSIRO asking it to provide "documents recording or evidencing the involvement, directly or indirectly, of any of CSIRO or Syngenta or any of its related entities in any actual or proposed releases in Australia (whether for trial purposes or otherwise) of any cotton product expressing the vip3A gene [or] relating to the importation into Australia by or on behalf of, or authorised by, any of CSIRO or Syngenta or any of its related entities of any cotton product expressing the vip3A gene".</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">CSIRO provided a response on 10 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It said that the information and documents requested were either available on the public record or "held by CSIRO subject to an obligation of confidentiality to Syngenta Seeds AG".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">When CSIRO was asked about its obligation of confidentiality it said it "is subject to broad confidential undertakings which prevent CSIRO from disclosing the precise basis of the confidentiality obligations or any documents or information within the scope of the confidentiality obligations without the consent of the party to whom the confidentiality obligation is owed ... CSIRO is, however, prepared to request the consent of the third party to whom CSIRO owes the duty of confidentiality and advise you of the outcome of this request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">" CSIRO was not released from its obligation of confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">7 The information provided by CSIRO indicates that a company in the Syngenta group, other than Syngenta, has played some role in the provision to CSIRO of a cotton product (most probably a seed) that expresses the vip3A gene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">If the vip3A gene falls within any of the claims of Monsanto's patent, that company may have indirectly infringed the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Section 117 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) provides that if the use of a product by a person would infringe a patent, the supply of that product is an infringement of the patent by the supplier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">8 The order for identity discovery is sought to identify that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Syngenta resists the order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It refers to cases which hold that a material factor in deciding whether to make an order are the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the action against the person whose identity is sought to be discovered: see eg, Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It then points out that not only is Monsanto unable to identify a prospective defendant, it is also presently unable to articulate a cause of action against that unknown defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Accordingly, so the argument goes, Monsanto is simply not entitled to an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">9 I accept as correct that in most cases an applicant for identity discovery must show some prospects of success in its proposed action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">A defendant's privacy should not be invaded unless there is good cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">But there is no absolute rule that an applicant must show some prospects of success as a condition to obtaining an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In the first place, r 3 does not contain any such requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Second, there may well be cases where the imposition of such a condition would lead to injustice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This case is a good example of one where it would be unjust to refuse an order because the applicant is unable to show prospects of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The reasons are so obvious they need no further elaboration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">10 The criterion that I would apply is whether Monsanto has shown that it has a claim that is worth investigating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">It may be true that two levels of investigation are required -- one to identify the prospective defendant and another to assess the merits of the claim against that prospective defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">But this should be no bar to an order under r 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">11 There is no need to spend much time considering whether Monsanto has a claim worth investigating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">I think it clear that it has such a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">First, there is a reasonable basis for believing that Monsanto's patent may have been infringed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Second, it seems clear enough that some company in the Syngenta group is involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In any event, the order will not cause much inconvenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">12 In the result, there will be an order for identity discovery and the application for information discovery will be stood over.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It is appropriate there be a Sabre order as well: see Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Company (1993) 46 FCR 428.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Monsanto should bring in short minutes of order for me to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">If there is a dispute about the breadth of what they will seek (as I suspect there might be) I will relist the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
