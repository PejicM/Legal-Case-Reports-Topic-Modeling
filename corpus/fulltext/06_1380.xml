<sentence id="s0">
 
1 A young postal worker died in a motor vehicle accident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He was a member of the Australia Post Superannuation Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Under that scheme, a payment was to be made if he died though he had not nominated who should receive any payment in the event of his untimely death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">A dispute then arose between his parents and a young woman who was the mother of his child, about how the payment should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The trustee of the scheme decided the mother of his child was his de facto spouse and the payment should be made to her (as to 75%) and their child (as to 25%).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">No payment was to be made to his parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The parents challenged this decision in the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In effect, the Tribunal decided not to disturb the decision of the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The parents contend in this Court that in making its decision, the Tribunal fell into legal error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 The proceedings take the form of an "appeal" from the determination of the Tribunal reflected in determination number D05-06/121 dated 17 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appeal is under s 46(1) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Complaints Act ") which enables an appeal to this Court from the Tribunal on a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The first respondent is the trustee of the Australia Post Superannuation Scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal has been joined as second respondent and has filed a submitting appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Background 
 
3 The appellants were the parents of Jason Edwards ("the deceased"), who died in a motor vehicle accident on 6 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">At the date of his death, the deceased was 25 years of age and, on the finding of the trustee and the Tribunal, was in a de facto relationship with Hayley Ifield (though this has been challenged by the parents).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 13 May 2003, a daughter was born of that relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 As noted earlier, the deceased was a member of the Australia Post Superannuation Scheme ("the scheme").</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">He did not complete a 'Nomination of Beneficiary form' for the scheme and died intestate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The total amount of the superannuation death benefit as at 2 December 2004 was $221,509.65.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Australia Post Superannuation Trust Deed in effect at the date of the deceased's death was that amended to 1 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Clause 11.6(a) of the trust deed provided as follows:
 
 Clause 11.6 Payment of Death Benefits 
 
 
 
 (a) Any benefit payable from the Fund on the death of a person who was a Member at the time of his or her death shall be paid or applied by the Trustees to or for the benefit of such one or more of: 
 
 
 
 (i) The Member's Dependants; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) The Member's legal personal representative; 
 
 (iii) if applicable, any other person but only on the terms and in the circumstances permitted under Superannuation Law 
 
 
 
 to the exclusion of others or other of them or in such proportions between them and in such form, manner, and subject to such conditions as the Trustees shall determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 

5 The words "Dependant" and "Spouse" were defined in Clause 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">"Dependant" was defined as follows:
 
 "Dependant" means in relation to a Member or Beneficiary: 
 
 
 (i) the Spouse or Child of a Member or Beneficiary; and 
 (ii) any other person whom in the opinion of the Trustee is, or in the case of a deceased Member or Beneficiary was at the time of his or her death, in any way dependent on the Member or Beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 

6 "Spouse" was defined as follows:
 
 "Spouse" means a person who at the date of death of a Member was in the opinion of the Trustee: 
 
 
 (i) legally married to the deceased Member; or 
 (ii) not legally married to the deceased Member and in the opinion of the Trustee ordinarily living with the deceased Member as his wife or her husband on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 

7 On 21 April 2004, the trustee notified the appellants that it had decided to pay 75% of the death benefit to Ms Ifield and the remaining 25% to the deceased's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Proceedings before the Tribunal 
 
8 On 30 July 2004, the appellants lodged a complaint about the trustee's decision with the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The complaint was made pursuant to s 14(2) of the Complaints Act , which enables a person to make a complaint about certain decisions made by a trustee to the Tribunal "that the decision was unfair or unreasonable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The appellants sought a decision that 75% be paid to the appellants and the deceased's siblings instead of Ms Ifield, with the remaining 25% still to go to the daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Ms Ifield and the daughter were joined as parties in the Tribunal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 The Tribunal conducted the review on the papers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The second appellant and Ms Ifield were both granted requests to be legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The daughter was represented by her grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The request of the first appellant to be legally represented was refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Submissions were received from the appellants, Ms Ifield and the daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">10 The appellants' case before the Tribunal was that they were financially dependent on the deceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They said that they were seriously disabled and unable to work and that the deceased provided them with $50 per week towards rent and had assisted them financially in other ways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He had also assisted one of his siblings to buy a boat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The appellants claimed they had been very close to the deceased and saw him daily, and that had he not died, the deceased would have continued to provide emotional and financial support to his parents and siblings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">11 The appellants claimed that Ms Ifield was not a potential beneficiary, being neither his spouse nor financially dependent on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">They disputed that Ms Ifield and the deceased had lived together as husband and wife, even though they had shared a house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Evidence relied by the appellants included that Ms Ifield was receiving the sole parent pension at the time she claimed to have been in the de facto relationship and that the deceased had not nominated her as a spouse on his tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">12 Ms Ifield claimed that she was the deceased's de facto, having lived with him as his wife for two years prior to his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">She disputed that the appellants were financially dependent on the deceased and that he had given them $50 per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">She submitted that the evidence showed that the appellants and siblings were merely recipients of the deceased's generosity but not that they depended upon him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Tribunal's decision 
 
13 The Tribunal identified the issue it had to address as whether the trustee's determination was fair and reasonable in relation to the appellants and other parties, and not whether the Tribunal would have made the same decision on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In considering the submissions of the parties, it said:
 
 "It is clear that there is considerable antipathy on the part of some of the parties involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In the submissions, there were many disputes of fact on minor issues, as well as accusations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The Tribunal does not propose to involve itself in these issues as they are of little relevance in the determination of this complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">" 

 The Tribunal said that it viewed as relevant to its determination the wishes of the deceased member, the financial circumstances and needs of the potential beneficiaries and the nature of the deceased's relationship with Ms Ifield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">14 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellants or his siblings were financially dependent on the deceased and found that there was no evidence that he had provided them with regular monetary support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Although it accepted that the deceased had made many gifts to his family, the Tribunal did not accept this as evidence that the appellants were financially dependent on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal concluded that both Ms Ifield and the daughter were financially dependent on the deceased, and that he would have wished to support them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was satisfied that the deceased member and Ms Ifield were in "a loving, committed relationship" at the time of his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Pursuant to s 37(6) of the Complaints Act , the Tribunal found that the trustee's decision was "fair and reasonable in the circumstances" and affirmed the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Grounds of appeal and submissions 
 
15 The amended notice of appeal filed 16 August 2006 identified five grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The written submissions of the appellants articulated the grounds differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">They identified five issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I will address the grounds as they emerge from the written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The first issue 
 
16 The first issue concerned the Tribunal's alleged misconstruction of the term "Dependant" in the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The appellants submitted that the Tribunal had failed to consider whether the term "Dependant", which included "any other person whom in the opinion of the Trustee is ... in any way dependent on the Member or Beneficiary" (emphasis added), included not only financial dependence but also encompassed either or both emotional dependence and other forms of dependence, such as financial contribution to the appellants' outgoings on a frequent but not necessarily regular basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">17 The failure to consider or give reasons whether emotional dependence or other dependence was sufficient to constitute dependence for the purposes of the scheme was framed as a failure to take into account a relevant consideration and a failure to make a finding on a material question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">18 The appellants submitted that the Tribunal had narrowly and unreasonably focussed on whether the appellants, as potential beneficiaries, could establish financial dependency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It had narrowly construed the term "in any way dependent" to require evidence of financial dependency and thereby posited a test which was incorrect as a matter of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">19 The appellants relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Petrohilos v Hunter (1991) 25 NSWLR 343.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The appellants submitted that, in that case, in a different but related context, Hope AJA (with whom Clarke and Sheller JJA agreed) refused to confine the term "Dependent", "as used in the statute or otherwise", to the "very limited meaning" of financial dependence (at 386).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Hope AJA instead adopted the definition applied by Samuels JA in Ball v Newey (1988) 13 NSWLR 489 at 491, namely that 'Dependent' in the ordinary sense of the word, means the condition of depending on something or someone for what is needed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The appellants submitted that dependence may arise by reason of expectations of support as manifested by patterns of behaviour which may or may not have monetary value: see Petrohilos at 346.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">They submitted that their evidence to the Tribunal confirmed that they were in need of both emotional and financial support from the deceased, and that he was the only person in the family who was employed and who provided constant comfort, gifts, financial support and contributions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The appellants also relied on the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Cornish and Commissioner for Superannuation (1987) 18 ALD 418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">20 The respondent resisted the appellants' contention that the term "Dependant" as defined in the trust deed extended to emotional dependence and contended that the notion of dependency in the trust deed was limited to financial dependency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">It is unnecessary to detail this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The second issue 
 
21 The second issue was whether the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by constructively failing to exercise its statutory review powers and obligations as contemplated by the Complaints Act , in particular, whether it did so by failing to conduct a hearing de novo which was required by s 37(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Tribunal said that "[t]he issue is not what the decision of the Tribunal would have made on the evidence before it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The appellants submitted that the intention of the Complaints Act is to place the Tribunal in the shoes of the trustee when making a determination in respect of a complaint and, under s 37(1) of the Act, the Tribunal was vested with all the powers, obligations and discretions of the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The Tribunal had also erred by affirming the decision of the trustee as fair and reasonable in circumstances where it was not fair and reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">22 The respondent submitted that, contrary to the appellants' submission, the Tribunal was not required to conduct a hearing de novo and had approached its task in accordance with the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It relied on the Full Court in Cameron v Board of Trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme [2003] FCAFC 214 ; (2003) 130 FCR 122 where it was held that the Tribunal's task in reviewing a decision pursuant to s 37 of the Complaints Act was not to determine whether the decision complained of was the correct or preferable decision but to form a view, from the perspective of the trustee, as to whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable having regard to the framework of the governing rules and terms of the applicable fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It held also that the Tribunal could be satisfied that a trustee's decision was fair and reasonable without reaching its own preliminary view of the issues on the material before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It relied also on the decisions of Mansfield J in Hornsby v Military Superannuation &amp; Benefits Board of Trustees No 1 [2003] FCA 54 ; (2003) 126 FCR 484 and Lykogiannis v Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 327 ; (2000) 97 FCR 361 at [48] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The third issue 
 
23 The third issue concerned the Tribunal's conclusions that Ms Ifield was the deceased's spouse and was dependent on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The appellants submitted that the Tribunal had erred by giving undue weight to irrelevant matters and failing to give adequate weight to relevant matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In particular, the appellants submitted that:
 
&#8226; The Tribunal did not consider whether the deceased ordinarily lived with Ms Ifield on a "permanent and bona fide basis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It instead proceeded on the basis that she was his spouse, without providing its reasons for this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">&#8226; The Tribunal failed to give any weight to a number of relevant facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">These facts were that the deceased member did not claim Ms Ifield as a de facto on his tax returns, that the de facto was receiving the sole parent pension at the time she claimed to be in a spousal relationship with the deceased, that the deceased member earned almost five times that of the de facto spouse (in relation to The Tribunal's finding that household expenses were shared between the deceased member and the de facto), and that Ms Ifield was not named as a co-tenant on the lease of the premises at which the deceased member lived at the time of his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">&#8226; The Tribunal found that the deceased intended sharing his future with Ms Ifield and that they were "in a loving, committed relationship" on the basis of an unexecuted loan application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">&#8226; The Tribunal reached its conclusion that the deceased and Ms Ifield were in a loving and committed relationship despite the failure of the deceased member to nominate her as a beneficiary for the purposes of the superannuation scheme, to claim the existence of a de facto relationship on his tax returns or to include her name on the lease of the premises where he resided at the time of his death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">&#8226; The Tribunal said that it was not prepared to involve itself in "disputes of fact of minor issues" without explaining the facts and issues to which it was referring.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">By ignoring or not involving itself in many disputes of fact, the Tribunal had failed to address whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances and unfairly restricted its review task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Further, the Tribunal was not constrained by the rules of evidence and it was entitled, if not required, to consider disputes of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">24 The respondent submitted that the Tribunal's finding that Ms Ifield was a de facto spouse was a finding of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Tribunal had clearly satisfied itself that the definition of "Spouse" was satisfied on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The appellants' submissions went to issues of weight to be given to the evidence and were not susceptible to challenge on appeal for error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">No issue of Wednesbury unreasonableness had been raised by the submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">25 The respondent also submitted that the Tribunal was not obliged to explain what were the "minor matters" it regarded as irrelevant: see Cameron at [32], where the Full Court refers to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-43 per Mason J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It was clear that the Tribunal had taken into account all the submissions made to it: see HEST Australia Ltd v Sykley [2005] FCA 1381 ; (2005) 147 FCR 248 at [48] - [52] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The fourth issue 
 
26 The appellants submitted that the Tribunal failed to give reasons why it considered certain disputes of fact as minor issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">This is linked to the second issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The fifth issue 
 
27 The final issue was whether the Tribunal erred by reaching a critical conclusion of fact that was not open to it, namely that the deceased member was paying most of the household expenses, notwithstanding that the only evidence available to the Tribunal was that all household expenses were shared between the deceased member and Ms Ifield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">28 The respondent submitted that there was no necessary contradiction between the Tribunal's finding that "all household expenses were shared" and that the deceased paid most household expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">This was because the evidence was capable of supporting the finding that the expenses were shared in unequal proportions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In any event, it was submitted, this was not a critical conclusion of fact for this appeal and had no bearing on the appellants' position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Consideration 
 
29 The appellants' submissions on the first issue involved an assumption which I do not accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The assumption is that the Tribunal acted on the basis that a "Dependant" for the purposes of the trust deed was only a person who was financially dependent on the member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is true that the Tribunal, in its determination, said that in order for the appellants and other members of the deceased's family to be potential beneficiaries, they had to show they were in some way dependent on the deceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">However, in its reasons the Tribunal discussed various aspects of the relationship between the deceased and the appellants including whether there was financial dependency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Tribunal did not say that it would only consider the appellants as potential beneficiaries if they could demonstrate financial dependency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Indeed the Tribunal's discussion appears to proceed on the basis that the appellants could be potential beneficiaries notwithstanding its conclusion that they were not financially dependent on the deceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Were it otherwise, it would have been unnecessary for the Tribunal to address the wishes of the deceased and the nature of the relationship between the deceased and both Ms Ifield and his parents and siblings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal appeared to consider the issue of whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable on the basis of an assumption that the appellants were dependants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It is unnecessary to determine whether, as a matter of construction, the word "Dependant", and notions of dependency in the trust deed, concern only financial dependency as the second respondent submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">30 The appellants' submissions on the second issue also involved an assumption that is not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The task of the Tribunal was to review the trustee's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It has considerable licence in doing so, and was not, in the present case, bound to decide how the payment should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Its task was to determine whether the trustee's determination was unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In engaging in this process it was not necessary for the Tribunal to decide afresh all findings of fact made by the primary decision maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It was necessary for the Tribunal to make its own findings sufficient to determine whether the decision under review was fair and reasonable: Cameron at [42] and [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">31 The third issue does not, in substance, concern a question of law but rather is an attempt to have the Court re-evaluate the material considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">It was a matter for the Tribunal to make what use it wanted of the material before it, having regard to its role as discussed at [30] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It was not incumbent on the Tribunal to resolve all disputes of fact on minor issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">32 The comments in the preceding paragraph are equally applicable to the fourth issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">33 Similarly the fifth issue is answered by the observations made at [30] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">34 The appeal should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">I certify that the preceding thirty four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
