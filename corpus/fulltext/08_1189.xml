<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Nicola Tana has had a number of successes in various business enterprises with which he has been associated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He is the managing director of North East Equity Pty Limited, and he has effectively controlled the company since he established it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In September 1998 North East Equity purchased a carrot processing plant at Mandogalup Road, Wattleup, which is south of Fremantle in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The plant had previously been operated by the Sumich group, but that group had gone into receivership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">However, after the purchase, North East Equity continued to sell some carrots and other produce under the Sumich brand name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 In 2002 Mr Tana negotiated with his then friend, David Proud, to replace some of the less sophisticated Sumich plant with a more modern processing plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Mr Proud was the principal of a business called Proud Machinery, which operated under the trading name of Proud Nominees Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I will refer sometimes to both Proud Machinery and Mr Proud simply as 'Proud'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The negotiations took many months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 In October 2002 North East Equity agreed with Proud Machinery to pay it $3 million to purchase and install new equipment for the carrots processing plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The new equipment was installed in March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Since then Mr Tana and Mr Proud have disagreed about whether the new plant and equipment were satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 North East Equity claimed many millions of dollars in damages and economic loss based on loss of carrots sales, breach of contract, contraventions of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and negligent misstatement, although in final address an alternative claim was also made in the order of $1 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">North East Equity also claimed that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud had represented that the plant and equipment would perform at the standards set in the contract, which was the basis of its claims of contraventions of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and in negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">There were many disputes as to whether the new plant, as finally installed by Proud Machinery, operated either to the contractual or represented standards, and how any loss of North East Equity should be assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 A further complicating factor is that, after entry into the contract with Proud Machinery, North East Equity financed the acquisition of plant and equipment by entering into a master lease with the Bank of Western Australia Limited, under which the bank took an assignment of all of North East Equity's rights under the contract with Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">That raised an issue whether North East Equity could sue Proud Machinery for breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS 
 
 6 As Mr Tana said, his discussions with Mr Proud '... were very informal'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Mr Tana asked for a plant that could process and pack 150 tonnes in an 8 hour working day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Mr Tana explained that the purpose of the 8 hour day was to condense his packing operations into a one-day shift, and thus avoid paying his workers penalty rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Tana said that he told Mr Proud that he needed to achieve a minimum temperature of 5deg.C for the cores of the carrots when they were packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 Mr Tana also asked that the plant have the ability to grade, automatically or mechanically, the carrots into various sizes, in order to replace the then-present process where this grading was done manually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Carrots can be graded by sorting them according to their width (or girth) and their length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Ultimately, as part of the contract, North East Equity's staff specified to Proud Nominees five widths and three lengths into which the carrots should be able to be graded by the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 Mr Tana and Mr Proud agreed that the new plant would result in an increase in the efficiency of North East Equity's labour usage, compared with the existing Sumich plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">9 In the course of their discussions, Mr Tana told Mr Proud that the principal source of carrots for the Wattleup plant would be an existing farm at Guilderton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Guilderton was about one hour's drive north of Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Tana explained that it was his intention to establish a larger farm, to replace the majority of the suppliers of the Wattleup plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This new farm was to be at Lancelin, about 180 km north of Wattleup, and further up the Western Australian coast from Guilderton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Tana's long-term plan was to have both his growing and packing operation on the premises at Lancelin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">But, he needed an interim plant at Wattleup until he brought the Lancelin operation into production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A new processing and packing plant would be built at Lancelin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">10 Mr Proud told Mr Tana that he had recently been involved in supplying a Queensland carrot producer, Kalfresh, with a new automated carrot processing line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr Tana sent North East Equity's maintenance manager, John Webster, to Queensland to inspect Kalfresh's plant prior to deciding to purchase the new plant from Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr Tana also travelled to Belgium to speak with the manufacturer of some of the proposed new plant and inspected three factories there to observe similar equipment in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">North East Equity claimed that Proud represented that there would be savings on power costs based on Kalfresh's experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">11 The new plant was installed in early March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">After that, the parties became engaged in disputes about its performance, which I will come to later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">MR TANA'S JULY 2002 NOTES 
 
 12 In July 2002 Mr Tana prepared a document headed 'DAVID [PROUD] INITIAL NOTES'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">During the pre-contractual negotiations in July 2002 Mr Tana handed Mr Proud a copy of that note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Mr Tana could not recall doing this, but I am satisfied that he did.</sentence>

13 Mr Proud said that Mr Tana's note formed the basis for the preparation of the agreement to supply the new plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The references in the note to 'Brunogh [sic] and Gillenkirsch [sic]' were intended to refer to manufacturers of equipment intended to be used in the new production line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">These were a Belgium company, Bruynooghe, which manufactured the grading and associated equipment which sorted carrots into various sizes by width (or girth) and length, and Gillenkirch, a German manufacturer of packing equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">PROUD MACHINERY'S LETTER OF 29 JULY 2002 
 
 14 By the time Mr Tana provided the handwritten note to Mr Proud, much discussion had already taken place between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Shortly after Mr Tana's note was provided, Mr Proud wrote to Mr Tana on 29 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The letter commenced by saying:
 
 'The following is an outline of the system which I believe will fulfil your desire to pack 150 tonnes of carrots over an eight hour working day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">' 
 

15 Mr Proud then described 22 items which were to be included in the proposed system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">First, the existing plant's equipment for receiving and polishing the carrots was to be retained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">16 That existing equipment operated in the following way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">When carrots were brought to the plant, they were contained in large wooden crates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There is a significant issue as to the weight of carrots contained in those crates, which, depending on which account is correct, varied between 400, 410 and 450 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A forklift truck would pick up two of these crates at a time and move them to the tipping station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The forklift would raise the crates up to a level where they sat on a platform on the tipping station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">After the forklift tines were withdrawn, the crates would be held in place on the platform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The platform would then tip, so that the carrots contained in the crates would spill into hoppers or large bins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">From there, they were conveyed mechanically, on conveyor lines, to inspection or grading tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">At this point the carrots were visually assessed as they moved along a conveyor belt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Carrots that looked damaged or unsuitable would then be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Thus, sometimes when the carrots were tipped into the receiving hopper, they might have become broken or chipped by contact with some sharp edge or other carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Such carrots are not attractive to consumers, who prefer produce which appears to be in good condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The rejected carrots, however, are able to be used commercially, for example, in commercial production of composite foods or in juice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">17 Obviously, the greater the accuracy at which unsuitable carrots are removed at this point, the more efficient the further processing will be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The subsequent stages of the processing plant will not have to deal with carrots that, ultimately, will not be packed at the end of the processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">18 After the carrots passed along the conveyor belt across the inspection or grading stations, they then proceeded into brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">These machines used water and brushes which rotated and washed the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Dirt and other residue, including root hair, were scrubbed off, so that the skin of the carrot appeared to be clean and fresh-looking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">19 Mr Proud's letter then proposed that a new stainless steel wet receiving hopper would be installed after the old brush polishers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">This would spread the carrots more evenly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">They would then be conveyed onto one of two flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">These would carry the carrots upwards on their way to automatic grading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">As the carrots passed upward on the flumes, they would be sprayed with water to rinse them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">At the top of the elevator, two infeed vibrators would be positioned to spread the carrots evenly across the conveying belt, which was two metres wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The vibrators were intended to be positioned to minimise the chance that any carrots might fall off the elevated platforms to which they had been carried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">20 Next, the diameter (or girth) sizers or graders would grade the carrots into five separate diameters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The diameters could be set by the operator of the equipment adjusting a hand wheel which was equipped with a gauge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">As the carrots passed over the diameter graders, they would fall through holes in the conveying belt that were wider than the width of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">After the carrots fell through such holes, they were received onto other conveyor belts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The smallest carrots would fall through first, followed by progressively larger ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The lower conveyor belts ran horizontally away from the diameter grader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Mr Proud said that the diameter graders would be accessible from a suitable platform and stairway, and would be serviced by a centralised lubrication unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">He said that there would be automatic lubrication systems as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He said that the output for Mr Tana's expected production would allow for the graders to operate at the lower end of their available speed '... which will reflect in the quality and service of each of these units'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">21 The five lower or 'exit' conveyors would carry, respectively, five streams of graded carrots ranging from smallest to largest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The smallest and the extra large carrots would be taken by their two conveyors directly to a receiving water tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The small/medium, medium and large carrots would be transferred to three stainless length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">These would run horizontally to the exit conveyors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The letter of 29 July 2002 said that the length graders '... have the ability to split these diameters into two selections which will then transfer into the desired chiller tank'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The letter said that, in order to control the transfer of selected sizes to the correct water tanks, 24 pneumatic gates would be positioned at appropriate locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The gates would be activated from the main control panel for the whole system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">22 In the letter, Mr Proud recommended that nine receiving water or chiller tanks be installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The receiving tanks would each hold up to 10 tonnes of a particular grade of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mr Proud wrote that those '... will give you one tank for each of the selected diameter and length grade and one extra tank for the purpose of receiving any grade which exceeds the ten tonne capacity allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">This will also give you an opportunity to have a spare tank in the case of a pump malfunctioning or for cleaning purposes as it is possible to drain any tank without interfering with the others'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">For example, the smallest diameter carrots would have been conveyed from the initial exit conveyor underneath the commencement of the diameter grader directly to a receiving tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That tank would be full of chilled water intended to cool the carrots' core temperature to the 5deg.C referred to in Mr Tana's note.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">23 The receiving tanks could be emptied by the plant operator causing air to agitate the carrots from below, and water to flow out of the tank into an intra-lock exit conveyor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The exit conveyor would allow the chilled carrots, which had been carried out of the receiving tank, to be conveyed to the packing stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">And, the exit conveyor also drained the water propelling the chilled carrots out of the receiving tanks into the return water tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">A water compensation tank would also be installed to hold any water that could not be used immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Next, water which had been recycled through the return water tank was pumped through a drum filter to remove debris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Then the chiller tank would receive the filtered water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Chilling coils were placed inside that tank which would lower the water to the desired temperature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Mr Proud wrote that he was proposing to make further enquiries with Mr Webster about North East Equity's refrigeration requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Proud said he would then be able to evaluate the existing refrigeration plant and what changes might be proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">24 Mr Proud said that the exit conveyors and gate system proposed would enable the operator to select any size and diameter of carrot to be sent to a particular packing site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">He said that he had allowed for a one-bin filling station which would have the ability to receive any size selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Delivery belts would control the flow of the chilled carrots to the intended packing station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">25 The letter gave the following description of the automatic control system which it proposed would be used by the plant operator:
 
 ' Item 16 Automatic Control System 
 
 One central PLC [Programmable Logic Control] will control the whole system using a 12.1 touch screen for full access of all perimeters of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">A graphical operator interface results in a user friendly operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">
 
 This system is a stand alone unit which can be connected to your main office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">A modem is installed to assist in program changes or troubleshooting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 Brief description of the control system 
 
 During the filling of the water tank the system activates the water pumps and the blowers to spread the product evenly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The water being pumped escapes into the Return Tank at a rate which is controlled through a PT100 Temperature Sensor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">
 
 The temperature of the tank is controlled through this PT100 sensor which ensures that we efficiently chill the received produce to its desired packing temperature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">
 
 When we select a desired grade to a packing position the pumps and blower are activated in an appropriate manner to obtain a constant product output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">A PID Control Loop calculates the speed of the pump and the blower motor to ensure this controlled feed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 
 It is also possible to bypass the program and in this way the operator can take over the machine in a manual mode and this has a password protection to ensure security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

26 The Wattleup plant used three carton filling stations, consisting of a combination of the Newtec weighing and Gillenkirch packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Mr Proud proposed that there be two additional Newtec/Gillenkirch carton filling stations, to make a total of five.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The way these carton filling stations worked was that the weighing machine would be set to measure either 10 or 20 kg quantities of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The desired quantity would then be packed into an appropriate 10 or 20 kg carton by the Gillenkirch packing machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Before the carrots went to the weighing machine, they would be conveyed over a final grading table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">At that point, they would be inspected for quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The persons at the grading table would pick up and throw into designated tubes, first, Class 2 carrots and, secondly, any damaged carrots which had not been removed at the initial grading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Class 2 carrots were ones that either had escaped notice in the initial grading, or subsequently had become damaged as they passed along the various parts of the processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Thus, carrots may have chipped or been damaged when they fell as they passed through the diameter or length grader holes or as they were mixed about in the process of being received into or taken out of the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The persons performing visual inspections at the final grading tables would remove these imperfect carrots from those destined for the carton filling stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Mr Proud suggested that the existing tanks in the old system be repositioned to receive, by conveyor belts, the carrots that were rejected at the final inspection tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">27 The 29 July 2002 letter also noted that the weighing and packaging equipment used in the existing prepack line could be included in the new design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Mr Proud suggested that he might be able to increase the productivity of the prepack line with new equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The prepack line was used to weigh automatically and then pack very small carrots into plastic bags of, say 0.5, 1 or 2 kg, each for display for sale in supermarkets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Small and small/medium carrots would be conveyed for prepacking from a chilling tank to a conveyor with a grading table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">From there, the sorted carrots would be conveyed to where they were weighed and packed into plastic bags, and then to cartons whence they would be carried along the final conveyor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">28 In addition, Mr Proud had incorporated Mr Tana's proposal that the existing hand-packing line be retained and incorporated into the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">This line conveyed particular classes of carrots which were hand-packed in smaller quantities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For example, the handline could process carrots that required closer than usual inspection, and those of which a small volume had been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">29 Next, all of the packed cartons were conveyed to two robots located at the end of the various lines, which automatically removed the cartons from the lines and stacked them onto pallets ready to be moved into the cool room by a forklift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">30 At the conclusion of the letter, before noting that he was still trying to calculate the cost, Mr Proud wrote:
 
 'Please consider this proposal as I believe that thru [sic] its implementation your company will profit from the following: 
 
 
 
 Quality of sizing length &amp; diameter 
 Controlled temperature for packing 
 Greatly reduced amount of crop being damaged and wasted 
 Reduction of fork lifts required to run the existing operation 
 Ability to pack out over an 8 hour day 
 Only require bins for the infeed of the line 
 Maintenance and down time will be minimised 
 Increase of production whilst reducing the man hours required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">'

<sentence id="s162">MR WEBSTER'S MEMORANDUM OF 1 AUGUST 2002 
 
 31 Mr Tana sought Mr Webster's input on the proposal and the then drawings of the suggested plant layout.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">On 1 August 2002 Mr Webster provided Mr Tana with a list of matters for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">He pointed out that an 8 hour shift was, in reality, only 7 hours of work, after taking account of the employees' rest breaks and an amount of inefficiency in an ordinary working day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He then gave a worked example to show that, in 7 hours, the five packing machines could process 7,350 cartons of 20 kg each, equivalent to 147 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">He had based this on each of the Gillenkirch packing machines being able to process three and a half 20 kg boxes per minute consistently over the whole of the seven effective working hours of an 8 hour shift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">32 Mr Webster wrote that this level of output would occur as long as the brush washers could keep up with the present 14-15 tonnes per hour to produce what he called 'a good polished carrot'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Importantly, he said that, at 15 tonnes per hour for such a quality, the brush washers could only produce 105 tonnes over 7 hours, and continued:
 
 'This means prior to shift start we would need 3 hrs at 15TPH to fill all tanks ready to get a total of 150 tonnes (9 tanks can hold 90 tonnes), so in effect becomes a 10 hour day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">?</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">hrs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">' 
 

33 Mr Webster observed that the 150 tonne target should be achievable because the prepack line's production was not included in the above figures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He noted that one of the drawings then being considered showed five inspection tables, one at each box filler, and observed that probably only three were required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He suggested that one inspection table could be used for two box fillers, so that only three inspection tables would be required between the five box fillers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">He commented that, because sizing should not be a problem for both girth and length, it would be possible to grade for Class 2 medium and large carrots at the inspection tables located prior to the box fillers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He said that the Class 2 carrots could then be able to be stored in the two old surplus Wyma (brand) wet tanks until they were packed later in the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">34 Mr Webster wrote that he had had discussions with Ms Mirosevich and they had estimated that no more than 32 people would be needed to operate the new automated plant (leaving out the handline and prepack line).</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He gave an example of a 10 hour day in which the forklift and grading (at the inspection tables located immediately after the wet hopper) would start at 6.00am so that 45-50 tonnes could be accumulated in tanks by about 9.00am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The shift of workers operating at that section of the plant could finish at 2.00pm and a new team could arrive to do 3 hours more work until 5.00pm and then clean up for an hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Thus, the second shift would do 4 hours per day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Mr Webster continued by observing that the pack out lines would be able to operate from 9.00am to 5.00pm for shifts of between seven and six effective working hours, or a 38 hour working week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">35 These observations to Mr Tana by his two principal employees responsible for the operation of the existing plant are of considerable significance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Webster was commenting on both the quality of carrot and the capacity of the existing brush washing machines which were to be used as the initial feed for the new plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Those machines could not supply 150 tonnes worth of good polished carrots in 8 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">If they were worked continuously for 8 hours and produced the maximum that Mr Webster suggested of 15 tonnes per hour, they could only produce 120 tonnes in an 8 hour shift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">36 Both Mr Tana and Mr Proud understood that the brush washers could operate to process about 22.75 tonnes per hour, but that this would affect the quality of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I accept Mr Proud's evidence that, in 2002, he discussed with Mr Tana that, at that speed of processing, the carrots would be insufficiently polished and would retain some hairs and green matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">As Mr Tana said:
 
 'The amount of polishing required is a quality issue that was not part of the brief to Proud anyway.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">' 
 

37 However, Mr Proud would have been conscious of the efficient operation and capacity of the brush washers and the need to operate them in a way to maintain the quality of his customer's (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">North East Equity's) product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Mr Tana was aware of the consequence of increasing the speed of the brush washers beyond Mr Webster's suggested 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Mr Tana said in re-examination:
 
 '... the function of the brush washer, it is to polish the carrots and that is a choice that we make in terms of the quantum of polishing that happens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">We can accelerate the process and in so doing brush off less of the epidermal layer or we can slow the process down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">' 
 

38 Thus, it was clear to Mr Tana that, to achieve his objective of 150 tonnes in an 8 hour shift, he would have to have his work force operating on split shifts as Mr Webster's memorandum had discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">In that way, it would be possible for the work force, efficiently managed, to have the individual workers paid only for 8 hour or shorter shifts, but they would not all work during the same 8 hours in any one day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Indeed, as the expert evidence made clear, split shifts in the food packaging and processing industry are common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">I am satisfied that Mr Tana was, at all times, fully cognisant of this fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Moreover, I find that Mr Tana was aware, and believed that Mr Proud was aware, that the workforce at Wattleup took lunch breaks and two 'smoko' or rest breaks during the course of their 8 hour shifts, so that an 8 hour shift did not translate into 8 hours of work, but rather into 7 hours, as Mr Webster's memorandum illustrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">MR TANA VISITS BELGUIM TO ASSESS BRUYNOOGHE 
 
 39 Around July or August 2002 Mr Tana went to Belgium and was met by Bruynooghe's export manager, Marc Seldeslachts and taken by him to its head office and factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Mr Proud had arranged for Mr Tana to make the visit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Before the visit, Mr Tana had an understanding of what Bruynooghe's processing system involved through his discussions with Mr Proud, his understanding of the drawings that Mr Proud had supplied showing possible configurations of the new processing line, and a video of the new Kalfresh plant operating which Mr Proud had shown him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Mr Tana understood that Bruynooghe's system of processing involved tank systems with water movement of the carrots, and that this feature would be an integral part of the upgrade which Mr Proud was proposing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">By then, he was aware that the likely cost involved was between $2-3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Mr Tana understood that Bruynooghe's system involved initial grading of both the girth and length of the carrots together with a hydro-cooling system using chilled water to cool the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">While he was at Bruynooghe's head office, he met its managing director or owner, Stefan Parrein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He was given a presentation of the various parts of the system and was impressed by both what was presented and the presenters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">40 Messrs Parrein and Seldeslachts showed Mr Tana a DVD demonstrating the tank system and carrot movement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">They explained to him what the DVD was demonstrating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">He was then taken to observe three Bruynooghe plants in operation at various factories, one of which he considered to be similar to that which Mr Proud was proposing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Mr Tana enquired of the Bruynooghe personnel about a number of matters, including the tonnage which the graders could process per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He formed the view that Bruynooghe were capable of manufacturing the components, and he was comfortable with both their responses and his observations of the equipment in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">41 Prior to organising this visit, Mr Proud had shown Mr Tana a DVD of the Kalfresh plant with the Bruynooghe system in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">While he was at Bruynooghe's offices he was shown drawings of the then current version of the design for the Wattleup plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He said that he discussed the drawings in general terms with Messrs Parrein and Seldeslachts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">They told him that they represented the system that was going to be provided for Mr Tana's job in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">42 However, Mr Tana said in his evidence that he had not gone to Belgium to understand technical specific matters about the Bruynooghe line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">He said that he did not ask them about the drawings or any aspect of them because he recognised the items and '... [s]o there was nothing for me to ask them in that'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">He said that he had no concerns and was comfortable with what he had seen in Belgium and therefore did not raise any matters with Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">He noticed that, in Belgium, carrots were not graded after they had gone through the hydro-cooler tanks, apart from removing rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">He said that he had not noticed any length grading occurring in the Belgium operations that he had been shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">43 In his written evidence, Mr Tana went as far as claiming that he had no prior knowledge of the Bruynooghe tank system and '[a]ll of my knowledge came from [Mr] Proud's representations to me'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">He said this in responding to Mr Webster's evidence that Mr Tana had rung him from Belgium sounding very excited and had said: 'It looks like this could be the way to go'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In cross-examination Mr Tana accepted the accuracy of Mr Webster's account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">He sought to explain his written response to it as relating to his initial discussions with Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">I reject Mr Tana's evidence seeking to minimise his investigations, knowledge and understanding of the Bruynooghe system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">As he said in cross-examination: 
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">I had availed myself of knowledge by going to see the system itself, by having sent John Webster by [sic] Queensland to view the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">' 
 

44 Mr Tana said that he was taken to a plant in Belgium with a similar operation to that he was contemplating for Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">He claimed not to recall whether he saw a length grader at a plant in Belgium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">I infer that, in Belgium, Mr Tana ensured for himself by his discussions with Bruynooghe and his inspections, how each important part of the equipment described in Proud Machinery's letter of 29 July would operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">That is why he was so enthusiastic when speaking from Belgium with Mr Webster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I also find that Mr Tana observed in operation Bruynooghe length graders of the kind later installed in his new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">PROUD MACHINERY'S LETTER OF 30 SEPTEMBER 2002 
 
 45 The negotiations culminated in late September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">On 30 September 2002, Mr Proud sent a letter to Mr Tana which began by referring to 'the following responses to your list of requests'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Mr Proud indicated that he would like to discuss them promptly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only document in evidence that could amount to such a list appears to be the initial handwritten notes of Mr Tana, to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">It is likely (and I find) that Mr Proud's letter was addressing these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The letter stated:
 
 ' Production expectations 
 
 Proud Machinery agrees that the line will have the capacity to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour with a maximum of 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">This calculates to 18.75 tonnes/hr final packout on the pallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">
 
 Utilizing all of the packaging and palletizing equipment which is shown in the final layout.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">I have used the following as a basis of our calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">
 
 Pre pack Line 
 
 Pre pack consists of a 2012/2G45 and 2009/G45 which have the ability to pack a conservative 50 units / min or 3000 packs/hr.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">
 
 50% @ 500 gms = 750 kg per hour 
 25% @ 1000 gms = 750 kg per hour 
 25% @ 1250 gms = 937 kg per hour 
 
 Total production per hour 2.437 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 Maximum allowance for daily production 12.5 tonne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 Five Gillenkirch CBF3000 carton fillers will achieve the following: 
 
 150 Cartons/hr each = 750 Cartons @ 20kg = 15 tonnes/hr 
 
 180 Cartons/hr each = 900 Cartons @ 20kg = 18 tonnes/hr 
 
 240 Cartons/hr each = 1200 Cartons @ 20 kg = 24 tonnes/hr 
 
 Hand Line 
 
 The relocated hand line will also allow you to pack any low volume sizes or carrots which require closer inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">
 
 Min 20 Cartons/hr each packer = 60 Cartons @ 20kg = 1.2 tonnes/hr 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 By using these calculations and several combinations of the same we are able to achieve the desired pack out of 18.75 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">
 
 Temperature of pack out 
 
 After discussions with Gary North, I am able to advise you that he would be comfortable in working with your refrigeration technicians in the supply and installation of the required equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">
 
 Gary North has advised me that he will guarantee a maximum 5 degree celcius core temperature for your carrots and will be contacting John Webster for further technical discussions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">' 
 

46 The letter then referred to commencing assembly on the site early in January and required that North East Equity would make the site available for commencement of the installation on 2 February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">Proud Machinery agreed to a penalty of $5,000 per day if the line were not operational by 7 March 2003, up to a maximum limit of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Mr Proud wrote that he would be in contact with Amaroo, a company in South Australia, which was building another processing plant at Renmark using equipment supplied by Proud Machinery to arrange training for Mr Webster and Ms Mirosevich when the new system was commissioned at Renmark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">The letter continued by stating that Proud Machinery was responsible for all contractors on the installation, excluding power supply to the line, plumbing work and water supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">North East Equity would be responsible for the sea freight for up to 10 x 40 foot containers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Proud Machinery agreed to accept letters of credit for Newtec and Gillenkirch equipment and was negotiating with Bruynooghe for similar conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The irrevocable letter of credit would be claused to provide for a payment of 50% on shipping, 40% on delivery and 10% on commissioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The letter continued:
 
 'The refrigeration is supplied require a 20% deposit and will discuss with you directly the balance of payment but have indicated that no furthur would be required prior to delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">
 
 Proud Machinery will also be invoicing North East Equity for the project management and co ordination of the equipment an amount of $233,000.00 over 5 equal monthly payments of $46,600.00 commencing October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">' [sic] 
 

47 On 1 October 2002 North East Equity issued a purchase order signed by Mr Webster to Proud Machinery in the following terms:
 
 'This Purchase Order is in a response from a letter from Proud Machinery dated 30/9/02 that N.E.E./Sumich and PROUD MACHINERY are at an agreed position to start production of new machinery from Newtek, Gillenkirch and Broonoogh [sic] (Handline &amp; pre-pack to still be agreed)' 
 

48 On the same day, one of Mr Proud's companies, Steventon Lodge Holdings Pty Ltd, invoiced North East Equity $46,600 plus $4,660 GST (a total of $51,260) for 'Sourcing, project management, coordination and supervision for new carrot packing and distribution line installed by Bruynooghe of Belgium and Gillenkirch of Germany'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">PROUD MACHINERY'S LETTER OF 8 OCTOBER 2002 &amp; THE AMENDMENTS OF 14 &amp; 18 OCTOBER 2002 
 
 49 Next, on 8 October 2002, Mr Proud wrote to Mr Tana referring to 'Revision S' of the drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">The letter commenced by stating:
 
 'Proud Machinery would like to confirm the terms and conditions of your contract to purchase the items listed in the attached schedule and included in drawing No SUM-000-Revision S.' 
 

The attached schedule listed 45 items of equipment and services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It identified the supplier in each case, except for refrigeration which was to be advised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">The letter said:
 
 'All ancillary equipment will be controlled through the main control board for easy start up and shut down of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The clients must supply a modem connection to the Bruynooghe control board which will allow for fast and efficient factory back up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">' 
 

50 The letter reiterated the terms of the penalty clause and that Proud Machinery would be responsible for ensuring that all contractors and employees of Proud Machinery performing duties for it on site were covered by appropriate Workcover and Public Liability Insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Proud Machinery also had the right to make minor alterations to the layout of the line, so that the produce could be handled more gently and efficiently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">It continued:
 
 ' Production expectations 
 
 Proud Machinery agrees that the line will have the capacity to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour with a maximum of 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">This calculates to 18.75 tonnes/hr final packout.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">
 
 Total Investment Value $3,000,000.00 plus GST' 
 

51 The letter specified a similar payment schedule to the earlier letters, except that all payments were now to be by transferable and irrevocable letter of credit in favour of Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The letter stipulated that all equipment would remain the property of Proud Machinery until final payment was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">It was signed by both Mr Tana and Mr Proud on behalf of their respective companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">In addition to the schedule of equipment and services, there was a schedule which identified different lengths and girths of carrots to be graded by the equipment and the tank to which they were to be sent, once graded, by the conveying equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">52 On 14 October 2002 an amendment was made to that schedule by North East Equity, and the amended schedule was faxed to Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The final requirements for the production line were then set out as follows:

53 On 18 October 2002 Mr Proud wrote a further letter to Mr Tana which they both signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The letter noted that, among other things, any alterations made by Proud Machinery to the layout of the line must not impact on its efficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">It said that the contract price was fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Proud Machinery also transmitted some drawings at the same time as this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The drawings depicted an alternative configuration adding a sixth box filler, if that were required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">They showed the dimensions of the grading tables located immediately before the carrots were conveyed to the box fillers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">These depicted three persons standing at the grading tables, which were 3 metres in length, and showed chutes for the graders to throw Class 2 and reject carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">54 In a number of respects, I found Mr Tana to be an unsatisfactory witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">One instance of this was his evidence concerning his visit to the Bruynooghe factory in Belgium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In March 2001 Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud complaining about the operation of the Gillenkirch packing units installed at Wattleup, and stating that he placed a large emphasis on manufacturer advice, '... as we expect that their equipment will do what it is meant to do'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">He admitted in evidence that he did place a large emphasis on manufacturer advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">He took the trouble to visit Bruynooghe and to go on a tour of three different plants showing Bruynooghe's equipment in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Bruynooghe was the manufacturer of an integral part of the system that he was considering purchasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">It had the proposed drawings of the new plant available for discussion with Mr Tana when he visited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Yet, in his evidence, Mr Tana sought to convey that his dealings with Bruynooghe in Belgium were unimportant, notwithstanding that he was, at that time, contemplating a substantial investment of over $2 million in new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Originally, in his witness statement he said:
 
 'I did not go back to David Proud with any concerns because I assumed that he had taken all of my requirements and the changes that would be necessary because of those requirements into account when the Sumich [Wattleup] system was designed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">' 
 

55 In cross-examination Mr Tana agreed that this statement could be read as suggesting that he did have concerns, but had not mentioned them to Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">He claimed that he had no concerns about how Bruynooghe's systems applied to what was proposed at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">In addition, because of his perception of shortcomings in equipment that had been supplied by Mr Proud in the past, Mr Tana asserted that he had reservations during the course of negotiations for the new Wattleup plant about Mr Proud's business dealings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">This was notwithstanding that he and Mr Proud were friends at that time, socialised together and would have dinner with their respective wives when visiting one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Indeed, they had gone on an overseas trip together with their wives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">He claimed that he regarded Mr Proud as a salesman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">He asserted in his witness statement:
 
 'Given the problems experienced in the past, the size of the financial commitment and the central importance of the packing lines to the Sumich [Wattleup] business, I was cautious about Proud's ability to meet NEE's requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">That is why the requirements were specifically documented ...' (emphasis added)
 

56 Mr Tana admitted that, except for the handwritten notes that he gave Mr Proud in July 2002, he had not documented his requirements and instead had simply relied on Mr Proud's documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">When he was taken to his handwritten notes during the course of cross-examination, Mr Tana had no recollection of sending them, or the circumstances in which he gave them to Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">He said that those notes represented his requirements '[a]s at that day', but that the discussions continued '... and the requirements were confirmed and finalised [in] a letter from David [Proud]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Mr Tana accepted that the notes may have been given to Mr Proud during the course of their meeting during 2002, and that they did not represent his overall requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">He then gave this evidence:
 
 'Do you say that at some point after this document was created your requirements changed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">--- My requirements never changed .</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">My requirements were still these but there was still a requirement for my operational personnel to fill in and that was a subsequent meeting or a meeting prior and that will have to come out with evidence from Mira [Mirosevich].</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">She sat in the office and they started to talk about sizing, about streams of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">That formed part of the contract as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">' (emphasis added)
 

57 The requirement for the operational personnel to which Mr Tana referred was specified in the two schedules, the first attached to Proud Machinery's letter of 8 October 2002, and the second in the facsimile with the amended requirements sent by North East Equity on 14 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">58 Ms Mirosevich had been involved in the specification to Proud Machinery of how the carrots were to be graded and the tanks to which they were to be sent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">This was a task she undertook with Mr Webster and Frank Chew, then the sales manager of North East Equity's carrot business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">These specifications were originally supplied to Proud Machinery and included in Mr Proud's letter of 8 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">Subsequently, the amendment made on 14 October 2002 was sent by North East Equity to Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">In cross-examination Ms Mirosevich sought to assert, instead, that Mr Proud decided which tanks were to be used for what produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Ultimately, she conceded that she had agreed to provide Proud Machinery and Mr Proud with the final specification of 14 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">She sought also to distance herself from her involvement in considering the proposed designs of the plant before it was made, but I think this was because she was given tasks by Mr Tana which were beyond her abilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">I do not accept her evidence that suggested she had little involvement in those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">It was important for her, as the production manager, to be substantively involved in this design and specification work, and I find that she was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">CONTRACT FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE NEW LINE 
 
 59 It was common ground that a contract was made in writing on 18 October 2002 between North East Equity and Proud Machinery, comprised of the letter from Proud Machinery dated 30 September 2002, North East Equity's purchase order dated 1 October 2002, Proud Machinery's letter of 8 October 2002, and that this was varied by Proud Machinery's letter of 18 October 2002, together with the sheet specifying the tanks to which graded carrots were to be sent, faxed by North East Equity on 14 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">60 North East Equity alleged that the contract was a contract for the sale of goods within the meaning of one of the Sale of Goods Act 1895 of Western Australia or South Australia, but it did not identify which Act applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Both Acts were written on the template devised by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers in 1893.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The proper law of the contract for the supply of the new plant is the system of law by reference to which the contract was made, or that with which the transaction has its closest and most real connection: Bonython v The Commonwealth [1950] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1950) 81 CLR 486 at 498 per Lord Simonds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Their Lordships stated there that ( Bonython 81 CLR at 498):
 
 '[W]hat is the proper law of the contract, and therefore what is the substance of the obligation created by it, it is a factor and sometimes a decisive one that a particular place is chosen for performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">' 
 

61 Here, the contract for the supply and installation of the new plant and equipment had to be substantially performed in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">The only connection with the law of South Australia was the location of Proud Machinery's head office there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">A condition of the letters of credit was payment of 40% of the purchase price for the particular goods upon delivery to Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">Effectively, performance of the contract had to occur either in Western Australia, or overseas in the various parts of the world from which Proud Machinery was sourcing supplies of items of plant and equipment to be installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">62 The substantial obligation created by the contract was for Proud Machinery to supply and install, at Wattleup in Western Australia, the plant and equipment for which it was charging $3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">That obligation, together with a consideration of the whole of the circumstances, leads to the conclusion that the proper law of the contract was the law of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The transaction had its closest and most real connection with that State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Accordingly, I find that the Sale of Goods Act 1895 (WA) applied to contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">63 North East Equity pleaded that the contract contained conditions implied by s 14(i) of the Sale of Goods Act based on representations said to have been made by Mr Proud to Mr Tana during the pre-contractual negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Relevantly, s 14(i) provides:
 
 '14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Implied conditions as to quality or fitness 
 
 Subject to the provisions of this Act, and of any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows: 
 
 
 
 (i) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply (whether he be the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose: Provided that in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">' 
 
 

64 I am of opinion that nothing turns on whether the contract for the supply of the new line was, on its true characterisation, a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for work and materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">In the former case, s 14(i) of the Sale of Goods Act ordinarily would operate to imply a condition that the goods be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required, as made known by the purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In the absence of special circumstances, a contract to do work and supply materials will carry with it two implied warranties: first, that the materials are of good quality and free from latent defects; and secondly, that the materials are reasonably fit for their intended purpose: Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Limited v Rotor-Work Pty Limited [1974] HCA 32 ; (1974) 132 CLR 1 at 6 per Menzies J, at 8 per Stephen J, Barwick CJ agreeing with their Honours at 4 and Mason J agreed with Stephen J at 15; Young &amp; Marten Ltd v McManus Childs Ltd [1969] 1 AC 454.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">I am of opinion that because, not only was Proud Machinery to supply the goods, it was also to erect and install them, the contract was not merely a contract for the sale of goods, but was in substance a contract for the provision of work and materials: cf Hewett v Court [1983] HCA 7 ; (1983) 149 CLR 639 at 646-647 per Gibbs CJ, 650 per Murphy J, 655 per Wilson and Dawson JJ, 662 per Deane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">As Gibbs CJ noted, the distinction between a contract for the sale of goods and one for the provision of work and materials is frequently a fine one and the tests for distinguishing them are unsatisfactory and imprecise: Hewett 149 CLR at 646; see too Sutton KCT, Sales and Consumer Law (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 1995) at [2.42]-[2.43]; Benjamin's Sale of Goods (7 th ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006) at [1-041]-[1-043].</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">65 It follows that, whether the contract is properly characterised as a contract for the sale of goods or for the supply of work and materials, there was an implied condition that what was to be supplied (goods or work and materials) would be reasonably fit for the purposes for which the buyer (North East Equity) indicated they were required and that it relied on the seller's (Proud Machinery's) skill or judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">66 North East Equity alleged that the new plant and equipment were goods of a description that was in the course of Proud Machinery's business to supply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">There is no question that that is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">North East Equity also alleged that it relied on Proud Machinery's skill or judgment because it had made known, through Mr Tana's discussions with Mr Proud, expressly or by implication, the purposes for which the new production line was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Those purposes for which the new line was to be reasonably fit were in the same terms as some of the representations pleaded independently by North East Equity in aid of its case under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act (with which I will deal with later), namely:
 
 
 (a) The capacity to process and pack in excess of 150 tonnes of carrots in an 8 hour working day (being equivalent to 18.75 tonnes per hour).</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">
 

 (b) The ability to process farm fresh carrots at field temperatures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">(c) The core temperature of packed carrots to be not more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">
 
 (d) The ability to sort and grade carrots into eight distinct streams of size and length grades.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">(e) An increase in efficiency of labour usage compared to the existing Sumich line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">(f) The ability to process and pack carrots from more than one source without intermixing carrots from other different sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">
 

67 North East Equity also alleged that the contract contained the following express terms, and that Proud Nominees had made identical representations arising from the correspondence and conversations between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Those additional terms and representations were, namely, that the new production line would:
 
 
 (g) have the capacity to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour with a maximum of 18% rejects, equal to 18.75 tonnes per hour final pack out on the pallet;
 (h) achieve a guaranteed maximum of 5deg.C core temperature for North East Equity's carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">
 

68 Mr Proud readily acknowledged that, in the discussions leading up to the formation of the contract, Mr Tana had asked him, or he understood North East Equity wanted him, to provide a system that could achieve each of the terms and purposes in sub-pars (a)-(e).</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">I am satisfied that Proud Machinery was aware of each of those five terms or factors as a purpose for which the new line was required by North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Additionally, the circumstances in which Mr Tana and Mr Proud were discussing these matters would have conveyed to a reasonable person in Mr Proud's position that Mr Tana and North East Equity were relying on Proud Machinery's and Mr Proud's skill or judgment in the selection of appropriate plant and machinery to achieve those purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Mr Tana had told Mr Proud to evaluate the existing line by visiting it at the time of preparing a quotation for what was required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">I am satisfied that Mr Proud (and hence Proud Machinery) appreciated, and a reasonable person in his position would have appreciated, that North East Equity (through Mr Tana) was relying on Proud's skill or judgment in recommending plant and equipment, and on those who might install it, to achieve each of the five purposes in sub-pars (a)-(e) that Mr Tana and Mr Proud had discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">69 However, the purpose specified in sub-par (a) changed, as the discussions evolved, from 150 tonnes in an 8 hour working day to 18.75 tonnes per operating hour, as will appear below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">And, there is a dispute about whether there were terms or representations to the effect in sub-pars (f), (g) and (h) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Consequently, there are also issues of how sub-pars (a) and (c) are to be understood.</sentence>

<sentence id="s360">IDENTIFICATION OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS 
 
 
 9.1 Principles 
 

70 No contract is made in a vacuum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">In order to construe the terms of the contract, the Court seeks to place itself in the matrix of mutually known facts forming the background in which the parties contracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Additionally, where terms are alleged to have been made orally, it is necessary to identify what, if any, oral terms were agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">In Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319 McLelland CJ in Eq explained that, where a party alleged in civil proceedings that conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, ordinarily it was necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court first, what the alleged conduct was, and secondly, the circumstances which rendered it misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">He continued, in terms, which in my opinion are apposite to the identification of oral terms of a contract agreed to have been made in the course of negotiations, as follows:
 
 'Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">All this is a matter of ordinary human experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">' 
 

71 McLelland CJ in Eq said that each element of the cause of action had to be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court: Watson 49 NSWLR at 319; see also s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and CEPU v ACCC [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 479-482 [29] - [39] per Weinberg, Bennett JJ and myself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">72 The process of construction of a contract is undertaken objectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">In Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said:
 
 'It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">' (citations omitted)
 

And in CEPU 162 FCR at 510 [164]-[165] Weinberg, Bennett and I said:
 
 ' In the construction of a contract, the court places itself in the commercial matrix in which the parties were at the time that the contract was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">This is so that the court can construe correctly both the express terms used by the parties and those which are included by implication in order to give effect to their presumed intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">In Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2001] FCA 760 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 ; 186 ALR 289 at [10] , Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that it was appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question in a contract were used and, from those circumstances, to discern the objective which the parties had in view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">They applied what Lord Wilberforce had said, namely that an appreciation of the commercial purpose of the contract "... presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating" ( Reardon Smith Line v Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996).</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">
 
 And, in Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 70 ; (2001) 210 CLR 181 at [11] approving Lord Hoffmann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society (No 1) [1998] 1 WLR 896 at 912, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said that interpretation of a written contract involved 
 ... the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.</sentence>

 9.2 What was the term or representation concerning a production level of 18.75 tonnes per hour at final pack out (sub-pars (a) and (g))?</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">
 

73 In the letter of 30 September 2002 the parties expressly adverted to the capacity of the line to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour, with a maximum of 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">The letter expressly said that this equated to 18.75 tonnes per hour at final pack out on the pallet (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">after the robots located at the end of the last conveyor).</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Moreover, that letter also referred to the packing capacities per hour of various components of the proposed new production line, namely the prepack line, the five Gillenkirch carton fillers and the handline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The letter expressed the conclusion that, by using those calculations and several combinations of them, the desired pack out of 18.75 tonnes per hour would be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">74 While the parties had discussed, in their earlier negotiations, 150 tonnes being produced in an 8 hour working shift on one day, I find that the letter of 30 September 2002 made clear that the particular performance Proud Machinery and Mr Proud were warranting would be achieved by the proposed configuration of the new line (which would include the handline and the prepack line production).</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">And, in the subsequent letter of 8 October 2002, signed by both Mr Tana and Mr Proud, the same warranty was given using the figure of 18.75 tonnes per hour at final pack out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">75 Mathematically, 18.75 tonnes per hour multiplies to 150 tonnes for 8 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">However, the parties had identified specifically that the capacity of the plant was to be measured by a pack out rate of 18.75 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">How North East Equity proposed to run the plant, and how many continuous hours it proposed to have, were matters for it to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">The production expert evidence, which I accept and discuss later in these reasons, demonstrated that the existing brush washers could process 22.8 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">The experts did not address the issue of the resulting quality of carrot processed at that speed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">However, it was unlikely that the brush washers would process 22.8 tonnes per hour in any event, because most of the 18% rejects should have been removed at the grading tables located immediately before them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Mr Webster's memorandum of 1 August 2002 showed that because the existing brush washers, which were to be incorporated into the new line, could not process more than 14-15 tonnes per hour if a good quality were to be maintained, he and Mr Tana were aware that it was impossible, even if the whole plant operated continuously for an 8 hour day, to process more than 120 tonnes of good quality carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">And, as that memorandum also showed, the plant did not operate for 8 hours continuously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Rather, in an 8 hour day, it operated for about 7 hours after allowing for lunch, smoking or tea breaks and other usual inefficiencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">I do not accept Mr Tana's evidence to the extent that it differed from Mr Webster's account of how the plant operated in practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Mr Webster worked there full-time when he wrote the memorandum, whereas Mr Tana visited the plant often, but was not there continuously throughout the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">76 I am satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the term 'per operating hour' in the contractual letters as referring to the actual time in which the plant was operating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">I find that Mr Tana also had that understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">Thus, in an 8 hour shift, Mr Tana understood that there were about 7 operating hours which would result in about 131.25 tonnes of packed product based on the rate of 18.75 tonnes per operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">And, after he deleted the handline, the stipulated result of an 8 hour day's production (with 7 operating hours) would be 122.85 tonnes (at 17.55 tonnes per hour).</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">77 I am satisfied that Mr Tana was fully aware of this limitation in his work force's operating hours when he decided that North East Equity would contract with Proud Nominees for the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">I am also satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have appreciated that Proud Nominees was representing and warranting that the packing machines could operate, initially, at the 18.75 tonnes per hour (and, after deletion of the handline, at 17.55 tonnes per hour), but that for good quality carrots, this output level could only be achieved by building up a store of carrots which had been processed through the brush washer operating at a slower speed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">And, they would have appreciated that, when the letters of 30 September and 8 October 2002 referred to the capacity of the line to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour, they must have had in mind the overall operation of the plant in a commercially efficient manner that would result, at the time of pack out, in a net output of 18.75 tonnes of good quality carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Both knew the quality limitations on the brush washers which prevented them feeding more than 15 tonnes per hour into the grading and chilling tank system, as Mr Webster's memorandum to Mr Tana of 1 August 2002 demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Equally, both knew that the existing brush washers had the capacity to process carrots at 22.8 tonnes per hour if North East Equity wished to use them at that speed, and so sacrifice quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">78 Both parties knew that the existing brush washer equipment was to be employed in the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">They knew that the supply of carrots to a packing machine and packing lines out of the proposed tank system could come at a greater rate than 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Thus, in the letter of 30 September 2002, Mr Proud identified maximum production capacities of 2.437 tonnes per hour for the prepack line, 24 tonnes per hour for the five Gillenkirch machines using 20 kg cartons, and 1.2 tonnes per hour for the handline, again using 20 kg cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The total of that production capacity was 27.637 tonnes per hour, far greater than the 18.75 tonnes per hour at final pack out, or 22.8 gross tonnes per operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">79 Mr Tana and Mr Proud were experienced in how production plants in the food processing industry operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">Split shifts were common in that industry, as David Harris, an expert witness called by North East Equity, made clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The parties also understood that the grading of the carrots was likely to lead to a faster build up of larger numbers of particular sizes of some carrots, principally the small/medium and medium ones, than other proposed gradings would produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Those carrots, once they had been processed through the brush washers, and across the flumes and various graders would take some time to cool to a core temperature of 5deg.C in the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">From there, they would have to be moved to pack them out in the last stages of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The parties' common knowledge was that the initial input of carrots from the farm could not pass through the brush washers at more than 15 tonnes per hour, if quality was to be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">And they knew that, if the packing machines worked to their maximum capacities of up to 27.6 tonnes per hour, before the packing operation could commence on any given day, it would be necessary for a considerable volume of carrots to be processed through the brush washers and the graders, to then be stored and chilled in the tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">80 A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood, from the discussions and the background of mutually known facts, that it was necessary for the chilling tanks to accumulate carrots over a period of time before packing could commence, and that thereafter a flow of carrots had to be provided to the packing equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">All of the production experts, Mr Harris, Gerd Gillenkirch and Oscar Manteca, in giving concurrent evidence, discussed a split shift arrangement as one which would be expected for the efficient operation of the new plant, just as Mr Webster had done in the memorandum to Mr Tana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Mr Harris said:
 
 '... you can have what I would call overlapping shifts that processing would start and then sometime two hours later, may be two to three hours later, packing operators would start and that's quite a normal thing to happen in the food industry as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">' 
 

81 Mr Webster's memorandum to Mr Tana had made clear that the pack out lines would work an 8 hour day from about 9.00am, but the forklift and grading staff could also work no more than an 8 hour day from 6.00am, being replaced by some other staff on a 4 hour shift from about 2.00pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">82 That memorandum was important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">It showed how Mr Tana must have appreciated how the system would work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">If the quality of the carrots were to be maintained, Mr Webster's memorandum indicated that there would not be a continuous feed of 22.8 tonnes of carrots for every hour of the day, resulting in 18.75 tonnes at final pack out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">This was because, at that rate, the existing brush washers would not provide carrots at the same level of quality which North East Equity was then producing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Mr Tana's interest was in maximising production, maintaining quality and minimising his labour costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Mr Webster's memorandum indicated a commonsense means of achieving those goals with the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The figures that the letters of 30 September and 8 October 2002 discussed were average figures which combined the outputs of various parts of the plant over the course of an operating day, in which workers in different areas of operation would not themselves be working more than 8 hours at a time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Thus, when one came to calculating the operating costs of running the plant, it would be realistic to use an 8 hour working day, because the various shifts that employees in the different parts of the plant would be working were either 8 hours or 4 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">83 The letter of 30 September 2002 showed that, if 15 tonnes per hour were packed by the five Gillenkirch packing machines, and if the handline (with 1.2 tonnes per hour) and prepack line (with 2.437 tonnes per hour) were operated, then 18.637 tonnes per hour would be produced, slightly below the 18.75 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">But even on those figures, the initial feed from the brush washer section of the line could not have supplied 18.637 tonnes in an hour, if good quality carrots were to be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">In that event, it was necessary to accumulate a supply in the chilling tanks for a period before there would be enough chilled carrots for a sufficient flow to the packing machines, in order to allow them to process more than 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">This was the very point that Mr Webster had made in his memorandum of 1 August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">On the other hand, for the reasons I give below when dealing with the expert production evidence, the brush washers were capable of running at the higher speed of 22.8 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">But, then the quality of the carrots would be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Proud Machinery was not responsible for the speeds at which the existing brushers would be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">North East Equity had required those machines to be retained and used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">They had the capacity to run faster or slower, depending on the quality that North East Equity wanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">84 With this background in mind, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have appreciated that the figure of 18.75 tonnes per hour final pack out on the pallet, could only be achieved for good quality carrots in an efficiently run plant using a split shift for its work force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">The letters of 30 September and 8 October 2002 stated that '... the line will have the capacity to process 22.8 gross tonnes of carrots per operating hour with a maximum of 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">This calculates to 18.75 tonnes/hr final packout on the pallet' (my emphasis).</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">The parties both understood that the calculations were to produce the overall end result of 18.75 tonnes per hour packed out on the pallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">And, they understood that capacity and quality were not the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">This was because of the limitation of the capacities of the brush washers to process more than 15 tonnes per hour, and maintain suitable quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">It was possible to use the processing method envisaged in Mr Webster's memorandum of 1 August to achieve the overall result in the two letters, with the consequential cost savings resulting from a split shift and, if quality were to be maintained, an initial hourly input of less than 22.8 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">A split shift could be used for both the 22.8 tonnes of initial input, and Mr Webster's sensible suggestion of the lesser initial input of 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">85 The letters of 30 September and 8 October 2002 must be read in the context in which the parties had negotiated, consistently with their awareness of the quality limitation of the brush washers to process 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">I am comfortably satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the references in the letters of 30 September and 8 October 2002 to 22.8 gross tonnes and 18.75 tonnes (or 17.55 after the handline was deleted) per operating hour at final pack out, as specifying the end result of an efficient use of labour, including procedures along the lines referred to in Mr Webster's memorandum of 1 August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">86 Mr Tana desired to have a new plant which could produce a range of sizes so that he could satisfy the markets into which North East Equity was selling in 2002 (when there was no quality problem with carrots).</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">It would be inconsistent for him to have discussed with Mr Proud making a $3 million investment, if he intended to use the existing brush washers in a manner which would produce poor quality carrots before these were introduced into the sophisticated new equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">87 I am not satisfied that North East Equity has established its pleaded allegations that Proud Nominees entered into a contract which included a term or represented that the new line would have '... the capacity to process and pack in excess of 150 tonnes of carrots in an 8 hour working day (being equivalent to 18.75 tonnes per hour)' (sub-par (a)) in the sense of a continuous day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Nor am I satisfied that the alleged term or representation in sub-par (g) existed in that sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Rather, I find that, at the time of entry into the contract, there was a term or a representation that the new line would have the capacity to process and pack at a rate of production per operating hour of 18.75 tonnes in terms of final pack out on the pallet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">This later reduced to 17.55 tonnes, once Mr Tana deleted the handline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">
 
 9.3 Could Proud Machinery and Mr Proud rely on a 'split shift' argument?</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">
 

88 North East Equity claimed that the use of split shifts was a new issue which was not pleaded or put as part of the written or oral evidence of Mr Tana, Mr Proud, Ms Mirosevich, or her assistant, Joe Correia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">However, Mr Tana asserted that the new line began after the brush washers and that that portion had to have the capacity to produce the various agreed final package tonnages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">That is, if I were to accept Mr Tana's evidence, the time which was taken to get the carrots to the point of exit from the brush washers should be ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">That period was addressed by Mr Webster' s 1 August 2002 memorandum to Mr Tana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">Mr Tana gave evidence that he understood that Mr Webster's memorandum involved people working separately, on differing shifts, over a 38 hour week; i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">on a split shift without anyone working overtime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">He discussed this with Mr Webster but claimed that he did not want such a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Mr Tana gave no explanation why he did not want it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">89 I do not accept that Mr Tana would have insisted on scarifying the quality of the carrots in 2002 when a sensible and commercial means of operating the plant was put forward in Mr Webster's memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Mr Tana's assertion made no sense, except to bolster a claim in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">I reject it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">90 Mr Webster also pointed out that, in an 8 hour day the workers had lunch and 'smoko' breaks which, with inefficiencies, meant that they worked productively for 7 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">Mr Tana asserted that if one lost 12.5% of production 'just like that, you're very inefficient'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">In re-examination he asserted that there was no need for a second 'smoko' break in an 8 hour shift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Given that the temperature in the shed could exceed 35deg.C, and that, unlike Mr Tana, Mr Webster actually worked inside the shed, I reject Mr Tana's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">91 This cross-examination and re-examination fairly raised the issue of what an 'operating hour' was (if it had not been raised earlier).</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">But, in any event, that is a question of construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">This did not require specific pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Given what Mr Webster' s 1 August 2002 memorandum said about the capacity of the brush washers to produce a good quality carrot, and the commonsense of the staff having breaks during an 8 hour shift, I am satisfied that the questions of what an 'operating hour' was, and what an 8 hour working day was, were always issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Indeed, 18.75 tonnes per operating hour, if a working day's production occurred in 7 operating hours, was equivalent to 131.25 tonnes in an 8 hour shift, not 150 tonnes (which was equivalent to 8 operating hours' production at 18.75 tonnes per hour).</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">And, in a later letter dated 8 May 2004 to Mr Proud, Mr Tana wrote: 'We are still working on an output expectation of 125 tonnes finished product in an 8 hour day (excluding prepack and handline)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">The letter then discussed how the split shift which North East Equity was then using was not able to process carrots quickly enough without, making any complaint that this was outside the 8 hour day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">I am satisfied that Mr Tana and North East Equity intended, at all relevant times in 2002, to run split shifts as Mr Webster' s 1 August 2002 memorandum contemplated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">
 
 9.4 What was the term or representation concerning the requirement that the core temperature of packed carrots not exceed 5deg.C?</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">(sub-pars (c) and (h)) 
 

92 Proud Machinery argued that it had merely stated that Gary North, an electrical contractor, had advised Mr Proud that the former would guarantee a maximum 5deg.C core temperature for the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">That is, it argued that it did no more than inform North East Equity of what Mr North had said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">I reject that argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">93 The core temperature of carrots being packed was a matter of importance, which Mr Tana and Mr Proud had discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">In those discussions, Mr Tana had made clear to Mr Proud that North East Equity and Sumich's business involved the export of a considerable volume of carrots which were to be processed at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">94 While Mr Tana understood that Mr Proud was relying on others, particularly Mr North, in making the assurance in the letter of 30 September 2002, and that Mr Proud himself was not a refrigeration engineer and had no particular expertise in that field, a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that Proud Machinery was assuming an obligation to supply equipment conforming to the quality of this assurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">95 I am of opinion that an ordinary reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the reference to 'a maximum of 5 degree celsius core temperature' in the letter of 30 September 2002 as a contractual requirement and a representation that the refrigeration equipment in the proposed new line would operate so as to achieve a core temperature of carrots, at the time of final pack out, of no more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">
 
 9.5 Was there a term or representation concerning intermixing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">(sub-par (f)) 
 

96 North East Equity also asserted that a sixth purpose was that in the alleged term and representation in sub-par (f), namely that the new plant was to have the ability to process and pack carrots from more than one source without intermixing carrots from different sources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Mr Proud denied that this was a requirement or a purpose which he and Mr Tana discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">97 I am not satisfied that such a requirement was discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Obviously, if carrots from different growers were to be segregated, it would be necessary for all of the carrots from one grower to have been processed past the first section of the line (tipping hopper and brush washers) before fresh carrots could be introduced from another source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">The configuration of the proposed new line was detailed in the various drawings in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">These made clear that no segregation was possible unless carrots introduced from one source had been cleared out of either the whole production line, or those tanks into which processing was to take place of carrots from the second source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">In any event, it would only be possible to segregate them by operating the plant in a way that allowed the carrots from the first source in the part of the line before the chilling tanks to clear before introducing those from the second source, because the second source carrots could then be directed to a separate empty tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">98 There was no evidence that this could not be done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">Of course, carrots from two different sources could not be introduced simultaneously at the commencement of the line if they were to be segregated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Segregation could occur only if carrots from one source were processed into chilling tanks before carrots from another were introduced at the commencement of the line, and directed toward different chilling tanks to those from the first source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">If that were done, each supply could be packed from the different tanks and directed to different packing stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">99 I am not satisfied that Mr Tana and Mr Proud discussed the concept of concurrent processing of carrots from difference sources before they had been directed separately into chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Such a requirement was not in Mr Tana's list of production expectations, nor was it in any other document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">IDENTIFICATION OF REPRESENTATIONS 
 
 100 North East Equity alleged that each of the purposes which I have just discussed were requirements communicated by Mr Tana to Mr Proud that any system designed and provided by Proud Machinery had to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">As I have found, North East Equity did make known to Proud Machinery that the new plant should achieve the first five purposes in the sense which I have found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">101 The fourth of those purposes namely, the ability to sort and grade the carrots into eight distinct streams of size and length grades, was communicated to Proud Nominees by North East Equity's employees, rather than by Mr Tana directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">This was achieved by the requirement in the facsimile of 14 October 2002 that various lengths and girths be able to be directed to particular tanks in the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">102 North East Equity alleged that the letter of 29 July 2002 conveyed representations as to how the new line would operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">These were:
 
(i) the new line would fulfil North East Equity's desire to pack 150 tonnes of carrots over an 8 hour working day;
 
 
 (ii) nine hydro-cooling tanks would allow one of those tanks for each length or size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank;
 (iii) the hydro-cooling tanks would be capable of producing constant product output;
 (iv) the new line would provide quality length sizing for three separate lengths;
 (v) the new line would be capable of controlling the temperature of the carrots;
 (vi) the new line would greatly reduce damage to the carrots and wastage; and
 (vii) the new line would increase production while reducing the man hours required to achieve that production compared to the existing Sumich line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">
 

103 Additionally, North East Equity alleged that the letter of 30 September 2002 made representations to the effect of the terms in sub-pars (g) and (h) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">
 
 10.1 Principles 
 

104 During the course of pre-contractual negotiations, many things are said or written which convey, expressly or impliedly, one or more representations about matters under consideration by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">In Codelfa Construction Pty Limited v State Rail Authority of NSW [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 352 Mason J, in his seminal judgment, said:
 
 'It is here that a difficulty arises with respect to the evidence of prior negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Obviously the prior negotiations will tend to establish objective background facts which were known to both parties and the subject matter of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">To the extent to which they have this tendency they are admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">But in so far as they consist of statements and actions of the parties which are reflective of their actual intentions and expectations they are not receivable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">The point is that such statements and actions reveal the terms of the contract which the parties intended or hoped to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">They are superseded by, and merged in, the contract itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The object of the parol evidence rule is to exclude them, the prior oral agreement of the parties being inadmissible in aid of construction, though admissible in an action for rectification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">' 
 

105 His Honour said that the reason that the actual intentions of the parties were not taken into account in determining construction to be given to a contractual provision was:
 
 '... for the very good reason that an investigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but it would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weight to these factors at the expense of the actual language of the written contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">' 
 

106 Here, of course, there was no written contract complete in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">But the policy reasons lying behind the parol evidence rule and the objective theory of contract are recognitions of the tendency of parties to negotiations to attribute to some particular matter a significance that did not exist at the time of the conclusion of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">In an evolving negotiation ultimately leading to the conclusion of the contract, different positions are taken with respect to different subject matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">To attribute significance in the final expression of the parties' contractual relationship to something said earlier may create an unreal and inaccurate appreciation of the subject matter of the relationship actually entered into at the later time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Of course, many things are said and written to induce the entry of a person into a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Even the common law recognised that misrepresentations, innocent, negligent or fraudulent, provided grounds in particular circumstances entitling parties to relief from the consequences of entry into a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">107 Any statement or representation made during pre-contractual negotiations is apt to be misconstrued if taken out of context, or treated as if it were a contractual term simply because it was said or written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">Negotiations to arrive at a contract are not themselves part of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Sometimes, however, they may set the scene in which the contract is to be understood; on other occasions they may contain, or be the source of contractual terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">But, it is often not realistic to treat a pre-contractual statement in isolation as if it were made outside the context of an evolving negotiation, which the parties recognise is a process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">That process will culminate when they finalise matters in a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">108 In a commercial setting between experienced business people, the express words of the contract, even if contained in exchanges of correspondence, will often be an authoritative guide as to the matters on which each party relied in entering the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">They will know that often events will have moved on from earlier communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">Courts will be mindful that representations made early in a negotiation process, can be potent and can continue to influence a party's understanding of what is being discussed, or what becomes the subject-matter of a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">Nonetheless, courts must also be realistic about how negotiations progress; they are not static and when the context evolves, so does the understanding of each party as to what, at the later point of time, is being discussed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Gibbs CJ noted in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199 (in a passage approved by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 85 [102] ) that s 52 of the Trade Practices Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Gibbs CJ was discussing representations made to the public, as opposed to particular individuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">However, the judgment in Campomar 202 CLR at 83-84 [98]-[100] also discussed the need to consider all of the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">And, as McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson 49 NSWLR at 318-319 noted, recollections of pre-contractual conversations relied on as the source of an allegedly misleading or deceive representation can be affected by later events and the lapse of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">109 Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the particular relations between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">Here, two experienced commercial men were discussing a proposed transaction over many months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The discussions involved a considerable degree of planning and reworking in the course of arriving at a final, evolved concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">That concept was the subject of their contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">It is important, in that context, to evaluate what effect any representation conveyed at an earlier point in the negotiations, had at the time of entry into the contract, and how, at that time, any such representation was understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Also, as Gibbs CJ identified in Puxu 149 CLR at 199, it is important to evaluate whether, at the time the contract was made, the representee had taken reasonable care to protect his or her own interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">The context, including subsequent events, statements or writings which cast a different light upon an earlier representation may be all important in determining whether it continued to have any operative effect or the effect alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">
 
 10.2 Consideration of alleged written representations 
 (i) Was a representation made that the new line would fulfil North East Equity's desire to pack 150 tonnes of carrots over an 8 hour working day?</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">
 

110 The letter of 29 July 2002 commenced by stating that it set out an outline of a system which Mr Proud believed would fulfil Mr Tana's desire to pack 150 tonnes of carrots over an 8 hour working day, and that it would include a number of specific items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">Subsequently, the discussions evolved the concepts until these were crystallised in the contractual correspondence commencing with the letter of 30 September 2002 and ending with the letter of 18 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Both parties knew that the design and the drawings for the proposed line under discussion had changed on a number of occasions in the period between 29 July and 30 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">111 I have already explained what I find to be the contractual terms that emerged from the negotiations in relation to the tonnage per hour that the new line was warranted to process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">It is not reasonable to read either of the two letters in isolation from the context in which they were communicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">That context included the background of what preceded each letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">The 30 September 2002 letter replaced and updated what had been said and written earlier in relation to the tonnage per hour figure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">I find that the only representation, relating to the capacity of the new plant to produce any tonnage of carrots per hour, on which Mr Tana and North East Equity acted in relation to, was embodied in the contractual term I have found at [87] above, arising from sub-pars (a) and (g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">
 
 (ii) Was a representation made that nine hydro-cooling tanks would allow one of those tanks for each length or size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank?</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">
 

112 From the time of the 29 July 2002 letter, the negotiations retained the characteristic that that the new line would be reasonably fit to achieve the purposes that:
 
 
 &#8226; the new line would be able to segregate carrots into eight different sizes based on girth and length; and
 &#8226; if eight different sizes were graded, each size would be able to be directed to its own specific chilling tank, from which it could then be packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">
 

113 Thus, I am satisfied that at the time of the entry into the contract, the representation made originally in the letter of 29 July 2002 continued, namely that the nine cooling tanks would allow one tank for each length/size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">However, it was understood by Mr Tana and North East Equity, through him, in the context of the intervening events, including his visit to Belgium: see Puxu 149 CLR at 199 per Gibbs CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">
 
 (iii) Was a representation made that the hydro-cooling tanks would be capable of producing constant product output?</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">
 

114 The letter of 29 July 2002 said that, when a desired grade was selected to be sent to a packing position, the pumps and blower were activated in a manner appropriate to obtain a constant product output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">North East Equity alleged that this representation was not fulfilled when the plant was commissioned and in operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">That was because the outflow system was said to rely on a combination of water pressure and compressed air to force carrots onto the discharge conveyor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">That method of removing carrots from the tank was said to cause product surges, and then droughts, for the sorting tables, resulting in delays and inefficiencies in the continuous operation of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">The letter of 29 July 2002 said that there was a 'PID control loop' which would calculate the speed of the pump and blower motor to ensure a controlled feed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">The letter also indicated that it was possible to bypass that program and operate the tank manually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">115 I am satisfied that a representation was made, which continued to the time of contract, that the chilling tanks could be controlled in a way that would make them capable of producing a constant product output for the packing line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">
 
 (iv) Was a representation made that the new line would provide quality length sizing for three separate lengths?</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">
 

116 I am satisfied that the letters of 29 July 2002 and the faxed list of girth lengths, sizes and destination tanks conveyed a representation that the new plant would provide quality length sizing for three separate lengths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">However, the nature of the quality of the length sizing was not divorced from the constraint that length graders cannot always correctly sort or size carrots, because of the variety of shapes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">This constraint was noted by the three experts' joint report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">Both Mr Tana and Mr Proud were aware of imperfections in mechanical grading and the limitations of machines when they were negotiating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">I will explain this finding later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">
 
 (v) Was a representation made that the new line would be capable of controlling the temperature of the carrots?</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">
 

117 The letter of 29 July 2002 expressly said that temperature of the tank was controlled through a 'PT100 sensor' which would ensure that carrots would be efficiently chilled to their desired packing temperature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">It was necessary for them to be chilled to a particular temperature so that, when sent to the packing line, they would be packed into the cartons at a core temperature of no more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">I am satisfied that that representation continued to the time of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Both parties knew that it was essential that the carrots be able to be packed at a temperature of no more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">
 
 (vi) Was a representation made that the new line would greatly reduce damage to the carrots and wastage?</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">
 

118 The letter of 29 July 2002 expressly said that there would be a greatly reduced amount of crop being damaged and wasted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">I am satisfied that this representation continued up to the time of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">Nothing was said or done to change the nature of that express statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">
 
 (vii) Was a representation made that the new line would increase production while reducing the man hours required to achieve that production, compared to the existing Sumich line?</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">
 

119 Again, the letter of 29 July 2002 expressly said that there would be an increase of production whilst reducing the man hours required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The negotiations had been conducted on the premise that the equipment, when installed, would involve North East Equity in a capital expenditure over $3 million to achieve the desired rate of packing per hour using, as I have found, split shifts to reduce the labour cost involved in the production process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">I am satisfied that the representation alleged, that the new plant would increase production while reducing the man hours required to achieve it compared to the existing Sumich line, was made in the letter of 29 July 2002 and continued to the time of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">
 
 10.3 Were representations made based on the contractual terms in sub-pars (c) and (h)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">
 

120 The two further representations alleged to arise from the letter of 30 September 2002 must be considered against the background of the negotiations at that time and the mutually known facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">The letter of 30 September 2002 said that Mr North advised Mr Proud that he, Mr North, would guarantee a maximum 5deg.C core temperature for the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">I have found that statement became a contractual term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">This is because it amounted to a promise of performance of the refrigeration tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">121 On the other hand, viewed as a representation, the wording of the letter makes clear that Mr Proud was passing on what Mr North had told him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Mr Tana knew that Mr Proud was not an expert in that field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">The ordinary and natural meaning of the repetition of Mr North's guarantee in the letter of 30 September 2002 did not involve Proud Machinery itself representing that it, as opposed to Mr North, was providing any guarantee of that level of performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">However, shortly after that, when the contract was made, Proud Machinery promised North East Equity that the maximum core temperature of carrots at the time of final pack out would be 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">I find that, at that time, Proud conveyed a representation to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">Mr Tana understood that what Proud was conveying was based on Mr North's assurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">122 Often when a person passes on what another has said, he or she gives his or her own imprimatur to the original statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Thus, at common law, a person who passes on a rumour or statement made by another is treated as having the same responsibility as the source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">And, in cases involving s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , the representor's conduct must be considered as a whole: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at 605 [38] - [40] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Once the contract was made, what Mr North had said, which Proud passed on to North East Equity, assumed a different character because Proud Machinery then accepted responsibility for achieving that level of performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">
 
 10.4 Consideration of alleged oral representations 
 

123 North East Equity also alleged that, between about late 2001 and September 2002, Proud made the following representations to Mr Tana orally, either on the telephone or in person:
 
(viii) Mr Proud repeated the various written representations alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">
 
 (ix) Proud Machinery and Mr Proud were possessed with sufficient knowledge, skill and experience to design, procure and install the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">(x) The new plant would utilise electric power more efficiently than the existing Sumich line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">(xi) The new plant would comfortably handle a capacity of 150 tonnes per day packed out in cartons and in doing so it would be operating at 'idle'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">(viii) Did Mr Proud repeat orally the various written representations alleged?</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">
 

124 While it is likely that Mr Proud repeated the written representations that I have found were made in the course of either discussions or republishing his own letters, I do not consider that such repetition adds anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">I do not propose to deal with the instances of those repetitions because it is not necessary to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">
 
 (ix) Was an oral representation made that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud possessed sufficient knowledge, skill and experience to design, procure and install the new plant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">
 

125 North East Equity did not deal with Proud Machinery as the designer of the proposed new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">First, the parties agreed that Proud Machinery would be paid $233,000 '... for the project management and co ordination of the equipment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">This was initially recorded in the letter of 30 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">Ultimately, they agreed that this sum would be paid to Mr Proud's nominee, Steventon Lodge Holdings Pty Ltd. Next, Mr Webster wrote on North East Equity's purchase order of 1 October 2002 that the parties were in '... an agreed position to start production of [n]ew machinery' from Newtec, Bruynooghe and Gillenkirch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">Then, Proud Machinery wrote in its letter of 8 October 2002 that it '... would like to confirm the terms and conditions of your contract to purchase the items listed in the attached schedule and included in drawing No SUM-000-Revision S'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The letter reserved to Proud Machinery '... the right to make minor alterations to the layout of the line in the event by changing the layout the produce will be handled more gently and efficiently'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The schedule listed each item of equipment and its supplier's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">126 On the basis of my findings in relation to the implied contractual warranties, I am satisfied that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud represented that they had sufficient knowledge, skill and experience to procure and supervise the installation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">Mr Proud was, to Mr Tana's knowledge, an agent for various equipment manufacturers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">As Mr Tana said in evidence, he would describe Mr Proud as a salesman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">He agreed that he did not deal with Mr Proud as an engineer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">He said that he classified a lot of what Mr Proud told him 'as salesman talk'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">Mr Tana had been buying plant and machinery for North East Equity from Proud Machinery through Mr Proud for a number of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">I am satisfied that Mr Tana knew that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud were distributing and selling complex products made and designed by others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">127 Mr Tana had had an experience in the past with Mr Proud involving a Campesato diameter grader, which had been installed in the old Sumich line at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Mr Tana said that that experience caused him concern as to Mr Proud's reliability in selecting suitable equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">That concern, coupled with Mr Tana's own understanding of Mr Proud's role as an equipment distributor and vendor, made it inherently unlikely that Mr Tana would have understood Proud Machinery to be representing to him that it had sufficient knowledge, skill and experience to design the new plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">128 While Mr Proud might have been able to recommend particular equipment and manufacturers for the purposes of including these in the new line, I do not accept that Mr Tana believed or that Proud Machinery or Mr Proud represented to him that Proud Machinery or Mr Proud had any expertise in the design of that equipment or the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">That is why Mr Tana wished to see for himself the Bruynooghe factory and equipment of the type which was proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">He already knew of the performance of the Newtec and Gillenkirch weighing and packing machines because they were installed and operating on the old line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">129 Moreover, Mr Tana saw at the Bruynooghe factory that it was preparing detailed plans and engineering drawings for at least so much of the proposed new plant as would be supplied by it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">The proposed configurations of the technical equipment was schematically presented to North East Equity and Mr Tana by Proud Machinery using its draftsman, Brendan Grogan, as the discussions progressed from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">However, I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Tana did not understand Proud Machinery or Mr Proud to be representing that it or he was capable of designing, or would in fact design, the new plant and equipment or the line itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">I am not satisfied that such a representation was made by Proud Machinery or Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">
 
 (x) Was an oral representation made that the new plant would utilise electric power more efficiently than the existing Sumich line?</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">
 

130 Mr Tana claimed that Mr Proud told him, during the negotiations in 2002, that Kalfresh had saved on power costs after it had installed the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">From this, Mr Tana claimed that he inferred that North East Equity would be saving on its total power bill after the new plant was installed, as compared to what it spent beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">Mr Tana said that the issue of electricity was not a major issue in his decision to go ahead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">He gave vague and unsatisfactory evidence that, sometime in late 2002, Mr Proud provided him with a dollar figure in the vicinity of $16,000 in relation to Kalfresh's consumption of electricity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">He assumed that it was a per month figure, but did not recall whether Mr Proud had mentioned anything about per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">His evidence continued:
 
 'So let me understand this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">You're saying, if I've got it right, sometime in 2002 Mr Proud made reference to electricity consumption by Kalfresh at their operation, you have a figure in [y]our head of [$]16,000, you think that's what he said, he didn't say per month, you've assumed per month?</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">
 
 But your evidence is you didn't ask or clarify with him what he meant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">--- I didn't make a big deal of it, no, sir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">' 
 

131 Although Mr Webster wrote a memorandum to Mr Tana in late November 2003 which set out a recollection of such a conversation, in his oral evidence, he did not recall a conversation to that effect until he was shown the memorandum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">Mr Webster's memorandum was not a contemporaneous note but rather was written just before a significant test of the new plant was to occur, and after months of complaints by North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">The memorandum concluded with Mr Webster's observation that he was not sure whether Mr Proud knew what the power costs were at the time of the alleged conversation, or if Mr Tana had provided Mr Proud with that information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">I am not satisfied that Mr Webster's memorandum accurately recorded anything said by Mr Proud over a year beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">132 On his return from Queensland, Mr Webster reported to Mr Tana that Kalfresh had informed him that its electricity costs were running below budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">Mr Tana recalled that during the negotiations in 2002, Mr Webster had told him that Kalfresh was making a saving on electricity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">Mr Tana did not ask Mr Webster to investigate the question of Kalfresh's power consumption, nor did he ask Mr Webster about that topic on his return from his inspection of the Kalfresh plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Mr Tana said that although the cost of electricity was a factor in his decision to go ahead with the contract, he would have gone ahead anyway with the decision to install the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">And, he said that had he known that there would not be a saving he would not have acted differently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">133 Mr Proud denied that he told either Mr Tana or Mr Webster during the negotiations in 2002 that there would be significant reductions in power costs if the new plant were installed, compared to those incurred in running the then existing plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">I accept Mr Proud's denial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">134 In late September 2002 Mr Proud was negotiating with Mr North about the terms on which Mr North would install the refrigeration and associated equipment for the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">Mr North had supplied the refrigeration equipment for the Kalfresh plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">He emailed Mr Proud that Kalfresh had budgeted about $16,000 per month for electrical costs to run its plant, but was currently paying about $12,000 per month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">Mr Proud said in his oral evidence that he forwarded this email on to Mr Tana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">Mr Tana was not asked about his being sent the email, nor was he recalled to deny Mr Proud's suggestion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">135 I am satisfied that Mr Proud did not tell Mr Tana that he (or North East -Equity) would be spending less on electricity than he (or it) currently was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">I find that Mr Proud simply told Mr Tana that Kalfresh was spending less for electricity on its new plant than it had budgeted to spend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">I find that Mr Tana did not ask anyone about the electricity consumption of the proposed plant before he entered into the contract with Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">136 I am not therefore satisfied that Proud Nominees or Mr Proud made any representation or contractual promise that the new plant would utilise electric power more efficiently than the existing one at Wattleup, or that North East Equity would save money on its power costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">I am not satisfied that Mr Tana relied on anything communicated by Proud Nominees or Mr Proud in relation to the new plant's power or electricity consumption, usage or costs as a factor in his decision to enter into the contract or install the new plant.</sentence>

 (xi) Was an oral representation made that the new plant would comfortably handle a capacity of 150 tonnes per day packed out in cartons, and in doing so it would be operating as 'idle'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">
 

137 Understanding the contractual terms and representations concerning the pack out capacity of the new plant in the way that I have explained, I find that Mr Proud made a representation to Mr Tana during the negotiations that the new plant would comfortably handle the capacity of 18.75 (or 17.55 after the deletion of the handline) tonnes per operating hour packed out in cartons, and that in doing so it would be operating 'at idle'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">By the words 'at idle' Mr Proud conveyed that the Gillenkirch machines could pack at a faster rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">So much was conveyed in the letter 30 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">138 Mr Tana gave evidence in chief concerning his discussions with Mr Proud on which he and, through him North East Equity, relied to establish the making of the representations alleged:
 
 'You told me what you said to him and it was that you wanted 150 tons processed in an eight hour day --- packed out in an eight hour day, what did he say to that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">Could it be done?</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Did he answer you at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">--- He had no hesitation in saying that he'll [look] at it, it should be able to be done, he didn't specifically say that I could do it on the spot, no.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">
 
 Right and did he come back to you though and say it could be done, or did he - - -?</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">--- Yes, he did, both verbally and in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">
 
 In terms of what it would do it at, was this at full capacity, or something less than this?</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">--- Capacity was never discussed .</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">I suppose it would be fair to say that I assumed that anything that's given to me as a piece of equipment, or as a line, would not be given to me on the basis that it's --- pardon my French --- but flogged to death and run at 100 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">
 
 Right, did he use the words 'operating at idle', use the words?</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">--- He used the words verbally to me, yes he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">
 
 When did he use those words to you, the words 'operating at idle'?</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">--- To the best of my recollection some time in late '01.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">
 
 Late '01, before the contract was made?</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">--- Wrong, I take that back, late '02.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">
 
 Was this before or after the contract was made?</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">--- Before the contract was entered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">' (emphasis added)
 

139 The examination in chief, although not objected to, was leading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">It did not elicit a response in terms of the alleged representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Mr Tana's evidence that capacity 'was never discussed' in the passage cited above is revealing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">Unsurprisingly, Mr Tana was not cross-examined on this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Significantly, he wrote to Mr Proud on 18 December 2003 saying:
 
 'My intention was as follows: 
 
 Contracted volume for 8 hours "idling" 125 tonne 
 (as per your comments) 
 
 Expected volume 8 hours "cranked up" 140 tonne 
 (approx with loss of quality)' 
 

And, months later on 8 May 2004 Mr Tana again wrote to Mr Proud saying that he was:
 
 '... still working on an output expectation of 125 tonnes finished product in an 8 hour day (excluding prepack and handline).</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">' 
 

140 If the five Gillenkirch packers processed 18 tonnes per hour for 7 hours, that would produce a total of 126 tonnes, on the basis that 20 kg cartons were packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">That very figure was one of those provided in the letter of 30 September 2002 which formed part of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">141 I am not satisfied that any representation was made that the new plant would comfortably handle a capacity of 150 tonnes per day packed out in cartons and in doing so would be operating at 'idle'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">DELETION OF THE HANDLINE 
 
142 After the contract was made, Mr Tana unilaterally decided to delete the handline from the design of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">It was common ground that if that happened, the amount capable of being packed by the new plant per hour would be reduced by 1.2 tonnes to 17.55 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">The 1.2 tonnes was the capacity of the handline referred to in the letter of 30 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">North East Equity alleged, in its statement of claim, that Mr Proud represented to Mr Tana orally that this would be the consequence of the deletion of the handline from the proposed design of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">However, in cross-examination Mr Tana agreed that he had unilaterally decided to remove the handline and announced his decision to Mr Proud in about February 2003, a fact corroborated by Mr Webster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">THE DESIGN OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM 
 
143 Mr North had been requested by Mr Proud to provide a quotation for the refrigeration requirements of the new line in late September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">Earlier, Mr Proud had worked with Mr North to provide the refrigeration system for the Kalfresh plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">Then, Mr North had been responsible for the design of both the refrigeration system of the Kalfresh plant and its control software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">The Kalfresh plant also had nine cooling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Mr North thought Kalfresh processed about four to six product groups.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">However, the cooling tanks in that plant were located inside an insulated room maintained at about 12deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">to 15deg.C by air conditioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">144 Mr North was aware, at the time he was asked to provide a quotation for the Wattleup plant, that between 20 and 25 tonnes per hour would be discharged by the system of nine cooling tanks system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">He travelled to Wattleup to discuss the job in order to prepare a quotation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">By 27 September 2002 Mr North had the then current drawing on which he had to provide a quote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">He initially suggested to Mr Webster locating the chilling tanks in the insulated juicing shed at the Wattleup site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">He thought that commonsense suggested that, in the middle of summer, an insulated shed would be far cooler than a tin shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">But, Mr Webster told him that that was too hard to do, logistically.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">Mr North recalled seeing provision for insulation in the main shed in one drawing, but that did not proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">145 Ultimately, Mr North designed the refrigeration components for the Wattleup site based on an ambient temperature of 38deg.C and no insulation in the shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">He said (and I accept) that it was industry practice to design refrigeration systems based on average and not extreme temperature so that there would be occasions on which the ambient temperature of 38deg.C would be exceeded and then the refrigeration equipment might not be able to operate at the desired capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">Mr North designed the Wattleup system to deliver sufficient chilled water at 1deg.-2deg.C from the compensation tank into the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">He understood, from discussions with Mr Proud, that control logic software for the system would be provided by Bruynooghe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">THE EFFECT OF THE REPRESENTATIONS 
 
146 As a matter of commonsense, each of the representations that I have found was made in the course of the negotiations for a significant transaction in trade or commerce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">Moreover, each representation was calculated to, and I find did, induce Mr Tana to decide, on behalf of North East Equity to proceed to enter into the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">There was no serious dispute that North East Equity relied on any representations which would be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">By entering into a contract to define their legal relationship, North East Equity and Proud Machinery selected an agreed expression of the promises that one was making to the other in relation to the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">The standard of performance of the new plant was a matter of considerable significance in the contractual relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">147 Mr Tana claimed that he wanted matters to be documented because he alleged that Mr Proud had been unreliable in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">I do not accept Mr Tana's evidence in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">Moreover, the only matters that Mr Tana had documented were his handwritten note, the typed letters from Proud Nominees and other documents which were part of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">I find that Mr Tana would not have signed the contractual documents unless he was satisfied that they correctly expressed the standard of performance that he had agreed, with Mr Proud, would be required of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">148 It is appropriate to analyse whether or not the breaches of contract alleged have been established before turning to the breaches of any of the representations which remain distinct from the contractual terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">THE NEW PLANT IS INSTALLED 
 
149 The new plant and equipment were installed at the Wattleup site in February and March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">This involved removing much of the previous plant with the exception of those components which were to be used in the new line (including the tipping hopper, initial grading conveyor tables and the brush washers, together with the existing Newtec and Gillenkirch weighing and packing equipment that were retained).</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">Mr Proud was present together with Proud Machinery staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">A number of the key personnel from various suppliers attended to install the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">Mr North was present working on the refrigeration aspects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">Mr Gillenkirch arrived together with Mr Manteca just after work started in late February 2003 to install the Gillenkirch packers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">An electrician from Bruynooghe, Karl van der Vermuelen together with a mechanic and a welder were also there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Later, another staff member from Bruynooghe arrived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">
 
 14.1 Key components of the new line 
 

150 The key components of the new line operated as follows:
 
 (1) Washing and polishing 
 
 
 Carrots arrived from the farms in wooden crates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">The carrots had been pre-washed at the farms but were not graded for size or selected for quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Different soil and weather conditions produced different quality carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">Some crates were introduced immediately into the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Other crates were stored in the cool rooms over night and pre-chilled before they were introduced into the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">The first section of the line retained the equipment that previously had been at the Wattleup plant, namely two wet hoppers into which the crates were tipped by forklifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">Normally two crates were tipped by the forklift into the wet hoppers at once, delivering between about 800 to 900 kg of carrots (depending on whatever weight of carrots was in the crates).</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">The wet hoppers fed the carrots onto roller grass removers and then onto a conveyor system to two elevators which conveyed the carrots onto two pre-inspection tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">At those tables operators removed stones and reject (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">broken, misshaped, cracked or green) carrots to prevent them from being fed into the next stage, being the brush polishers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">The carrots then proceeded into Wyma brush polishers where they were polished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">(2) Flume elevators 
 After polishing, the carrots moved onto one of a pair of Bruynooghe flume elevators which lifted them up to the diameter or girth graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">Water was sprayed onto the carrots as they ascended on small protrusions on the elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">(3) Diameter graders 
 At the top of the flume elevators were two infeed vibrators which spread the carrots out before they dropped through appropriate sized rollers of the two diameter graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">Those machines could grade the carrots into six streams of diameter sizes namely: waste, small, small/medium, medium, large and extra large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">The capacity of the diameter graders was not affected by the quality of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">Their speed could be adjusted by an inverter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">The waste removed by the graders was delivered into crates or bins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">(4) Length graders 
 Next, each of the streams of small, small/medium, medium and large carrots was delivered to the length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">The extra large carrots were delivered to a tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">The four length graders were capable of grading the carrots into three lengths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">Those graders could be adjusted to select different lengths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">As noted above, in a joint report the three experts stated that the sizing of carrots by the length graders was not always correctly done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">They agreed that consistent sizing to the same length was not possible because of the natural variations in the shapes of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">And, they also agreed that the contractual documents did not indicate or specify any quality requirements for the length sizing by these graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">During 2003, North East Equity caused the length graders to be used only as conveyors, without permitting carrots to be sized by length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">(5) The chiller tanks system 
 After the carrots were processed by the length graders (or conveyed over them) they were delivered to the nine chiller tanks by gates positioned on eight conveyors located under the length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">Each size of carrot could be placed in one or more of the chiller tanks where they were held prior to being moved onto conveyors for packing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Because the carrots were heavier than water they sank to the bottom of the chiller tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">The chiller tanks were about 9.5 m long, 1 m wide and 2 m high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">On the southern side of the tanks was a refrigeration tank housing refrigeration coils supplied by Mr North's company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">The refrigeration coils chilled water delivered from a filter located on the top of the refrigeration tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">The water was then returned to the water compensation tank on the western side of the tank system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">That tank contained submersible water pumps which pumped the chilled water into the chiller tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">The submersible pumps were controlled by an inverter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">The submersible pumps delivered sufficient chilled water to chill the carrots in response to a signal from a temperature sensor located in the chiller tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">In each of the chiller tanks there was an air blower, a submersible pump and temperature sensors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">The air blower had two functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">First, during the filling cycle it spread the carrots over the length of the tank as it was being filled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">Thus, as the experts explained in their joint evidence, the carrots did not accumulate in a mound immediately under the end of the conveyor from which they were delivered into the tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">However, the air blower used air at the ambient temperature in the shed and thus that air had the effect of warming the chilled water through which it passed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">The operator of the chiller tanks used the air blower to lift the carrots from the floor of the tank to the water's surface in order to remove them to be packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">All those functions of the chiller tanks and associated equipment could be controlled manually or automatically by the operator manning the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">After the carrots were removed from the tanks, the pumps were activated to deliver chilled water back into the tanks by a signal from an ultrasonic sensor located above the exit conveyor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">(6) The exit conveyors 
 Each of the nine chiller tanks had an exit conveyor which removed carrots and fed them onto one of four distribution belts positioned underneath the exit conveyors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Additionally, the two tanks furthest to the south in the shed received small, and small/medium carrots from the graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">The packing sections were fed by five distribution belts or conveyors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">First, the prepack line was fed by a belt which ran from the two southern tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">That belt conveyed carrots to a grading table positioned immediately before the Newtec multi-head weighers that packed the prepacked bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">A second belt delivered carrots to one of the pairs of dual inspection tables which fed two Newtec multi-head weighers that operated with two Gillenkirch automatic carton fillers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">(This belt could also be reversed to deliver carrots to the area where the handline was to have been built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">) A third belt delivered carrots to the other pair of dual inspection tables feeding the Newtec/Gillenkirch weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">A fourth belt delivered carrots to a single inspection table feeding a single Newtec multi-head weighing machine that operated with a single Gillenkirch automatic carton filler.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">(This was machine No 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">) A fifth belt delivered carrots in bulk (i.e not packaged) directly into the wooden delivery crates for transport to customers such as Woolworths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">(7) The weighing and packing stage 
 The Newtec multi-head weighers on the prepack line were capable of packaging carrots into 0.5 or 1 kg bags and one of them could also package 5 kg bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">Cartons on the prepack section of the line had to be filled manually and were then placed on a conveyor for delivery to one of the two stacking robots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">The other Newtec weighing machines could be set to weigh carrots appropriately for deposit into either 10 kg or 20 kg cartons which were packed by the Gillenkirch packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">Operators positioned manually the empty cartons on infeed conveyors which fed the Gillenkirch automatic filling stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">After the cartons had been automatically filled by one of the other filling stations they were also placed on a conveyor and delivered to one of the two robots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">Before the cartons reached the robots, an operator had to supervise the carton taper (or strapping process) and the vibration station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">The robots were programmed to lift and stack the full cartons onto pallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">14.2 The touch screen 
 

151 The touch screen displayed different A4-sized pictures of the line and its various components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">When a button on the screen was touched, that brought up another window or page which allowed the adjustment of settings, conveyor speeds and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">It was possible to access and view particular parts and components of the production line in order to control them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">Each machine could be turned on or off and its operation could be adjusted by touching the page on the screen that related to that machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">It was possible to control the graders, chilling tanks and packing processes through the use of the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">The screen thus gave the operator control over all aspects of the machinery used in the operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">And, the operator could use the control provided by the touch screen either manually to direct the particular task, or automatically to change the operation of an individual component or a number of components on the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">152 Bruynooghe's representatives had decided to install the touch screen, which controlled the operation of the new plant, including the graders, chilling tanks, exit conveyors and packing operations in the main office at the Wattleup packing shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">The windows in that office looked out towards the tank system over the length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">But that location of the touch screen was some distance away from the tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">The cable originally supplied by Bruynooghe connecting the touch screen to various components in the line was not long enough to locate the touch screen in a position overlooking the tanks, so Mr Vermuelen located it in the office instead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">Later, after a number of complaints, the touch screen was moved from the office to a position on a platform which overlooked the tanks themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">153 The installation was completed on 5 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">However, on 6 March 2003 North East Equity staff began to encounter a number of problems when trying to operate the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">Mr Webster sent a fax to Mr Proud shortly after midday identifying 12 issues, including the need to train staff fully on the new system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">He required Mr Vermuelen and any other people with expertise in the operation of the new machinery to remain at Wattleup to train staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">154 One of Proud Machinery's employees, Adam Hunter, was present during the installation process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">He was a qualified electrician.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">He thought the new line ran quite well the first time it was used although, in his view, a number of slight adjustments needed to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">He was trained by Mr Vermuelen in the operation of the tank system, including the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">Mr Hunter said in evidence that any child who was competent in using a computer game would be able to understand how to use the touch screen (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">the various functions it could perform).</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">155 In addition, he said (and I accept) that the operator of the touch screen had to engage in a skilled 'juggling exercise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">This involved appreciating the amounts of carrots being graded, their graded volumes, the number accumulated in the nine chilling tanks and how long they should be left there to cool the carrots, discharging chilled carrots to the packing machines and '... then moving on to filling another tank and repeating the process over and over'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">He said that:
 
 '... the operator really needs to know the larger amount of the carrots coming through the line as far as your smalls, your mediums, your larges, what tank to put them in, to get that tank - and get that tank emptied whilst filling another tank to allow that tank to cool down to empty that one, while refilling the other tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">And that's what I mean by juggling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">
 
 And you mean it involves skill?</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">--- Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">
 
 You wouldn't describe it as being a simply automated process then, would you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">
 
 Not at all?</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">' 
 

Once the touch screen was moved to a position above the chilling tanks, the operator could simply look down to assess the quantity of carrots in the water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">Before that, the operator had to walk to the tanks, assess the position and then return to the touch screen or speak to other staff who could report on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">
 
 14.3 Ms Mirosevich's role in operating the new line 
 

156 In early March 2003, Mr Hunter and Mr Vermeulen trained Ms Mirosevich, Mr Webster and a Proud Machinery technician, Ralph Gibson, in the use of the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">Ms Mirosevich was the manager of the Wattleup plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">She controlled the labour force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">The touch screen training took about half a day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">Mr Vermuelen went through each page on the touch screen and described the functions of each block on the screen itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">157 Mr Hunter said that Mr Webster had no difficulty picking up how to operate the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">Mr Hunter acted in a role of interpreting for Ms Mirosevich during the training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">Mr Vermuelen spoke with an accent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">Ms Mirosevich spoke with a thick Croatian accent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">Mr Hunter sought to explain to her in English, a second time, what Mr Vermuelen had said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">However, Ms Mirosevich appeared to Mr Hunter to be confused during her training, and to have had little comprehension of how to use the touch screen at the end of the training period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">He also concluded that Ms Mirosevich had no knowledge of mechanical maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">I accept Mr Hunter's evidence that Ms Mirosevich was involved in the process of training, as described by Mr Hunter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">I reject Ms Mirosevich's evidence that she simply stood at the back of the room during the training session.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">158 Moreover, by this time, Ms Mirosevich had already spent a week in Belgium at the Bruynooghe factory and other locations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">Mr Tana had sent her there in early 2003 to learn how to operate the new equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">159 Mr Tana knew that Ms Mirosevich had had no computer training or, indeed, any management training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">Yet, he chose her to be trained at Bruynooghe's factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">She said, and I find, that Mr Tana promised her that she would be the '... princess in the shed' as a reward for her previous hard work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">160 Ms Mirosevich had no capacity to deal with computers or computerised equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">Even at the time of the hearing she did not know how to operate a computer and was not then interested to learn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">Although she denied being afraid of technology, she had no wish or desire to learn how to use a computer or the internet prior to her retirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">Her attitude was, as she told me: 'I have operators to use the touch screen, my job is not to use the touch screen'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">However, this was the crucial and focal point of the operation of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">Ms Mirosevich gave the following evidence regarding what she learnt in Belgium about using the touch screen:
 
 'Did you go through the various settings and controls or did you just learn to stop and start?</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">--- Stop and start, give the carrots to the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">That's all that what I learn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">
 
 So, did you learnt no more than that?</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">--- No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">' 
 

161 I accept that this encapsulated the extent of the knowledge she obtained: i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">how to turn the machines on and off and to 'divert [the carrots] to the belt' using the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">However, I am satisfied that proper attempts were made at the Bruynooghe factory to train Ms Mirosevich on how to use the touch screen and to operate equipment similar to that which was to be installed at Wattleup, so as to achieve all of their technical capacities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">I do not accept her evidence that she spent a week at the Bruynooghe factory and other factories in Belgium without, as she asserted, being shown and trained how to operate the technically complicated aspects of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">She had been chosen by Mr Tana to be in charge of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">I do not accept that Bruynooghe did not attempt to instruct her fully as to how to operate both the touch screen and the type of equipment which was to be installed at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">162 After she returned from Belgium, Ms Mirosevich did not train, or require training for, any of her staff in the operation of the new line or the touch screen at any time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">Unfortunately, that was because she did not acquire any relevant understanding of the importance of those matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">She said: 
 
 '.... I train people how to grade the produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">I'm operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">I'm production .</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">I train people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">For machinery, John Webster will train how to operate machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">
 
 All right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">But since 2004, Mr Webster hasn't been there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">There hasn't been any training, has there?</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">--- I have still many signed people operating machine what they were there before John Webster left.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">' (emphasis added)
 

163 Ms Mirosevich had asserted in her witness statement that she had primarily taught herself how to operate the plant including the touch screen, and she repeated in the witness box that she was self taught.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">She complained that Mr Webster had said that he was too busy to teach her how to run the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">However, in cross-examination she claimed that, at some time after early March 2003, she learnt from Mr Webster some of the capacity of the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">She also said that she asked the electrician, Hin Tan, who took over some of Mr Webster's responsibilities after he left, to teach her how to adjust the system manually, and that Mr Webster and Mr Proud had refused to help her do this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">I find that Ms Mirosevich was conscious of her failure to learn how to operate the new line, and sought to blame others for that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">Apart from her seeking help from Mr Tan, I do not accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">164 Ms Mirosevich's incompetence in understanding how the touch screen and other parts of the plant operated and could be controlled by the computer equipment, led to constant manual adjustments of the different items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">That resulted in the machinery not working as it should have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">And, the operation of the new line lacked the overall intelligent control which a competent controller would have brought to the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">This was evident when a test was conducted on 17 or 18 November 2003, with which I will deal below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">The various representatives of the manufacturers were present on that occasion and recalibrated all their machinery to operate as it had been specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">The plant then performed in a generally satisfactory manner (making allowances for the performance of the flume elevators, and the intralock convertors).</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">165 Overall, I did not find Ms Mirosevich to be a reliable witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">I do not intend by saying this to criticise Ms Mirosevich personally, or to suggest that she was dishonest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">Rather, she was concerned that she should not be blamed for any problems North East Equity experienced from the operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">It was not her fault that she had been given a task that was beyond her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">She did not appreciate her own incompetence to be in charge of the operation of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">This led her to rationalise in her own mind that she had no part in any shortcomings in identifying requirements of North East Equity for the design of the new plant or the deficiencies in its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">166 Because of her inability to understand the importance and significance of the touch screen to the overall operation of the new line, Ms Mirosevich was unable to convey to Mr Tana, and he did not himself appreciate, the need to have a competent person running the operations who could use properly the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">It was vital that there be someone who actually understood how to operate the machinery and who could use that knowledge to conceptualise the appropriate inputs into the touch screen so that the plant would operate efficiently and usefully to grade and process the volumes of carrots available at any particular time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">167 Mr Tana described himself as computer illiterate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">He did not have any understanding of the need to employ in the plant a person who could operate the computer and its touch screen competently.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">He, too, did not understand the significance of the touch screen or the need for constant monitoring of the various parts of the new plant to inform decisions about the use of the touch screen to control the processing operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">Instead of employing someone else who had that technical competence, Mr Tana relied on Ms Mirosevich in an area where both of them were out of their depth because of their inability to work with computers or to understand the changes in management skills needed to operate the new line as compared to the old one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">It is hardly surprising, then, that when the equipment was installed and the Bruynooghe and other technicians left, the operation of the plant became less than satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">
 
 14.4 Mr Correia's role in operating the new line 
 

168 Jose Correia was the assistant production manager at the Wattleup plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">He said that he had been doing basically the same things in his job at the Sumich plant at Wattleup since 1980 with the exception of about eighteen months, when he left to run his own business, but later returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">Mr Correia had said that his basic function was to check the carrots before they went to the packing line to determine their temperature and quality so as to see how they should be graded for packing and to oversee the rest of the operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">That was also substantively the function that he performed prior to the introduction of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">169 I formed the view that Mr Correia was basically an honest person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">But, he was not always reliable as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">He was defensive about his role in giving evidence because he had not been able to absorb how to run the complex new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">Because he was responsible to Ms Mirosevich, he did what she told him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">Mr Correia denied that he was resistant to change or to doing things differently, particularly in adjusting to the introduction of the automated plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">However, I am satisfied that he found it very difficult to adjust to the different way in which the new line operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">170 Mr Correia was aware that Ms Mirosevich had gone to Belgium to be trained just before the new line began operating, but he received no training at all from her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">Although he recalled being present with Mr Vermeulen and Mr Webster when the plant was being commissioned, Mr Correia did not recall any occasion when Mr Vermeulen taught him and Ms Mirosevich how to operate the touch screen and other aspects of the Bruynooghe equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">Mr Webster had also been trained by the Gillenkirch personnel on how to operate its equipment when the new plant was being commissioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">171 Mr Webster said that no one had been designated as the operator of the touch screen when it was installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">He volunteered to run the system for a week, provided that he had some assistance from the production staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">Mr Webster said that Mr Correia provided him with this assistance, and he trained Mr Correia, who then became the focus of running the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">Mr Correia said that he had been trained to operate the chilling tanks by Mr Webster for a couple of days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">He claimed that Mr Webster did not train him on all of the touch screen's operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">I accept Mr Webster's evidence and prefer it to Mr Correia's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">172 Tony Schubring had first attended the Wattleup plant when he was still working at Kalfresh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">This was probably during 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">He was then the floor manager of Kalfresh plant responsible for managing the operations of its plant and equipment in the packing shed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">Mr Schubring's principal responsibility at this time was to monitor Kalfresh's plant's output from its nine Bruynooghe chilling tanks together with that plant's polishing and grading of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">He later attended at the Wattleup plant in early 2006 when he was employed by one of Mr Proud's companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">173 Mr Schubring observed that Mr Correia never seemed to be present at the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">Mr Correia understood that a supervisor in his position had to control the flow of carrots through the line, and do so by using the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">He disagreed with Mr Schubring's advice to him that the operator should be at the touch screen all the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">Mr Correia knew that he could make adjustments to the operation of the machinery controlled by the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">However, he did so only when he saw the need to make them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">His approach was to be reactive to problems after they occurred and not proactive by seeking to avoid them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">Mr Correia was only at the touch screen when he thought there was something to do there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">He claimed that he was there for about 70 percent of the time, but I have no confidence that that estimate is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">174 Mr Correia said that he only calibrated the equipment on the line when he thought there was a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">He claimed that he had never been told to do so on a daily basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">Initially, he had to ring Mr Vermeulen in Belgium to ask him how to do that task.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">He also did what he was told in keeping records, and Mr Proud's complex schedule was made up largely from the records Mr Correia had kept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">Mr Correia's resistance both to learning how to operate the new equipment (including the touch screen) and changing his routine was demonstrated in early 2006 when Mr Schubring again came to Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Mr Correia did not spend much time with Mr Schubring even though he appreciated that the purpose of Mr Schubring's visit was to help North East Equity's personnel to operate the machinery properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">175 Mr Schubring told him that the pumps should not be run continuously to remove carrots from the tanks, as Mr Correia had been doing up to then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">And, he told Mr Correia that the air blowers in the chilling tanks should be turned off once the tank was full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">That was because the air was pumped into the tanks at ambient or higher temperatures and therefore heated the chilled water.</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">Indeed, Mr North took measurements in about 2004, recording that, when pumped into the tanks, the air had a temperature of up to 65deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">At such a temperature the air would transfer its heat to the cooler water causing it to heat up (as well as increasing the costs of power consumption, first, for chilling and, secondly, for unnecessary air pumping).</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">Mr Correia said no-one had told him that before, but I accept Mr Webster's evidence that in early 2003 he had told Mr Correia the same thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">I do not accept Mr Correia's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">I prefer Mr Schubring and Mr Webster's evidence where it conflicts with Mr Correia's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">And, I accept Mr Schubring's evidence about his observations of the operations and personnel on his visits to Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">The consequence of this inappropriate use of the pumps was that it affected the ability of the chilling tanks to cool carrots to a core temperature of 5deg.C or less, and slowed production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">In my opinion this was a cause of carrots being packed with a core temperature more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">THE WEIGHT OF CARROTS IN THE BINS 
 
176 Mr Tana and Mr Proud gave conflicting accounts of the weight of carrots in the crates or bins tipped into the wet hopper, depending on the time at which they made their various witness statements and how they perceived that suited their cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">It would have been a simple matter to have measured that weight, but neither side did this objectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">Neither Mr Tana nor Mr Proud was a reliable witness on this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">177 Each changed his evidence to adopt the other's position when they understood the purport of Mr Proud's schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">Both men were dealing with matters at a level of generality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">By the time of the litigation each was defensive of his own position and argumentative about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">I am not satisfied that either retained a reliable recollection of the detail of their discussions and considerations in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">The contemporaneous written material, the objective matrix of mutually known facts and commonsense, are, in general, a better guide for reaching findings of what was said or conveyed between Mr Tana and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Nonetheless, I have also used the less sure guide of impression in arriving at my conclusions about their evidence generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">178 In his first witness statement Mr Proud had said that the weight of the carrots in those bins was 410 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">On the other hand, Mr Tana, in his initial witness statement had said that the carrots in the bins weighed approximately 450 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Mr Proud used this latter figure as the hypothesis on which his schedule was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">The hypothesis involved deducting the weight of the rejected carrots from the posited 450 kg weight of carrots in the tipped bins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">In his evidence in chief, Mr Tana said that he wished to amend the figure of 450 kg to between 400-425 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">He did this to demonstrate that Mr Proud's analysis was incorrect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">He agreed in cross-examination that as soon as he saw that Mr Proud's schedule had a heading indicating that the weight of the carrots in the bins was 450 kg, he realised that it could have the effect of undermining his case that the new plant could not produce over a 140 tonnes of packed carrots per day (leaving aside any production from the handline).</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">This also went to the claim for economic loss based on a loss of sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">Mr Tana agreed that, by the time he made his first witness statement, he had used the crates or bins in the business for a long time and had many years of experience with them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Ms Mirosevich had said that the bins contained 410 kg of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">179 An objective means of determining which weight was correct appeared in a letter that Mr Proud wrote on 23 July 2003 to Mr Tana about a test done on 15 July 2003 and Ms Mirosevich's notes of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">In the table below I have calculated the weight of carrots in the bins based on Ms Mirosevich's notes of this test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">These recorded that 372 bins were tipped into the wet hoppers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">Ms Mirosevich noted that 39 bins were filled with rejects from the grading tables located before the brush washers and a further 20 bins of rejects (including waste) were filled from the grading tables at the weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">Thus a total of 313 bins were processed, resulting in a recorded pack out of 126,684 kg, or 404.74 kg per bin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">This pack out included 18.64 tonnes of Class 2 and 18.08 tonnes of 10 kg cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">Using 404.74 kg per bin, the 59 bins of rejects (23.9 tonnes) amounted to about 15.9% of those delivered and the carrots originally in the 372 bins weighed about 150.5 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Production test of 15 July 2003 
 
 Total number of bins tipped into wet hoppers 
 372 bins Reject bins from grading tables before brush washers 39 bins 
 Reject/waste bins from grading tables at weighing/packing machines 20 bins 
 Less total number of reject/waste bins 
 59 bins Total bins packed 
 313 bins Total kg recorded at pack out 
 126,684.00 kg Average kg per bin processed (126,684 kg / 313 bins) 
 404.74 kg Total kg in reject bins (59 bins x 404.74 kg) 
 23,879.73 kg Total kg in bins delivered (372 bins x 404.74 kg) 
 150,563.73 kg % of carrots rejected ((23,879 kg / 150,563 kg) x 100) 
 15.86 % 

 
180 Mr Proud wrote in his letter of 23 July that the waste was 16.7% and weighed 25,500 kg (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">on his calculation the 59 waste bins each had a quantity of carrots which weighed on average 432.2 kg).</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">However, I do not consider Mr Proud's calculation to be reliable because he gave no explanation in his letter of how he arrived at this weight for the waste.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">Although the witnesses sometimes used the word 'rejects' generally as synonymous for 'waste', in fact there was a commercial distinction between the terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">Rejects were carrots which, in general, had a commercial value and were in fact sold by North East Equity for non-retail purposes such as juicing or use in commercial manufacturing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">On the other hand, 'waste' was material that had no value and was, in effect, 'rubbish'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">181 I find the carrots in the bins weighed between 400 and 410 kg, but on average 405 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">There may have been seasonal and other factors, such as the variety of carrot, which affected the weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">When the negotiations occurred in 2002, Mr Tana, his staff, and Mr Proud all understood and proceeded on the basis that the carrots in the bins weighed about 410 kg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">MR TANA'S ROLE IN PLANNING CARROT PRODUCTION 
 
182 In his written evidence Mr Tana said that North East Equity did not grow carrots speculatively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">He said that, as far as possible, he aimed to avoid growing any carrots that could not be processed, packed and sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">He said that carrot production was always very dependent on sales expectation and packing capability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">Mr Tana personally decided the growing and planting program of each of North East Equity's carrot farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">Initially it operated a 700 acre farm at Guilderton, some distance north of Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">That farm supplied 60% to 70% of carrots processed at Wattleup by 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">In addition, a number of other farms owned or operated by North East Equity or Mr Tana, as well as by independent farmers, supplied carrots to Wattleup for packaging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">183 In around 2001 or 2002, North East Equity purchased a farm at Lancelin of about 4,500 acres about 180 km north of Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">Mr Tana then had the long term aim of expanding his operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">At this time, a North East Equity's sales and net profit from its vegetable business were significantly increasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">Carrot production from the Wattleup plant was the primary source of that increase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">However, the purchase coincided with what turned out to be the peak in the local export market for carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">184 Mr Tana worked with North East Equity's farm manager to determine carrot plantings at the farms to meet production targets in time for harvest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">Carrots could be grown on the farms throughout the year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">The farm manager used a computer program for planting and growing carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">In summer, carrots took about 16 weeks to grow, whereas in winter they took between 20 and 26 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">Certain varieties of carrots were faster growing than others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">Mr Tana would write down the amount of carrots that he wished to have grown and the time in which he required them to be ready for delivery to the Wattleup plant for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">This involved planning for up to half a year before the carrots were ready to be harvested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">Thus, if carrots were planted in the beginning of winter, he would expect those carrots to come to market about 20 to 26 weeks later, depending on exactly when in the seasonal cycle they were planted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1013">185 The computer program worked by indicating that, if carrots were planted at a particular time, they would be ready for harvest at a fixed time thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">Mr Tana gave his farm manager the production targets he wished for each of the 52 weeks of the year by indicating the times at which he wished to have specific quantities of carrots ready for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">The program would then work backwards to calculate the time at which those carrots should be planted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">186 Thus, by March 2003 or beforehand, Mr Tana had already given directions for planting of carrots that would be harvested 4-6 months afterwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">In other words, Mr Tana had assessed the likely market months in advance of when the carrots arrived at the Wattleup plant for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">In this way he decided and pre-planned the quantity of carrots which the plant would process many months before the carrots were delivered for packing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">This planning and its associated time scale for the later harvest is significant in assessing Mr Tana's evidence that, but for its claimed problems with the new line, North East Equity would have produced more carrots, and profits from their sales, and thus it suffered economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">CARROT FARM PRODUCTION PROBLEMS 
 
187 By early 2003 the Guilderton farm was experiencing problems with the quality of its crop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">These difficulties had commenced at least by the time the new plant was installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">Mr Tana said that there were a number of diseases at the Guilderton farm which resulted in carrots which were not consistently of good enough quality to meet the standard of Class 1, although he said that some good carrots were still produced there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">188 Moreover, there were other difficulties with the Guilderton farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">Mr Tana explained the decision to close it down was made because it was an aged farm, run down and the soil had been pushed too hard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">He said: 'We needed to relocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">' Hence, I infer that this was an important factor in the decision to purchase the Lancelin farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">Another factor was, of course, the opportunity it presented as a much larger farm to expand North East Equity's carrot production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">In my opinion the quality problems with the Guilderton farm continued, even if the diseases were addressed, up to the time that it ceased production in June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">189 Coincidentally, when North East Equity sought to use the resource of the Lancelin farm, it experienced carrot blight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">Mr Tana said that the blight afflicted the crop there during 2004 and 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">The problems with both farms appear to have been evident in terms of their effect on the operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">North East Equity's expert accountant, Martin Langridge, concluded that in the period between May 2003 and June 2005 the volume of carrots packed showed a downward trend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">Extrapolating figures from the bar charts prepared by Mr Langridge depicting carrot volumes packed, the following very approximate comparisons emerge:
 Month 2002 Volume packed (million kg) 2003 Volume packed (million kg) 2004 Volume packed (million kg) 2005 Volume packed (million kg) January 2.35 2.8 1.45 1.35 May 2.35 1.35 1.85 1.2 June 1.75 1.30 2.2 1 August 2.6 1.30 2.1 September 2.25 2.25 2.45 October 3.05 3.00 2.15 November 2.75 2.5 2.45 December 2.25 1.9 1.75 

 
190 These figures show some reduction over time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">Significantly the radical drops in May 2003 and 2005 as against the corresponding figures for 2002 and 2004 would appear to reflect the difficulties at the farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">The figure for May 2003 of about 1 million kg fewer carrots packed than for the preceding year could not have been related to any problem with the new line since Mr Tana would have caused those carrots to have planted in January 2003, well before the line was installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">Likewise, the figures for June and August 2003 reflect production problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">191 Significantly, the figures for September, October and November 2003 show similar volumes packed at the peak time for sales, as in the previous year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">Yet, the evidence summarised in Mr Proud's schedule in those three months of 2003 showed that the overall reject rate was very high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">And, about 70% of all carrots which arrived at the grading tables immediately before the weighing and packing machines at that time were Class 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">Hence, I infer that Mr Tana had caused more carrots to be grown than in the previous year's corresponding period, but what was harvested was of an inferior quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">192 Mr Langridge prepared a chart which showed the weighted average price per kilogram for export sales was about 80cents per kg in mid-2003 but fell to about 70cents per kg in late 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">By mid-2004 the price was between about 67cents and 69cents per kg rising to stay around 72cents per kg from late 2004 to mid-2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">It is not necessary to make a precise finding about these prices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">It suffices that the chart showed that the returns from export sales had substantially reduced after mid-2003 from what they had been before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">193 Mr Langridge also analysed North East Equity's sales figures for the 2004 and 2005 financial years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">He used actual data from its financial records to calculate export sales and some local sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">He hypothesised that some local sales were rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">He prepared calculations (excluding assumed rejects) of average local sales prices per kilogram for the 2004 and 2005 financial years of 48.64cents and 43.36cents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">He did not have data for May and June 2003 local sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">Thus, both local and export average sales prices per kilogram fell over the period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">
 
 17.1 Carrot quality in 2003 
 

194 In his 20 August 2003 memorandum to Mr Tana, Mr Webster wrote that the 'quality of carrots' was a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">(I will return to this memorandum later in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">) In evidence, which I accept, Mr Webster explained that the quality of the carrot to which he was referring was that the more carrots that had to be graded out, the longer the process of production became, and that was a major issue to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">Mr Webster said that he meant that there were more rejects and Class 2 carrots being taken out than ought to have been the case, had they been of a Class 1 quality, when the process would have been a lot easier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">195 Mr Proud, in his written evidence, stated that in 2003 and early 2004 the proportion of Class 2 carrots that he observed '... was far too high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">It was up to 70%'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">Mr Tana admitted this in his written responsive evidence, saying:
 
 'I repeat that having up to 70% class 2 was a temporary aberration and has not been the norm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">' 
 

In his written evidence in chief, Mr Tana had asserted that, on average since 1998, there were 20% Class 2 carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">I do not accept that evidence in relation to the period after the new line was installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">196 During most of 2003, the quality of produce delivered to Wattleup for processing was very different and of a significantly lesser quality to that of a year earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">On 3 November 2003 Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud saying that all carrots that day had been processed as Class 2 '... because your system has no flexibility to take out 30% Class 1'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">Of course, the system was not intended to remove Class 1 carrots, nor was it supposed to process so many low quality carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">As Mr Tana said in evidence, he was '... not in the business to sell grade 2s' (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">Class 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">197 The specifications and negotiations for the new plant in 2002 had nominated a maximum of 18% rejects for removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">Mr Tana and North East Equity did not specify or suggest in 2002 that 30% of the produce be capable of being removed, let alone that percentage after removal of rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">The negotiations and the contract contemplated that Class 1 carrots would be packed while Class 2 and some rejects would be removed at the grading tables immediately before the weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">The 18.75 or 17.55 tonnes per operating hour at final pack out that was the subject of negotiations in 2002 referred to Class 1 carrots that had been processed from an input of 22.8 tonnes, the balance being class 2 and rejects (including waste).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">198 The facsimile transmission of Proud Machinery's letter of 18 October 2002, which formed part of the contract, was accompanied with drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">One of those drawings depicted a table 3 m long and 1.75 m wide, with six persons grading, three on either side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">In the middle of conveyor belts running the length of the tables were six chutes for either waste or Class 2 carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">The grading personnel threw carrots into the appropriate chute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">The final design of the tables was changed by reducing the number of chutes from six to five.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">Although North East Equity did not plead any case involving the particular configuration of these grading tables, it complained that, as installed, they were only capable of fitting two persons, rather than three, on each side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">Hence it contended the tables could not meet the requirement of being able to remove 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">However, I accept Mr Proud's evidence that he had observed three people grading on each side of the tables on his visits and that the tables could fit that number of persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">199 But, in any event, Proud Machinery had submitted drawings of the tables for North East Equity's consideration and approval before proceeding to install them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">North East Equity knew how close together individuals performing grading work could and should be placed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">And it knew how quickly the actual Newtec and Gillenkirch weighing and packing machines in the old line operated and how fast individuals grading had to work to keep up with those machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">Mr Tana and Mr Webster, at least, had been looking at proposed designs and commenting on dimensions during the months leading up to and after the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">Indeed on 3 September 2002 Mr Tana wrote a fax to Mr Webster of his '... initial thoughts on layout'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">He wrote: 'Where will we fit 2-3 persons levelling carrots after [Gillenkirch]?'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">This showed that he was conscious of how many people needed to be accommodated at various parts of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">200 The three production experts concluded that the plant was capable of removing about 25% of the carrots presented at the final grading tables (including rejects).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">Mr Tana's complaints by November 2003 were based on the aberrant nature of the carrots being grown by the farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">Those carrots were of much lower quality than either party had contemplated in the negotiations in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">201 However, I am satisfied that most of the carrots produced at this time, in the order of 70%, were of a class or grade 2 standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">The diseases and other problems at Guilderton did not affect the volume of carrots produced, so that quantities stipulated in Mr Tana's growing schedule were still delivered for processing at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">However, these factors did affect the quality of what was produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">202 I am not satisfied that the size or capacity of the grading tables, as installed immediately prior to the weighing and packing machines, caused any breach of contract or departure from a representation by Proud Machinery or Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">I am not satisfied that those tables were not adequate to enable a sufficient and appropriate amount of rejects and Class 2 carrots to be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">I find that the tables, as designed and installed, were approved by North East Equity as appropriate for the grading work it required to be done on them before their design was finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">More grading came to be done at these tables in 2003 and afterwards due to the significant deterioration in the quality of the carrots as delivered from the farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">
 
 17.2 Carrot blight at Lancelin 
 

203 The carrot blight reduced production from the Lancelin farm by 50% from that planned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">Mr Tana initially claimed this lasted only for about 3 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">In cross-examination he volunteered that it had lasted from late 2004 to December 2005, when he said 'it had virtually vanished'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">Tellingly he said: '... only our records would be able to reveal the exact figures'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">No such records were put into evidence, although Mr Tana said they were at the Lancelin farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">In 2005, North East Equity was growing carrots at Lancelin on 1,200 of its 4,300 acres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">The blight affected the leaves of the carrots, which resulted in them not growing as large as normal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">Initially Mr Tana said in evidence that the effect of the blight on the Lancelin crop could be explained in this way:
 
 'We were still getting the volume out but the only difference was that the carrots were not of 100% grade one quality, they were a much lesser quality .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">' (emphasis added)
 
 
 
204 However, earlier, in his written evidence he asserted that in 2004 North East Equity was planting fewer carrots because of the limitations in the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">I reject that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">At that time, Mr Tana had planned to phase out production from the Guilderton farm entirely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">He knew that there were production problems at both farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">I do not believe that Mr Tana reduced planting or production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">To the contrary, he sought to maximise production so that North East Equity could harvest a crop that was of as great a quantity and as good a quality as possible to send to market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">205 Moreover, a decision to cut or not increase carrot production at the farms during 2003 and afterwards because of claimed difficulties with the new line is improbable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">First, any decision had to be made four to six months before harvest and delivery to the new line for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">Secondly, in the context of production-related problems being experienced at the Guilderton and Lancelin farms, I do not accept that Mr Tana was doing anything except seeking to obtain the maximum crop possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">Thirdly, any difficulty in the operating of the new line was likely to be addressed during the four to six months intervening period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">Fourthly, the quality problems meant that North East Equity was only bringing to market a composite grade of, at best, about 30% of its harvest as Class 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">Fifthly, North East Equity adduced no contemporaneous records or other evidence beyond Mr Tana's self-serving assertions of planting decisions or demand forecasts that could corroborate this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">The impacts of market forces on carrot prices, crop quality and sales, strongly told against a suggestion that North East Equity would have produced any more carrots than it actually did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">In addition, work was necessary to prepare more acreage on the Lancelin farm to grow carrots and to insulate those acres, if possible, from being affected by blight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">206 By 2005, Mr Tana said that he was in the process of switching the focus of his horticultural operations, including the production of carrots through (among others) North East Equity, from almost 100% export to about 50% export with the rest diverted to the local market in both Western Australia and the eastern states.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">No doubt, this plan resulted from the impact that competition from China and the appreciation of the Australian dollar had had on North East Equity's exports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">Mr Tana said that he perceived China as the major source of competition for the export market for carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">He told a newspaper reporter in April 2005:
 
&#8226; the percentage of exports from the overall production of his business was down to about 75% at the time;
 
&#8226; the Western Australian vegetable industry, including carrot growing, had gone through what he described as a 'major, major correction' as a result of increased competition in export markets and the high Australian dollar over the preceding two years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">By then he had also taken a decision to move North East Equity's processing operations to the Lancelin site; and
 
&#8226; Mr Tana proposed to convert what he described as the new large-scale, highly mechanised carrot farming and packing operation at Lancelin to organic production;
 
207 Although he initially sought to suggest that these comments, published in April 2005 in a newspaper article, were to do with cauliflower, Mr Tana ultimately conceded that they were to do with carrots which formed 90% to 95% of the business of Sumich about which he was speaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">This was another instance leading to my overall impression that I should be cautious about accepting Mr Tana's uncorroborated evidence or its accuracy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">208 Mr Tana asserted that the problems at the Guilderton farm lasted between 6-12 months after March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">North East Equity produced no records to support Mr Tana's assertions as to when production difficulties began and ceased at either Guilderton or Lancelin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">The only evidence of their duration was Mr Tana's uncorroborated assertions, which I do not accept fully explained these problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">In a number of instances in his evidence, Mr Tana exaggerated substantially difficulties or problems, which he claimed North East Equity had, for the purposes of improving its case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">I am not prepared to accept his uncorroborated assertions or to draw inferences favourable to North East Equity's case based on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">209 As at November 2003 Mr Tana's contemporaneous correspondence demonstrated (and I find) that the production problems at Guilderton had resulted in as much as 70% of the carrots delivered regularly for processing were Class 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">This was combined with the small amount of Class 1 carrots to make a 'composite' grade at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">The decision to process this composite grade had nothing to do with any defect in the operation of the new line at any time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">I am comfortably satisfied that the problems with the Guilderton farm were far from being resolved in late 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">Indeed, I am not satisfied that those quality problems were ever resolved at any time prior to that farm's closure in June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">I am not satisfied that the quality of produce from the Guilderton farm was ever restored to a Class 1 standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">
 
 17.3 The market for carrots 
 

210 Mr Tana's written evidence included material to support North East Equity's claim for economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">He estimated that, based on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, in the period between 2001 and 2003 North East Equity was producing approximately 50% of the fresh produce supplied to the export market from Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">The figures related to fruit and vegetables in general, not just carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">He said that carrots comprised about 95% of North East Equity's total fresh produce sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">He swore that North East Equity:
 
 '... is not able to command a premium price for the packed carrots processed through the Proud line because of its poor packed quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">
 
 
 
 Therefore, [North East Equity] sales are now driven more by the volume we produce rather than the quality of the product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">
 
 
 
 ... [C]arrots packed through the Proud line are of an inferior merchantable quality to those packed at Lancelin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">' 
 
 
 
211 These paragraphs were calculated to lead to the inference that the plant installed by Proud Machinery had caused the decline in quality to which they referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">I am satisfied that Mr Tana was well aware, when he gave that evidence, that this was not the true position at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">212 Next, Mr Tana asserted in his written evidence that since 2003 there had not been a noticeable impact on North East Equity's business due to currency fluctuation, in particular the appreciation of the Australian dollar against major currencies used to pay for exports in the markets to which it was selling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">However, Mr Langridge's report showed that the weighted average price per kilogram received in Australian dollars by North East Equity fell from approximately 81cents at the end of July 2003 down to 71cents at the end of October 2003, falling as low as 67cents in the middle of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">213 Mr Tana had said that during the period between January 2003 to June 2004 the carrot market was not good because of, first, competition from China and, secondly, a spike in the exchange rate for the Australian dollar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">He explained the spike was in the Australian dollar appreciating against the US dollar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">214 During the period between 1998-1999 and 2004-2005 carrot exports from Australia rose from about 50,000 tonnes, worth $30 million in 1998-1999, to a peak just short of 70,000 tonnes, worth a little over $40 million in 2001-2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">Exports fell back in terms of volume to about 65,000 in 2002-2003 but increased in value to about $42.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">However, in 2003-2004 there were falls in volume to about 52,000 tonnes and revenue to about $36 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">The decline continued in 2004-2005 to about 50,000 tonnes and about $34 million in revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">These figures appeared in the 2005 annual report of the Department of Agriculture of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">The report noted that Western Australia produced 88% of Australia's carrot exports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">It remarked that there had been reduced export returns for Australia during the above period and that there was then a continued expansion of vegetable exports from China which was causing rationalisation in production here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">215 Frank Chew was North East Equity's export or marketing manager from 1998 until he ceased employment in early 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">During that period he ultimately also became the general manager of operations at Wattleup but North East Equity gave no explanation why he was not called to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">I infer that his evidence would not have assisted North East Equity's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">216 Gary Kift had been North East Equity's company secretary since 1989 and was its financial controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">Mr Kift was a professional accountant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">He prepared North East Equity's tax returns and after they were finalised by its tax agents he signed a number of them in his capacity as public officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">Mr Kift explained that the profit and loss statements in North East Equity's tax returns for the financial years 2000 to 2006 contained the following total results for its vegetable business which I have summarised in the table below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">He explained, as did Mr Tana, that the accounts in other sections recorded results from various other activities of North East Equity apart from the vegetable business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">217 North East Equity led no evidence to explain or break down the sources or amounts of its actual income or expenses in any of these years relating to carrot sales or its carrot business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">Neither of the expert accountants, Mr Langridge and Mr Holmes, examined this data in the tax returns to segregate which parts of the figures related solely to carrot production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">Mr Holmes reported that he was not able to access North East Equity's data to extract this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">Mr Langridge pointed out that the sales figures (total, export and local) shown in the tax return data did not disclose the volume of sales or the exact proportion which related to sales of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">He was not sure that the figures were able to be useful in that form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">However, Mr Tana said about 95% of North East Equity's fresh produce sales were carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">218 Indeed, Mr Langridge said in his first report that he had examined monthly profit and loss statements for the carrot shed operations of North East Equity for the period May 2003 to June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">His figures for the financial years 2004 and 2005 were very different to those in the tax returns, and I have included those in the table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">219 I find that the substantial part of North East Equity's business was its dealings in carrots, with only minor contributions of not more than 5% to 10% from other vegetable dealings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">Its tax returns revealed the following, and I have included comparable figures from Mr Landridge's report:
 
 
 
 
 Financial Year Total Sales Income Gross Profit Net Operating Profit Tax Return Mr Langridge's Report Tax Return Mr Langridge's Report Tax Return Mr Langridge's Report 1999/2000 $29.09m

 $5.07m 
 $2.56m 
 

 
220 The discrepancy between Mr Tana's and Mr Kift's evidence as to what was in the tax returns and how they represented substantively North East Equity's carrot processing business and what was in the monthly figures aggregated by Mr Langridge was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">Based on Mr Tana's and Mr Kift's evidence concerning the results of North East Equity's vegetable business, its carrot business contributed 90% to 95% of the total sales income gross profit and net operating profit in the tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">221 The decline in sales and profit from 2001/2002 to 2002/2003 was marked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">It occurred during eight months that were unaffected by the new line, which only began operating in March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">And the decline continued in the subsequent years because of the quality and production problems at North East Equity's farms and the significant deterioration in the export market from competition and the appreciating Australian dollar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">Although those figures are not solely to do with the carrot business, I find that the significant downward movements after 2002/2003 were caused substantively by the above factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">
 
 17.4 The 2002 decision to buy the new line, the 2003 change in the carrot market and North East Equity's claim for economic loss 
 

222 In late 2001, North East Equity exported about 90% of the carrots which it processed through the old Wattleup plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">Its export market was in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, sometimes the Philippines, South East Asia and sometimes across to the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">At this time Mr Tana (late 2001) began speaking with Mr Proud about the possibility of installing the new plant and equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">I find that Mr Tana had a very positive view of the market at this time based on the success of his company's export sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">However, the market changed in 2003, after the new line had been installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">223 The impacts of competition from Chinese carrots with the appreciating Australian dollar continued well past mid-2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">But by August 2003, Mr Tana recognised that the carrot market was '... going through a very tough period ... with China carrots flooding into all Asia ports'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">The change in the market was also reflected in Mr Tana's fax to Mr Proud of 14 September 2003 when he said:
 
 'When we contracted to buy your machinery, carrot prices were $16-18 [per carton] ...They are now $13-15 ...' 
 

 
224 In mid-November 2003, Mr Tana launched a new brand name 'Jack Rabbit', for carrots he intended to grow at the Lancelin farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">Mr Tana, said in a newspaper interview at that time, that he planned to have an additional packing operation at Lancelin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">225 On 18 December 2003, Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud asserting that North East Equity had missed the opportunity to maximise the volume of carrots from August to November '... due to the continual problems experience[d] with the line and other factors'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">226 The claim that the new line affected the volume of carrots was simply false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">Mr Tana did not reduce his plantings or the amount he always intended would be delivered to the Wattleup plant for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">The only impacts on production at the farm and output at the plant were caused by the difficulties experienced at the farms and the changes in the market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">Mr Tana sought to make Proud Machinery, Mr Proud and the new line his scapegoats for the commercial difficulties he was experiencing in his business from factors for which they had no responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">I accept that there were several sources of justified irritations and some shortcomings in the way the new line operated and that some of Mr Tana's sense of grievance was fairly directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">But the problems with North East Equity's farms and export markets meant that its investment in the new plant was not the commercial success that Mr Tana had wanted; not because of any substantive deficiency in the performance new line, but because the market price had come down, competition had increased and the quality and volume of farm production of its carrots had deteriorated very significantly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">227 Mr Langridge was the expert forensic accountant engaged by North East Equity to quantify its claim for economic loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">Both Mr Langridge and Peter Holmes, Proud Machinery's and Mr Proud's expert forensic accountant, in a joint report noted that Mr Langridge had constructed a model to forecast economic loss claimed by North East Equity which had the following fundamental assumptions affecting sales revenue:
 
&#8226; there was sufficient availability of carrots to be processed by the new line;
 
&#8226; all of the carrots claimed in the model were able to be processed and packed could have been sold both into the local and export markets;
 
&#8226; the additional carrot volumes and grades of carrots that could otherwise have been sold into those markets would be sold in proportion to the actual volume sold in each market and in the same product mix;
 
&#8226; that the market prices adopted in the model could have equally been achieved for those volumes and that there was no impact from competitors reacting to the supply of the additional volumes now assumed;
 
&#8226; the monthly sales volumes incorporated seasonal variations and an assumed reject rate of 10%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">228 The experts agreed that they offered no opinion about the reasonableness of those assumptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">First, the quality and quantity of the carrots produced in 2003-2005 were severely affected by the matters which I have discussed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">There were up to 70% Class 2 carrots produced because of the production difficulties of the Guilderton farm leading to its ultimate closure in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">The blight affected the produce from the Lancelin farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">There was no evidence to support Mr Tana's assertions that the farms could or would have produced more carrots and that some unspecific sales opportunities were lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">I do not accept those assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">Secondly, it is immediately apparent that the assumed reject rate of 10% was quite different from the known facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">Given the falsification of the assumptions, there is no basis upon which the model constructed by Mr Langridge can be of assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">That is not a reflection on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">The assumptions that he was asked to make had no semblance to the reality of North East Equity's actual position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">As North East Equity's final written submissions recognised the first, second and fourth of those assumptions were supported only by Mr Tana's assertions, as was much of the third.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">229 And, the competition from Chinese carrots had caused what Mr Tana had said in April 2005 was 'a major, major correction' in the Australian carrot growing industry (T 86).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">This correction was reflected in the substantial decline in North East Equity's sales revenues and net profit between 2002-2003 and 2005-2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">230 North East Equity claimed about $4.85 million damages as its economic loss during the period from 1 May 2003 to 7 July 2005 based on the above assumptions which it gave to Mr Langridge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">I am not satisfied that there was a sufficient basis to render the above assumptions given to Mr Langridge reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">Indeed, in my opinion, on the evidence, they were without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">231 I have accepted that, in some respects, the new line fell short of its warranted or represented performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">For the reasons I give below in assessing damages, these matters were not substantial or of a kind which had any substantive adverse impact on the actual operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">But I do not accept that these matters caused any economic loss to North East Equity or the loss of any chance to earn more profit than it in fact did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">232 I am not satisfied that North East Equity lost any sales at all or any market opportunity to sell any more carrots than it actually produced and sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">Nor am I satisfied that North East Equity was financially worse off because of any deficiency in the operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">THE PROBLEMS CONTINUE 
 
233 Over the course of the weeks and months after its installation, Mr Webster prepared a number of lists of problems which were being experienced in the operation and commissioning of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">He sent these lists to Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">Mr Tana also made numerous oral and written complaints to Proud Machinery and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">Many of the problems were teething problems which were addressed promptly and resolved, however a number of the problems were of a more fundamental nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">234 By 18 March 2003 Mr Tana was expressing considerable concern to Mr Proud that a number of 'disasters' existed with the operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">Mr Proud was also upset, at that stage, about the way the line was operating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">He arranged for Mr Gillenkirch to fly urgently from Canada via Germany to Perth to arrive on 21 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">Mr Proud also sought assistance from Bruynooghe in relocating the touch screen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">He said that he was working towards resolving the then difficulties in his letter of the same date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">235 There were problems with the equipment as supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">Thus in his letter to Bruynooghe of 18 March 2003, Mr Proud stated that he was '... personally totally disappointed and frustrated with the amount of problems and rework that we have been left to deal with on our own'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">In a postscript to that letter he said:
 
 'Installing the Length Grader for the smalls on the feed from the large carrots was the final insult to the client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">' 
 

Bruynooghe had installed the length graders so that carrots with large girths, after being graded on the width grader, were deposited on a length grader intended to segregate the smaller sized carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">236 I am satisfied that the new line was not fully operational within 10 business days of 7 March 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">Thus, North East Equity was entitled to retain the $50,000 maximum sum of liquidated damages provided in the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">237 By 28 March 2003 Mr Webster wrote to Mr Proud saying that, due to the continuing problems that were being experienced, North East Equity had decided that:
 
 'We will provide a person or persons for training and information dedicated to being the controller.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">This person is in the "driving seat" and will be the only person to make any changes to the buffer tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">' 
 

This appears to have been an acceptance that, despite whatever training Ms Mirosevich had received in Belgium and at Wattleup, neither she nor Mr Webster was acting as the 'controller' in deciding how to operate the overall machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">In my view, this was a fundamental problem in North East Equity's organisation and contributed significantly to the difficulties that were experienced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">MR WEBSTER'S 20 AUGUST 2003 MEMORANDUM TO MR TANA 
 
238 On 20 August 2003 Mr Webster wrote a memorandum responding to a request by Mr Tana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">He reported on the major issues North East Equity then had with Proud Machinery, and considered the position, particularly if it ceased to do business with Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">One issue was the relocation of the touch screen from the office to the position above the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">Mr Webster also noted that, while mechanical damage to the carrots had been '... significantly reduced, the farms are still a problem'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">That referred to damage occurring to carrots during the harvesting and delivery process and resulting in considerable quantities of already damaged carrots being fed into the line for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">Mr Webster described the management problems that were affecting the efficient operation of the plant as follows:
 
 
 '7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">The other major issue is of course whether we can maintain a consistent packout tonnage over the 8-hour period; (problems are below) that affect it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">
 
 
 
 
 
 a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">Quality of carrot 
 
 b.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">Consistent feed from tanks i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">an efficient operator driving the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">
 
 c. Stoppages on line, no accumulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">
 
 d. Better management of lines, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">too many changeovers of variety cartons --- too much time lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">(Never retrieve lost time) 
 e. Why do we never use No: 4 machine?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">Seems ludicrous that we run 5 &amp; 6, 7 &amp; 8 flat out, No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">4 sitting there doing nothing, that's around 20 Tonnes over 8 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">I think its [sic] to reduce labour costs, someone must have done the calculation!</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">' (emphasis in original) 
 
 
 
 

239 Mr Tana accepted in his evidence that those matters were concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">The first problem was the significant change in quality of the carrots delivered to Wattleup for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">This referred to problems then being experienced with the farms supplying the plant, particularly Guilderton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">As I have found, about 70% of carrots supplied at this time were Class 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">In addition, Mr Webster identified the problems with North East Equity's management of the new line as his second, third and fourth concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">In cross-examination, Mr Tana was unable to answer Mr Webster's question about why machine No 4 was not used, other than by asserting that it was used, and he was unable to specify how or when it was used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">I accept the accuracy of Mr Webster's contemporaneous observations including his observation that one of the Newtec/Gillenkirch packing stations (machine No 4) was rarely used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">240 The ability for the plant to process carrots into differently graded sizes at an even rate of output depended upon there being some consistency in the size of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">If eight different streams would be graded at 17.55 tonnes per hour on average between the eight streams, it would be necessary to have an input of about two tonnes of each of the eight grades of carrots, after allowing for rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">The evidence, however, established that there were certain predominant sizes of carrots, mainly medium and small/medium ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1266">MR TANA'S LETTER OF 12 SEPTEMBER 2003 TO MR PROUD 
 
241 On 12 September 2003 Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud discussing a number of deficiencies that he claimed were apparent in the operation of the new plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1267">The letter is notable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1268">First, Mr Tana made no complaint about the split shift operation commencing at 6.00am which he described in this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1269">I infer that this was because it was always his understanding that the new line, which he and Mr Proud discussed in 2002, would operate with a split shift, as Mr Webster's memorandum of 1 August 2002 had indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1270">Secondly, the letter described the length sizers (which were in use) as being:
 
 '... moderately capable and like all other pieces of machinery have their capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1271">When put under pressure (approx 6-8 tonne) they do not size well at all due to several reasons: 
 
 a) Piggy backing; 
 b) Carrots pushing each other; 
 c) Carrots crossways.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1272">
 
 ... [W]hen we process 18-20 tonne per hour and say 30-50% are medium there is no way this unit can do even an adequate job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1273">' 
 

242 Thirdly, Mr Tana noted his assumption that, at the initial grading tables, near the wet hoppers, 8% of the carrots were removed as rejects, with a further 2% removed at the grading tables near the weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1274">In addition, he said another 15% of the carrots removed at the latter grading tables were Class 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1275">In the 12 September letter Mr Tana asserted that he had assumed '... a 10% reject rate which for us is normal (sometimes it does go as high as 25% but [this is] abnormal)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1276">243 Fourthly, Mr Tana identified the six sizes which were being packed as prepack short, small, small/medium, medium, large short and large.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1277">He wrote:
 
 'Let us assume a carrot size split as follows: 
 
 Reject 8% (first take 8%, second take 2%) [sic]
 Prepack 5% 
 Small 10% 
 Small/medium 15% 
 Medium 40% 
 Large short 11% 
 Large 11% 
 100% 
 
 Now based on the above percentages please tell me how we are to operate given that carrots need to stay in the tank 10 minutes plus before we can use them as they are entering the tanks at between 17deg.-30deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1278">' 
 

244 In cross-examination, Mr Tana gave another measurement of the quantity of rejects in the operation of plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1279">He sought to rely on a distinction between 'rejects' and 'waste', saying that 'rejects' were 'not waste in total'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1280">However, he also acknowledged that 'rejects is a combination of waste and rejects'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1281">In the discussions Mr Tana had with Mr Proud, and as used generally in the evidence, I am satisfied that the expression 'rejects' included waste.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1282">This is because neither rejected carrots nor unusable waste were intended to be packed at the end of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1283">North East Equity did have other uses for some of the rejected material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1284">But what happened to it after it had been removed from the line was of no concern in the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1285">245 Mr Tana acknowledged that North East Equity kept no record of the weight of rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1286">In evidence in chief he claimed that the specification of 18% rejects for the performance of the new line was to be measured only in respect of the carrots that had passed through the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1287">This would have meant that the commencing tonnage for measuring the ultimate pack out rate consisted of carrots that had already been culled at the initial grading table.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1288">246 However, despite all his asserted dissatisfaction with the performance of the new line, Mr Tana had never caused any measurement to be taken of the amount or weight of carrots which entered the brush washers (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1289">after the chilling of rejects and waste at the initial grading tables).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1290">That is, he had never obtained a measurement of the initial tonnage in order to make good his claim that the new line was deficient in meeting the specified 18.75 or 17.55 tonnes per hour final pack out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1291">Mr Tana justified this omission in the following evidence:
 
 'There was no need to do it because when we talk about rejects we're only talking about rejects from the point at which they're tipped into the wet hopper until they're packed out?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1292">--- In the context of the line, yes, sir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1293">
 
 So there's no distinction for that purpose between what happens at the first grading table and what happens at the second grading tables?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1294">--- There is a distinction sir, but no numerical distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1295">
 
 There's no numerical distinction because what you've said yesterday is to your construction as to how to measure 18 per cent rejects, was simply creative thinking on your part?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1296">--- Not at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1297">
 
 If it had been important you would have carried out some sort of measure, wouldn't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1298">--- We do on a daily basis by knowing how many bins come through, thereabouts, and it was always two to one: two before the line and one approximately during the line .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">
 
 Where are these measures?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">--- They're not formal documents as I said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">
 
 You didn't measure, you told us that, you didn't measure at any stage?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1302">--- I recall - I do recall Mira on certain days taking that measurement upon my request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">Whether they're recorded or not she would tell me at the end of the day so many came here, so many came there and on average it always averaged between two to one if not three to one .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">' (emphasis added)
 

247 An average of two to one is, of course, different from three to one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">Moreover, the measure of 8% and 2% rejects, referred to in Mr Tana' s 12 September letter is four to one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">I have no confidence in Mr Tana's evidence as to the general performance of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">I am satisfied that Mr Tana was conscious of a significant deterioration in the quality of the produce delivered for processing to the Wattleup plant from early 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">This was because of the production difficulties which led him to decide to close the Guilderton farm in June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">As a result, significantly more rejects, waste and Class 2 carrots were delivered and had to be removed or processed after the new line was installed than before.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">I am satisfied that from about March 2003 and thereafter the quality of carrots grown had substantively deteriorated and that substantially more than 18% rejects were included in the carrots delivered from the farm for processing at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1311">248 Indeed, Mr Harris, North East Equity's expert, assessed the line, between August and October 2005, after the Guilderton farm had closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">He had been asked to assume that the final grading tables had to be capable of removing 18% rejects and 20% Class 2 carrots: i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1313">38% of all carrots processed through the line up to that point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1314">That assumption did not reflect any pleaded contractual term or representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1315">However, if 18% rejects were presented at the last grading tables, then applying one of Mr Tana's varying ratios would suggest that 2, 3 or 4 times that quantity of rejects had been removed at the grading tables prior to the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1316">The differences in these measures are significant as the table below shows: 
 (Figures are in tonnes) Ratio 2:1 Ratio 3:1 Ratio 4:1 (a) Carrots delivered ((d) + (e)) 198 224 250 (b) Carrots removed at initial grading tables 52 78 104 (c) Carrots removed at grading tables immediately before weighing and packing machines 26 26 26 (d) Total carrots removed 78 104 130 (e) Assumed net pack out 120 120 120 (f) Carrots removed as percentage of carrots delivered 39% 46% 52% 

 
249 Assuming, for example, a final pack out of 120 tonnes in a day, then, using Mr Tana's starting point, that amount would comprise 82% of the carrots which had emerged from the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1317">Thus, about 146 tonnes had emerged from the brush washers, of which approximately 26 tonnes (18% of 146) were classified as rejects at the final grading tables (assuming little or no waste had been segregated by the diameter or length graders).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1318">There was no evidence about how much waste was removed by these machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1319">250 As the above table demonstrates, if one of Mr Tana's ratios were correct, then 52 or 78 or 104 tonnes must have been removed as rejects at the initial grading tables prior to the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1320">Even if the ratio of rejects were two to one, then 78 tonnes (the final 26 tonnes and an initial cull of 52 tonnes) or 39% out of 198 tonnes delivered were rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1321">If it were four to one, 52% of the total carrots delivered were rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">(If three to one, the total proportion rejected would be 46% or 104 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">) And the task of removing so many rejects at the initial grading tables would involve substantial work and time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">That is, there would have been more people working for a longer period at the initial grading tables which would have increased both labour costs and the time of the shifts, regardless of how efficiently the new plant operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">That would have negated one of Mr Tana's principal reasons for the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">These considerations reinforce my findings that, first, the efficient economic operation of the new line was substantially affected by the substantive deterioration in quality of carrots delivered from the farms from about March 2003 and, secondly, the specification of 18% rejects was in respect of the whole line (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">including the initial grading tables).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">251 In making the second finding, I have not overlooked Mr Proud's evidence, which North East Equity relied on as supporting its case, in relation to the starting point for measuring the 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">In his written evidence, Mr Proud referred on three separate occasions to the agreed initial tonnage (182 tonnes per 8 hour working shift or 22.75 tonnes per operating hour) being fed into the new line commencing after the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1330">In cross-examination Mr Proud said that this was wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1331">I do not consider that Mr Proud was always reliable in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1332">On this point, the contemporaneous documents are a surer guide to what the parties agreed and discussed than their recollections four or five years later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1333">Those recollections have been coloured by the subsequent history of the dispute and the desires of both witnesses to justify in their own minds, what they thought they had done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1334">Their evidence was prone to being assertive and unreliable: see too Watson 49 NSWLR at 318-319.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1335">252 While North East Equity was entitled to rely on these statements by Mr Proud as admissions against interest, I do not consider them to be reliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1336">They made no commercial sense, since neither party measured the weight at that point, or had any objective means of calculating this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1337">The new equipment had to work with what was to be retained, including the initial part of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1338">A mix of production targets was discussed in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1339">The key inputs were the initial quantity of carrots delivered and the pack out tonnage per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1340">As I have found above, it made no sense for the parties to measure or consider the production of the new equipment in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1341">Ultimately, in 2002 Mr Tana agreed with Mr Proud that Proud Machinery would provide new equipment to be combined with some old for the plant, working as a whole, which could pack out 18.75 tonnes per operating hour (or 17.55 tonnes without the handline) with a maximum of 18% total rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1342">The new equipment, obviously, had to have the capacity to operate in a way which enabled the final pack out rate to be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1343">But, as Mr Webster' s 1 August 2002 memorandum showed, the overall capacity of the line, consisting of both the old and new equipment, was what mattered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">The new equipment could not process more than the amount of carrots fed into it from the old system's brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">I do not accept Mr Proud's written evidence on the starting point for measuring the 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">253 In any event, I must approach the identification of the terms and the construction of the agreement objectively, rather than from the subjective points of view of the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">For the reasons I have given, I am satisfied --- based on the mutually known facts, the evidence of discussions and contemporaneous written material --- that the parties agreed that the 18% rejects related to the processing operation as a whole, commencing from the point where the carrots were tipped into the wet hoppers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">And, given the nature of the negotiations and the parties here, it is appropriate to assess whether any representation complained of was made by Proud Machinery or Mr Proud on the same basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">254 North East Equity specified that the system be able to grade the carrots into eight different sizes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">But North East Equity never informed Proud that any particular quantity or quality of each size of carrot was to be processed through the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">It would have been obvious to Mr Tana that significant variations in the quantity and quality of differently sized carrots would impact the production capacity and efficiency of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">There were five packing machines, but only three sizes could be packed simultaneously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">This was because North East Equity had specified that there be only three conveyors from the chilling tanks to deliver carrots to three grading tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">Two of those tables served two weighing and packing machines each and one table served only one set of weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">The prepack line would allow a further size to be packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">255 I am satisfied from Mr Tana's handwritten facsimile of 14 September 2003 that he and Mr Proud discussed the 12 September letter the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">Mr Proud made many handwritten annotations on his copy of the 12 September letter which I infer he used as his basis of discussion with Mr Tana.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">For example, Mr Proud noted his response to a complaint Mr Tana had made about a build up of mounds of carrots where they were dropped into the chilling tanks by the conveyor from the length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">Mr Tana had asserted that if more than five or six tonnes were in a tank, the carrots could not be moved by water pressure from their entry point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">He complained that this led to carrots spilling into adjoining tanks which could undo the earlier grading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">Mr Proud wrote a note that the tanks could be completely filled and the operator had to adjust the timer on the air pumps to spread the carrots evenly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">Mr Gillenkirch's evidence confirmed that this was how the system should have been operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">256 Mr Tana's comments about the tanks revealed that his staff were not monitoring any build up of carrots in the chilling tanks, nor were they adjusting settings or the operation of the equipment as and when needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">That is, as I find, North East Equity was not operating the equipment properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">THE TEST IN MID-NOVEMBER 2003 
 
257 On 4 November 2003, Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud, Mr Gillenkirch and Mr North as well as to Bruynooghe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">He proposed that they meet on 17 November 2003 commencing at 6.00am at Mandogolup (Wattleup) where they would inspect the operation of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">Mr Tana provided an agenda in the letter for three subsequent meetings that day at North East Equity's offices at Balcatta starting at 10.00am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">The Balcatta offices were north of Perth, quite some distance from the Wattleup plant which was to the south of Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">The first meeting proposed would be between Mr Tana and Mr Proud alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">At the second, Mr Tana proposed that they would be joined by Ms Mirosevich and Mr Webster, and at the third, the Bruynooghe representative and Messrs Gillenkirch and North would also be present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">This suggestion followed many months of complaints by North East Equity and Mr Tana to, principally, Proud Machinery and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">258 Ultimately, Mr Vermeulen came from Belgium to represent Bruynooghe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">The evidence is unclear as to whether the test of the plant and the meetings took place on 17 or 18 November 2003, although both parties agreed that by 18 November at the latest, a test and a meeting had occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">Mr Tana created handwritten notes dated 18 November 2003 recording the results of a meeting with himself, Mr Proud, Mr Gillenkirch, Mr Webster, Ms Mirosevich, Mr Vermeulen, Mr North and Mr Hunter (of Proud Machinery).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">These were the only contemporaneous record of that meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">I am a satisfied that a meeting took place with those persons on 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">I find that meetings and a test took place over the two days, 17 and 18 November, with the final discussion occurring as recorded in Mr Tana's notes on 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">
 
 21.1 Production on 17 and 18 November 2003 
 

259 Mr Proud's schedule summarised North East Equity's records of the number of bins tipped, the weight of total carrots packed out, their temperatures at the final grading tables, and operational problems for each day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">Other than the issue of the assumed initial weight of 450 kg per bin and the associated calculations, there was no dispute as to the accuracy of the information in Mr Proud's schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">260 On 17 November 2003 North East Equity's records showed that 453 bins were tipped into the wet hoppers at the commencement of the line, resulting in approximately 131 tonnes of packed cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">That meant that 183.5 tonnes (at 405 kg per bin, as I have found) were tipped into the wet hoppers resulting in 52.5 tonnes or 29% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">Mr Proud's schedule recorded that there were problems with a motor relay which tripped out nine times for one of the dual weighing packing machine stations, a robot was unable to cope with the weight of cartons, a flume was blocked with carrots, resulting in10 minutes stoppage time, the carton sizes had to be changed because the robot was unable to stack all the different cartons, and one of the gates for delivering carrots lost a nut clamp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">261 The same records showed (assuming 405 kg per bin) that on 18 November, 386 bins (or 156.33 tonnes) were tipped into the wet hoppers, resulting in a total production pack out of 132 tonnes with 24.33 tonnes, or 15.6% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">Mr Proud's schedule also recorded that a brush washer broke down around 3.15pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">It noted that the motor relay, this time, tripped out five times, a water spray pipe on an output belt was splashing water, the flumes blocked with a 20 minute stoppage of the line, and fresh carrots were processed after lunch but were too hot to pack because the temperature of the water in the chilling tanks was too high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">Production had to be stopped for 35 minutes because the carrot temperature varied from 6-12deg..
 
262 The schedule showed the temperatures of the carrots which Mr Correia had measured at the packing stations for these two days as follows:
 

 Date Time Exit temp 
 Large Exit temp 
 Medium Exit temp 
 S[mall]/M[edium] Monday 17 November 2003 am N/A 2deg.-5deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">4deg.-7deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">12.00 [noon] 3deg.-4deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">3deg.-6deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">4deg.-6deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">Tuesday 18 November 2003 am - 3deg.-4deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">3deg.-4deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">12.00 [noon] 6deg.-12deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">6deg.-10deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">5deg.-8deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">pm 5deg.-6deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">5deg.-7deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">4deg.-6deg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">263 On the day of the test, each of the suppliers (Messrs Gillenkirch, Vermeulen and North) had adjusted their machinery to the settings which they regarded as appropriate to test the capacity and functioning of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">However, by this time, North East Equity had modified the operation of the length graders so that they no longer did any grading and they simply conveyed carrots to the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">Thus, only five different grades of girth were processed in the test and there capable of being was no separate automatic grading for length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">264 Mr Tana made some handwritten notes of processing which commenced with 453 bins being tipped into the brush washers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">This figure accords with the records for 17 November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">Both Mr Tana and Mr Proud recalled that, on the day of the test, production stopped early.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">In his witness statement, Mr Proud asserted that the meetings took place on 17 November and a productivity test of the line took place the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">He confirmed this in his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">265 It is difficult to determine from any contemporaneous record whether the test occurred on 17 or 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">It would have taken some time for those attending the meeting to make their way to Balcatta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">Both Mr Tana and Mr Proud agreed that that production finished earlier than usual on the day of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">Significantly less bins were processed on 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">No witness said that any stoppage had occurred on the day of the test due to carrot temperatures being too high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">And, Mr Tana's contemporaneous notes do not suggest that this was an issue in the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">It would have been an obvious and immediate source of discussion (and vociferous complaint by Mr Tana) if production had stopped while the test was proceeding, particularly if the chilling system were not functioning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">Indeed, Mr North said that he did not recall a lot of discussion about the chilling tanks at the time of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">And, on 19 November he sent a fax to Mr Tana noting that he had changed the computer program to control the times when the refrigeration plant automatically began and ceased operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">Mr North indicated that this might alter the cost of power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">266 And, although the ultimate packed production was similar on both days, the quantity of rejects was substantially greater on 17 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">In addition, during the hearing, both parties focused their examination of the evidence principally upon 18 November as being the day of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">The contemporaneous records show that, on each day, the sizing crew stopped work at 5.10pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">That may be because they were employed and thus paid up to that time, even though the work had ceased earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">267 Mr Gillenkirch said that the test was on 18 November and stopped after about 6 hours because there were no more carrots from the farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">He said a meeting took place in Mr Tana's office after the test on 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">I accept Mr Gillenkirch's evidence generally, although for reasons I explain below, I am not sure that he is correct about the day of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">He was an impressive witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">Mr North also said that the meeting occurred on the same day as the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">268 Mr Tana said that on the test day only a composite of Class 1 and 2 carrots was graded and packed, rather than the two classes being packed separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">He asserted that this 'composite' was 'Class 1 on paper'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">He claimed that North East Equity was selling, as Class 1, a composite grade of carrots that included Class 2 carrots and gave evidence that '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">I suppose we could fudge a little bit in marketing'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">I understood him to suggest by that answer that he was prepared to deceive his customers as to the quality of carrot which he was selling to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">Mr Proud also said that a composite class went through that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">The table below summarises the packing records for 18 November 2003:
 

 Packing records for 18 November 2003 Cartons Tonnes % of final pack out Class 1 (10 kg cartons) 1573 15.73 11.9% Class 1 (20 kg cartons) 4281 85.62 64.9% Class 2 (20 kg cartons) 1028 20.56 15.6% Prepack - 9.958 7.6% Total pack out 
 131.868 100% 

 
269 Those packing records showed that, of the 132 tonnes packed, most of the carrots were recorded as being packed as Class 1, of which about 15.7 tonnes were packed into 10 kg cartons, with the balance packed into 20 kg cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">About 20.6 tonnes of Class 2 carrots were packed in 20 kg cartons (15.6% of the final pack out of the five weighing and packing machines).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">In addition, about 10 tonnes were packed in the prepack line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">Those records made a clear distinction between Class 1 and Class 2 carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">Earlier in his evidence Mr Tana had acknowledged that those records actually identified several brands as Class 2 and others as Class 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">Mr Tana's preparedness to 'fudge' did not reflect favourably on his integrity or reliability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">I find that any difficulties in quality were not due to deficiencies with the new plant and equipment, but rather, were caused by Mr Tana's farms, for example, the high level of rejects on 17 November showed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">270 As I have found, the production difficulties that North East Equity was experiencing in 2003 resulted in a significant deterioration in the quality of the carrots delivered for processing at Wattleup.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">When Mr Tana and Mr Proud referred to the 'composite' class on the test day, I find they were referring to the very substantial proportion of carrots --- in the order of about 70% of the total carrots delivered (as I have found) --- presented at the final grading tables which were actually Class 2 standard, but were processed as if they were Class 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">And, Mr Tana said that November was a peak period for North East Equity to process packed carrots, so it is safe to infer that the quantity delivered for processing on 17 and 18 November was planned four to six months beforehand to meet peak demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">271 Mr Gillenkirch said that he observed that both Class 1 and Class 2 carrots were run through the production lines and Class 2 carrots were graded out at the grading tables near the packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">Mr Gillenkirch was principally concerned, at the time, to observe how his equipment performed, rather than to assess precisely the quality of the produce as graded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">No doubt, as part of Mr Tana's 'fudge', the better-looking Class 2 carrots were packed into the Class 1 cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">But, I consider Mr Gillenkirch to be most likely to be reliable about how his own equipment was operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">I accept his evidence, and I prefer it to Mr Tana's and Mr Proud's evidence, to the extent they may differ as to the classes of carrots packed on the day of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">272 The three experts agreed that the Gillenkirch carton fillers could pack between 240 and 300 kg cartons of 20 kg each per hour (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">between 4.8 and 6 tonnes per hour) and between 280 and 340 kg cartons of 10 kg each per hour (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">between 2.8 and 3.4 tonnes per hour).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">A B C D E F No of machines 

 Type of carton packed 
 Minimum hourly capacity per machine Minimum tonnage packed per hour (A x C) Recorded packed out tonnage (18/11/03) Maximum time to meet recorded pack out (E / D) 
 4 20 kg cartons 4.8 tonnes 19.2 106.18 5.53 hours
(5 hours, 32 mins) 1 10 kg cartons 2.8 tonnes 2.8 15.73 5.61 hours
(5 hours, 37 mins) 

 
273 As set out in the table above, assuming that the lower rates of each of those figures were packed on the day, if four of the packing machines packed the 20 kg cartons continuously, they would have processed about 19.2 tonnes per hour and would have completed the whole packing of the 106 tonnes in about 51/2 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">Likewise if one packing machine were packing the 10 kg cartons it also would have taken about 51/2 hours to pack the 15.7 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">274 Mr Tana accepted that the test showed that the capacity of the Newtec/Gillenkirch packing machines was satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">But in evidence he asserted that there was no grading apart from removing objects and that all carrots were pre-chilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">That was not correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">At least 236 of the 386 bins processed on 18 November had been left outside the cool rooms or had been processed fresh on delivery from the farms, according to Mr Correia's contemporaneous notes i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">over 60% of the carrots processed on 18 November were processed at ambient temperature, and had not been pre-chilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">There is little evidence as to the pre-chilling, if any, on 17 November, and I infer that a similar amount of farm fresh carrots were processed then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">275 I am satisfied that Mr Tana's acceptance that the Gillenkirch machines performed to their capacity demonstrated that they packed at least at the rates identified by the experts and thus, the time for the packing operation would have been no more than about 51/2 to 6 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">That of course, leaves out of account the time required to process the carrots up to the time of packing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">If the packing operation commenced at about 9.00am, it would have been completed around 3.00pm and have left time for the meetings to occur later on 17 or 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">I am satisfied that all the carrots available for processing on the day of the test were processed and packed by about 3.00pm that day, even though the crew may have been paid for a full shift (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">to stay until 5.10pm) to clean up or perform other duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">However, I have some doubt that the test occurred on 18 November, or if it did, that the meeting occurred after the end of the day's production if the contemporaneous records of problems with the chilling tank temperatures were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">276 A production stoppage for 35 minutes because the carrots emerging from the chilling tanks were too hot would have been a very significant issue in the meeting, considering North East Equity's complaint that the new line did not work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">Instead, the meeting proceeded without any suggestion that a significant incident had occurred while they were all there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">It is likely that those attending the meeting left on 18 November before this incident occurred, and, they had seen the whole of the previous day's production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">Moreover, it is likely that the temperature problem was caused by an operator error or some other obvious (to those present) cause which was not inherent in the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">While I accept that the meeting which Mr Tana noted occurred on 18 November, I am uncertain whether the test occurred on the previous day, or on the same day, but those attending left for Balcatta before the stoppage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">In the end, it is not necessary to make a finding choosing between 17 and 18 November as the day of the test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">This is because, on whichever day it was, the test had proceeded without any significant problem concerning the chilling of the carrots up to when the attendees left for Balcatta.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">277 During the course of each day (17 and 18 November), the plant had packed a total of just more than 130 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">On 18 November about 10 tonnes had been packed by the prepack line and the rest by the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">The reason that less than 140 tonnes (or 17.55 tonnes in an 8 hour shift) were processed was that some time after 1.00pm there were no more carrots available to feed into the wet hopper at the commencement of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">278 One consequence of the test was that whatever weight the attendees believed the bins contained, it was clear to everyone present that the line could process, at least 17.55 tonnes per hour at final pack out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">The packing operation, using the split shift had taken less than six hours to pack out about 130 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">And, on 18 November with 405 kg in the bins, then there were about 15.6% rejects in total.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">279 Mr Tana recorded in his handwritten notes of the meeting of 18 November 2003 that it was agreed that the final 'grading stations need [an] output of net 3 ton[nes per] hour allowing for up to 30% [Class] 2 &amp; rejects'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">In other words, first, Class 1 carrots were being graded separately from Class 2 and, secondly, if 18% rejects were to be removed at this point then only 12% Class 2 carrots could be graded there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">The Class 2 carrots were commercially more valuable than rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">It would have been more important to allow for these to be graded than rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">The note reinforces the implausibility that all the 18% rejects were ever contemplated to come out at the final grading tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">And at a rate of three tonnes net per hour, the five weighing and packing machines would process 15 tonnes of Class 1 per hour and in addition Class 2 and rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">Similarly on 8 May 2004 Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud referring to 'a choking point' at the final grading tables saying:
 
 '... even if the carrots are good quality and can be chilled there will still be a requirement to extract approximately 5% of waste and 15-20% of class 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">' (emphasis added)
 

280 Mr Tana was then aware that the carrots were not of good quality and that this caused the line to be used with produce quite different from that originally intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">Yet Mr Tana asserted that the purpose of the November 2003 test was to assess the box packing section of the line and that all other parts of the line were compromised to ensure that the maximum amount of carrots were fed to the box packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">I reject this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">If that were the case, there would have been no need for Mr Vermeulen, as a representative of Bruynooghe, or for Mr North to have been present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">They could not have contributed to the simple question of whether the Newtec and Gillenkirch machines were capable of processing 17.55 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">Moreover, that assertion was inconsistent with Mr Tana's conduct immediately after the test during the meeting between him and Messrs Proud, Gillenkirch, Webster, Vermeulen, North and Hunter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">281 The test was performed to ascertain whether the new line, as a whole, would perform in accordance with the contractual specifications, and had the capacity to process 17.55 tonnes per hour at final pack out (being the reduced output after the removal of the handline).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">282 By November 2003 both Mr Tana and Mr Proud had had their fill of one another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">There had been constant negotiations, complaints and attendances at the Wattleup plant over the proceeding months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">I find that the purpose of the test on 17 or 18 November 2003 was to assess the overall operation of the plant to see whether, in substance, it met the contractual or represented requirements, after making allowances for the fact that the length graders were no longer being operated, and the number of classes graded thus had reduced from eight to five.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">
 
 21.2 The meeting on 17 or 18 November 2003 
 

283 After the test, a meeting was held on 18 November at North East Equity's offices at Balcatta, away from the site of the plant itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">Mr Tana confirmed to Mr Proud that he was satisfied with the day's production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">Mr Tana said that if four problems were fixed then he would accept the installation of the new plant and would pay Proud Machinery the $50,000 that had been withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">The four problems were the flume elevators, the operation of the interlock conveyor belts, the overloading of elevators leading to the packing stations, the provision of Gillenkirch manuals and Bruynooghe software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">Although he used the word 'software' in his evidence I am satisfied that his contemporaneous handwritten note accurately recorded that Bruynooghe was to provide a CD-rom of the programs for the systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">Mr Tana's difficulty with computers led him to be confused in describing what this issue was, although later by early March 2004, he wanted to have the ability to change the software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">I accept Mr Proud's evidence that he did not agree to provide software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">284 Mr Tana's handwritten notes recorded a number of other matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">At the meeting he required that the problems with the flume elevators be addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">The two flumes were supplied with water by a tank with submersible pumps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">The flumes were located after the wet hopper and initial grading tables and fed the width or girth graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">Sometime after the new line had been installed, North East Equity had caused chilled water to be fed into the flume pumps to commence the process of cooling the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">The water flowed down two moveable chutes containing the flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">The water washed over or rinsed the carrots as they moved up the flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">285 The flume elevators carried the carrots on metal cleats or shelves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">Initially, the cleats had sharp edges which chipped or damaged many carrots and quite a few fell off them onto the floor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">Mr Webster and others made some adjustments to the cleats which improved their efficiency and reduced the number of sharp edges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">286 Mr Proud said that the pumps for the flumes were blocking because loose weed and root hair got into them after carrots were transferred from the initial grading tables onto the flumes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">Mr Vermeulen said he would speak with Bruynooghe's Mr Parrein about the flumes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">Shortly afterwards, Bruynooghe recommended to Mr Proud that two new pumps should be used to replace the existing ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">Proud Machinery installed the new pumps and some filters but they proved insufficient and the problems persisted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">287 Mr Tana's second requirement was for the intralock conveyor belts to be fixed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1517">These linked the chilling tanks and the next grading stations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">Mr Proud agreed to arrange the installation of invertors on the intralocks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">The inverters controlled the speed of the conveyors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">Soon afterwards, that work was done and this problem was resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">I am satisfied that the new plant, as originally supplied, had been deficient until this rectification was undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">Thirdly, the motors in some of the elevators were overloading causing some elevators to trip out, and that problem needed to be rectified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">288 Fourthly, Mr Tana wanted operating manuals for the Gillenkirch equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">Mr Proud and Mr Gillenkirch arranged for that to occur and this problem was resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">Also, Mr Tana wanted Proud Machinery or Bruynooghe to provide North East Equity with a CD-rom with the program for the Bruynooghe equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">Proud Machinery caused a copy of the program for the Bruynooghe equipment to be provided to North East Equity although it did not provide the password needed to give access to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">In its letter of 16 May 2004 Proud Machinery asserted that it would provide the password when all claims and issues had been attended to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">That step did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">In my opinion the non-provision of that password was not a breach of any contract or representation made by Proud Machinery or Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">I am not satisfied that the failure to provide the password was a failure by Proud Machinery to adhere to a pleaded contractual term or representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1531">289 Mr Tana's notes of the meeting of 18 November also recorded that Mr Webster was to address the issues of communication between the grading operators and the overall control of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1532">Additionally, the notes recorded that Ms Mirosevich was to attend to improving management control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">North East Equity's personnel were also to institute a cleaning schedule for the various parts of the equipment that accumulated debris which might affect their efficient operation of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">290 Mr Gillenkirch gave unchallenged evidence, which I accept, that during the meeting of 18 November 2003 Mr Tana did a calculation of the costs savings North East Equity had made with the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">He said that his production costs had decreased from $1.20 per carton to between 86cents and 90cents per carton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">Obviously, savings of that magnitude were significant and beneficial for North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">I am satisfied that in this important meeting Mr Tana did not overstate the saving North East Equity had made in its production costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">291 In counsel's final address, North East Equity adopted the saving of 30cents per carton, at the bottom of Mr Tana's range, to argue a recalculation for its latest economic loss claim at $1.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1539">It submitted that the annual labour savings were $586,500 (using 1.955 million cartons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1540">If 86cents were the new cost per carton, the saving was $6,647,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1541">These figures demonstrate that the new line was far from being a financial or business catastrophe for North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1542">292 Mr North said that Mr Gillenkirch had said at the meeting held on 18 November 2003, or in a discussion with Mr North, Mr Proud and Mr Vermeulen immediately afterwards that he, Mr Gillenkirch, would not do any of the things which Mr Tana requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1543">Mr Gillenkirch denied having said that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1544">As Mr Gillenkirch said, his attitude was that if he agreed with someone to make something, he stood behind the promise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1545">He was not willing to risk his and his company's commercial representation by not following up promises made in business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1546">I accept Mr Gillenkirch's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1547">293 Mr Gillenkirch said that the problem with the flumes was that the pumps were blocking with leaves and debris from the brush washers and polishers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1548">He said that Bruynooghe was being asked by Mr Tana at the meeting to fix these blockages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1549">It may be that Mr North mistook something that Mr Vermeulen had said for something said by Mr Gillenkirch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1550">Bruynooghe did not agree to fix without payment any equipment that it had originally provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1551">Mr North was giving a recollection of a meeting or discussion over four years beforehand at which persons with different accents were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1552">He made no contemporaneous note and was not involved in the subject matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1553">I think it likely that he was confused as to who made the statement even though he was not cross-examined about this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1554">294 On 19 November 2003, Mr Tana wrote another letter of complaint to Mr Proud copying it to Mr Gillenkirch, Bruynooghe and Mr North.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1555">He stated that on the previous day they had had '... a productive day albeit expensive for me, given the concessions I made'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1556">He said that they identified two critical areas that had to be addressed quickly and others that needed to be addressed but were not as critical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1557">The critical areas were the Gillenkirch feed (namely the intralock and inverter problem) and the flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1558">He was complaining that a flume had blocked, causing carrots to spill onto the floor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1559">295 I find that at a meeting later on 18 November with only Mr Proud and Mr Gillenkirch, Mr Tana proposed that if the identified four items (namely problems with the flume elevators, the intralock converters, the motors tripping out and the provision of the Gillenkirch manuals and the Bruynooghe CD-rom) were rectified, he would accept the plant as then installed, and pay to Proud Machinery the $50,000 he had retained as liquidated damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1560">Mr Proud agreed to attend to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1561">In addition, Mr Tana agreed that he would pay Gillenkirch another &#8364;10,000 for two cross-belts to process the Class 2 carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1562">I find that Mr Tana was prepared to arrive at this agreement on 18 November because the four matters that he required to be rectified were the only substantive problems with the operation of the new line in accordance with what he believed Proud Machinery and Mr Proud had contracted (or promised or represented) would be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1563">While he considered that he had made some compromises, he did so, no doubt, based on his belief that the new line had given the Wattleup plant significant efficiencies and savings, including on labour costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1564">296 However, the flume elevators problem was not fixed and this agreement was not completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1565">No settlement of the dispute occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1566">
 
 21.3 The aftermath of the 17 or 18 November meeting 
 

297 I am satisfied that in the meetings on 18 November, after the test run occurred, Mr Tana and Mr Proud arrived at a conditional resolution of the matters which were unsatisfactory in the performance of the line, having regard to what the test run had showed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1567">298 Although no ultimate resolution of the difficulties occurred, I am satisfied that the substantive points regarded by Mr Tana as necessary to resolve North East Equity's complaints about the capacity and operation of the new line in November 2003, were in substance, the four set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1568">The problems with the intralock conveyors and elevators to the packing machines were addressed, and the manuals and software were supplied (absent the password).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1569">However, the flume elevators continued to be problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1570">299 Mr Proud accepted that the flumes had not operated satisfactorily since their installation, as he wrote to Mr Tana on 6 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1571">Mr Vermeulen had agreed to discuss what could be done with his head office in the 18 November meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1572">Their first proposed solution, the substitution of the pumps and new filters, did not work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1573">Subsequently, Mr Tana corresponded directly with Bruynooghe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1574">It ultimately designed a new elevator system which would cost &#8364;51,000 plus freight, to provide and Proud Machinery offered to install it at no cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1575">Mr Tana, understandably, was not prepared to pay that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1576">Bruynooghe were not prepared to supply the equipment without charge, and Mr Proud was not prepared to bear the cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1577">Thus, the flume elevators were not rectified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1578">300 But, in the end, the flumes did not operate satisfactorily particularly because the new pumps also kept blocking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1579">The original flumes were not reasonably fit to meet the standard of operation required of them by the contractual warranty and the representation of efficiency, which equipment of that kind ought to have had when installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1580">301 Matters dragged on but never resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1581">Later in 2 March 2004 Mr Tana wrote to Mr Proud following their discussion earlier that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1582">He said that North East Equity wanted to obtain the ability to alter Bruynooghe's software and Mr Tana claimed that this was part of the contract with Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1583">I have found that there was no such contractual term or representation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1584">Mr Tana also raised an issue concerning the refrigeration system in that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1585">He wrote:
 
 'The problem with the refrigeration was discussed with Gary North last week and whilst the corrective process is not a large expense it needs to be addressed as at present chilled coil water is mixing with overflow water from the carrot tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1586">This has the effect of mixing 1deg.C water with 7-10deg.C water giving a 4-5deg.C plus water temperature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1587">Until our issues are resolved we will not instruct Gary to make any changes as it would prejudice our position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1588">' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1589">

302 Mr Tana did not cause North East Equity to undertake any corrective process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1590">Importantly, there was no evidence that any issue about the operation of the chilling tanks, or their ability to ensure that carrots would be packed at 5deg.C or less, was raised at the time of the test or in the meeting of 18 November.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1591">And this matter was not referred to in Mr Tana's handwritten notes of the meeting even though Mr North was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1592">I am not satisfied that the refrigeration system did not operate in accordance with its contractual and represented capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1593">303 No complaint about the refrigeration was made or addressed during the test and meetings on 17 and 18 November 2003 when all the suppliers were present to ensure correction operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1594">As I have noted, while the contemporaneous records show that a refrigeration problem occurred on 18 November, causing processing to stop, this did not result in the meeting dealing with any issue arising from any stoppage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1595">I infer that this was because its cause was an operator-related, not inherent, problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1596">22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1597">THE EXPERT EVIDENCE ON THE OPERATION OF THE PLANT 
 
304 Messrs Harris, Gillenkirch and Manteca gave concurrent evidence together and produced two joint expert reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1598">These recorded the issues on which they agreed and disagreed in their individual reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1599">They identified three areas of disagreement among them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1600">First, what was meant by 'working day' and 'operating hour'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1601">Secondly, whether it was necessary that the temperature of every carrot had to be 5deg.C or less before it could be packed and whether the new line was reasonably fit for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1602">And thirdly, at what point were the 18% rejects to be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1603">305 Those matters can be resolved, in part, by construing the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1604">As is frequently, the principal area of disagreement among the experts arose because of differences in the assumptions that each of them had been asked to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1605">
 
 22.1 Defining 'working day', 'operating hour' and removal of 18% rejects 
 

306 I have found that, in consequence of the removal of the handline, the contract required the plant to process 17.55 tonnes per operating hour based and that this could be on a split shift system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1606">The '8 hour working day' measurement in Mr Proud's letter of 29 July 2002 had been changed in the later contractual letters, initially to 18.75 tonnes, and, then when the handline was removed, to 17.55 tonnes per operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1607">Mr Harris was asked by North East Equity to assume that 'an 8 hour working day' was one in which all processing and packing machinery was manned and operated continuously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1608">He used the 8 hours as a fixed period for the whole operation and applied this assumption to assessing capacity per operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1609">During the concurrent evidence, as I have noted above, Mr Harris explained that a split shift was normal in the food industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1610">307 Mr Gillenkirch opined that the measurement of capacity had to be while the plant was actually operating.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1611">That meant one would exclude the start-up, shut down and cleaning procedures of the plant, which would be outside the time needed to measure its capacity to produce a particular tonnage in an operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1612">In my opinion, that is a commonsense and correct view to take.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1613">Thus, the pack out rate per hour, under normal operating conditions, had to be calculated based on when the plant actually operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1614">This did not include time spent preparing it and closing it down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1615">It did not matter to North East Equity whether a split or continuous shift was used, so long as the overall labour used for the production of the tonnage worked so as to produce the agreed tonnage in an overall operating hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1616">308 Mr Gillenkirch explained that the essential feature of North East Equity's system was its ability to accumulate carrots while they were cooled in the chilling hoppers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1617">If one started packing too early, there would be insufficient supply to keep up the production rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1618">309 The experts agreed that the first section of the line (which they identified as including the washing, polishing, diameter and length grading sections) had the capacity to deliver between about 23 and 24 tonnes per hour into the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1619">They did not consider Mr Webster's view (in his 1 August 2002 memorandum) that the brush washers could process 'a good polished carrot' at 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1620">Messrs Gillenkirch and Manteca had said in their joint report that the capacity of the receiving and polishing section of the line was between 20 and 24 tonnes per hour depending on the quality and condition of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1621">310 The two views are not inconsistent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1622">As I have found, Mr Tana and Mr Proud discussed in 2002 the effect on quality if the brush washers were operated at or towards their full capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1623">Mr Webster was concerned with quality being lost if the brush washers operated faster than at 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1624">Both he and Mr Tana were aware that the brush washers could be operated at a higher rate but that this would result in the carrots having a lesser quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1625">The experts were discussing the actual capacity of this equipment, to operate at a given rate per hour, not the preferable rate at which it should be operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1626">311 Before preparing the joint reports Mr Harris had concluded that, if the plant were operated continuously in one concurrent shift of 8 hours, its maximum capacity (if run at 100% efficiency) was about 71 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1627">If the shift were increased to 10 hours (at 100% efficiency) he said the maximum capacity was 89 tonnes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1628">He said that normally such plants would run at about 70-80% efficiency, rather than the 100% he had assumed in his calculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1629">Mr Harris visited the plant between in August and October 2005 on four separate occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1630">He said that there were three limiting factors for the pack out tonnage:
 
 
 (1) The design and configuration of the grading tables immediately prior to the Newtec/Gillenkirch weighing and packing machines, which he concluded 'severely limits the gross feed rate to box packing to a maximum of 5 tonnes per hour'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1631">(2) If eight product groups were produced simultaneously, then nine chilling tanks were not enough to enable processing to continue uninterrupted over a sustained processing run.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1632">(3) The packing combinations limited flexibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1633">
 

312 Mr Harris expressed the view that all the equipment, with the exception of final grading tables, could operate individually at a capacity of 17.55 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1634">Mr Harris took the view that, ultimately, with the plant configured as he saw it, normal production of eight products could be expected to be 60-70 tonnes pack out in 10 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1635">313 In expressing those key limiting factors, Mr Harris had assumed that the final grading tables had to have the capacity to remove 18% waste.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1636">I have found that that was not the contractual requirement, and that the waste could (and ordinarily would) be removed as early in the line as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1637">And Mr Harris prepared his report on the assumption that 20% of the gross feed to the grading tables immediately before the packing machines would consist of Class 2, with a further 18% rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1638">Again, I am not satisfied that the parties agreed or negotiated on the basis that 38% of the carrots conveyed to those grading tables would be removed there from what was to be packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1639">314 In their joint report, the three experts agreed that the installed maximum capacity of the grading tables, prior to the weighing and packing machines, was between 4-5 tonnes per hour per table for large carrots, 4 tonnes per hour for medium carrots and 3-4 tonnes per hour for small carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1640">They therefore agreed that the total maximum capacity of the five inspection tables before the weighing and packing machines was between 20-25 tonnes per hour if they were all operating at a maximum capacity on large carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1641">It follows that, if all five tables were operating on maximum capacity on a maximum of three classes of carrots at any one time, they could pack between 15 and 25 tonnes per hour as Mr Proud's letter of 30 September 2002 stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1642">That was because North East Equity had specified that there would be only three conveyors from the chilling tanks to the weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1643">315 The packing section of the line thus had the capacity to pack 17.55 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1644">Of course, if only small carrots were fed into it, it would only pack 15 tonnes per hour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1645">This was also stated in the 30 September 2002 letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1646">But the contract did not require it to pack any particular size at this rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1647">Commonsense and the mutually known facts meant that both parties were aware that the carrots delivered for packing would not be of an homogenous size or quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1648">Thus in specifying capacities the parties were providing for an average or typical situation but not for every possible permutation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1649">316 The experts agreed that the capacity of the final grading tables was sufficient to remove no more than 25% of the total carrots delivered to those tables as either Class 2, waste or rejects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1650">They said that this could be done with three people present at those tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1651">They agreed that up to 20% Class 2 carrots would be removed at this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1652">The experts also agreed that the flow of production (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1653">carrots) at grading tables was affected by the number of people at the particular tables, the variety and quality of carrots, and the different sizes of carrots that could occur during daily production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1654">They noted that there was no information in the written contractual documents as to the acceptable quality of carrots that could be packed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1655">They agreed that a packing line such as that installed at Wattleup, should be assessed by calculating its average capacity over the whole line as being approximately 80% of the individual capacities at each packing machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1656">317 Importantly, they agreed that the management of production was important and could be a key point for the efficiency of the plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1657">They also agreed that the quality of the packing machines, the adjustment of the settings, the management of the line and the quality of the carrots affected the efficiency of the line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1658">
 
 22.2 The 5deg.C requirement and the chilling tanks 
 

318 Mr Harris had not addressed the performance of the chilled water and the refrigeration systems in his reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1659">He had assumed that the chilled water had a temperature of 2deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1660">He estimated that the time required to chill carrots introduced into the line at 28deg.C to less than 5deg.C, was 30 minutes for small/medium carrots and 45 minutes for large carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1661">His view was that it was necessary to hold all the carrots in the chilling tanks for 30 minutes after the last one had entered, before any discharge to the packing stations could commence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1662">Mr Gillenkirch said that for the carrots in classes with smaller volumes, once about 2 hours worth of supply had accumulated in the chilling tanks, packing from those tanks could begin while they still received further carrots of the same size from the graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1663">319 During the concurrent evidence, Mr Harris qualified his view that 45 minutes was an appropriate time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1664">He said that it could be 40 minutes and his own trials with larger carrots came out to approximately 38-40 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1665">His experiment did not measure the actual processing operation at the Wattleup plant on any day on which he was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1666">He had constructed a predictive model which established a relationship between the temperature of the carrot before it went into the water, and the time that it would take to cool to 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1667">The model had a mathematical curve that showed that the nearer the temperature was to 5deg.C, the harder it was progressively to reduce that temperature further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1668">He said that the model showed that if the ambient temperature were reduced from 28deg.C to 20deg.C, it took about 5 minutes less time to cool the carrot to 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1669">320 Mr Gillenkirch said that the times in which carrots would chill had to be based on their diameter, not their length.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1670">He asked Mr Harris whether he could agree with that, but Mr Harris said he did not have enough information to answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1671">Mr Harris said he could not be predictive between lengths and could only speak about weight and temperatures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1672">However, he thought Mr Gillenkirch was putting to him a reasonable assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1673">321 Mr Harris worked on the premise that the 5deg.C was a quality parameter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1674">Based on Mr Stammers' measurements, he said that it was possible for a carrot to go from one end of the chilling tank to the other and exit in about 5 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1675">Mr Stammers had been instructed by Mr Gillenkirch to make observations and record results on a visit to the Wattleup line in September 2006 for the purpose of assisting in the preparation of his expert evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1676">Mr Stammers was a fitter and turner by trade.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1677">He had performed a test using a marked carrot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1678">He dropped it four times into chilling tank No 5 where the length grader deposited closest to the exit point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1679">The length graders deposited carrots closer to the exit to the packing conveyors on tank No 5 than for any other tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1680">The tank was being emptied at the time and the marked carrot took between 3.5 and 5.5 minutes to leave the tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1681">Mr Stammers also observed that some large carrots had been in a chilling tank for 30 minutes but their temperature was 6-7deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1682">Mr Harris had not measured final temperature at pack out although he did measure some temperatures of carrots actually in the tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1683">322 Mr Gillenkirch said that the last carrot that came into one of the chilling tanks from the graders would not be the first carrot to be pumped out when that tank was being emptied to the packing conveyors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1684">None of the experts had actually measured whether the carrots on the Wattleup line, if processed in a continuous fashion (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1685">put into a chilling tank which was at the same time being emptied onto the packing conveyor) emerged onto the conveyor at 5deg.C or less.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1686">Mr Harris worked on the assumption that it was possible for the carrots, after being deposited from the length graders, to pass through the chilling tank onto the exit conveyors before they had been chilled to 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1687">323 Mr Manteca explained that after the carrots were dropped into the chilling tanks from the length graders, air was bubbled into the tanks to prevent the carrots accumulating into a mound and to disperse them inside the tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1688">Chilled water was pumped into the tanks in order to keep the temperature even.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1689">In agreeing with Mr Harris, Mr Manteca said that it was possible that, once the gates opened to the packing conveyors, a new carrot could enter a chilling tank from the length graders and could move easily from the entry point to the exit point in less time than was needed to cool it down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1690">Mr Gillenkirch then explained that carrots in the lower volume sizes would be accumulating over the course of at least two hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1691">He said that if there were 5,000 kg in a tank, then (after Mr Harris had corrected him) the risk that the last carrot in the tank would be the first out was one in about 30,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1692">He said that most carrot packing houses in Europe worked in the way the Wattleup plant did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1693">Even if the tank were 50-60% full, he thought the risk was very low, although theoretically possible, that a carrot would emerge from the chilling tanks before its core temperature had cooled to 5deg.C or less.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1694">324 I accept Mr Gillenkirch's evidence that the risk was relatively low that, after a considerable period of accumulation of the lower volume sizes, a carrot recently introduced into a chilling tank would come out before it had chilled to 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1695">This risk was more likely to occur in the tank in which Mr Stammers did his experiment, but that did not make the new line, as a whole, deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1696">That tank could be managed so as to minimise the risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1697">None of the experts measured whether this in fact was occurring in the operation of North East Equity's plant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1698">However, Mr Gillenkirch's experience with the ordinary operation of such plants satisfied me that, in terms of fitness for purpose, the system was reasonably capable of processing carrots at 5deg.C or less, even if there were a small risk that a few carrots in the smaller volume sizes might slip through without having been chilled to 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1699">Overall, such a risk was unlikely to affect the quality of the out turn in any material way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1700">23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1701">LENGTH GRADERS 
 
325 Mr Tana said that, before 2002, the Wattleup plant had a mechanical length grader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1702">He was not sure whether it had been part of the original Sumich equipment, or if he had bought it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1703">He said this machine operated differently to the Bruynooghe ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1704">It used a sliding motion to move the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1705">The Bruynooghe length graders moved the carrots down a corrugated surface by vibration causing them to bounce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1706">As I have found above, he was aware from his visit to Belgium in August 2002 of how the Bruynooghe equipment as proposed for Wattleup, including length graders, operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1707">326 Mr Proud asserted in his witness statement that length graders were inherently inaccurate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1708">Mr Harris corresponded with Mr Parrein of Bruynooghe after they had undertaken a joint inspection of the new line in late October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1709">Mr Parrein wrote that:
 
 '[T]he accuracy of mechanical length grading will always be poor (same experience with other customers).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1710">
 
 [T]he easiest and best improvement will be a better spreading of the carrots at the infeed section.</sentence>

327 Although Mr Proud's description of length graders as being 'inherently inaccurate' is graphic, it is consistent with the expert evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1712">Their conclusion that the shape of the carrots impeded consistent grading would have been apparent to Mr Tana on his visit to Belgium when he saw a system in operation similar to that described in Proud Machinery's letter of 29 July.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1713">That is, the length graders supplied to North East Equity worked as well as one could expect given that the carrots had different shapes, girths and sizes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1714">328 The experts agreed that length graders as a class could not consistently size carrots to the same length because of the shape of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1715">They also agreed that the contractual documents did not provide any information or specification for the quality requirements of the length graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1716">Mr Tana knew that some carrots he grew (Nantes/Stefano) were more tubular than conical, while others (Sakata/Mojo) were more conical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1717">329 I have approached Mr Tana's evidence with caution for the reasons I have given above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1718">He was a skilled and astute businessman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1719">He examined business propositions with care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1720">I am satisfied that Mr Tana was aware of the nature and practical operation of the length sizers that Proud Machinery suggested before deciding to enter into the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1721">I am not satisfied that he was misled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1722">330 Mr Gillenkirch said that the length sizing machines were of a standard acceptable in the industry at the time they were supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1723">I accept that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1724">24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1725">CAPACITY 
 
331 During the period between early August and late September 2002, Mr Tana, together with Ms Mirosevich and Mr Webster, carefully examined each draft of the schematic drawing of the then current layout proposed for the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1726">For example, Mr Tana examined them to understand how many times carrots would drop as they were conveyed to the point of packing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1727">He did this to consider the potential for damage due to the drops.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1728">He told Mr Webster to check with Ms Mirosevich if more than three varieties would be packed at any one time and to get her to confirm that what was proposed was acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1729">332 Mr Tana appreciated, before the contract was entered into, that in addition to carrots sent onto the prepack line, only three conveyors would carry graded carrots to the weighing and packing machines at any one time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1730">Thus, at most only four particular graded sizes could be packed simultaneously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1731">Mr Harris identified an assumption that there were eight product groups and that all eight were to be simultaneously graded, one each into one of the nine chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1732">He also assumed, for one scenario he considered, that the premium product group comprised 40% of the total product mix.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1733">333 Mr Harris noted that there was no reference to product mix in the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1734">And there is no evidence that any particular product mix was provided or identified by North East Equity to Proud Machinery or Mr Proud prior to the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1735">However, the contractual and represented requirement was that the line would have the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight distinct streams of length and size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1736">A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood that the pack out rate would be related to the quantity and variety of sizes of carrots delivered for processing and the selection of sizing by North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1737">If, for example, there were only one tonne of carrots of a particular size in a delivery of, say, 150 tonnes, then reserving a chilling tank for that small quantity would affect the rate at which the balance of the 150 tonnes would be graded and processed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1738">It would take all day to process the one tonne into its designated chilling tank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1739">That would obviously reduce the efficiency of the whole process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1740">And, if there were two or three similar small quantities of particular sizes, each using its own chilling tank, the impact on reducing the rate of processing would be greater.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1741">334 The ability of the new line to achieve particular results was dependent not only on the machinery supplied but also upon the nature of what was delivered by it for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1742">North East Equity specified which tanks it wished to receive what types of carrots in its fax of 14 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1743">It had changed that specification slightly from the version attached to Proud Machinery's letter of 8 October 2002 by adding to chilling tank No 1 the capacity to receive premium medium size carrots, as well as 500 gm small carrots for the prepack line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1744">It did not seek advice from or inform Mr Proud or Proud Machinery about that selection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1745">The selection was made by Ms Mirosevich, Mr Chew and Mr Webster for North East Equity using design drawings for the new line, including the position of the tanks in relation to the graders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1746">335 It was obvious, as a matter of commonsense, that if the input of carrots to the new line did not accumulate enough carrots in the tanks to keep a constant flow from three tanks once the packing operation began, then, the maximum daily output would be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1747">Thus, originally, tank numbers 1 and 2 had been designated solely to supply the prepack line, but North East Equity altered the specification to allow tank No 1 to be used to increase the number of tanks which could supply the three main packing lines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1748">336 Likewise, if North East Equity packed 10 kg cartons, then the ultimate hourly pack out rate would be significantly less than if it packed 20 kg cartons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1749">This again was common knowledge of the parties and commonsense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1750">The handling for 10 kg cartons was twice that required for the 20 kg ones to pack the same quantity of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1751">First, North East Equity employees had to assemble cartons, whether 10 kg or 20 kg, for use by the Gillenkirch packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1752">The weighing, packing and strapping machines and the stacking robots had to perform twice as many actions if 10 kg cartons were used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1753">The smaller cartons required double the number of actions in the operation of the parts of new line where they were used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1754">Mr Proud's letter of 30 September 2002 used 20 kg cartons as examples of how the tonnage per operating hour could be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1755">337 The new plant had a number of centrally important features.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1756">First, there were nine tanks, one for each stream of graded carrots, with one spare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1757">And, there were three conveyors to the five packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1758">Thus, the contents of only three tanks could be processed at any one time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1759">Secondly, if there was not a relatively consistent mix of the eight different sizes in the supply of carrots fed into the commencement of the line, the operator of the plant would need to make adjustments in the production process to ensure continuity of supply to the weighing and packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1760">Thus, if North East Equity decided to process less than eight different sizes, more than one tank could be used to chill certain sizes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1761">338 It was up to North East Equity to determine the mix of sizes of carrots it fed into the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1762">Thus, as a matter of commonsense, when Mr Tana and Mr Proud discussed the capacity of the new plant to process a number of tonnes per hour, each must have had understood that consistency of the size and quality carrots introduced at the commencement of the production process, affected the capacity of the plant to pack out particular numbers of carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1763">And, a reasonable person in their position would have understood this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1764">If the carrots were predominantly, as appeared to have been the case, small and small/medium, eight different lengths and grades would accumulate in the tanks at significantly differing rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1765">That would require the person controlling the production process to have a keen eye on how quickly the receiving tanks were filling up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1766">Once more than one tank was full (there being a spare tank) it would be necessary to stop the input of the line so as to clear up to three of the full tanks by commencing the packing process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1767">Thus, the selection of the sizes of carrots to be processed, using the girth and length graders would have a critical impact on how output would occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1768">339 It was obvious to the parties, at the time of the contract, that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud had no control over the sizes of the carrots grown on the farms and delivered for processing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1769">That input, and the selection of the grades for processing, were critical inputs beyond the control of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1770">Both parties must have understood this at the time of the negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1771">The capacity or ability of the plant to grade and process carrots at a particular rate per hour was one thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1772">However, I do not think either party understood that what each of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud was being asked to do was to guarantee that, whatever the variety or combination of inputs in carrot size or length, there would or could be a minimum constancy of output.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1773">340 There were only three conveyors to the five packing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1774">Thus, only three tanks could be emptied at any one time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1775">North East Equity had specified that there be only three tanks emptied to the three sets of grading tables in addition to the prepack line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1776">The operation of the conveyors depended on what carrots were ready for processing from the chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1777">What went into the chilling tanks depended upon what had been delivered from the farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1778">If the produce delivered were relatively homogenous so that the chilling tanks would accumulate produce at a constant rate, then one might be able to infer that a constant output would be delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1779">But, if the input from the farms were significantly varied, so that, say 50% of the carrots to be processed were of one kind and the rest were distributed unevenly over the other seven different possible grades, then it would be obvious that the rate of production per hour at the packing machines would be affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1780">The predominant carrots would fill up the one or two tanks to which they could be sent at a far quicker rate than the other seven varieties which would occupy the remaining seven chilling tanks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1781">341 This reinforces the commonsense of Mr Webster's memorandum to Mr Tana of 1 August 2002, that it would be necessary to build up, in a split shift, a supply in the chilling tanks before the packing side of the line began operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1782">And this was also reflected in North East Equity's change to the specifications for tank No 1 in the fax of 14 October 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1783">342 North East Equity conflated the different capacities of the plant into a cognate specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1784">Thus, it claimed that Proud Machinery contracted to, or represented that it would, supply a plant which not only could perform each of the separate functions but could do all of them together, in effect, in any combination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1785">This conflation was reflected in the instructions and assumptions which it gave to Mr Harris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1786">I am of opinion that the conflation is unwarranted and does not reflect accurately what the parties discussed in 2002 or the terms of the contract and representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1787">25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1788">APPROACH TO REPRESENTATION CLAIMS GENERALLY 
 
343 I have analysed the position of North East Equity and Proud Machinery in terms of contract, because they undoubtedly made a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1789">And, the terms to which they agreed provide a sound basis on which to assess what representations were conveyed by Proud Machinery and Mr Proud, on which North East Equity relied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1790">344 Where experienced business people have concluded an agreement, that contract will normally provide a very good starting point, and often an equally good finish, in ascertaining what terms and representations were made which caused the parties to proceed as they did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1791">That is the approach I consider to appropriate here, having considered all of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1792">In other words, I am satisfied that North East Equity, through Mr Tana, proceeded in its relationship with Proud Machinery, and Mr Proud, as if there were a contract on foot between them and that Mr Tana understood that its terms were, in effect representations; as did Proud Machinery and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1793">26.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1794">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS PLEADED AND REPRESENTATIONS UNDER SS 52 AND 53(C) OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
345 I summarise below the contractual terms and representations which I have found Proud Machinery made to North East Equity and my findings on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1795">In analysing whether the new line, as installed, conformed with the purposes and terms referred to in [66](a)-(e) above, I have had regard to the implication that the new line would be reasonably fit for those purposes ( Helicopter Sales 132 CLR at 4, 6, 8, 15: see [64]-[66] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1796">(1) Pack out rate per hour 
 
 
 I have not found that terms or representations were made exactly corresponding to those pleaded and set out at [66](a) and [67](g) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1797">Rather I have found (at [87] above) that, at the time of entry into the contract, the processing capacity was contained in a term and representation that: 
 
 
 
 
 the new line would have the capacity to process and pack at a rate of production per operating hour of 18.75 tonnes final pack out on the pallet (later reduced to 17.55 tonnes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1798">
 
 
 
 
 For the reasons given above, I am not satisfied that this was incorrect or misleading or deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1799">The new line had that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1800">And, by operating a split shift, the new line had the capacity to achieve a pack out in excess of 150 or, later (after the handline was deleted), 140.4 tonnes in eight working hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1801">
 

 (2) Temperature 
 
 
 I have found that terms and representations were made which corresponded to those pleaded and set out at [66](b), (c) and [67](h) and [102](iii) and (v), namely that the new line would, first, be designed so as to be reasonably fit to achieve: 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the ability to process farm fresh carrots at field temperatures;
 (c) the core temperature of packed carrots to be not more than 5deg.C;
 and secondly, 
 
 

(h) achieve a guaranteed maximum of 5deg.C core temperature for North East Equity's carrots;
 
 
 
 (iii) have hydro-cooling tanks capable of producing constant product output; and
 (v) be capable of controlling the temperature of the carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1802">
 
 
 
 
 I have found that I am not satisfied that the new line did not have these capacities if operated correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1803">
 

 (3) Grading 
 
 
 I have found terms and representations were made that corresponded to those pleaded and set out at [66](d) and [102] (ii) and (iv), namely that the new line would, first, be designed so as to be reasonably fit to achieve: 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight distinct streams of size and length grades;
 and secondly,
 (ii) have nine hydro-cooling tanks which would allow one of those tanks for each length or size grade and provide the opportunity to have a spare tank; and
 (iv) provide quality length sizing for three separate lengths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1804">
 
 
 
 
 I have found that I am not satisfied that the length graders (there being no complaint about the width or girth graders) were not reasonably fit for the purpose of providing quality length sizing in accordance with what both parties understood were their inherent limitations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1805">I am not satisfied that the new line was not reasonably fit for the purpose of having the ability to sort and grade carrots into eight different streams of length and size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1806">I am satisfied that the hydro cooling tanks conformed with representation (ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1807">
 

 (4) Efficiency 
 
 
 I have found that terms and representations were made that corresponded to those pleaded and set out at [66](e) and [102](vii), namely that the new line would first, be designed so as to be reasonably fit to: 
 
 
 
 
 (e) achieve an increase in efficiency of labour usage compared to the existing Sumich line; 
 and secondly,
 (vii) increase production while reducing the man hours required to achieve that production compared to the existing at the Wattleup plant line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1808">
 
 
 
 
 I am satisfied that these were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1809">As Mr Tana admitted in the meeting of 18 November 2003, labour costs per carton had reduced by 25% or more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1810">
 

 (5) Reduction in damage to carrots 
 
 
 I have found that a representation was made that corresponded to that pleaded and set out in [102](vi) namely that the new line would greatly reduce damage to carrots and wastage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1811">I am not satisfied that this was incorrect, misleading or deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1812">In any event there were no records of waste or damage to carrots so as to enable any finding to be made as to the position before or after the new line was installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1813">And, the quality of carrots delivered for processing after the new line was installed was very different from, and worse than, their earlier quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1814">North East Equity has not established that this representation was not met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1815">
 

346 North East Equity also pleaded that the representations were made by Proud Machinery and Mr Proud:
 
 
 (a) as to the performance characteristics, uses or benefits of the new line and because they were incorrect there were contraventions of s 53(c) of the Trade Practices Act ;
 (b) as to future matters, thus engaging s 51A of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1816">
 

On the findings I have made, it is not necessary to consider these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1817">27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1818">DID NORTH EAST EQUITY HAVE TITLE TO SUE FOR DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1819">
 
347 Proud Machinery and Mr Proud argued that the contractual measure of damages was not appropriate or available to North East Equity because it had assigned all of its contractual rights to the Bank of Western Australia Ltd in November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1820">North East Equity had entered a master lease agreement with the bank in August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1821">The master lease agreement contemplated that in the future North East Equity would seek to lease goods from the bank and set out the general terms which would apply once goods were nominated and acquired by North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1822">On 19 November 2002 the bank and North East Equity sent to Proud Machinery a 'novation notice to and acknowledgment from supplier'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1823">This recited that North East Equity had:
 
 
 (1) 'novate[d]' to the bank all of its rights under the contract that it had with Proud Machinery relating to the construction of the new line under which the bank would receive title to it and become its owner (cl 1);
 (2) 'assign[ed] to [the bank] the [new line] and all of its rights in relation to the [new line]' (cl 2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1824">
 

348 The notice recited that, by Proud Machinery accepting it, the bank was not obliged to pay Proud Machinery, and North East Equity remained liable for any payments due, but once the payments were made, the bank '... will acquire title to the [new line] as it is constructed and will be the sole owner of the [new line], whether or not [North East Equity] makes any payments under the Contract' (cll (a) and (b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1825">349 Proud Machinery executed its acknowledgment and agreement to the terms in the notice on 3 December 2002 and recorded that it agreed to the terms of the novated contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1826">Subsequently on 16 December 2002 North East Equity and the bank executed a construction purchase and lease agreement for the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1827">This recited that North East Equity had entered into a contract with Proud Machinery for the construction of the new line, and the contract (presumably meaning the notice signed by Proud Machinery on 3 December 2002) provided for title to the new line to pass progressively upon payment by the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1828">350 North East Equity argued that the assignment to the bank of the new line '... and all of its rights in relation to the [new line]' was not an assignment of its rights under the contract between it and Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1829">351 The right to sue for breach of the contract to supply work and materials (and equally, for the sale of goods) because the new line did not meet the standard set by contractual terms must be a right 'in relation to' the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1830">It would be a very odd result if the bank, as the owner of the new line, could not sue Proud Machinery under this assignment for breach of the contract to sell or supply the work and materials, if, for example, the new line as installed, was incapable of packing even one carrot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1831">352 North East Equity argued that the assignment was only of its interest and proprietary rights in the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1832">But it did not suggest why the rights which the assignment gave the bank were limited to ones arising outside of the contract between North East Equity and Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1833">The contract was then executory and had not been breached in late 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1834">353 In addition, s 20 of the Property Law Act 1969 (WA) provided:
 
 ' 20 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1835">Assignment of debts and choses in action 
 
 
 
 
 (1) Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor (not purporting to be by way of charge only) of any debt or other legal chose in action, of which express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee, or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim that debt or chose in action, is effectual in law (subject to equities having priority over the right of the assignee), to pass and transfer from the date of the notice -- 
 
 
 
 (a) the legal right to that debt or chose in action; 
 (b) all legal and other remedies for the debt or chose in action; and 
 
 
 
 (c) the power to give a good discharge for the debt or chose in action, without the concurrence of the assignor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1836">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Where the debtor, trustee, or other person liable in respect of the debt or chose in action referred to in subsection (1) has notice -- 
 
 
 (a) that the assignment so referred to is disputed by the assignor, or any person claiming under him; or 
 (b) of any other opposing or conflicting claims, to the debt or chose in action, 
 
 
 
 
 he may, if he thinks fit, either call upon the persons making claim thereto to interplead concerning the debt or chose in action, or pay the debt or other chose in action into court, under the provisions of the Trustees Act 1962.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1837">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section "any debt or other legal chose in action" includes a part of any debt or other legal chose in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1838">' 
 
 
 
 

354 That section is derived from s 25(6) of the Judicature Act 1873 (UK): see Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) [6-030], where at [6-480] the learned authors referred to the decision of Lord Alverstone CJ, Darling and Channell JJ in Torkington v Magee [1902] 2 KB 427 as an instance of a valid assignment of a chose in action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1839">In Torkington [1902] 2 KB at 431-432 the Divisional Court held that an assignment of the benefit of an executory contract, of which there was no breach at the time, was validly made under the analogue of s 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1840">Their Lordships held that the right to sue for damages for a later breach by the obligor could be exercised directly by the assignee without suing in the assignor's name: Torkington [1902] 2 KB at 432.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1841">355 As a matter of ordinary English, the assignment by North East Equity of 'all of its rights in relation to' the new line was plenary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1842">The expression 'in relation to' is of wide and general import (cp its width when used in a statute: Fountain v Alexander (1982) 150 CLR 615 at 629 per Mason J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1843">And, in Loxton v Moir (1914) 18 CLR 360 at 379 Rich J said:
 
 'The phrase "chose in action" is used in different senses, but its primary sense is that of a right enforceable by an action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1844">It may also be used to describe the right of action itself, when considered as part of the property of the person entitled to sue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1845">A right to sue for a sum of money is a chose in action, and it is a proprietary right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1846">' 
 

356 I am of opinion that the chose in action, being the entitlement to sue the vendor of the new line for breach of contract, was intended to be assigned by the language of the notice of 3 December 2002, to which North East Equity, Proud Nominees and the bank were parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1847">357 Next, North East Equity relied on cl 1.15(g) of the construction purchase and lease agreement it entered into with the bank on 16 December 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1848">That provided that North East Equity, at its own expense, would take any action required by the bank '... in order to enforce performance of the contract by the supplier or to protect our interest in the goods'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1849">North East Equity argued that this contemplated that it would retain its rights under the contract including the right to sue for breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1850">I reject that argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1851">358 First, the assignment occurred and Proud Machinery became party to the notice some 13 days before the construction purchase and lease agreement was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1852">The latter agreement cannot affect the construction of the earlier notice which had an additional party, Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1853">359 Secondly, in any event cl 1.15(g) was consistent with the plenary construction of the earlier assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1854">It provided for North East Equity, as assignor, to make its name available, were that necessary, to enforce performance of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1855">That would only be where rights had not been passed to the bank by the earlier assignment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1856">Since the bank was paying for the purchase and installation of the new line, it is not apparent, as a matter of commercial commonsense why it would leave causes of action for breach of contract by the vendor in the hands of the bank's customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1857">The bank would be conscious of the risk to it of its customer (North East Equity) becoming insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1858">If that occurred, the bank would have purchased, and would own the new line, but could only prove in its customer's insolvency for the damages needed to bring the new line into conformity with the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1859">That would work commercial inconvenience and is not a commercially sensible construction in absence of clear words: Zhu v Treasurer of NSW [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1860">360 Thirdly, cl 1.15(g) protected the interests of the bank where, for some legal or other reason, it could not sue (e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1861">in respect of a claim for unliquidated damages which accrued before the assignment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1862">Fourthly, the protection of the bank's interest in the goods referred to in cl 1.15(g) is not a right of North East Equity 'in relation to' the new line as contemplated in the notice; it is a distinct right of the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1863">361 North East Equity also argued that the assignment was of a bare right to damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1864">It was not; the assignment was of a legal chose in action for the reasons I have given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1865">362 In Beaton v Moore Acceptance Corporation Pty Ltd [1959] HCA 59 ; (1959) 104 CLR 107 , Dixon CJ, Taylor and Windeyer JJ considered a case involving a purchaser who had entered into a contract with a vendor for the sale of goods, being a bulldozer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1866">Before that contract was completed, the purchaser entered into a hire purchase contract with a financier, and the financier in turn entered into a contract with the original vendor to acquire the bulldozer from it so as to make it available to the purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1867">The bulldozer was defective when delivered to the purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1868">Dixon CJ, Taylor and Windeyer JJ said that the purchaser's claim against the original vendor was for breach of a contract '... which, by common consent, was superseded by the hire purchase agreement in question and which, therefore, was never carried into effect': Beaton 104 CLR at 118; see too Hellyer Drilling Co v MacDonald Hamilton &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1983) 51 ALR 177 at 181 per Fitzgerald J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1869">363 North East Equity relied on TC Industrial Plant Pty Ltd v Robert's Queensland Pty Ltd [1963] HCA 57 ; (1963) 180 CLR 130 where a purchaser under a hire purchase agreement was held to be entitled to recover damages for breach of contract against both the vendor of the equipment and the financier who let it on hire purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1870">However, the reason for this was that such a right was expressly created by s 7A(1) of the Hire-purchase Agreement Acts 1933-1946 (Qld): see TC Industrial 180 CLR at 136 where the relevant section is set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1871">364 Rights to sue for the tort of negligent misrepresentation ( Poulton v The Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602 per Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ) and for loss or damage under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act in respect of a contravention of s 52 are not assignable: Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 at 732-734 [51] - [57] per myself; BHP Coal Pty Ltd v O &amp; K Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG [2008] QSC 141 at [76] per McMurdo J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1872">Those rights remained with North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1873">365 The assignment was made as a contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1874">Each of North East Equity and Proud Machinery agreed with the bank in December 2002 that all North East Equity's rights in relation to the new line would be either assigned by it to, or taken as being enforceable directly by, the bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1875">Under that agreement, North East Equity's contractual rights against Proud Machinery passed to the bank in accordance with, or were superseded by, the terms of the notice executed by Proud Machinery on 3 December 2002: Beaton 104 CLR at 118.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1876">Accordingly, I am of opinion that North East Equity had no title to sue Proud Machinery for breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1877">28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1878">THE CLAIM IN NEGLIGENCE 
 
366 North East Equity pleaded that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud owed it a duty '... in designing, procuring and installing the [n]ew [l]ine to exercise reasonable care and skill so as to avoid [North East Equity] suffering loss and damage by any act or omission on the part of [Mr] Proud or Proud Machinery'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1879">I have found that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud did not design the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1880">367 Nonetheless the contract contained an implied promise that Proud Machinery would exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of its services, including the selection of goods or work and materials that were reasonably fit for the purposes for which North East Equity had (expressly or by implication) indicated they were required: Astley v Austrust Ltd [1999] HCA 6 ; (1999) 197 CLR 1 at 21-22 [46] - [47] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Helicopter Sales [1974] HCA 32 ; 132 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1881">368 In the relationship between North East Equity and Proud Machinery, that implied promise was parallel and concurrent with a co-extensive duty in tort on the part of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud to exercise the same reasonable skill and care: Astley 197 CLR at 23 [46]-[48] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1882">369 The pleading of Proud Machinery's and Mr Proud's alleged negligence and the way in which North East Equity argued this claim reflected, in substance, its complaints of failures in the design, procurement and installation of the new line, which gave rise to the shortcomings in its operation as installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1883">The duty of care in this matter arose because and in the context of the contractual relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1884">Proud Machinery had parallel and concurrent obligations in tort and contract to exercise reasonable care and skill in performing professional tasks owed to North East Equity under the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1885">Mr Proud had a parallel and congruent obligation in tort: Astley 197 CLR at 23 [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1886">There is no circumstance pleaded in the present case which would justify extending those obligations in tort beyond a parallel and concurrent liability of Proud Machinery and Mr Proud, co-extensive with the contractual obligations of Proud Machinery to exercise reasonable skill and care.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1887">370 The contract was negotiated at arms length between two experienced and capable business people, Mr Tana and Mr Proud.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1888">Its express and implied terms reflected the commercial relationship agreed on by the parties for the procurement and installation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1889">That relationship is a commonplace in commerce; a vendor who is the distributor of plant and equipment and a purchaser who, after negotiating with the vendor, agrees on terms for the purchase and installation of the equipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1890">The common law and statutory obligations (such as in Part V of the Trade Practices Act and the Sales of Goods Act ) which govern such a relationship do not need extension or modification on the facts of this matter or merely because one party was unhappy, after the event, with the result arrived at by the performance of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1891">371 On the basis of my findings in respect of the contractual terms and representations, the claim in negligence, must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1892">29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1893">DAMAGES 
 
 
 29.1 General conclusions 
 

372 I have rejected the claims for damages for economic loss and loss of a chance to earn further profits as being without foundation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1894">I have also found that, in substance, North East Equity has not established that the new line failed to operate in accordance with the pleaded contractual terms and representations, or that Proud Machinery and Mr Proud breached the duties of care they owed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1895">There are still some subsidiary matters which I will address below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1896">
 
 29.2 The flume elevators 
 

373 The agreement reached in the meeting on 18 November 2003 recognised that the flume elevators were not operating to the standard which they ought to have achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1897">I am of opinion that, as Mr Proud admitted, the problem with the flumes was never remedied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1898">Bruynooghe quoted &#8364;51,000 plus freight to replace them with a system that Mr Tana would have accepted, if he had not had to pay for this, as he explained in his letter to Mr Proud of 8 January 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1899">This price provides a reliable measure of the quantum of damages required to put North East Equity in the position that it would have been in, had the flume elevators not been defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1900">True it is that the original flume elevators worked, albeit not as well as they should have, and were retained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1901">Mr Tana gave evidence that North East Equity's packaging operations were to be conducted from the Lancelin farm pack house from late October 2007, with the exception of the prepack line of 10 kg cartons for small/medium carrots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1902">374 The problems with the flume elevators caused them to stop sometimes, which held up production for brief periods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1903">On other occasions, carrots fell off the flume elevators, particularly in the first few months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1904">These occasions caused disruption and irritation to North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1905">There was no precise evidence of how long or how often these delays occurred, but I am satisfied that they were more than trivial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1906">North East Equity, however, did not prove that it had to pay staff overtime or otherwise suffered financial loss on any particular occasion because of delays caused by the flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1907">There is no evidence that, even though production was interrupted, it was not completed during ordinary working hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1908">375 Moreover, while Mr Tana no doubt was annoyed by being asked to pay for the replacement flumes, had he done so by early 2004, when it was clear that Proud Machinery and Bruynooghe would not, this problem would have been resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1909">I am not persuaded that it was reasonable for North East Equity not to have replaced them by June 2004 if there were production difficulties of any substance caused by the flume elevators: Burns v MAN Automotive (Aust) Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 81 ; (1986) 161 CLR 653 at 658 per Gibbs CJ, at 668 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ, at 673-674 per Brennan J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1910">Accordingly, I am of opinion that the general damages for this problem should be awarded only for the period to June 2004 when the new flumes should have been installed, had a decision to replace them been made within a reasonable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1911">376 It was not reasonably foreseeable, at the time the contract was entered into, that North East Equity would continue to operate a defective flume system which disrupted its business by affecting the orderly and efficient operation of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1912">Any damage it suffered beyond the time when what needed to be done became clear and that Proud Machinery would not replace the flume elevators, was not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties as flowing from the breach: Burns 161 CLR at 668 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1913">377 I am of opinion that the cost of replacing the flume elevators was &#8364;51,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1914">There is no evidence of the freight or installation costs but, doing the best I can from reviewing the general costs of installing the new line I consider that an allowance of &#8364;9,000 should be made, making a total of &#8364;60,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1915">
 
 29.3 Damages for disruption 
 

378 It is difficult to dissect particular losses of time or costs as having been occasioned by one or more of the deficiencies in the new line which I have found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1916">These were the defective flume elevators and the original location of the touch screen in the office, rather than above the tanks where it was moved later in 2003 at no cost to North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1917">The task of making an assessment of any loss is more difficult because of the deficiencies I have found in North East Equity's management, or lack of it, of the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1918">379 Doing the best I can, it is likely that, on occasion, some extra labour and operating expenses were incurred due to the deficiencies of the flume elevators and the initial location of the touch screen in the office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1919">No attempt to quantify such losses by evidence was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1920">I am of opinion that it is appropriate to find that $10,000 would compensate North East Equity for any unnecessary increase in its operating costs during the periods in which the touch screen remained in its original location and up to June 2004 when the new flumes should have been installed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1921">I am not satisfied that any substantial or greater loss was incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1922">380 However, North East Equity did not appear to make any separate claim for damages based on the deficiencies in, and disruption caused by, the flume elevators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1923">The expert production evidence did not suggest that these machines caused any delay or inefficiency which related to the pleaded misrepresentations and negligence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1924">I consider that this sum of &#8364;60,000 can be some evidence of the amount by which the new line as installed was worth less than its cost, but I will need to hear the parties as to whether I can allow North East Equity to recover damages in this sum on its pleaded case and in light of my overall findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1925">
 
 29.4 The 5deg.C requirement 
 

381 As I have found, I am not satisfied that North East Equity has established that, if the new line were competently operated, it could not achieve an outcome of 17.55 tonnes per operating hour at final pack out, with a maximum of 18% rejects, and with carrots at no more than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1926">382 There was no evidence of any loss of sales or other economic loss suffered by North East Equity, including any claim relating to carrots being packed at a core temperature greater than 5deg.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1927">If I were wrong in my finding that no breach has been established of the contractual terms and representations that the core temperature of carrots would not exceed 5deg.C, then the question of quantification of North East Equity's damages for this breach would arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1928">383 The situation has some similarity to assessing damages where building work is defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1929">Recently, Finkelstein and Gordon JJ said that, speaking generally in cases of work done or not done, or damage caused to property in breach of contract, there are two bases for assessing damages: first, the cost of reinstatement, or secondly, the diminution of the value of the property due to the breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1930">They held that the correct measure is '... whatever is reasonable for the wronged party to recover': Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (2008) 166 FCR 494 at 503 [29].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1931">I examined the authorities and concluded that the principle applicable based on Bellgrove v Eldridge [1954] HCA 36 ; (1954) 90 CLR 613 was ( Bowen Investments 166 FCR at 524 [98]):
 
 '... that the building owner was entitled to recover the cost of rectification provided that the rectification proposed was both necessary, to bring about conformity with the contract, and a reasonable course to adopt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1932">"Reasonableness", in that context, can be seen to be what the owner could require having regard to the terms of the contract and the nature of the departure from them in the performance proffered by the other party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1933">That is, of course, a factual enquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1934">' 
 
 

384 The new line was a working asset used by North East Equity in its business from March 2003 to at least October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1935">On the hypothesis that I ought to have found that the new line was defective because it did not always pack out carrots with a core temperature of 5deg.C or less, such an event had no pecuniary consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1936">And, the carrots were still packed chilled but perhaps not as low as exactly 5deg.C or less.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1937">The performance offered by the new line as installed was not productive of any relevant determent to North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1938">It saw no need to reinstate, supplement or replace the refrigeration system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1939">And it suffered no commercial detriment as a result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1940">I am of opinion that North East Equity has not established that the cost of bringing the new line into conformity with the contractual term or representation relating to the 5deg.C requirement would be reasonable to award as damages: see Bowen Investments 166 FCR at 503 [29], 522 [93].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1941">
 
 29.5 Damages on a 'no transaction' basis 
 

385 In final address, counsel for North East Equity suggested that its reliance damages should be calculated on the basis set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1942">It argued that it would not have entered into the contract and subsequent lease agreement with the bank, had it not acted in reliance on Proud Machinery's and Mr Proud's misleading representations, or if they had not been negligent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1943">North East Equity's methodology used a number of approximations in claiming that it had suffered a loss of $1,300,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1944">In the calculations below, I have attempted to remove those approximations so that the result, using North East Equity's methodology, can be compared with other calculations, which I explain below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1945">(Negative values are in parenthesis) Exact calculation North East Equity's approximation in its submissions (a) Total cost to North East Equity of new line (Based on North East Equity making all lease payments to the bank for 5 years to 30 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1946">This figure was agreed by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1947">) $ (4,328,230) $ (4,328,230) (b) Add the current value of the new line (Based on Mr Gregson's evidence that at May 2007 the new line had an auction value of between $640,000 to $960,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1948">) $ 960,000 $ 1,000,000 (c) Add North East Equity's savings on labour costs: &#8226; based on a period of 4 years; &#8226; assuming savings per carton reduced by 30cents to 90cents per carton for 1,955,000 cartons p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1949">(based on Mr Langridge's analysis that 23,000,000 kg p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1950">were produced); &#8226; 0.30 x 1,955,000 = $586,500 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1951">labour savings; &#8226; subtract from this figure additional power costs of $89,700 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1952">that North East Equity claimed were incurred; &#8226; net saving of $586,500 - $89,700 = $496,800 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1953">(approximated by North East Equity to a net saving of $500,000 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1954">), or a total net saving of $1,987,200 (approximately $2 million) over 4 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1955">$ 1,987,200 $ 2,000,000 (e) Net expenditure by North East Equity $ (1,381,030) $ (1,328,230) approx $1.3 million 
 
 
 

386 The above calculation mixed the costs in (a) for a 5 year lease, with only 4 years worth of savings in (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1956">The new line had been retained beyond the 4 year period and there was no evidence that North East Equity intended to bring the lease to an end before the expiry of the 5 year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1957">In that situation, I consider that credit should be given for the savings over the whole 5 year term of the lease not for only 4 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1958">I have rejected the claim that any representation was made to the effect that North East Equity's power costs would be less if the new line were acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1959">387 Accordingly, that amount should be excluded from the calculation leaving, on North East Equity's basis for its claim a net saving of $586,500 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1960">or $2,932,500 for 5 (not 4) years resulting in a net loss, on this hypothesis of $435,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1961">However, I find that the saving was not less than 34cents per carton (that is the labour costs per carton of the new line were at the lower end of Mr Tana's range, namely 86cents each).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1962">Using the same packing rate, that produces a saving of $664,700 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1963">or $3,323,500 for the 5 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1964">This would result in a loss of $44,730 on the above assumptions, as set out in the table below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1965">(a) Total cost to North East Equity of new line $ (4,328,230) (b) Add the current value of the new line $ 960,000 (c) Add back savings on labour costs &#8226; based on a period of 5 years; &#8226; assuming savings per carton reduced by 34cents to 86cents per carton, using same packing rate as above; &#8226; 0.34 x 1,955,000 = $664,700 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1966">resulting savings, or a total net savings of $3,323,500 for 5 years &#8226; Not accepting that additional power costs were incurred $ 3,323,500 (d) Net expenditure by North East Equity $ (44,730) 
 
 
 

388 If such a small loss were incurred, it would not accord with commonsense for North East Equity not to have gone ahead with acquiring the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1967">In assessing what Mr Tana (as the controlling mind of North East Equity) would have done, it is important to exclude from consideration the subsequent impacts of the fall in the market and the production problems with the farms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1968">Mr Tana was optimistic in 2002 that demand for carrots would increase, so that the labour savings he expected would have been greater, the more carrots were processed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1969">A reasonable business person in the position of Mr Tana and, I infer he too, would have replaced the inefficient old plant with the more efficient new line which gave the actual savings referred to above with the prospect of even greater ones in light of the expectation of greater demand and the significant reduction in future labour costs: Gull v Saunders &amp; Stuart [1913] HCA 55 ; (1913) 17 CLR 82 at 89 per Barton ACJ, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ approving British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co Ltd v Underground Electric Railways of London Co Ltd [1912] AC 673: cf at 689-691 per Viscount Haldane LC esp at 691 where the Lord Chancellor referred to replacing obsolete machines with up to date ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1970">389 There is a further difficulty with North East Equity's analysis because it relied, as the value of the new line, on the figure of $960,000 given by Jonathan Gregson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1971">Mr Gregson had no formal qualifications as a valuer, but was a very experienced auctioneer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1972">He had no experience in selling equipment of the kind in new line, other than selling other equipment belonging to North East Equity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1973">First, Mr Gregson gave that figure in respect of the new line as at May 2007, not at the time of its acquisition or installation four years earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1974">The figure affords no proper basis on which to compare the amount paid in early 2003 with the true value at that time of what was acquired: HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640 at 656-659 [34]-[40] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1975">Secondly, Mr Gregson was not able to offer an opinion in his expert report on the new line's value when it was acquired, saying only that this assessment was 'difficult'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1976">He had tried to enquire of Mr Proud and Bruynooghe about a value which he could consider for his report, but desisted after he learned of their involvement in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1977">Nor did another equipment dealer of whom he enquired give him any assistance in placing a value on the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1978">390 Here, the subsequent fall in the carrot market may have been an independent or extrinsic cause affecting Mr Gregson's perception in 2007 of what the new line might then realise at auction based on his experience with selling North East Equity's equipment subsequent to early 2003: HTW Valuers 217 CLR at 659 [40].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1979">If the market for carrots were higher, rather than lower, a processing plant offering substantial savings in labour costs would be likely to be more attractive to potential purchasers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1980">Instead, by 2007 the market falls had driven some of North East Equity's competitors out of business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1981">391 This analysis shows that, even if North East Equity had proved that Proud Machinery and/or Mr Proud had contravened ss 52 and or 53 (c) of the Trade Practices Act and/or been negligent in one, or even all, of the respects it had alleged, it would not have established that the contravention(s) or breach(es) of duty had caused it to suffer any loss or damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1982">This is because, first, there is no evidence that the new line, as installed, was worth less than was paid for it (except, perhaps the &#8364;60,000 I have found it would have cost to replace the flume elevators and $10,000 for the disruption caused) and, secondly, even if it were, that difference was greater than the savings North East Equity achieved by operating the new line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1983">392 I do not accept that Mr Gregson's appraisal of the auction price realisable for the new line in May 2007 provides any reasonable basis on which to arrive at its value in March 2003 when it was brand new.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1984">A willing but not anxious purchaser, and a willing but not anxious vendor, would agree on a different and substantially higher price for brand new plant and equipment than for plant and equipment which had been used to process about four years worth of production at the levels shown on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1985">The wear and tear of four years' use would create a substantial difference between the value when new (even if it were less than the price paid to Proud Machinery) and the value of the plant and equipment as seen by Mr Gregson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1986">393 If the new line, in March 2003, were worth even half of the price payable to Proud Machinery of $3,000,000 (excluding the sum due to Steventon Lodge) then, using North East Equity's methodology for assessing its damages, it would not have suffered any loss:
 (a) Total cost to North East Equity of new line $ (4,328,230) (b) Add the current value of the new line (Assuming equal to half of price payable to Proud Machinery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1987">) $ 1,500,000 (c) Add back North East Equity's savings on labour costs: &#8226; based on a period of 5 years; &#8226; assuming savings per carton reduced by 34cents to 86cents per carton, resulting in labour savings of $664,700 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1988">as shown above; &#8226; subtract from this figure additional power costs of $89,700 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1989">that North East Equity claimed were incurred; &#8226; net saving of $664,700 - $89,700 = $575,000 p.a.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1990">or a total of $2,875,000 over 5 years $ 2,875,000 (d) Net gain by North East Equity $ 46,770 

 
394 In my opinion, the value of the new line at March 2003 was likely to be substantially more than $1,500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1991">So, this last calculation understates the net benefit which North East Equity would have obtained, notwithstanding the assumption that it had proved all of its claims of misrepresentations and breaches of duty under the Trade Practices Act and in tort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1992">The fact that North East Equity chose to move most of its packing operations in October 2007 from Wattleup is not relevant to the application of the methodology suggested by it, since it has claimed the cost of leasing up until May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1993">Had it continued to use the new line, it would not have been worse off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1994">Its decision to change its operations should be viewed in the same way that the decision to buy new turbines in British Westinghouse [1912] AC at 691 was viewed; namely, that the decision to centre operations at Lancelin was commercially sensible and would enable North East Equity to eliminate unnecessary road transport costs, including for transport of rejects and waste.</sentence>

<sentence id="s2000">I will allow the parties to consider these reasons and address the question of the final orders which ought to be made.</sentence>
