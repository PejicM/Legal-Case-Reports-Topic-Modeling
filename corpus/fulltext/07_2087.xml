<sentence id="s1">
 
2 Section 7 of the Income Tax Act 1986 (Cth) levied the income tax imposed by s 5(1) as follows:
 
 
 '7.</sentence>

<sentence id="s3">' 
 


 
3 Under s 12(1) of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 (Cth) the relevant rates of tax were as set out in schedule 7 to that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">That schedule has been amended to record the prevailing rates from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 At all material times s 166 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act') has made provision for the Commissioner to make assessments of the amount of the taxable income of a taxpayer and of the tax payable thereon and s 174 has made provision for the Commissioner to serve notices of assessment in writing upon persons liable to pay the tax the subject of the assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">5 Section 177(1) of the Assessment Act provided for notices of assessment to have a conclusive evidentiary character both in respect of the due making of the assessment and that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Section 177(1) provided:
 
 
 
 '177(1) The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, shall be conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">' 
 
 
 

6 The present proceedings are not proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">7 In McAndrew v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 62 ; (1956) 98 CLR 263 ('McAndrew') at 280-282 Taylor J said of s 177(1):
 
 '...</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The purpose of that sub-section [s 177(1)] , is, subject to an important qualification, to make the production of a notice of assessment in judicial proceedings conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The qualification is that upon proceedings on appeal against the assessment, the production of the assessment does not constitute conclusive evidence that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It will be seen that the sub-section contains two limbs and that the second limb applies only in proceedings which are not appeals of the character specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In all other proceedings both limbs apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">But although doubts may exist as to what is comprised in each limb, the existence of these doubts in no way requires a modification of the view previously expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 ... 
 
 There seems no doubt that s.177(1) was intended to make it impossible for a taxpayer, in proceedings other than appeal against it, to challenge an assessment on any ground and, accordingly, there is every reason for thinking that the second limb in s.177(1) covers all grounds upon which an assessment may be challenged other than those covered by the first limb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In my view s.170(1) (sic) should be understood as precluding a taxpayer in proceedings other than an appeal (or a reference [now a review] ) under the Act from challenging an assessment on any ground.</sentence>

<sentence id="s19">Bloemen Proprietary Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360 at 375 Mason and Wilson JJ cited with approval the observations of Taylor J in McAndrew .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 In Webb v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2 ) (1993) 47 FCR 394 at 400 Hill J said:
 
 '... the giving to the taxpayer of a notice which stipulates the taxable income and the tax payable referable to that taxable income in the year (a positive figure) will be a notice of assessment attracting the provisions of the objection and appeals procedure and s 177.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">' 


 
His Honour then continued at 400-401 by saying:
 
 'My view is consistent with the decision of Hunt J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Clyne (1982) 60 FLR 45 and that of Enderby J in Commonwealth v Opiel (1986) 86 ATC 5,013.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The former case is not greatly different from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In that case Mr Clyne, who had received a notice of assessment showing a credit for provisional tax, sought to argue that the giving of that credit constituted an admission by the Commissioner that payment had been made for that amount or that a claim was no longer made in respect of that amount, or alternatively that the provisions of s 177 rendered there conclusive evidence that the amount was no longer claimed by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">This somewhat audacious argument was rejected by Hunt J who regarded the particulars of assessment referred to in s 177 of the Act as constituting merely the two ingredients taxable income and the tax assessed with respect to that taxable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The other material on the notice, including the credit, were, his Honour thought, particulars of the notice but not particulars of the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The decision of Hunt J was followed by Enderby J in Opiel in holding that details of a refund stated in the assessment to be due to a taxpayer did not attract the conclusive evidentiary protection of s 177.</sentence>

<sentence id="s28">10 To facilitate the recovery of income tax a system prevailed until 30 June 2000 under which employees were required to pay tax on their salary or wages income progressively as they earned it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The tax was paid through a tax instalment deduction system which employers were obliged to implement (the Pay-As-You-Earn or PAYE system) under the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 Traditionally, a Group Certificate was issued to an employee at the end of a given financial year and lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') with the employee's income tax return so as to enable a credit to be claimed for the amount deducted by way of income tax under the PAYE system and remitted by the employer to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Such Group Certificates were signed by an authorised person on behalf of the 'Employer' and recorded, amongst other things, the 'Tax Instalments Deducted' in respect of the relevant 'Employee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">12 As from 1 July 2000 a New Tax System (the Pay-As-You-Go or PAYG system) was put in place under which a payer was required to withhold amounts from salaries and wages paid to a payee which were then to be remitted by the payer to the Commissioner (see s 3AA of the Administration Act and Schedule 1 thereto) and the payee became entitled to a credit against his tax debts for the amounts collected under the new system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Under the new system a 'PAYG payment summary --- individual non-business' was issued by the payer to the relevant payee at the end of the financial year, in lieu of a Group Certificate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Such PAYG payment summaries were signed by an authorised person on behalf of the 'Payer' and recorded, amongst other things, the 'Total tax withheld' in respect of the relevant 'Payee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">They were then affixed by a taxpayer to his relevant income tax return to enable a credit to be claimed for the amount withheld by way of income tax under the PAYG system and remitted by the employer to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">13 Generally speaking all resident individuals were required to lodge annual income tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Such returns were normally required to be lodged within four months after the end of the relevant financial year with the opportunity in some instances for returns to be lodged during the ensuing six months or so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">14 This case is concerned with a taxpayer who claimed credits for amounts of tax said to have been deducted under the PAYE system or withheld under the PAYG system by a company of which he was a director where Group Certificates or PAYG Payment Summaries were said to have been issued to him by that company, but where no tax was ever remitted by the company in question or any other companies to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">15 The taxpayer, who is the applicant in these proceedings, did not lodge income tax returns for any of the eight years ended 30 June 1996, 30 June 1997, 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999, 30 June 2000, 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 until well after the times prescribed for doing so had expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It would appear that returns for each of the eight years in question were forwarded to the Australian Taxation Office under cover of a letter dated 19 September 2005 from the applicant's tax agent, Gertos Savell Katos, on about 30 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It is necessary to record certain information in relation to the 8 returns seriatim as follows:

<sentence id="s44">The Group Certificate suggested that in the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 the applicant had been paid $76,804 by way of salary, wages, etc and that tax instalments deducted from that income had totalled $31,252.00.</sentence>

 &#8226; A number of anomalies were discovered in the group certificates and payment summaries.</sentence>

 &#8226; The 1998, 1999 and 2000 Group Certificates issued showed the employer as Clean Fast Pty Ltd, where in fact it was Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd.

 Why have we made this decision: 
 The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) provisions are contained in Division 2 of Part VI of Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 Section 221H(2) of ITAA 1936 states: 
 
 Entitlement to credit --- deductions by employer 
 If: 
 
 (a) an employer has made any deductions in respect of an employee under this Division during a year of income, and 
 (b) an assessment has been made of the tax payable, or the Commissioner is satisfied that no tax is payable, by the employee in relation to the year of income; the employee is entitled to a credit equal to the sum of the deductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 "Deduction" means a deduction under section 221C or section 221D from the salary or wages of an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 Under section 221H(2) an employee is entitled to a credit equal to the amount of deduction made from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">If it can be established that an entity did not actually "deduct" an amount under section 221C or 221D, the employee would not be entitled to a credit for any amount under section 221H(2) of ITAA 1936.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 Application of the law to your circumstances 
 You lodged your income tax returns for the years ending 30 June 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 on 30 September 2005 and claimed PAYE credits of $31,252, $32,448, $33,592 and $34,476 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">During this time, you were a director of CP Agents Pty Ltd (CP) and Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd (CF).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Therefore, you were not in an arms length relationship to your employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 We requested from you the employer copies of your group certificates for the years ending 30 June 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Other than the employee copies of your group certificate for 1996 --- 2000, you have not provided any evidence to support your contention that PAYE was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 
 In any case, the issue of a group certificate is not conclusive evidence that PAYE deductions have been made from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to deduct and remit the amounts of PAYE deductions during the years ending 30 June 1996 --- 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">
 
 Therefore, we will exclude the PAYE credits returned in your income tax returns for the years ending 30 June 1996 and 1998 --- 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">
 
 Penalty 
 In relation to the 2000 and earlier Income years penalties are imposed on tax shortfall amounts ... .</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Only certain credits are taken into account in determining a tax shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Tax Instalment deductions are not credits that are included in the calculation of a tax shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 Accordingly no penalty can be imposed on the over-claiming of tax instalment deductions in the years ending 30 June 1996 and 1998-2000.</sentence>

<sentence id="s116">He responded on the 30 November 2005; however, he enclosed the payee copies of the above accompanied with a letter dated 24 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 
 On 25 November 2005, we contacted your tax agent by phone and advised we received his letter and supporting documentation we requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Upon reviewing the information sent, we found the payee and not the payer copies (as requested) were received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Your tax agent advised that this is all the information they have on file for you and the companies, as all the other information is with the liquidator, as the company was under external administration and had a controller appointed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">He advised he would contact me and provide the liquidator's details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">
 
 On 6 December 2005, your tax agent contacted our office and provided us with the liquidator's contact details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The same day, we contacted the liquidator's office by phone and left a message with his assistant --- with our contact details and to return my call requesting:

<sentence id="s133">Thus, he assumes that none of the above have been lodged, sent and paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 
 Following this call, we contacted your tax agent on two further occasions regarding the requests made above with the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">On 6 March 2006, your tax agent returned my call and advised he will contact the liquidator regarding the file/information he has on yourself and your entities.</sentence>

 Why have we made this decision: 
 
 [The material under this heading is the same as that appearing in the corresponding document referred to at [11] above, albeit later in point of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">]
 
 
 Application of the law to your circumstances 
 You lodged your income tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997 on 30 September 2005 and declared gross salary and wages $79,508 and claimed PAYE credit of $33,436.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">During this time, you were a director of "CP" Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Therefore, you were not in an arms length relationship to your employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">
 
 In November 2005, we contacted your tax agent and requested copy of your Group Certificate for the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">On 30 November 2005, we received a response from your tax agent who provided a payee copy of the 1997 Group Certificate and Payment Summaries for the years ended 30 June 2001 to 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 We contacted your tax agent by phone on 1 December 2005 requesting payer copies of the above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">He was unable to assist us, as all the information was with the liquidator, so on 6 December 2005 we contacted the liquidator's office by phone requesting the above and asking for evidence that PAYE was withheld (sic) from payments of salary and wages paid to you for the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The liquidator advised at a later date that after searching through the archived files, none of the requested information could be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 
 Other than the payee copies of your group certificate for 1997 and payment summaries for 2001 --- 2003 years, you have not provided any other evidence to support your contention that PAYE was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">
 
 The issue of a group certificate is not conclusive evidence that PAYE deductions have been deducted from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to deduct and remit the amounts of PAYE deductions during the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Thus, we are unable to verify that the amounts claimed have actually been deducted (sic) from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">
 
 Therefore, we will exclude the PAYE credit returned in your income tax return for the years ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">
 
 The Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding provisions are contained in Part 2-5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ("TAA").</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">
 
 Section 18 - 15 of Schedule 1 to the TAA provides: 
 
 18-15 Tax credit for recipient of withholding payments 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A person is entitled to a credit equal to the total of the *amounts withheld from *withholding payments made to a person during an income year if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) an assessment has been made of the income tax payable by the person for the income year, or 
 (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that no income tax is payable by the person for the income year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 
 
 Amount withheld is defined in section 995-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ("ITAA 1997").</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">An amount withheld by an entity from a withholding payment means: 
 
 
 (a) an amount that the entity withheld from a payment under Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 An amount withheld by an entity from a withholding payment includes amounts withheld under a withholding variation upwards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">These variations are effected under the withholding declaration process set out in section 15 -50 of the PAYG provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The effect of this provision is that the amounts withheld under a variation upwards become amounts "required to be withheld" under Division 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">
 
 Withholding payment is also defined in section 995- 1 of the ITAA 1997 to mean: 
 
 
 (a) a payment from which an amount must be withheld under Division 12 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (even if the amount is not withheld); or 
 (b) an alienated personal services payment in respect of which Division 13 in that Schedule requires an amount to be paid to the Commissioner; or 
 (c) a non-cash benefit in respect of which Division 14 in that Schedule requires an amount to be paid to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">
 
 
 An amount withheld from a payment to an employee or a company director is an amount withheld under section 12-35 and section 12-40 of Schedule 1 to the TAA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Under section 18-15 of Schedule 1 to the TAA , a payee is entitled to a credit equal to the amount withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">If it can be established that an entity did not actually "withhold" an amount from a payment of remuneration to an employee or company director under section 12-35 or section 12-40 of Schedule 1 to the TAA , the payee would not be entitled to a credit for any amount under section 18-15 of Schedule 1 to the TAA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">Application of the law to your circumstances 
 
 You lodged your income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2003 on September 2005 and declared gross salary and wages of $92,092, $101,296 and $101,400, and claimed pay as you go withholding credits of $44,668, $49,140 and $49,179 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">During this time you were a director of "CF" Pty Ltd. You were not in an arms length relationship to your employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">
 
 In November 2005, we contacted your tax agent and requested copies of your Payment Summaries for the years ended 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">On 30 November 2005, we received a response from your tax agent who provided payee copies of the Payment Summaries for the years requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 
 We contacted your tax agent by phone on 1 December 2005 requesting payer copies of the above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">As he was unable to assist us, as all the information was with the liquidator, on 6 December 2005 we contacted the liquidator's office by phone requesting the above and asking for evidence that PAYGW was withheld from payments of salary and wages paid to you during the years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">
 
 You have not provided any other evidence to support your contention that PAYGW was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">
 
 The issue of a Payment Summary solely is not conclusive evidence that PAYGW has been deducted (sic) from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to report and remit the amounts of PAYGW during the years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Hence, we are unable to verify that the amounts claimed have actually been deducted (sic) from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">
 
 Therefore, we will exclude the PAYGW returned in your income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 
 Penalty Year ended 30 June 1997 
 
 In relation to the 2000 and earlier income years, penalties are imposed on tax shortfall amounts under Part VII of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITM 1936).</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">A tax shortfall is defined in section 222A of the ITAA 1936 and broadly means the difference between the tax properly payable by the taxpayer and the tax that would have been payable if it were assessed on the basis of the taxpayer's return for the year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">
 
 Only certain credits are taken into account in determining a tax shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Tax instalment deductions are not credits that are included in the calculation of a tax shortfall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">
 
 Accordingly, no penalty can be imposed on the over-claiming of tax instalment deductions in the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 
 Tax Shortfall Penalty --- Years ended 30 June 2001 to 2003 
 Under section 28475 (sic) of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA 1953), an administrative penalty can be imposed where: 
 
 
 &#8226; you or your agent make a false or misleading statement, and 
 &#8226; the statement results in a shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 
 
 
 A false or misleading statement can result, for example, if you omit assessable income from your tax return, or if you over-claim a tax deduction, tax offset, credit or payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">
 
 This false or misleading statement must result in a shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 Under Item 2 of sub-section 284-80(1) of the TM 1953, you can have a shortfall amount if: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; the Commissioner must pay or credit an amount to you under a taxation law; 
 &#8226; this amount is worked out on the basis of a statement made by you or your agent; and 
 &#8226; this amount is more than it would be if you or your agent had not made a false or misleading statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 
 
 
 Under section 18-15 of Schedule 1to (sic) the TM 1953, you are entitled to a credit equal to the amount withheld from your withholding payments for an income year after 1 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Withholding payments include payments of salary to an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Therefore, where you or your agent makes a false or misleading statement in regard to this credit, you can have a tax shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 Where a false or misleading statement has been made, the shortfall amount is the difference between: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; the amount the Commissioner must pay or credit to you worked out on the basis of the statement; and 
 &#8226; what the credit or payment would have been if the false or misleading statement had not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 
 
 
 In your 2001 taxation return, you over claimed your credit for PAYG withheld by $44,668.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Therefore, you have a shortfall amount for the 2001 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">
 
 In your 2002 taxation return, you over claimed your credit for PAYG withheld by $49,140.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Therefore, you have a shortfall amount for the 2002 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 In your 2003 taxation return, you over claimed your credit for PAYG withheld by $49,179.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Therefore, you have a shortfall amount for the 2003 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 Reasonable care 
 
 Where this shortfall amount results from a failure by you or your agent to take reasonable care to comply with a taxation law, a penalty can be applied at the rate of 25% of the shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">
 
 The reasonable care standard is discussed in the Taxation Ruling TR 94/4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">As noted at paragraph 8 of the Ruling, the reasonable care test requires you to take the care that a reasonable, ordinary person would take in your circumstances to fulfill your tax obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
 
 Where you have tried your best to lodge a correct return --- having regard to your experience, education, skill and other relevant circumstances --- you will not be liable to pay a penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 
 You do not meet the reasonable care standard simply by using the services of a tax agent or tax advisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Your agent must also take reasonable care in preparing your taxation return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">
 
 Application to your circumstances 
 
 We consider that you or your tax agent did not take reasonable care in declaring your salary and wage income and claiming your PAYE &amp; PAYG withholding credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">We have made this decision based on the following factors: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; it is your responsibility to lodge a tax return that is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">
 &#8226; you were a director of "CF" Pty Ltd during the years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">
 &#8226; as a director you have a responsibility to deduct, report and remit PAYGW from salary and wages to the Commissioner, and 
 &#8226; you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support that PAYGW included in your income tax return was deducted from payments made to you by "CF" Pty Ltd. 
 
 
 
 Therefore, as we consider that you did not take reasonable care in the preparation of your 2001 to 2003 taxation returns, the base penalty will be imposed on your shortfall amount for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 years at the rate of 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">
 
 Reasonably arguable position 
 
 Where a shortfall amount exceeds the greater of $10,000 or 1% of your tax payable, a different penalty provision can apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This penalty can apply where your shortfall amount results from you applying a tax law to a matter or identical matters in a way which is not 'reasonably arguable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">' 
 
 In your income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001 to 2003, you claimed PAYG withholding credits (from salary and wages) which your company has not remitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">As PAYG withholding credit was overstated - $44,668, $49,140 and $49,179 respectively, the shortfall amount is more than the greater of $10,000 or 1% of the income tax payable by you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 We consider that you do not have a reasonably arguable position in regard to the application of the law to the over-claimed credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">We have made this decision based on the following: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; as a director of "CF" Pty Ltd, you were fully aware that the credit did not exist, 
 
 
 
 Therefore, you are liable for a base penalty of 25% of your shortfall amount resulting from the overstated PAYG withholding credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 
 Base Penalty 
 
 Where one or more base penalty amounts arises in relation to the same shortfall amount, and the two base penalty amounts are the same, then that is the base penalty which will apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 
 As the base penalty amounts for lack of reasonable care and not having a reasonably arguable position are both 25%, base penalty will be imposed on your shortfall amount on your shortfall amount resulted (sic) from the overstated PAYG withholding credit for the years ended 30 June 2001 to 2003 at the rate of 25%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">
 
 Remission of penalty 
 
 Under section 298-20 of Schedule 1 to the TAA 1953, the Commissioner of Taxation may remit all or part of a penalty imposed on a shortfall amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Taxation Ruling TR 94/7 provides guidelines as to when this discretion may be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Ruling states that the discretion to remit tax penalty should be exercised in only those exceptional cases where, having regard to all the circumstances, the application of penalty would provide a clearly unreasonable or unjust result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 
 We have considered all the facts and circumstances concerning your over-claimed credit for tax deducted and tax withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Based on the guidelines in TR94/7, we do not consider that the application of penalty in your case would provide an unreasonable or unjust result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">
 
 Therefore, the penalty imposed on your shortfall amounts (for the 2001 --- 2003 years) will not be remitted.</sentence>

<sentence id="s332">26 By s 221C(1A) of the Assessment Act employers were to make deductions under the PAYE system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Section 221C(1A) relevantly provided:
 
 
 
 '221C(1A) Where an employer pays to an employee salary or wages [before 1 July 2000], the employer shall, at the time of paying the salary or wages, make a deduction from the salary or wages at such rate (if any) prescribed in accordance with subsection (1) as is applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">...' 
 
 


(The words in square brackets were introduced into the Assessment Act effective 22 December 1999)
 
27 At all material times the Assessment Act has made provision for the payment to the Commissioner of amounts deducted by employers from salaries or wages paid to employees in accordance with s 221C(1A) of the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Until 30 June 1998 the relevant obligation to remit the amounts deducted to the Commissioner was to be found in s 221F of the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In respect of the period 1 July 1998 --- 30 June 2000 the relevant obligation was to be found in Division 1AAA of Part VI of the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Needless to say, strict time limits were imposed upon employers to make payments of amounts deducted from the salaries or wages of employees in accordance with s 221C(1A) of the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">28 In relation to the PAYG system, corresponding provisions required employers as 'entities' (see s 960-100 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth)) to withhold amounts from salaries and wages paid to individuals as employees (see section 12 - 35 and 15-10 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">29 A corresponding provision in respect of the remittal of amounts withheld under the PAYG system to the Commissioner was to be found in section 16-70 et seq of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Once again there were strict time limits imposed within which amounts that had been withheld were to be paid to the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">30 Under section 16-20 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act an entity that withheld amounts as required by Division 12 of Schedule 1 from the salary or wages of an employee was discharged from 'all liability to pay or account for that amount to any entity except the Commissioner'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">31 There was no comparable provision to that contained in section 16-20 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act in the Assessment Act in respect of deductions made by an employer from the salary or wages of an employee as required by s 221C(1A) of the Assessment Act under the PAYE system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">32 At no material time was there a requirement that employers retain amounts deducted or withheld under the PAYE system or the PAYG system in some identifiable form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Although the provisions of the relevant legislation assumed that the relevant employer would have sufficient funds to pay the Commissioner the amount of the deductions or amounts withheld as required, the employer was never obliged to pay those amounts into a trust account or any other separate bank account or to deal with them in a way which separated those amounts from its other monies (see per Ormiston J in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sargon (1985) 85 ATC 4206 at 4209).</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">33 In respect of the audits of the applicant's claim for credit in respect of PAYE tax instalment deductions referred to in his tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997 and his claims for PAYG withholding credits as referred to in his tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003, the letters initiating them were two letters from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to the applicant dated 17 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The letter in respect of the year ended 30 June 1997 included the following:

43 In a facsimile sent on 1 November 2006 to the Australian Taxation Office by Mr Tsoukatos of Gertos Savell Katos, the applicant's tax agents, he said:
 
 'Further to our telephone conversation today, we confirm that we are in receipt of your letters dated 28 September 2006 that relate to the income tax audit of Mr Perdikaris for the years 1996 to 2003 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">
 
 We note that the letters had specified a past due date for the return of any additional information to substantiate the taxpayer's withholding credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">
 
 The process of sourcing this additional information is a lengthy process, given the age of the records, access to archives and access to records held by the liquidator of the taxpayer's former employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">
 
 This is an onerous task that cannot be completed by the due dates imposed in your letters, and for this reason, we respectfully request that you defer the issue of any assessments, allowing the taxpayer sufficient time to table the substantiating records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">We trust that the taxpayer will have additional information provided to you on or before 10 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">
 ...' 
 

44 By a letter dated 10 November 2006 to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, the applicant's tax agents said in respect of the applicant:
 
 'We refer to the Income Tax Returns lodged for the years ending 30 June 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 wherein the Taxpayer claimed credits pursuant to PAYG amounts withheld (sic) from his salary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">
 
 We understand the basis to defer assessment of the Income Tax Returns lodged was that there was no evidence that the relevant employer had set aside payments for services having the character of wages and salaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">
 
 It is submitted that the relevant issue at law is whether the characterisation of the payments received by the Taxpayer is in consideration for services provided by the Taxpayer in his capacity as an employee .</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">
 
 The following documents are submitted in support of the claim that the Taxpayer received or was entitled to receive payments in his capacity as an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">
 
 a) Duty Statement 
 b) Inchoate Group Certificates and PAYG Payment summaries 
 ...' 
 
 (Emphasis added)
 

No 'additional information to substantiate the taxpayer's withholding credits' was forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">45 The evidence does not sheet home any responsibility whatsoever to the Australian Taxation Office for any understanding that the applicant's tax agents may have had in relation to the deferral of assessment of the applicant's income tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">46 Notwithstanding the identification of the applicant's employer as Clean Fast Pty Limited in each of the applicant's tax returns for the years ending 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000, the applicant's tax agents, who prepared those returns, said in their letter to the respondent of 10 November 2006:
 
 '1998, 1999 and 2000 Group Certificates were issued showing the employer as Clean Fast Pty Ltd ACN 062 002 019.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">It is observed that the identity of the employer was in fact Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd ACN 078 361 369.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">
 
 This error was made presumably by a member of the staff of Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd ACN 078 361 369, who appears to have copied the ACN of the former employer, probably believing that a name change had occurred and not the creation of a new company that was made on the 29/04/1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">' 


 
No errant 'member of the staff of Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd ACN 078 361 369' provided any evidence to the Deputy Commissioner to support the applicant's tax agents' speculation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Furthermore, no Group Certificates issued by Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Limited ACN 078 361 369 in respect of salary or wages paid by that company to the applicant and deductions therefrom, were ever submitted to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">47 In respect of the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 the applicant's tax agents said in their letter of 10 November 2006:
 
 'It is observed in respect of these years that name of the employer is in error and that there is no ACN stated in the PAYG Payment Summary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">The correct name is Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd and the ACN is 078 361 369.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">' 
 

Once again it may be observed that no evidence was provided to the Deputy Commissioner to support the tax agents' assertion that there had been an error made in the preparation of the relevant PAYG payment summaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">No evidence was provided to the Deputy Commissioner by the 'authorised person' who issued the payment summaries on behalf of Clean Fast Pty Limited to establish that he or she had inadvertently referred to the wrong company when nominating Clean Fast Pty Limited as the relevant payer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">Furthermore, no evidence was provided to explain the omission by the relevant authorised person of the 'Payer's ABN or withholder payer number' from the relevant PAYG payment summaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">In addition, no PAYG payment summaries issued, if at all, by Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Limited ACN 078 361 369 in respect of tax withheld from salary or wages paid by that company to the applicant, were ever submitted to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">48 The so called 'Duty Statement' referred to in the tax agents' letter would appear to have been a document signed by the applicant and dated 9 November 2006 which relevantly provided as follows:
 
 '1, Chris Perdikaris ... hereby declare that I was employed by Clean Fast Pty Ltd (ACN 062 002 019) as a Working Director and General Manager during the period October 1993 to April 1997 and by Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Ltd (ACN 078 361 369) as a Working Director and General Manager during the period July 1997 to April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">
 ...' 
 

The declaration was silent in relation to, firstly, the making by Clean Fast Pty Limited of deductions from any salary or wages that may have been paid by it to the applicant in the years of income ended 30 June 1996 and 30 June 1997, secondly, the making by Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Limited of deductions from any salary or wages that may have been paid by that company to the applicant in the years of income ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000 and thirdly, the withholding of any amounts by Cleanfast Property Maintenance Agents Pty Limited from any salary or wages that may have been paid by it to the applicant in the years of income ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">49 Somewhat curiously, the applicant's income tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997, signed against the date 15 September 2005 and apparently lodged on 30 September 2005, was accompanied by one only Group Certificate which was purportedly issued on 9 August 1997 in respect of the whole of the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 and not just 1 July 1996 to April 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Furthermore, the assertion in the applicant's declaration of 9 November 2006 that his service was as a 'Working Director and General Manager' for the two different companies mentioned in the financial years ended 30 June 1997 and 30 June 1998 respectively, does not sit comfortably with his identification of himself in his tax return for the year ended 30 June 1997 as an 'administrative officer' of 'C P Agents Pty Limited' and in his return for the year ended 30 June 1998 as an 'administrative officer' of Clean Fast Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">50 On the applicant's own evidence the conclusion is inescapable that, in the eight relevant years of income, he derived assessable income as disclosed by him in the several returns which he lodged, declaring the information therein to be 'true and correct'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Whether he received the whole of his assessable income from his employment with whomsoever may have been his employer in cash or in some other form is irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">This case is only concerned with his entitlement to credits against his tax liability for deductions said to have been made or amounts said to have been withheld by his relevant employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">51 The applicant submitted that the respondent's 'decisions were that the particular amounts claimed to have been deducted [or withheld] were not deducted [or withheld]' i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">the decisions were 'that these amounts were in fact paid by the employer and received by the employee'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The applicant further submitted that the taxpayer's returns were not admissions that he received the gross amounts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">52 As previously explained (at [5]-[9]) the notices of assessment that are in evidence have a conclusive evidentiary character both in respect of the due making of the assessments and that the amounts and all the particulars of the assessments were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">53 The declarations by the applicant in the returns in question that he derived assessable income by way of salary or wages as an 'administrative officer' in the amounts of $76,804, $79,508, $79,404, $81,640, $83,720, $92,092, $101,296 and $101,400 in the respective years of income, cannot be disputed in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">A finding that the applicant derived the income which he said he derived and thus that his taxable income was as returned in each of the years of income, did not require the respondent to draw any inferences from any rejection of claims that amounts said to have been deducted or withheld by the applicant's employer from his salary or wages had in fact been deducted or withheld.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">54 Whilst it may be accepted, as the applicant submitted, that 'in general a false denial that a fact occurred does not provide evidence that it did occur' (per Clarke JA, with whom Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreed, in R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 241-2), here, there was 'evidence aliunde' to support the Commissioner's assessments (cf Edmunds v Edmunds and Ayscough (1935) VLR 177 at 186-7).</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">Furthermore, it was not necessary for the respondent to draw any inferences from circumstantial evidence to found her assessments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">55 The deduction of amounts under the PAYE system and the withholding of payments under the PAYG system are relevant to the discharge by a taxpayer of his or her liability to pay tax under a notice of assessment, not to the making of the assessment of the amount of a taxpayer's taxable income and of the tax payable thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">56 The applicant effectively argues that the respondent can't accept that the taxpayer derived the assessable income by way of salary or wages, which he declared that he had derived, unless the respondent also accepted that the company said to have paid that salary or wages, deducted or withheld the amounts said to have been deducted in the relevant group certificates/payment summaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">57 Putting it another way, the applicant submits that, if the respondent accepts that the taxpayer derived the assessable income by way of salary and wages which he said that he derived in a given tax return, then the respondent must accept that the company whose group certificate/payment summary was attached to that return, as lodged, in fact deducted/withheld the amounts said to have been deducted/withheld from the relevant salary or wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">58 Whether these propositions bear analysis or not will depend in part on the utility of placing reliance upon:
 
&#8226; group certificates/payment summaries attached to income tax returns which were lodged out of time by 2 --- 9 years, the relevant company issuing same having been wound up 8 years previously and deregistered six months' previously;
 
&#8226; a group certificate issued in the name of a company which name the company did not assume until 9 months after the relevant group certificate was said to have been issued;
 
&#8226; group certificates/payment summaries issued in the name of a company which that company ceased to have for up to seven years previously;
 
&#8226; group certificates/payment summaries issued by a company which had been in liquidation for 1 --- 6 years at the time of the issue thereof;
 
&#8226; group certificates/payment summaries said to have been issued by a company which the applicant has since said was not his employer for 6 out of the 8 relevant years of income, notwithstanding that for 3 out of those 6 years the applicant specifically named the company in question as his employer in his income tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">59 The relevant background facts having been stated, attention should now be given to the circumstances in which a taxpayer is entitled to a credit in respect of tax that is payable by him, by reference to deductions he believed that his employer may have made from his salary or wages under the PAYE system or to amounts he believed that his employer may have withheld from his salary or wages under the PAYG system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">60 In respect of the eight tax years presently under consideration there were three different statutory regimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">The relevant provisions for the years ended 30 June 1996, 30 June 1997, 30 June 1998 and 30 June 1999 were to be found in the Assessment Act, as were the relevant provisions for the year ended 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">In respect of the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 the relevant provisions were to be found in the Administration Act.</sentence>

 The Application 
 
64 Following the institution of proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in 2006 ( Perdikaris v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation SYG 3824 of 2006) leave was granted to the applicant to discontinue those proceedings noting an agreement between the parties dated 27 February 2007.</sentence>

69 It may be observed that in paragraphs 5-8 constitutional writ relief is sought in the alternative to the prayers for relief under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (the ' Judiciary Act ') the original jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia includes jurisdiction with respect to any matter in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth (see also ss 75(v) and 77 (1) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">70 The application for an order of review included a series of grounds, nos 3 and 5(a) of which were abandoned by the applicant on 24 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The remaining grounds were as follows:
 
 '1.The respondent misdirected herself in that the procedures required by law to be observed in connexion with the making of the decisions, or in connexion with the conduct, were not observed in that it was a condition of the power, or alternatively, was a legal requirement to be observed in exercising the power, to make the decisions to make or not make the credit, that before the decision is made the Commissioner must first have made an assessment of the tax payable by the applicant or must be satisfied that no tax is payable, and the respondent proceeded without first making an assessment of the tax payable and the respondent did not determine that she was satisfied that no tax was payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">
 
 2.The respondent misdirected herself in that she failed, in connexion with the making of the decision, or in connexion with the conduct, to ask herself and determine what were the assessable wages or salary of the applicant during the income years in question and whether the amounts of the credits claimed were or were not part of those assessable wages or salaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">
 ... 
 
 4.The respondent acted on no evidence in concluding that the applicant had received the amounts of the claimed PAYE and PAYG deductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">
 
 5.The respondent denied procedural fairness to the applicant in that the respondent in making the decision: 
 ... 
 
 (b)did not identify and call for comment by the applicant on the material evidence that the respondent proposed to take into account, so far as it was considered to be adverse to him; and 
 
 (c)did not identify the material issues in relation to the decisions or conduct, and did not call upon the applicant to address them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">
 
 6.The respondent took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely, that information available within the Tax Office that the employer company has not fulfilled its obligation to deduct and remit the amounts of PAYE deductions during the years ending 30 June, 1996-2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">

<sentence id="s499">
 
 8.The aforementioned grounds consequentially affected the respondent's determination (in relatin (sic) to the imposition of tax shortfall penalties) of the existence of shortfall amounts, false or misleading statements, want of reasonable care and want of a reasonably arguable position.</sentence>

 Jurisdiction 
 
71 On 5 April 2007 the respondent filed a 'Notice of Objection to Competency' which provided as follows:
 
 'The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of this Court to try this application to the extent that it seeks an order under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 on the grounds that: 
 
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">The application is incompetent because it seeks review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (the ADJR Act) of alleged decisions that are not "decisions to which this Act applies", as defined in s.3 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">The alleged "decisions" do not exhibit the criteria of a "reviewable decision": 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) as stated by Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; [1990] 170 CLR 321 at 337 in that the "decisions" are not decisions "for which provision is made by or under a statute" or decisions "which are final or operative or determinative, at least in a practical sense...", nor 
 
 (b) as stated by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; [2005] 221 CLR 99 at [89] , namely: 
 
 
 
 
 i. the decision(s) must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and 
 
 ii.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>

 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">The Respondent has not made reviewable decisions to which the ADJR Act applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">' 
 


 
72 Putting to one side whether any ground was established or whether any relief would be futile or should be refused on some other basis, the respondent conceded that the Court had jurisdiction to deal with the application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act (see Richard Walter ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">73 In relation to the prayers for relief under the ADJR Act the respondent submitted that the Court was without jurisdiction for the following reasons:
 
&#8226; 'No alleged decision of the respondent, referred to in these proceedings, was a "decision" to which the ADJR Act applies, as it had neither of the indicia of such a decision identified in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at [89].</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">".. See also Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 337..</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">Section 221H of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ("ITAA 36") does not "require or authorise" a decision (to use the language of Griffith University ) or provide for the making of a decision (to use the language of Bond ) that alters or affects legal rights or obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">It is section 221H itself that has that effect; not any decision made by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The fact that the respondent, as a practical matter, forms a view as to how that section applies to the applicant and acts upon that view does not mean that the respondent is making a "decision...under an enactment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The position is comparable with Century Yuasa Batteries Pty Ltd v FC of T (1997) 143 ALR 477 at 487 (lines 40-47).</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The respondent's point is not that the decision is excluded by Sched 1 of the ADJR Act (as to which see Coco v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 42 FCR 219;' (Footnotes omitted)
 
&#8226; 'Nor was it "conduct" to which section 6 of the ADJR Act applies, as it was not for the purpose of making any "decision" to which that Act applies;' 
 
&#8226; 'Equally, there cannot here be said to have been any failure to make a "decision" to which the ADJR Act applies, such as might be actionable under section 7 of that Act, because there was no relevant duty: The alleged "decision" which the applicant claims was not made was not one to which the ADJR applies --- see (a) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">' 
 
74 In Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [89]:
 
 
 '89 The determination of whether a decision is "made ... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">A decision will only be "made ... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">' 
 
 
 Inquiries 
 
75 The respondent's records revealed that C P Agents Pty Limited was not registered with the respondent as a group employer in respect of the years of income ended 30 June 1996 to 30 June 2000 or for any other years of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">76 The respondent's ATO matching system records indicated that the company with the ABN 29 078 361 369 did not report or pay any amounts for PAYG withholding to the respondent for any period subsequent to 1 July 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">77 After receiving a letter from the applicant's tax agents, Gertos Savell Katos, dated 24 November 2005, Mr Tomaras had a conversation with Mr Savell in which conversation to the following effect took place:
 
 
 Tomaras: 'We have received your letter and supporting documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">I have looked at the information you have sent me but you have sent the payee copies and not the payer copies of the relevant group certificate and payment summaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">' 
 
 Savell: 'This is all the information that I have on file for Mr Perdikaris and the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">All the other information in respect of the company is with the liquidator ...' 
 
 

78 On 27 February 2006 Christopher Darin said to Mr Tomaras 'I've searched through all the records for the companies and Mr Perdikaris for 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2003 years as to whether any group tax has been paid to the Tax Office but I can't find any documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">I assume that none of the documents have been sent to the ATO and no group tax has been paid'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">79 On 6 March 2006 Mr Tomaras had a further conversation with Mr Savell in which conversation to the following effect took place:
 
 
 Tomaras: 'I rang in relation to Mr Perdikaris' matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">I have spoken with the liquidator and he says he doesn't have any documents that give me any information or any proof that the PAYE tax for the year ended 1997 and the PAYG Withholding for the years ended 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2003 for the companies concerned has been paid to the Tax Office or document have been lodged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">' 
 
 Savell: 'We don't hold any documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">They should all be with the liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">I will contact the liquidator to see what he has got on file or what information he has in relation to Mr Perdikaris.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">I will also contact Mr Perdikaris to see whether he has any information or proof that PAYG Withholding or group tax has been paid by the companies that issued the payment summaries and group certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">I'll get back to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">' 
 
 
 Consideration 
 
80 It is clear that proper enquiries were made by the respondent of the applicant in relation to evidence that might have established that PAYE deductions had been made by the applicant's employer in respect of the applicant in relation to the years of income ended 30 June 1996, 30 June 1997, 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000, and further, that PAYG amounts had been withheld by the relevant payer from amounts paid to the applicant in respect of the years of income ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 (see the letters from the respondent to the applicant of 28 September 2006 and 17 March 2006 (two letters) referred to above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">81 It will be recalled that in her first-mentioned letter the respondent said:
 
 'In order that we can consider your claim for PAYE TIDs, please provide details of the amount of all salary and wages paid and PAYE TIDs deducted from such payments .... You should also provide any documentary evidence that is available to support your entitlement to PAYE TIDs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">
 ... 
 
 If you are unable to provide evidence that the salary and wages payments have been made and PAYE tax instalments deducted, then we may be unable to allow any PAYE TID credit claimed by you in your income tax returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">...' 


 
82 In the first letter of 17 March 2006 referred to above the respondent had said to the applicant:
 
 'We have no record of the company remitting PAYE TIDs or lodging a Reconciliation Statement in respect of group certificates for the period 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Therefore, we are unable to confirm if any PAYE TID credit is available for the employees of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">
 
 In order that we can consider your claim for PAYE TID credit, please provide details of the amount of all salary and wages paid and PAYE TIDs deducted from such payments during the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">You should also provide any documentary evidence that is available to support your entitlement to PAYE TID credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">
 ... 
 
 If you are unable to provide evidence that the salary and wages payments have been made and PAYE TIDs deducted, then we may be unable to allow any PAYE TID credit claimed by you in your income tax return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">' 
 

83 The second letter of 17 March 2006 the respondent had said to the applicant: 
 
 'We have no record of Business Activity Statements (BAS) or a Payment Summary Statement being lodged by the company for the income years 1 July 2001 till 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Therefore, we are unable to confirm if any PAYG Withholding credit is available for employees of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">
 
 In order that we can consider your claim for PAYG Withholding credit, please provide details of the amount of all salary and wages paid to you and PAYG Withholding deducted from such payments for the income years 30 June 2001 till 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">You should also provide any documentary evidence that is available to support your entitlement to PAYG Withholding credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">
 
 If you are unable to provide evidence that the PAYG Withholding has been deducted from your salary and wages payments, then we may be unable to allow the PAYG Withholding credit claimed by you in your income tax return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">...' 


 
84 The respondent's 'Reasons for Decision' forwarded to the applicant under cover of the respondent's letters dated 30 November 2006 and 28 September 2006 (two letters) make it clear that the paucity of relevant information in relation to the making of PAYE deductions and the withholding of PAYG payments, provided by the applicant, told against his claims for credits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">85 It will be recalled that the in the 'Reasons for Decision' accompanying the respondent's letter of 30 November 2006 the respondent said:
 
 'We requested from you the employer copies of your group certificates for the years ending 30 June 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Other than the employee copies of your group certificate for 1996 --- 2000, you have not provided any evidence to support your contention that PAYE was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">' 
 
 (Emphasis added) 


 
86 Similarly, in the respondent's 'Reasons for Decision' forwarded to the applicant under cover of the respondent's letters of 28 September 2006 the respondent said:
 
 'We contacted your tax agent by phone on 1 December 2005 requesting payer copies of the above [the applicant's group certificate for the year ended 30 June 1997] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">He was unable to assist us, as all the information was with the liquidator, so on 6 December 2005 we contacted the liquidator's office by phone requesting the above and asking for evidence that PAYE was withheld (sic) from payments of salary and wages paid to you for the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">... 
 
 Other than the payee copies of your group certificate for 1997 and payment summaries for 2001 --- 2003 years, you have not provided any other evidence to support your contention that PAYE was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">
 ... 
 
 We contacted your tax agent by phone on 1 December 2005 requesting payer copies of the above [the applicant's payment summaries for the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">He was unable to assist us, as all the information was with the liquidator, so on 6 December 2005 we contacted the liquidator's office by phone requesting the above and asking for evidence that PAYGW was withheld from payments of salary and wages paid to you during the years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">
 
 You have not provided any other evidence to support your contention that PAYGW was deducted from payments of salary and wages made to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">
 ...' 
 
 (Emphasis added) 


 
87 In the respondent's 'Reasons for Decision' forwarded under cover of her letter dated 30 November 2006 she also said:
 
 'Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to deduct and remit the amounts of PAYE deductions during the years ending 30 June 1996 --- 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">' 
 
 (Emphasis added)
 

88 I do not consider that, by using the expression 'deduct and remit', the respondent was asserting that the applicant's employer had failed to relevantly make PAYE deductions as required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Rather, the respondent was focussing upon the failure of the applicant's employer to discharge its remittal obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">A failure to remit will not, of itself, establish that there was a failure to make the requisite PAYE deductions, but a non-remittal will legitimately put into question whether deductions were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">89 Similarly, in the respondent's Reasons for Decision forwarded under cover of her letters of 28 September 2006 she said:
 
 'The issue of a group certificate is not conclusive evidence that PAYE deductions have been deducted from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to deduct and remit the amounts of PAYE deductions during the year ended 30 June 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">... 
 ... 
 
 The issue of a Payment Summary solely is not conclusive evidence that PAYGW has been deducted (sic) from payments of salary and wages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Information available within the Tax Office supports the conclusion that the company has not fulfilled its obligation to report and remit the amounts of PAYGW during the years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">' 
 
 (Emphasis added) 


 
90 Similar comments may be made in respect of these Reasons as were made in respect of the reasons previously considered at [88].</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">In relation to the three PAYG years, it may be observed that the respondent's reasons do not deal with the applicant's employer's obligation to 'withhold and remit' but rather, the payer's obligation to 'report and remit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">91 The fact that the respondent forwarded letters to the applicant dated 30 November 2006 and 28 September 2006 reporting upon its audits, before the eight notices of assessment were issued on 28 December 2006, is of no moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">92 Under the relevant legislation set out at [61] above the Commissioner was not obliged to credit any sum in payment or part payment of the relevant tax unless, firstly, the relevant employer had made PAYE deductions from which the sum of the deductions could be derived and, secondly, the Commissioner had assessed the amount of tax payable by the relevant employee, to the payment or part payment of which the sum of the deductions could be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">93 Plainly, until the relevant notices of assessment were issued, the occasion for the Commissioner to credit sums could not have arisen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">But this did not preclude the respondent from addressing, before the notices of assessment were issued, whether the relevant employer had 'made any deductions' in respect of the relevant employee in the years in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">94 Under the relevant legislation set out at [62] above, the respondent had no obligation to 'credit' any sums.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">The imperative 'must credit' was not employed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The legislation simply 'entitled' an employee to a credit equal to the sum of the deductions that had been made in respect of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">It was then for the Commissioner to credit the relevant sum of the deductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">95 Under the relevant legislation applicable to the PAYG regime, set out at [63] above, the imperative 'must credit' was not used to impose an obligation upon the Commissioner rather, the legislation simply 'entitled' an employee to a credit equal to the total of the amounts withheld by the relevant payer from payments made to the relevant employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">96 The obligatory crediting of the sums of the deductions in payment or part payment of the tax payable under an assessment, the entitlement of an employee to a credit equal to the sum of the deductions under the PAYE system and the entitlement of an employee to a credit equal to the total of the amounts withheld under the PAYG system did not form part of the assessment process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">They were matters which were consequential upon the making by the Commissioner of assessments of the employee's taxable income and of the tax payable thereon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">They were germane to the discharge by taxpayers, who had been employees in receipt of salaries or wages, of their tax liabilities, not to the determination of the relevant tax payable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">97 True it is that a determination that an employer has not made PAYE deductions or that a payer has not withheld PAYG amounts from payments made to an employee will negate any obligation on the Commissioner to credit the sum of the deductions in payment or part payment of the relevant tax or deny the entitlement of the employee to a credit equal to the sum of the deductions or the total of the PAYG amounts withheld, but such a determination will not constitute a decision made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">98 In my opinion, the determinations did not answer the description of being decisions made under an enactment in the requisite sense as explained by Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Griffith University v Tang (see [74] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">They did not, in my opinion, by themselves confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations and in that sense derive from the relevant enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">99 Were the respondent to bring recovery proceedings against the applicant, the applicant would not be precluded by the determinations from asserting that his employer had made the relevant PAYE deductions or withheld the relevant PAYG amounts, for which he contends.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">All that the determinations do is deny the applicant the credits which he contends the Commissioner must make or to which he submits that he has become entitled, unless and until he establishes, he carrying the onus of proof, that his employer made the deductions or withheld the payments as claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">100 Nothing that was said by Adams J in Laurent v The Law Society of New South Wales [2000] NSWSC 1103 ('Laurent') assists the applicant in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">In Laurent the plaintiffs sought to set aside a decision of the Council of the Law Society of New South Wales in relation to a claim made against the Solicitors' Fidelity Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Section 80 of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) ('the Legal Profession Act ') made provision for claims against the Fidelity Fund to be made in writing in the form approved by the Law Society.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Section 80(3) provided for the Law Society to investigate claims made against the Fidelity Fund and to determine the claims by wholly or partly allowing, compromising, settling or disallowing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">For there to be a successful claim against the Fidelity Fund it was necessary that there be a 'dishonest default' or a failure to account within the meaning of the Legal Profession Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">Absent a conviction, it was necessary for the Council of the Law Society to make a finding of dishonesty before a claim could be allowed on either basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">Plainly, determinations made by the Council of the Law Society under the Legal Profession Act had an entirely different character from determinations made by the respondent in respect of PAYE deductions said to have been made by an employer during a year of income and PAYG amounts said to have been withheld from payments by way of salary or wages made to a person such as the applicant during a year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">101 Were the determinations of the respondent open to review it could not be said that the respondent failed to accord the applicant procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The applicant was afforded an opportunity to put information and submissions to the respondent in support of an outcome that supported his interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">In my opinion it was not incumbent upon the respondent to afford the applicant an interview before making the determinations which she made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">102 Natural justice and fairness are not to be equated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">In the context of administrative decision-making it is more appropriate to speak of a duty to act fairly or to accord procedural fairness (per Mason J, as his Honour then was, in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 583).</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">103 In most cases the critical question is not whether the principles of natural justice apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">It is: what does the duty to act fairly require in the circumstances of the particular case?</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">(see per Kitto J in Mobil Oil Australia Proprietary Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475 at 504, per Mason J in Kioa v West at 585 and per Ellicott J in Finch v Goldstein (1981) 36 ALR 287).</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">104 The expression 'procedural fairness' more aptly conveys the notion of a flexible obligation to adopt fair procedures which are appropriate and adapted to the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">The statutory power must be exercised fairly, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">in accordance with procedures that are fair to the individual in the light of the statutory requirements, the interests of the individual and the interests and purposes, whether public or private, which the statute seeks to advance or protect or permits to be taken into account as legitimate considerations (per Mason J in Kioa v West at 585 cf Salemi v MacKellar [No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">2] [1977] HCA 26 ; (1977) 137 CLR 396 at 451 per Jacobs J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">105 Fairness is not an abstract concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">It is essentially practical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice (per Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 ('Lam') at [37]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">106 The content of the requirement for procedural fairness may fluctuate during the course of particular administrative decision-making (per Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 ('Aala') at [62]; see also per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Lam at [48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">107 Insofar as the determinations of the respondent may have constituted decisions, it is clear that the respondent did not identify a wrong issue, ask herself a wrong question, ignore relevant material, rely on irrelevant material to make an erroneous finding or reach a mistaken conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">Furthermore there was no question of Wednesbury unreasonableness (see Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs of the Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCAFC 33 at [32] - [39] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">There was no jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">108 In considering the respondent's determinations, it is not in point to ask whether her factual conclusions were right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">The relevant question related to the respondent's processes, not her actual decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">109 The determinations of the respondent in this case were not determinations as to the time at which amounts credited by the Commissioner should take effect within the meaning of s 221H(4B) of the Assessment Act as in force in the years of income ended 30 June 1996 --- 30 June 2000 inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">Determinations under s 221H(4B) are predicated upon an obligation or entitlement to a credit of the sum of the deductions made by an employer, in payment or part payment of the relevant tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">Discretion 
 
110 Were the applicant otherwise entitled to Constitutional writ relief, in the circumstances of the present case, as recorded above, I would consider the matter to be one where, it would be appropriate for the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to decline to order the relief sought (see generally per Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala at [43]-[62] and, in particular, [53]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">Decision 
 
111 For the reasons indicated above, grounds 1, 2, 4, 5(b), 5(c), 6 and 7 fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">It follows that grounds 8, 9 and 10 also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">112 Furthermore, it should be observed in relation to the applicant's challenges to the assessment of penalties in respect of the years of income ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003 that such challenges were restricted by s 298-30 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act to proceedings under Part IVC of the Administration Act on a review or appeal relating to the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">The application for an order for review presently before the Court is not such a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">Section 298-30 provided:
 
 
 
 '298-30(1) The Commissioner must make an assessment of the amount of an administrative penalty under Division 284.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">
 
 (2) An entity that is dissatisfied with such an assessment made about the entity may object against it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">
 
 (3) The production of a notice of such an assessment, or of a copy of it certified by or on behalf of the Commissioner, is conclusive evidence of the making of the assessment and of the particulars in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">
 
 (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">' 
 
 


 
113 In an affidavit of Mr Savell sworn 2 April 2007 he referred to a printout which he caused to be made on 21 February 2007 of what he described as 'the running balance of the Applicants intergrated account (sic)' which commenced 1 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">The evidence of Farisha Ali, a Tax Technical Officer in the Micro Enterprises and Individuals business line of the Australian Taxation Office, was that the document in question, to which Mr Savell referred, was 'an itemised statement of account and not an RBA [a Running Balance Account under the Administration Act]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">Given the findings which have been made, it is unnecessary to make any finding as to whether or not the account to which Mr Savell referred was a Running Balance Account, or as to the consequences which may have flowed from it being such an account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">114 In my opinion the application should be dismissed with costs which will, of course, include the costs of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia SYG 3824 of 2006, subject to the agreement of the parties in relation thereto, to which reference has been made.</sentence>
