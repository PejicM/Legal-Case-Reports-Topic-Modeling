<sentence id="s0">
 This appeal from a decision of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) concerns the distribution of a death benefit in a superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The parties to the appeal are potential beneficiaries from the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Rebecca Webb is the only child of the late Christopher Webb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Jill Teeling claimed to be Christopher's de facto wife and dependant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Audrey Duckworth and Richard Webb are the executors of the estate of the late Olive Webb, Christopher's mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They took no part in the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Kim Webb is Rebecca's mother and Christopher's estranged wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">I frequently refer to the parties and the deceased, Christopher Webb, by their first names in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I do so only in order to ensure that my references to the parties do not cause confusion given that most share the same surname.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">An appeal from the Tribunal may only be brought on a question of law (s 46(1) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The identification of questions of law is a jurisdictional requirement for the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The fact the questions may involve questions of law is insufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The questions must be questions of law ( Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321; [2003] FCAFC 232 at [10] - [18] and Comcare v Etheridge (2006) 149 FCR 522 ; [2006] FCAFC 27 at [11] - [17] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Many of the so-called questions (in fact, grounds) in the further amended notice of appeal are not pure questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They are also difficult to comprehend and repetitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Many do not accord with the submissions made on Rebecca Webb's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The problems with the further amended notice of appeal go beyond mere infelicitous drafting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Despite this, and mindful that the dispute is about the distribution of money, I have determined the appeal by reference to the issues as they emerged by the completion of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Those issues (cross-referencing the related paragraphs of the further amended notice of appeal) are as follows: 
(1) Did the Tribunal err in concluding that Olive Webb, by reason of her death on 20 October 2007, was not a "dependant" of Christopher Webb (paras 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 4 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">(2) Was the Tribunal precluded from making a determination affecting the allocation of benefits to Olive Webb by the trustee of the superannuation fund given that no complaint had been made about that allocation (paras 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 4 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">(3) Did the Tribunal wrongly focus on the trustee's reasoning process and thus fail to apply the requirements of ss 37(4) and (6) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act by not considering whether the actual decision of the trustee was fair and reasonable in the circumstances (paras 1 and 2 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">(4) Did the Tribunal apply a policy resulting in an inflexible and mathematically exact apportionment and thus fail to apply the requirements of ss 37(4) and (6) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act (paras 1 and 2 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">(5) Did the Tribunal fail to consider a relevant matter, being the effect of Christopher's death on the financial position of the beneficiaries, specifically Kim Webb (para 3 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">(6) Did the Tribunal fail to deal with the complaint and, in giving excessive weight to the beneficiaries' financial dependence on Christopher, thereby ignore Christopher's nomination that his daughter, Rebecca, should receive half of the entitlement (paras 5 and 6 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">(7) Did the Tribunal's apportionment of the death benefit go outside its power under s 37(4) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act by taking more than necessary from Rebecca Webb's share to remove the unfairness to Jill Teeling (paras 2E and 7 of the further amended notice of appeal)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL 
 Christopher and Kim married in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Rebecca, their only child, was born in 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Christopher joined the National Mutual Tailored Superannuation Fund on 5 February 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Christopher and Kim separated in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Christopher returned to live with his mother, Olive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Christopher and Kim never divorced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Nor did they divide their assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">They retained joint tenancies over the family home and a holiday home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Christopher and Jill Teeling began a relationship in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 29 February 2000 Christopher completed a form (change to member details) by which he left 25% of the benefit from the fund that would accrue on his death to his wife, Kim, 25% to his mother, Olive, and 50% to his daughter, Rebecca.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Under the terms of the trust deed this nomination was not binding on the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Clause 4(b) of Appendix A to the trust deed provided for the death benefit to "be paid to or for the benefit of the Dependants of that Member or of such one or more of them and to the exclusion of the other or others of them and in such proportions and manner as the trustee in its absolute discretion shall think fit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Christopher died on 28 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">His wife, Kim, therefore automatically became the sole owner of the family home and the holiday home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The trustee of the fund wrote to the potential beneficiaries under Christopher's policy on 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">There is a dispute about the effect of this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The relevant parts of it are as follows: 
 
 We have now completed our deliberations and after a thorough evaluation of the information supplied, we have formed the preliminary view that the proceeds available in the fund... are to be apportioned as follows: 
 

 
 
 $250,000.00 to OLIVE MAY WEBB, the deceased's mother;
 $547,712.00 to KIM LORRAINE WEBB, nee BIRCHELL, the deceased's widow;
 $100,000.00 to JILL TEELING as a financial dependant; and
 $1,293,137.00 to REBECCA LOUISE WEBB, the deceased's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">... 
 

 
 
 We are also advising the other parties of our preliminary decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 

 
 
 If your clients are not satisfied with our preliminary determination, please advise us in writing as to why they think the death benefit should not be paid in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Their objections must reach us within 28 days of receiving this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 

 
 
 Should your clients decide not to lodge an objection within the 28 period, it will result in them having no right to complain to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In accordance with legislation, the Trustee is required to advise you of the date of this decision and in this instance, the date of the decision is the date of this letter, i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">7 th September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 

 By a letter dated 25 September 2007 from her solicitors Jill Teeling made a complaint about the preliminary determination and requested that the trustee reconsider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">This letter is over seven pages long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It sets out a detailed series of submissions on Ms Teeling's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Much of the letter involves a submission explaining why Ms Teeling should be accepted to have been Christopher Webb's de facto partner and not merely his financial dependant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">As part of this, the letter refers to the financial contributions Christopher gave to Jill in money and kind and the fact that adequate provision should be made for her from the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The letter also deals with other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The solicitors submitted that the allocation to Kim Webb was grossly unfair, particularly having regard to her ownership of the family home and the holiday home and her long estrangement from Christopher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The letter requests an apportionment of the fund that more accurately reflected Christopher's planned use including his planned retirement with Jill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Olive Webb, Christopher's mother, died on 20 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The trustee of the fund responded to the complaint by a letter dated 13 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Again, there is a dispute about the effect of this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The letter includes the following: 
 
 We have completed our deliberations in light of the objection you have lodged on behalf of Ms Jill Teeling and advise that our preliminary determination is now confirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 

 
 
 Accordingly, our final decision is to apportion the benefit... as follows: 
 

 
 
 $250,000.00 to OLIVE MAY WEBB, the deceased's mother;
 $547,712.00 to KIM LORRAINE WEBB, nee BIRCHELL, the deceased's widow;
 $100,000.00 to JILL TEELING as a financial dependant; and
 $1,293,137.00 to REBECCA LOUISE WEBB, the deceased's daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">... 
 

 
 
 ...
 We are also advising the other parties [of] our final decision... 
 

 
 
 If your client is not satisfied with the Trustee's final determination, she is entitled to lodge a complaint with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal within 28 days of receiving this notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Failure to lodge a complaint with the Tribunal within that period will result in it being prohibited from reviewing the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 

 Ms Teeling made a complaint to the Tribunal on 21 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Section 14 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act permits a complaint to be made and is in these terms: 
 
 (1) This section applies if the trustee of a fund has made a decision (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) in relation to: 
 (a) a particular member or a particular former member of a regulated superannuation fund; or 
 (b) a particular beneficiary or a particular former beneficiary of an approved deposit fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 

 
 
 (1A) This section does not apply to a decision of a trustee in respect of which a complaint can be made to the Tribunal under section 14A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 

 
 
 (2) Subject to subsection (3) and section 15 , a person may make a complaint (other than an excluded complaint) to the Tribunal, that the decision is or was unfair or unreasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 

 
 
 (3) If a person has been given a written notice by the trustee of a fund setting out: 
 (a) the trustee's decision in relation to the person's objection to the payment of a death benefit; and 
 (b) the prescribed period within which the person must complain to the Tribunal about the decision; 
 the person may only make a complaint under this section to the Tribunal within that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 

 Section 15 , which is referred to in s 14(2) , is as follows: 
 
 (1) A person may make a complaint under section 14 only if: 
 (a) in the case of a decision that relates to the payment of a death benefit:
 (i) the person has an interest in the benefit; or 
 ... 
 

 
 
 (2) A person does not have an interest in a death benefit for the purposes of paragraph (l)(a) unless: 
 (a) the person: 
 (i) has been given written notice by the trustee of the proposed payment of the benefit; and 
 (ii) has been given written notice by the trustee of the prescribed period within which the person may object; and 
 (iii) has objected to the trustee within the prescribed period; or 
 

 Ms Teeling's complaint to the Tribunal identified that she was not satisfied with the trustee's failure to recognise her as a financial dependant and her future loss as Christopher's de facto partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Ms Teeling claimed that the apportionment did not adequately provide for her future financial security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">She complained about the apportionment to Christopher's wife, Kim, and to the estate of his mother, Olive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">She described the apportionment as unfair and sought a greater share of the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Other provisions of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act are also relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Section 19(1) is as follows: 
 
 (1) The Tribunal cannot deal with a complaint under section 14 or 14A unless the complainant satisfies the Tribunal that: 
 (a) a complaint about the same subject matter was previously made to an appropriate person under arrangements for dealing with such complaints made under section 101 of the Supervision Act; and 
 (b) the complaint so made was not settled to the satisfaction of the complainant within 90 days or such longer period as the Tribunal allows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 

 The Supervision Act is the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Section 101 of the Supervision Act requires a trustee of a regulated superannuation fund to establish arrangements to enable a person to make an inquiry or complaint and for proper consideration of any such inquiry or complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Section 37 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act is a key provision because it identifies the powers of the Tribunal in respect of a complaint under s 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Section 37 is as follows: 
 
 (1) For the purpose of reviewing a decision of the trustee of a fund that is the subject of a complaint under section 14: 
 (a) the Tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee; and 
 (b) subject to subsection (6), must make a determination in accordance with subsection (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 

 
 
 (2) If an insurer or other decision-maker has been joined as a party to a complaint under section 14: 
 (a) the Tribunal must, when reviewing the trustee's decision, also review any decision of the insurer or other decision-maker that is relevant to the complaint; and 
 (b) for that purpose, has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the insurer or other decision-maker; and 
 (c) subject to subsection (6), must make a determination in accordance with subsection (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 

 
 
 (3) On reviewing the decision of a trustee, insurer or other decision-maker that is the subject of, or relevant to, a complaint under section 14 , the Tribunal must make a determination in writing: 
 (a) affirming the decision; or 
 (b) remitting the matter to which the decision relates to the trustee, insurer or other decision-maker for reconsideration in accordance with the directions of the Tribunal; or 
 (c) varying the decision; or 
 (d) setting aside the decision and substituting a decision for the decision so set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 

 
 
 (4) The Tribunal may only exercise its determination-making power under subsection (3) for the purpose of placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in such a position that the unfairness, unreasonableness, or both, that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 

 
 
 (5) The Tribunal must not do anything under subsection (3) that would be contrary to law, to the governing rules of the fund concerned and, if a contract of insurance between an insurer and trustee is involved, to the terms of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">(6) The Tribunal must affirm a decision referred to under subsection (3) if it is satisfied that the decision, in its operation in relation to: 
 (a) the complainant; and 
 (b) so far as concerns a complaint regarding the payment of a death benefit - any person (other than the complainant, a trustee, insurer or decision-maker) who: 
 (i) has become a party to the complaint; and 
 (ii) has an interest in the death benefit or claims to be, or to be entitled to benefits through, a person having an interest in the death benefit; 
 was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 

 THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 
 The Tribunal determined to set aside the trustee's decision and to substitute its own decision distributing the fund as follows: 52% to Kim Webb ($1,139,241), 26% to Rebecca Webb ($569,620) and 22% to Jill Teeling ($481,987).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The estate of Olive Webb received no benefit from the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal reviewed the circumstances of each potential beneficiary, particularly by reference to the financial support they received from Christopher (at [19]-[31]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">After considering the submissions (at [35]-[50]), the Tribunal identified (at [51]) that it must determine whether the trustee's decision: 
 
 ...was fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the Complainant and the Joined Parties in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The issue is not what decision the Tribunal would have made on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In reaching its determination, the Tribunal took the whole of the evidence and submissions into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">
 

 The Tribunal observed (at [52]) that "[r]elevant to this determination are the wishes of the Deceased Member, the financial circumstances and needs of the potential beneficiaries and the nature of the relationship between the beneficiaries and the Deceased Member".</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Tribunal then dealt with each potential beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">First (at [55]-[59]), with respect to the estate of Olive Webb, the Tribunal considered that a payment to the executors of the estate, who were not dependants of Christopher as defined in the trust deed, would not be a payment "to or for the benefit of the Dependants" as the deed required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Nor would such a payment satisfy legislative requirements (referring to reg 6.22 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 (Cth) which provides for fund benefits to be cashed in favour of either the member's legal personal representative or the member's dependants).</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal concluded (at [59]) that: 
 
 Even if the Trustee were correct and was able to pay $250,000 of the benefit to the Mother's estate consistently with the Trust Deed and the legislation, the decision would still appear to be inconsistent with the Trustee's own reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In the Tribunal's view, the Trustee's decision to pay $250,000 to the Mother's estate was not fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 

 Second (at [60]-[62]), with respect to Jill Teeling, the Tribunal concluded that she was Christopher's dependant and would have continued to receive about $15,000 a year in support from him had he not died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Third (at [63]-[64]), with respect to Kim Webb, the Tribunal concluded that she was Christopher's dependant and would have continued to receive about $36,000 a year in support from him had he not died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Fourth (at [65]-[66]), with respect to Rebecca Webb, the Tribunal concluded that she was Christopher's dependant and received about $18,000 a year from him in support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The Tribunal considered it fair and reasonable to assume that this level of support would decrease when Rebecca ceased to be a full-time student and started work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal noted that under the trustee's decision Rebecca was to receive far more than her mother Kim, even though her mother was more financially dependant on Christopher than Rebecca.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The Tribunal (at [67]) said that: 
 
 ...a fair and reasonable distribution of the death benefit would have taken into account all the circumstances above, including the likelihood and quantum of future financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal is of the view that the Trustee did not do this and this has resulted in an unfair and unreasonable distribution to each of the beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 

 After reminding itself of its powers under s 37(3) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act (at [68]), the Tribunal determined the complaint in the following terms: Sub-section 37(6) of the Complaints Act provides that the Tribunal must affirm the decision of the Trustee if it is satisfied that it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances in its operation in relation to the Complainant and any person who has become a party to the complaint and who either has an interest in the death benefit or claims to be, or to be entitled to benefits through, a person having an interest in the death benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The Tribunal is not so satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In accordance with the requirements of sub-ss.37(3), (4) and (5) of the Complaints Act, the Tribunal determines to set aside the decision under review on the grounds that it was not fair and reasonable and substitute its own decision that the death benefit be paid as follows:
 52% to the Spouse; 26% to the Daughter; and 22% to the Complainant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Tribunal has determined this distribution based on the following:
 the Mother should not have received any part of the distribution as she died prior to the final determination of the Trustee and for the reasons stated above; the benefit should be distributed between the other three potential beneficiaries; the Deceased Member showed no indication that the level of support he was providing to each of these beneficiaries would reduce in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">It appears to the Tribunal that the pattern of support was embedded and unlikely to change in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The Tribunal considers that this is a fair basis for the distribution of the benefit as it reflects the most likely future support each would have received; and specifically, the Tribunal has used the amount of the regular support provided by the Deceased Member to each of these beneficiaries as an indication of what would most likely have continued in the future had he lived and continued to share his income with all three of them, whether his income derived from superannuation or personal exertion; while there was a Nomination of Beneficiary form completed in early 2000, the circumstances of the nominated beneficiaries had changed as at the date of death, particularly the Daughter's future education expenses and ability to support herself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">THE ISSUES IN THE APPEAL 
 (1) Was Olive Webb Christopher's dependant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law in concluding that Olive Webb was not Christopher's dependant at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">According to this submission the trustee made its allocation decision as required by the trust deed on 7 September 2007 and as notified in the letter of that date to the potential beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Olive Webb was alive and dependant on her son, Christopher, for financial support at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">This decision was preliminary only in the sense that it was subject to a process of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The decision of 13 December 2007 was a further and separate decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Further or alternatively, under the terms of the trust deed, a person's status as a dependant is to be determined at the date of the member's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Olive Webb was still alive when Christopher died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The Tribunal thus misdirected itself in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">These arguments lack substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The first argument is untenable on any reading of the correspondence from the trustee of 7 September and 13 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The terms of the letter of 7 September 2007 convey a preliminary, in the sense of a proposed, decision only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">This preliminary decision was not subject to any right of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It was subject to a right to make a complaint to the trustee about the preliminary allocation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">As required by s 101 of the Supervision Act, the trustee would then have to consider that complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The reference to the Tribunal in the letter of 7 September 2007 is to put the recipient on notice that, unless the recipient make a complaint or objection to the trustee, the recipient cannot make a complaint to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Given s 19(1), this advice was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Accordingly, the letter of 7 September 2007 did not convey any operative decision of the trustee under the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">To the contrary, the trustee made its decision on 13 December 2007, being a date after the death of Olive Webb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It follows that the Tribunal was required to "stand in the shoes" of the trustee as at 13 December 2007, not 7 September 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">On that date, Olive Webb had already died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The second aspect of this argument requires consideration of the terms of the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Payment of the death benefit is to be determined by the trustee in accordance with cl 4 of Appendix A to the trust deed which provides: 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">...
 (b) Any amount which becomes payable pursuant to the provisions of this Deed on the death of a Member shall at the option of the Trustee:
 (1) be paid to or for the benefit of the Dependants of that Member or of such one or more of them and to the exclusion of the other or others of them and in such proportions and manner as the Trustee in its absolute discretion shall think fit...; or
 (2) be paid to the legal personal representatives of that Member; or
 (3) be paid to any other person to whom payment of the benefit is permitted in accordance with the Applicable Requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 

 The definition of "Dependant" in cl 4 of the trust deed includes: 
 
 (c) any person who in the opinion of the Trustee is at the relevant date (or in the case of a deceased Member was at the date of the death of the deceased Member ) wholly or partially dependent financially on that Member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">[Emphasis added] 
 

 It was submitted that this definition demonstrates that the question whether Olive Webb is a dependant must be determined as at the date of Christopher's death.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">If the construction advanced is correct, then it was submitted that the subsequent death of Olive Webb was not relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">There are two answers to this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">First, the question whether Olive was Christopher's dependant depends on the operation of the definition of that word in the trust deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">But the power of the trustee (and thus also the Tribunal) to make a payment depends on the operative provisions of the trust deed and the legislation (specifically reg 6.22 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations as referred to by the Tribunal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The trustee may only pay the benefit to the nominated classes including to or for the benefit of the dependants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">A payment to a person's estate after their death, as the Tribunal correctly acknowledged, is difficult to reconcile with this requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To the extent that it involves ambiguity, the terms of the trust deed are to be construed as a whole in order to give effect to a harmonious scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Once this approach is adopted, I am satisfied that although Olive Webb was Christopher's dependant at the time of his death, the trustee did not have power to make a payment to Olive's estate consistent with its obligations to make payments only to or for the benefit of the dependants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Second, even if this be incorrect, it must also be recognised that the Tribunal's decision about the allocation to Olive Webb did not turn upon these issues of construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This is because the decision, as the terms of [59] of the Tribunal's reasons disclose, depended on the Tribunal's view that it was not fair and reasonable in the circumstances for money to be paid to the estate of Olive Webb.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">This was a conclusion which the Tribunal was entitled to reach in all of the circumstances and is unassailable in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 4) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">(2) Was any complaint made about Olive Webb's share?</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that, by reason of s 19(1) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to deal with Olive Webb's share of the fund as decided by the trustee because no complaint by Jill Teeling had been made about her share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">This argument is untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">It misconceives the complaint made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">It also misconceives the powers and obligations of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">As to the former (the scope of the complaint), it cannot be said that the complaint made by Jill Teeling's solicitors was limited to the trustee's failure to recognise her as Christopher's de facto partner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">That was one of the complaints, but even that submission, properly understood, was a means to an end.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The essence of the complaint was that the trustee's proposed distribution did not adequately provide for Jill's financial needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">She wanted a greater share of the fund in order to reflect her position as Christopher's de facto partner and to meet her needs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">As there is one fund only, increasing the share given to Jill must decrease the share available to the other potential beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It may be accepted that the complaint stressed that the share proposed to be given to Kim Webb, Christopher's estranged wife, was grossly unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">But that was not the essence of her complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The complaint's essence was the unfairness of the amount Jill herself was proposed to receive from the fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">As to the latter (the Tribunal's powers and obligations), s 37(6) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act explicitly recognises that where one potential beneficiary seeks a greater share of a fund, then the interests of one or more of the other beneficiaries will require adjustment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">It is for this reason that the Tribunal must affirm a decision if it is satisfied that the decision is fair and reasonable in the circumstances not only in relation to the complainant, but also in relation to any other person who has an interest in the death benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Further, s 19 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act does not advance the argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The section serves to establish a procedure under which the Tribunal is not to deal with a complaint unless the complainant has attempted to have the matter resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">This procedure was followed in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 4) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">(3) Did the Tribunal wrongly focus on the trustee's reasoning process?</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider whether the actual decision of the trustee was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Instead, the Tribunal asked itself whether the trustee's reasoning process was somehow flawed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">By these submissions it was sought to both demonstrate that the Tribunal had not acted in accordance with the statutory requirement to affirm the decision if satisfied that is fair and reasonable in accordance with the terms of s 37(6) and to engage the observation in Lykogiannis v Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd (2000) 97 FCR 361 ; [2000] FCA 327 at [48] in which Mansfield J, after considering numerous decisions (including Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428) , observed that: 
 
 Ultimately, whatever findings the Tribunal must make standing in the shoes of the trustee ... s 37(6) requires the Tribunal to decide whether the decision under review, in its operation, was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The focus of s 37(6) is upon the consequence or outcome of the decision in its practical operation, rather than upon the process by which the decision under review came to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">
 

 According to the submissions, a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, particularly [67] and [71] (3 rd and 4 th dot points), discloses that the Tribunal failed to consider the consequence or outcome of the trustee's decision in terms of its practical operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Instead, the Tribunal considered that the process by which the trustee had reached its decision was flawed in that the trustee did not give weight to the likelihood and quantum of financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">These arguments cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The first argument involves a strained reading of a few paragraphs of the Tribunal's reasons taken in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The Tribunal was well aware of the requirements of s 37(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It recited them in terms at [69] of its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Its recognition of the limitation in the section is also apparent from the observation in [51] that the issue is not what decision the Tribunal would have made on the evidence, but whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances in relation to its operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Tribunal did not set aside the trustee's decision because of any concern about inadequacies in the trustee's reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">As it said in [69], the Tribunal was not satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances in its operation in relation to the complainant, Jill Teeling, and the other beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It was not fair and reasonable because it did not reflect the likelihood and quantum of future financial support those beneficiaries would have received had Christopher not died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The Tribunal's reasons simply do not reflect the error said to have arisen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">It may be accepted that "[t]he role of the Tribunal under s 37(6) of the Complaints Act is not to decide for itself the correct or preferable decision: it must affirm a decision if it is satisfied that the operation of the decision the subject of review was fair and reasonable in the circumstances" ( Edwards v Postsuper Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 83 at [15] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In so doing the "Tribunal may have to make its own findings of fact for the purpose of determining whether the decision is fair and reasonable in its operation in the circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">However, this is precisely the approach that the Tribunal took, as its observations in [51] disclose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 1 and 2) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">(4) Did the Tribunal apply a policy resulting in an inflexible and mathematically exact apportionment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law because its decision resulted from the application of its own policy identifying factors relevant to an apportionment of a death benefit thereby replacing the test under ss 37(6) and (4) with something "inflexible and mathematically exact".</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The submissions drew attention to the Tribunal's reliance on a published policy which states that "[t]he Tribunal has found that a useful test in cases of contested distribution is to ask who would have continued to benefit from the member's income if the member had not died".</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">In respect of this argument the submissions (properly, given the facts) disavowed any suggestion that the Tribunal had inflexibly applied this policy without considering the merits of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Instead the argument, insofar as I can understand it, suggested that the Tribunal erred by applying a precise mathematical approach to the apportionment rather than applying the test set out in s 37(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">This was said to follow from the fact that the Tribunal reached its percentage apportionments (52%, 26% and 22%) by reference to the relationship between the amount of financial support each beneficiary, other than the late Olive Webb, received (being $15,000, $36,000 and $18,000 or a total of $69,000).</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">I am unable to discern any error or question of law arising from these submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The Tribunal had decided that it was not satisfied that the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances in its operation in terms of s 37(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The Tribunal was entitled to take into account its published policy in order to discharge its obligation under s 37(4) (that is, exercising its powers for the purpose of placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in such a position that the unfairness, unreasonableness, or both, that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint no longer exists).</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 1 and 2) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">(5) Did the Tribunal fail to consider the effect of Christopher's death?</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider that Christopher's death would change the needs and level of dependency of the beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">According to this submission Christopher had carefully planned his financial arrangements including the fact that Kim Webb, his estranged wife, would receive the family home and holiday home valued at $350,000 and $700,000 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The Tribunal failed to take this into account and instead applied its policy (see [53]-[54] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">These submissions, properly analysed, are nothing more than a challenge to the merits of the Tribunal's determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The submissions identify no matter which the Tribunal was bound to consider or not to consider consistent with the principles identified in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-41, which were sought to be invoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Further, and contrary to the submission, the Tribunal did take into account this factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">At [22] the Tribunal noted: "[Kim Webb] owned two properties as joint tenant with [Christopher]...</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">These properties passed to her by survivorship".</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">It follows that the question in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (para 3) must be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">(6) Did the Tribunal fail to deal with the complaint and ignore Christopher's nomination?</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law by ignoring the terms of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">According to these submissions the complaint claimed that the trustee should have recognised Jill Teeling's status as Christopher's de facto and taken money from Kim Webb, Christopher's estranged wife, to give to Jill.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The complaint did not seek any reduction of the share granted to Olive Webb, Christopher's mother, or to Rebecca Webb, his daughter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">By these submissions it was sought to engage the principle that the Tribunal's function relates to the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">As it was put in National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell (2000) 99 FCR 562 ; [2000] FCA 852 at [15] : 
 
 When exercising its powers under s 37(3) the Tribunal is engaged in a task that results from a complaint that the decision being reviewed is or was unfair or unreasonable, or both.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The claimed unfairness or unreasonableness, which was the subject of the complaint, is the central object of the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The terms of s 37(4) confirm that this is so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">
 

 And further, at [32], that: 
 
 The issue is whether the s 14(2) complaint has been made out and whether, for the purposes of s 37(6) the Tribunal is satisfied that the decision, in its operation in relation to the respondent, was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 

 The submissions also asserted that the Tribunal placed excessive weight on the financial dependence of the beneficiaries to the exclusion of all other factors, including Christopher's nomination that his daughter Rebecca should receive half of his entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">These submissions confront a number of difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">First, and as discussed above, the complaint cannot be read so narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The complaint did say that the share given to Kim Webb was grossly unfair but it did not ask for money to be taken from Kim Webb and given to Jill Teeling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It asked that the apportionment adequately provide for Jill Teeling's future financial security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">The Tribunal did not ignore the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Tribunal correctly recognised that the question of Jill Teeling's status as a de facto partner was immaterial because the evidence established that she was Christopher's dependant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The Tribunal then considered the practical consequences of the trustee's apportionment in terms of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Tribunal upheld the complaint by reason of the Tribunal's express finding in [69] that it was not satisfied that the trustee's decision was "was fair and reasonable in the circumstances in its operation in relation to the Complainant and any person who has become a party to the complaint and who either has an interest in the death benefit or claims to be, or to be entitled to benefits through, a person having an interest in the death benefit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In other words, the Tribunal in terms did that which the submissions assert it did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The fact that the Tribunal's determination resulted in a substantial decrease in Rebecca Webb's share does not disclose any error or question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Again, properly considered, the submissions involve a challenge to the merits of the Tribunal's determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Second, the submission about the Tribunal ignoring Christopher's nomination that his daughter Rebecca should receive half of his entitlement failed to explain why the Tribunal was bound to consider this factor in discharging its statutory function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Moreover, and contrary to the claim, it is apparent that the Tribunal did consider this factor as its reasons in [32] and [66] disclose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">To the extent that these submissions asserted that the Tribunal placed excessive weight on the financial dependence of the beneficiaries they manifestly sought to trespass on the merits of the Tribunal's decision when the appeal is confined to questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Further, and in any event, the factor of financial dependence is not irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Indeed, as the submissions for Rebecca Webb pointed out, the Tribunal was acting in accordance with its published policy which states that "[t]he Tribunal has found that a useful test in cases of contested distribution is to ask who would have continued to benefit from the member's income if the member had not died".</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The Tribunal's reasons do not disclose it taking into account this factor to the exclusion of other relevant factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">As the Tribunal stated at [67]: 
 
 The Tribunal is of the view that a fair and reasonable distribution of the death benefit would have taken into account all of the circumstances above, including the likelihood and quantum of future financial support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">
 

 This reference to "all of the circumstances" indicates that the Tribunal did not exclude other relevant considerations in determining whether the trustee's determination resulted in a fair and reasonable distribution of the death benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Indeed, The Tribunal expressly acknowledged other relevant considerations at [52] of its reasons for decision, namely "the wishes of the Deceased Member, the financial circumstances and the needs of the potential beneficiaries and the nature of the relationship between the beneficiaries and the Deceased Member".</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 5 and 6) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">(7) Did the Tribunal's apportionment go outside its power?</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law by making a determination outside of its power as confined by s 37(4) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The Tribunal concluded that Jill Teeling should receive 22% of the death benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">By operation of s 37(4) , according to the submissions, the Tribunal's power to remove the unfairness was limited to an apportionment which took the proportion required from the shares granted to Kim and Olive Webb to increase Jill Teeling's share to this figure of 22% and no more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Instead the Tribunal varied the whole decision going far beyond what was necessary to ensure that the unfairness to Jill Teeling no longer existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">This submission cannot succeed in the face of the terms of s 37(4) construed in context, including s 37(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Section 37(4) refers to unfairness or unreasonableness that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">It does not and could not rationally limit the Tribunal's power to a decision which ensures that unfairness or unreasonableness in relation to the complainant alone no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The reason it could not do so is obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Making a decision fair and reasonable for the complainant may make it unfair or unreasonable in relation to another potential beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This is why s 37(6) establishes a statutory requirement that the Tribunal affirm a decision if satisfied it is fair and reasonable in relation to not only the complainant but also other potential beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">In this case the Tribunal was not so satisfied (at [69]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">As such, its powers under s 37(3) were enlivened but only in accordance with s 37(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In accordance with that section the Tribunal had to exercise its powers for the purpose of placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in a position that the unfairness the Tribunal determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision no longer exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The unfairness the Tribunal determined to exist in this case was that the trustee's apportionment did not recognise either: - (i) that the late Olive Webb was no longer a dependant so that the money allocated to her was available for re-allocation, or (ii) the levels of financial dependence of Jill Teeling or the other dependants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Having found this unfairness to exist in relation to the trustee's decision it was open to the Tribunal to ensure that the unfairness to Jill Teeling, so far as practicable, no longer existed by the apportionment it proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The fact that this resulted in Rebecca's share decreasing to the benefit of Jill Teeling and Kim Webb does not disclose any error or question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Again, the submissions are a challenge to the merits of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Insofar as these submissions reiterated that the Tribunal's decision was inconsistent with the requirement that the central object of the review be the complaint (as referred to above by reference to National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v Campbell at [15] and [32]), they overlook the scope of the complaint and the Tribunal's related factual findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In particular, at [39] of its reasons the Tribunal recorded that Jill Teeling's complaint included that: 
 
 ... the Trustee's decision failed to adequately take into account the properties that passed to the Spouse by survivorship, the Daughter's future earnings and the fact that the Mother had died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It was submitted that the Trustee should have considered the future superannuation plans of the Deceased Member in respect of the Complainant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">
 

 The financial support given by Christopher Webb to the beneficiaries and the consequent likelihood and quantum of future financial support was within the scope of the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">It cannot be said the Tribunal misdirected itself as to the central object of the review for the purposes of s 37(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">This is particularly so in light of s 37(6)(b)(ii) which specifically directs the Tribunal to take into account the operation of the trustee's decision in respect of any person who has an interest in the death benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The Tribunal's task under s 37 is to determine whether the trustee's decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Indeed, this is what the Tribunal did, as it stated in [67] of its reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">It follows that the questions in the further amended notice of appeal relating to this matter (paras 2E and 7) must each be answered in the negative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">No error of law as asserted is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">CONCLUSION 
 The applicant, Rebecca Webb, has not identified any question of law the answer to which would vitiate the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
