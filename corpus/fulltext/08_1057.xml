<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The respondents hold a licence issued under Part V of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The licence permits them to use the premises at 34-38 Pipe Road, Laverton North, for purposes of warehousing goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Between October 2005 and November 2005 quantities of Affair cigarettes owned by Eastern Enterprises Pty Ltd were placed into storage at the warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The cigarettes had been imported into Australia in February 2004 but had not been entered for home consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 12 November 2006, the cigarettes were stolen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Following the theft, the applicant, a Collector of customs, demanded that the respondents pay to the Commonwealth $127,364.30 as the customs duty payable on the cigarettes at the rate in force at the date of the demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The demand was not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This action has been brought to recover the amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The question is whether the respondents are required to pay that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">2 Duty of customs is imposed by the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Section 15 relevantly provides that the duty is imposed on "goods imported into Australia on or after 1 July 1996".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Customs Act is also relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Section 68 of that Act states that goods that are imported are required to be entered: (a) for home consumption; (b) for warehousing; or (c) for transhipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Section 132 provides that, subject to irrelevant exceptions, the rate of duty payable on goods is the rate in force when the goods are entered for home consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Section 132AA provides that in the case of goods entered for home consumption the "[t]ime by which the duty on the goods must be paid [is the t]ime of entry of the goods for home consumption".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Finally, s 153 provides that duties shall constitute debts payable by the owner and are recoverable at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">3 The authorities establish that the effect of these provisions is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">First, while there is no definition of "importation" in the Customs Act , goods are deemed imported into Australia when they are brought from abroad on board a vessel or ship for purposes of being landed: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Tony Longo Pty Ltd (2001) 52 NSWLR 458 at [110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Second, goods are dutiable under the Customs Act on importation: Tony Longo 52 NSWLR 458 at [118]; The Collector of Customs (Vict) v Wilh Wilhelmson Agency Proprietary Limited [1956] HCA 74 ; (1956) 102 CLR 147 at 157.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Third, the goods remain dutiable whether or not they are entered for home consumption: Tony Longo 52 NSWLR 458 at [115]-[118]; Collector of Customs for the State of New South Wales v Southern Shipping Company Limited [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 at 296.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Fourth, and this is a qualification on the third proposition, the obligation to pay the duty is suspended until the goods are entered: Customs Act s 132AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">4 In the first instance, the obligation to pay customs duty falls on the "owner" of the goods in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">"Owner" is an expression that is given a wide meaning in s 4 of the Customs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The owner is not, however, the only person who may be liable for duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">When the Customs Act was first enacted, Part V (comprising ss 78 to 110) dealt with the warehousing of goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Section 78 provided that dutiable goods might be warehoused in a licensed warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 92(4) provided that the licensee of any warehouse shall "[p]ay the duty on all warehoused goods removed from his warehouse except by authority and on all warehoused goods not produced to the officer on demand unless such goods are accounted for to the satisfaction of the Collector".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">5 A broader provision, s 35A , was introduced into the Customs Act by Act No 37 of 1957.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That section relevantly provides:
 (1) Where a person who has, or has been entrusted with, the possession, custody or control of dutiable goods which are subject to the control of the Customs: 
 
 (a) fails to keep those goods safely; or 
 
 
 
 (b) when so requested by a Collector, does not account for those goods to the satisfaction of a Collector; 
 
 that person shall, on demand in writing made by a Collector, pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of the duty of Customs which would have been payable on those goods if they had been entered for home consumption on the day on which the demand was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">6 Section 35A has a greater scope of operation than s 92.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">First of all, it covers a wider class of persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Section 92 imposed liability only on the holder of a warehouse licence whereas s 35A deals with the liability of every person entrusted with the care of dutiable goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Secondly, s 92 was only engaged in the circumstances when: (1) goods were removed from the warehouse without authority; or (2) dutiable goods were not produced to an officer on demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Section 35A , on the other hand, covers those cases as well cases involving the loss, theft, or destruction of dutiable goods, which may be outside s 92.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">7 The respondents put forward three propositions, any one of which, they say, relieves them from liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Each proposition lacks nothing in ingenuity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Two are somewhat troublesome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">8 First, the respondents contend that whatever be the ambit of s 35A , it was not intended to cover a warehouse licensee, whose liability was dealt with by s 92 alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This contention is founded on two grounds: (1) the location of s 92 in a division concerned with licensed warehouses; and (2) the unlikelihood that Parliament intended that liability be imposed on a licensee by two potentially overlapping provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 While the argument is not without its attraction, it cannot be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">First of all, the two sections (ss 35A and 92) only partially overlap.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">More importantly, s 35A is an extremely broad provision which, according to its plain language, will cover the licensee of a warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There is, in my view, no good reason to read it down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">10 I should explain why acceptance of their first proposition is of importance to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In 1980, s 92 was repealed by Act No 110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It was replaced by other sections which did not repeat s 92(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The argument put is that following the amendment Parliament intended to eliminate the responsibility of warehouse licensees to pay duty on goods removed from their warehouse without authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">11 The ordinary place at which imported goods are stored prior to entry for home consumption is a licensed warehouse, and thus to exclude warehoused goods from the scope of s 35A would have a significant negative impact upon customs revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">As a general rule Parliament is usually concerned with increasing the revenue; thus, in the absence of a clear statement that warehouse licensees are in fact excluded from the statutory regime, I can see no reason to impute this intention to Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Rather, I think it more reasonable in the circumstances to conclude that when s 92 was repealed Parliament did not insert a substitute for s 92(4) because the view was taken that s 35A covered the field.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">12 The respondents' second proposition is built primarily on the fact (not in dispute) that when the Affair cigarettes were stolen they were "stale", in that they had passed their "use by" date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Additional support for the proposition is drawn from evidence that the cigarettes were not packaged in conformance with applicable statutes and regulations (ie they could not be legally sold in Australia without repackaging) and are in any event a brand not ordinarily sold within Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The argument is that because the cigarettes were stale, improperly packaged, and without an established market in Australia, they had no value and thus could not be dutiable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">There is some attraction in a proposition that goods which have no value should not be subject to duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">However, the argument overlooks certain important facts and ignores the structure of the Customs Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 As regards the facts, the cigarettes themselves did have a value when they were imported --- they were not then stale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The packaging argument does not change this fact because the packaging of cigarettes is extrinsic to their value; there is nothing to say that the cigarettes could not have been repackaged in conformity with law and then sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Similarly, the evidence that Affair cigarettes are a brand not ordinarily sold within Australia is not of itself sufficient to establish that they have no market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Indeed, the very fact that someone thought to import them into this country suggests that they had some value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">14 But there is a more fundamental flaw in the respondents' market value submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Even if I were to accept that the cigarettes had no value at the time of importation, the duty payable on cigarettes is not an ad valorem duty but a duty imposed at a fixed rate on each individual cigarette, without reference to brand name or market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">If following importation goods diminish in value, provision is made for a refund, rebate or remission of duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">This is dealt with by s 163 of the Customs Act and the Customs Regulations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Regulation 126 sets out the circumstances in which refunds, rebates and remissions may be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Those circumstances include: (a) where the goods on which duty has been paid or is payable have deteriorated or been damaged, lost or destroyed before they become subject to the control of Customs; (b) where goods on which duty has been paid or is payable have deteriorated or been damaged or destroyed while subject to the control of Customs; and (c) where goods on which duty has been paid or is payable have been lost or stolen while subject to the control of Customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">If this, or any other regulation, is applicable, then an application for rebate may be made; but at the same time, that a rebate or remission may be available is not a defence to an action for the recovery of the duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">15 In their last submission, the respondents contend that in order to succeed under the facts and circumstances of this case it was incumbent upon the applicant to establish both that the respondents had failed to keep the Affair cigarettes safely (s 35A(1)(a)) and that they had not accounted for the cigarettes to the satisfaction of a Collector (s 35A(1)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The point of this submission is that the object of s 35A is to protect the revenue, and the revenue will not be harmed by the entry into home consumption of valueless cigarettes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Hence, so the argument went, the Collector, having voluntarily sought an accounting, was required as a matter of law to be satisfied the goods had relevantly been accounted for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">16 It may be that the premise that lies behind this argument is that the conditions in s 35A(1) are cumulative and not alternative conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">But, as the cases say, they are alternative bases for imposing duty: Southern Shipping at 287 and 299, 305; Sidebottom v Giuliano [2000] FCA 607 ; (2000) 98 FCR 579.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">In other words, it is not a condition precedent to the making of a demand that an accounting first has been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">17 Acknowledging this authority, counsel for the respondents made a far subtler argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">First, he quoted the following passage from the reasons of Owen J in Southern Shipping (at 305-306) (emphases added):
 The question then arises as to the meaning of the words "does not account for those goods to the satisfaction of the Collector" in par.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">(b) of the sub-section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The use of the word "or" in introducing the paragraph may at first sight appear to create some difficulty but if the purpose of the section is kept in mind I think that difficulty disappears.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">If the undoubted fact is that a custodian of goods has failed to keep them safe from the danger of going into consumption without payment of duty as, for example, where readily saleable goods have been stolen, par.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">(b) need not be called in aid by the Collector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">But cases may easily be imagined in which the disappearance of the goods leaves it doubtful whether they may have gone into consumption or that it is likely that they will do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">If so, par.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">(b) may be invoked and the custodian may be required by the Collector to account for the absence of the goods in such manner as to satisfy him that the revenue has not suffered and, in the absence of an explanation which satisfies the Collector of that fact, the obligation to pay imposed by the latter part of the sub-section may be enforced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In the present case, the explanation given by the defendant for the disappearance of the goods was that they had been stolen and the probabilities were, in these circumstances, that they would go into consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The defendant failed to safeguard them against that danger and there was no need, in these circumstances, for the Collector to request the defendant to account for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Nevertheless he did so and the account was not one upon which he was bound to be satisfied that the revenue had not suffered or would not be likely to suffer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">See also Wilh Wilhelmson 102 CLR at 159.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">18 The first three sentences of this passage establish, as the respondents accept, that the demand and accounting provisions are alternative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">However, counsel placed great reliance on the emphasised portions of the passage distinguishing "readily saleable" goods from those unlikely to go into home consumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">He argued further that even though a Collector may not be required to request an accounting, he may voluntarily do so, in which case his discretion to accept or reject that accounting is not unfettered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">19 I will accept, without deciding the issue, that Owen J's views are correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I am also prepared to accept for the sake of argument that: (1) even where a Collector is not required to request an accounting, he or she may nevertheless do so, particularly in a case such as this where the goods are not "readily saleable"; and (2) the Collector's discretion to then accept or reject the accounting is not completely unfettered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">20 Arguably, a voluntary request for an accounting was made in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The evidence was that on 13 November 2006, a Collector informed agents of the respondents that if they could not account for the goods, then a demand would be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Prior to making the demand on 3 July 2007, the respondents informed the Collector of facts adverted to earlier, including that the cigarettes were unlikely to enter the home market because they were stale and were a brand not ordinarily sold in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">21 The respondents contend that if this account was, in the words of Owen J, "one upon which [the Collector] was bound to be satisfied that the revenue had not suffered or would not be likely to suffer," then the demand should not have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">(Strictly speaking, the respondents never explicitly challenged the validity of the demand, but it is tolerably clear that this is the point of their accounting argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">) In oral argument, counsel conceded that the Collector has a discretion whether to accept an accounting and that the only way to show that an exercise of the discretion had miscarried would be to show that the Collector, on the facts before him, had no alternative but to be satisfied that the respondents had suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">22 In this case, always assuming for the sake of argument that the views of Owen J represent binding authority, I do not consider that the Collector was bound to be satisfied by the respondents' accounting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The unchallenged evidence was that one Mr Lee, attempting to sell stale and unmarked Affair cigarettes to sailors, managed in the course of 18 months to sell roughly 300 packets at $1.50 per packet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">When it was put to counsel that this evidence showed only that the threat to the revenue from the stolen cigarettes was on the light side, but not that there was no threat, he argued that no reasonable Collector would consider it a threat such as to justify rejection of the accounting given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">23 One problem with this submission is that this action is an action for a debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">There is no cross claim to review the reasonableness of the Collector's decision to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Putting that problem to one side, the only way the respondents could succeed under Owen J's test would be to demonstrate that there was no threat to the revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">For example, suppose the facts were that, at the time of the theft, the cigarettes were not just stale, but were waterlogged and covered in mould.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">In those circumstances it might be accepted that, on Owen J's approach, the Collector, having requested an accounting, was bound to be satisfied by the response given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">24 That is not this case, however.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Here, the facts were such that it was open for the Collector to consider that there was still some risk of loss to the revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Thus he was not bound to be satisfied by the accounting given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">25 Although I need go no further, because it might be said there is some unfairness about the result in this case I ought to say a few words about that topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">First of all, it is distinctly possible that s 35A can produce unfair results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">For example, the duty to keep goods safe has been held to be nearly absolute: Southern Shipping at 287 (stating that only force majeure might be an exception to the duty); see also Sidebottom at [11].</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Thus, short of a showing that, say, Godzilla had stomped the warehouse, the respondents could not avoid liability for a failure to keep dutiable goods safe, no matter how many precautions they had taken in an attempt to safeguard the cigarettes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Moreover, even under Owen J's approach, a Collector is not required to request an accounting where the duty to keep safe has been breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Thus, even in the hypothetical of the waterlogged and utterly worthless cigarettes, if a Collector were to simply present a demand without mentioning an accounting, that would be the end of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">26 What then is a person in the position of the respondents, who has failed to keep goods safely but considers that the loss of the goods poses little threat to the revenue, to do?</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The answer is the second response to the charge of unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The respondents' proper course is to seek a refund, rebate, or remission of the payment under s 163 of the Customs Act and reg 126, on any qualifying basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">If the application for remission is wrongly rejected by the Collector the applicant can then seek merits review of that decision before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Alternatively, the applicant may seek judicial review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">27 I will order that the respondents pay the applicant the amount claimed in the demand together with the costs of this action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
