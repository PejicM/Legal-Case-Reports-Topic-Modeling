<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 16 March 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made 16 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship who formed the view that the appellant is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 , amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 (Convention) and accordingly refused to grant a protection visa on 19 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">CLAIMS MADE TO REFUGEE STATUS 
 Article 1A(2) of the Convention relevantly defines a refugee as any person who: 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who arrived in Australia on 4 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On 18 March 2008 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, which included a statement of his circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">A delegate of the Minister refused the application for a protection visa on 19 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 16 June 2008 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In his application, the appellant claimed to fear persecution because of his support for the Nepali Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He claimed that because of his support he became a target of Maoist insurgents in and around his village in about 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He claimed that the Maoists used his farm for shelter and forced the appellant and his family to feed them and that when he protested he was beaten and robbed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He claimed the Maoists also bombed his house, completely destroying it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The appellant stated that after his house was destroyed he and his family moved to his parents' house in the city where he started a small business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He claimed that the Maoists targeted him again, in about 2006, requiring him to make "donations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">When he was not able to make any more payments, the Maoists beat him and threatened to kill him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">They used his shop for their own personal use and stole his goods, forcing him to close the business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He stated that he had no choice but to leave the country, and as he had family in Australia, he came to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant provided additional information to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 The Tribunal by reference to the definition of a refugee in Art 1A(2) of the Convention noted, with respect correctly, that there are four key elements to the Convention definition: The Tribunal found that the appellant was "not a generally credible witness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal stated that the appellant had shown that he was "willing to embellish, if not fabricate", his claims in order to invoke refugee protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">This finding was based on four stated reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">First, the Tribunal noted that following his time in the city, he returned to the village and farm between 2006 and 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, the evidence that he worked on his farm in this period, which did not appear in his initial statement in support of his application for a protection visa, only came out through a "considerable effort on the Tribunal's part".</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">At [39] of the Tribunal reasons, the Tribunal found: 
 It took considerable effort on the Tribunal's part to elicit the immediately above evidence from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">For instance, he said in turn that he had not been able to do any work between July 2006 (when he returned to his farm) and February 2008 (when he departed Nepal); then that he had done some farming work and general merchandise work during that period; then he denied having worked at all (July 2006 --- February 2008) saying his previous response arose from a misunderstanding of the Tribunal's questions; then he agreed that he did work on his farm during this period (ie July 2006 to February 2008).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Further, the Tribunal had to repeatedly put questions to the applicant as he appeared not to provide meaningful responses to questions put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The present Tribunal has utilised the hearing interpreter on previous occasions and this problem had not occurred before (at least with this interpreter).</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Further, the Tribunal was eventually able to obtain apparently meaningful responses to questions put to the applicant after repeatedly asking same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">At any rate, this has led the Tribunal to conclude the problems it had in eliciting evidence were not due to the fault of the interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 Secondly, the Tribunal found the appellant did not make any claims in his protection visa about having suffered any harm between July 2006 and February 2008 and rejected as false his explanations that he forgot to include details of the persecution he suffered in this period in his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Additionally, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant did not suffer any harm between July 2006 and February 2008 (when he departed Nepal).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Thirdly, the Tribunal noted that the appellant stated that he did not wish to travel to India because of the Maoist presence there but took no steps to ascertain whether the chance of harm in India was less than in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This also led the Tribunal to find that the appellant did not fear that he had a real chance of persecution between July 2006 and February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Fourthly, the Tribunal found that the appellant's delay in seeking a visa to come to Australia was inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution, dismissing his explanation for the delay (that he was waiting for his finances and english language ability to improve) as implausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal therefore further concluded that the appellant had not been harassed or harmed by Maoist insurgents between July 2006 and February 2008, dismissing his claims in this regard as false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In consequence of those four reasons, the Tribunal found at [46] --- [48] as follows: 
 Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied the applicant's oral claims at hearing to have been harassed and or harmed (persecuted) by Maoist insurgents between July 2006 and February 2008, to have been a recent invention submitted for the sole purpose of enhancing his prospects to invoke refugee protection obligations in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The Tribunal rejects same as false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal is therefore satisfied the applicant and his family, were able to reside and work safely on their farm in Nepal, between July 2006 and February 2008 (at which time the applicant departed Nepal and his wife and children returned to reside in his parent's home in Ghorahi City).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Tribunal is also satisfied the applicant was able to obtain work commensurate with his skills in Nepal (between July 2006 and February 2008) as a farmer and there is no evidence before it that has satisfied the Tribunal he would not again be able to do so should he return to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

 
 Further, even though the Tribunal accepts the applicant may have been subject to some form of harm by Maoists in 2002 (on his farm) and 2006 (in Ghorahi City), given the other adverse credibility findings herein, the Tribunal is satisfied he has (at the least) embellished these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

 
 The above findings have formed part of the reason the Tribunal was ultimately satisfied the applicant does not have a prospective real chance of persecution in Nepal; though further discussion of this is set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 The Tribunal was further satisfied that the appellant would not engage in the expression of his political opinion, but would voluntarily choose to focus on his business, career and family if he were now to return to his village in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">In making this finding the Tribunal noted that the appellant's "lack of knowledge and/or understanding about the Nepali Congress was indicative of a lack of any real interest on his part".</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Tribunal was also not satisfied that businessmen in Nepal were targeted by Maoists for any other reason than "opportunistically and for their perceived capacity to provide monies".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In making this finding the Tribunal noted that, based on independent country information, numerous other persons and occupations were similarly targeted by the Maoists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Overall, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant was not a witness of truth, rejecting all of his "material" claims as either an embellishment or fabrication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 Before the Federal Magistrate the appellant claimed that the Tribunal fell into error as it: (a) confined its consideration of the claims in relation to political opinion to the strength of the appellant's actual political opinion; 
(b) failed to have regard to whether the appellant might be persecuted for his perceived, imputed or actual political opinion; 
 
(c) failed to consider the extent of persecution of persons supporting or perceived to be supporting the Nepali Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Regarded the opportunistic targeting by Maoists of businessmen in Nepal as precluding a finding that persecution for opportunistic reasons could give rise to refugee obligations for businessmen in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">(a) failed to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable future in relation to the situation in Nepal in circumstances where it noted that Nepal was passing through a difficult period and its recent history had been tragic; 
(b) incorrectly considered the period between July 2006 and February 2008 in which the appellant had not been persecuted as necessarily determinative that there was no real chance of persecution in the future irrespective of the circumstances which might occur and irrespective of the appellant's claims of persecution prior to July 2008; 
 
(c) erred in confining its consideration of past persecution to the period of July 2006 and February 2008 in circumstances where the appellant had claimed persecution for about 9 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, was satisfied, first, that the Tribunal's decision was not based on the strength or weakness of his political views but rather on its finding that the appellant's interest in the Nepali Congress Party was not a real one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">His Honour also found that the appellant did not make a claim that he might be persecuted by reason of the imputation to him of a political opinion and that such a claim was not otherwise sufficiently apparent that the Tribunal was required to consider it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In relation to the second claimed ground, His Honour stated that the Tribunal had found that the targeting of Nepali businessmen was no different to the targeting of numerous other persons and occupations in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Therefore the conduct complained of could not be said to indicate that Nepali businessmen were being harassed because of their distinctive features or because of attributes peculiar to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Thirdly, his Honour found that the Tribunal had expressly taken into account the events that the appellant claimed had been ignored but had generally rejected all of his claims on credibility grounds and therefore did not err when concluding that the appellant did not face a real chance of persecution were he to return to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Having found no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 On 6 April 2009 the appellant filed in this Court a notice of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The grounds of appeal are substantially similar to those advanced in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The appellant claims that His Honour erred in the same way that the Tribunal erred, in failing to find that the Tribunal's decision was affected by jurisdictional error as it: (a) confined its consideration of the claims in relation to political opinion to the strength of the appellant's actual political opinion; 
(b) failed to have regard to whether the appellant might be persecuted for his perceived, imputed or actual political opinion; 
 
(c) failed to consider the extent of persecution of persons supporting or perceived to be supporting the Nepali Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Regarded the opportunistic targeting by Maoists of businessmen in Nepal as precluding a finding that persecution for opportunistic reasons could give rise to refugee obligations for businessmen in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">(a) failed to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable future in relation to the situation in Nepal in circumstances where it noted that Nepal was passing through a difficult period and its recent history had been tragic; 
(b) incorrectly considered the period between July 2006 and February 2008 in which the appellant had not been persecuted as necessarily determinative that there was no real chance of persecution in the future irrespective of the circumstances which might occur and irrespective of the appellant's claims of persecution prior to July 2008; 
 
(c) erred in confining its consideration of past persecution to the period of July 2006 and February 2008 in circumstances where the appellant had claimed persecution for about 9 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">CONSIDERATION 
 It is well established that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal is only available to be set aside upon judicial review if it involves "jurisdictional error".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Absent that, a decision refusing an applicant a protection visa will be "privative clause decision" for the purpose of s 474 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) from which no appeal or relief on judicial review is available: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [76].</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Plaintiff S157/2002 held that an error by an administrative tribunal such as the Refugee Review Tribunal will only constitute jurisdictional error if the Tribunal: 
&#9679; identifies a wrong issue;
 
&#9679; asks the wrong question;
 
&#9679; ignores relevant material; or
 
&#9679; relies on irrelevant material;
 
in such a way that the Tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected, resulting in a decision exceeding or failing to exercise the authority or powers given under the relevant statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It is also accepted (see Plaintiff S157/2002 211 CLR 476 at [76]) that there may also be jurisdictional error if a tribunal fails to discharge "imperative duties" or to observe "inviolable limitations or restraints" upon which its exercise of administrative powers is conditioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [82] ; Lobo v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 168 ; (2003) 200 ALR 359 at [45] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">However, where a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal refusing an applicant a protection visa turns entirely on an assessment of that applicant's credibility, a challenge to the Tribunal's findings and conclusions can only amount to an impermissible attempt to undertake further merits review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">This proposition has been affirmed in a number of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Recent examples include SZKMV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 157 at [18] per Stone J; SZMFH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 105 at [14] --- [15] per Graham J; SZMLR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1853 at [11] per Spender J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Accordingly, a finding by the Refugee Review Tribunal, which is not capable of being set aside on the basis of jurisdictional error, is a factual one which is not open to challenge by way of judicial review or on subsequent appellant proceedings: see NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">THE APPELLANT'S CREDIBILITY 
 The appellant was self represented before the Court and, although he said he had some english language and could read some english, communicated with the Court through a Nepalese interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The appellant had communicated with the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal in a similar way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">At no time has he been legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">He told the Court that a friend had helped him draft the grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There is no doubt that in Tribunal proceedings and Court proceedings, self representation is not usually the ideal way for a party to proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Nor is it always optimal for a party to communicate through an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Special care must always be taken by bodies such as tribunals and courts when dealing with self represented persons communicating through interpreters, especially when they are not familiar with the official processes in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Indeed, a case like this highlights the importance of persons in the position of the appellant telling their story to the initial finders of fact, such as the delegate of the Minister, and in particular, the Refugee Review Tribunal on review in as much appropriate detail as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This also highlights the importance for every member of a tribunal, particularly an inquisitorial tribunal like the Tribunal, to explore in an objective way the story that an applicant wishes to tell in seeking some right or entitlement or privilege from an administrative decision-maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">That said, it is understood that the Tribunal is not expected to make an applicant's case for them, although it is appropriate to consider claims that, while not expressly made, emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; 144 FCR 1 at [68] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; 78 ALJR 992 Gummow and Hayne JJ at [43], [44] considered that as the Refugee Review Tribunal was not under "a duty to inquire", but simply to provide a written statement setting out its decision on review, the reasons for the decision and the findings on any material questions of fact and referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings are based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However, Gleeson CJ at [16] and Callinan J at [126] appeared to countenance the possibility of circumstances where further inquiry may be necessary and appropriate in order to avoid unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 the High Court of Australia held that procedural fairness required the Refugee Review Tribunal to inform an applicant of the substance of an allegation made in a "dob in" letter held by the Tribunal before reaching a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne &amp; Heyden JJ) at [26] observed: 
 The Tribunal was not an independent arbiter charged with deciding an issue joined between adversaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Tribunal was required to review a decision of the Executive made under the Act and for that purpose the Tribunal was bound to make its own inquiries and form its own views upon the claim which the appellant made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">And the Tribunal had to decide whether the appellant was entitled to the visa he claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 It has been suggested, rightly in my view, that this decision means that if a tribunal is to meet common law natural justice obligations and is under an obligation to be satisfied that their decision is correct and preferable, then in order to achieve that stated satisfaction the tribunal may need to make further inquiries: Bedford N, and Creyke R, Inquisitorial Processes in Australian Tribunals (The Australian Institute of Judicial Administration Incorporated, 2006) p 44.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">There is in the event no question of procedural unfairness in this case or that the Tribunal did not have sufficient material before it to permit it to make material findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It did not therefore need to inquire further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In the end, the Tribunal made findings of fact, based on the credibility of the appellant which critically affected the outcome of the application before the Tribunal and the review before the Federal Magistrate, which also critically affect the outcome of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">When one reads the whole of the statement of decision and reasons of the Tribunal it is clear that the Tribunal accepted that there was much evidence to show generally an abuse of human rights in Nepal, the appellant's country of origin, in the relevant period that the appellant alleged abuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">As the Tribunal noted at [37] of its decision and reasons: 
 The Tribunal believes it uncontroversial to say the immediately above claims are prima facie plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The country information considered by the Tribunal supports the applicant's oral and written evidence that the Maoist insurgents were and are capable of acting in a brutal and arbitrary manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">

 The information before the Tribunal plainly indicated that the Maoist insurgents not uncommonly required a range of persons to make "donations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">This is plainly a euphemism for extortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">However the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant had suffered in the ways he alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That is to say, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had suffered acts of brutality in 2002, 2006 or in the period 2006 --- 2008, or that he had been subjected to the extortion in the city in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">It appears that the Tribunal initially accepted that the appellant's account of events, particularly in 2002 on his farm and in 2006 in the city where he then went, were plausible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">At [47], as noted above, the Tribunal concluded, in the context of assessing the credibility of the appellant's evidence in relation to his claims of persecution, that: 
 Further, even though the Tribunal accepts the applicant may have been subject to some form of harm by Maoists in 2002 (on his farm) and 2006 (in Ghorahi City), given the other adverse credibility findings herein, the Tribunal is satisfied he has (at the least) embellished these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 As noted earlier, the Tribunal took an adverse view of the appellant's credibility overall for four main reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">First, the Tribunal had difficulty in getting the appellant to provide a clear account of what he had been doing between 2006 (when he left the city and returned to his farm) and February 2008 (when he departed Nepal for Australia).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal was unimpressed with the account the appellant gave it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There were inconsistencies in that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal explained that this was not a case where the communication between the applicant and the Tribunal was affected by an interpreter's inability to properly assist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">This evidence on its own led the Tribunal to consider that the appellant was prepared to change his claims as he thought suited his case (see [40] of the Tribunal reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Secondly, the Tribunal was unimpressed with the fact that the appellant had not mentioned in his statement in support of his visa application that he had been harmed, harassed or even questioned after he returned to his village in July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Yet, when he gave oral evidence to the Tribunal about that period he made these claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Tribunal was not satisfied with the appellant's explanation that he must have forgotten to include these points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Thirdly, the Tribunal noticed that it had been open to the appellant to travel to India, given there was an "open border" between Nepal and India at material times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">He could have avoided persecution in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant's explanation --- that the Maoists were in India too and would find him --- was compelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Tribunal noted at [44]: 
 However, India is a large country and the Tribunal presumes he may have wished to ascertain with some certainty whether the chance of harm to him in India may be less than the chance of harm to him (and his family), in his home village in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">That he did not do this has formed part of the reason the Tribunal is satisfied the applicant did not fear he had a real chance of persecution in his village between July 2006 and February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">This was also the third reason that ultimately led the Tribunal to conclude the applicant is not a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">[emphasis in original] 
 The fourth and last reason that the Tribunal relied on to conclude the appellant was not a witness of truth was that he obtained a tourist visa to travel to Australia in late November 2007 and yet did not actually arrive in Australia until 4 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The Tribunal noted the appellant explained that he wished to improve his finances and his english language ability before travelling to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">However, the Tribunal noted: 
 With respect, the Tribunal does not believe it plausible that an applicant who feared harm amounting to persecution, would allow such matters to prevent them from removing themselves and their families, from a place where they had a well founded fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">
 The appellant does not appear to have expressly challenged these findings in respect of this credibility either before the Federal Magistrate on review or in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In his submissions to the Court, on this appeal, the appellant expressed some regret that the Tribunal did not find him to be a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He appealed to the Court to "show compassion" on the hearing of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In essence, however, the appellant appeared to accept that the credibility findings made against him were open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">In the event, I think it is fair to say that the credibility findings made against the appellant were open to the Tribunal and, to the extent the appellant may be taken to have implicitly challenged them, the findings must stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">No doubt in many cases it is a difficult decision for a Tribunal to make, whether a particular applicant has satisfied it that the account of the persecution they have claimed should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">As noted above by reference to the authorities, it is also very difficult for an applicant whose basic credibility has been challenged in Tribunal proceedings and found wanting to recover from that finding in further review and appeal proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It therefore goes without saying that it is of the utmost importance the Refugee Review Tribunal take special care before making such findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Thus, the importance of ensuring that an applicant before a Tribunal has had every opportunity, sometimes at the prompting of the tribunal itself, to fully explain their position so that misunderstanding or lack of information does not infect or affect the findings of fact, including on credibility, that a tribunal may ultimately make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Nonetheless, as I have noted above, there is no claim made in this case, either before the Federal Magistrate or before this Court that any relevant information was not taken into account by the Tribunal or that there has been some lack of procedural fairness so far as the Tribunal hearing was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In all the circumstances, while the third and fourth reasons for finding against the appellant on credibility grounds may not on their own have supported the finding ultimately made, it was at least open to the Tribunal to find, as it did, that the appellant had "embellished his evidence to the Tribunal" for all the reasons given.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It should be noted, however, that the Tribunal's finding in relevant respects was that the appellant had "embellished, if not entirely fabricated, his material claims" (see for example [44]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The Tribunal, in the end, was not satisfied that the appellant had made out his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">At no point did the Tribunal actually conclude that the appellant had in fact "fabricated" his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It seems the Tribunal was content to find on the materials and the evidence before it that the appellant had "embellished" his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Plainly the Tribunal was left in some doubt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Plainly it was not prepared to find that the material facts alleged by the appellant were so or not sufficiently made out to support a finding he was a person to whom protection should be afforded under the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In my view, it was unfortunate that the Tribunal used the expression that the appellant had "embellished, if not entirely fabricated, his material claims", as it may be considered to introduce an element of ambiguity into the Tribunal's own decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If a tribunal is not convinced that a person has simply made up their evidence --- that is, has lied ---then they, in my respectful opinion, should use expressions that imply such a view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">If a tribunal is of the view that evidence has been embellished such that it cannot be relied upon to support a finding of the material facts asserted by the claimant, then it should clearly state that to be the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The point is important, in my view, because if a tribunal is not satisfied that an applicant before it has in fact lied, but is of the view that the applicant has embellished evidence such that it cannot be relied upon, this will usually suggest there is some factual basis to the claims made, but that the tribunal cannot sort out fact from fiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">However, in some cases the Tribunal may still find itself able to find some facts which are relevant to the case at hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">There may well, for example, be circumstances where an applicant for a protection visa exaggerate, his or her claims of persecution for perfectly explicable reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">They may be so concerned to convince the decision-maker that they have suffered for a Convention-based reason, that they exaggerate their case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Or they may come from backgrounds where a certain degree of emphasis is required when dealing with administrative decision-makers in order to make their point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Whatever the reason for exaggeration it does not necessarily mean that there are still not relevant facts capable of being found to provide a Convention-based reason for granting a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Therefore, in my view, simply to say that an applicant has "embellished, if not entirely fabricated" a material claim, is not usually likely to be a helpful decision-making approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Indeed it may, on occasion, be considered a formula that avoids the difficult fact finding exercise that a Tribunal is often required to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Nonetheless, as indicated above, in this case, the credibility findings against the appellant have not been materially challenged before the Federal Magistrate or in the course of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Further, I consider that taking into the account the findings made by the Tribunal in relation to the evidence before it, and the reasons for the findings, the Tribunal's finding that it was not "satisfied" that a protection visa should be issued was open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The Tribunal was indeed alert to a number of the difficulties to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In [65] of its reasons the Tribunal acknowledged the difficulties of proof that may be faced by some applicants for refugee protection in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The Tribunal understood it may on occasion be appropriate to extend the benefit of the doubt to an applicant for refugee protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">However, a Tribunal was also aware that it should not uncritically accept any and all allegations made by an applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Tribunal also understood that it is not essential that a decision-maker necessarily have rebutting evidence available to them before they can find that a particular factual assertion has not been made out, and that usually it is not the Tribunal's role to make the applicant's case for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">As noted, the Tribunal did no accept that the applicant was a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">However, having dealt with particular claims of the appellant, at [66], the Tribunal went further and concluded that it was sufficiently satisfied that the applicant was not a witness of truth, "such that I am satisfied there are reasonable grounds to reject all his material claims".</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Tribunal added: 
 Thus, to the extent I have not expressly rejected his claims herein, I now find that none of the applicant's material claims to invoke refugee protection obligations in Australia are true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">
 In my view, this is a less than desirable way to find the existence of material facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">To the extent that the Tribunal has dealt with particular material claims made by the applicant and explained why they should not be relied upon, the Tribunal's findings are appropriate and acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">However, a sweeping rejection of the reliability of "all material claims" is, I consider, an inappropriate way to find facts in many cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">In this case, counsel for the Minister, in reliance on this finding, submitted that the appellant was unable to demonstrate even a subjective fear of persecution, let alone an objective fear on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">However, the question of a subjective fear was never directly addressed by the Tribunal and I am not prepared to find that the generalised rejection of his material claims extends to an unexpressed finding that he lacked a subjective fear of persecution if her were to return to his country of origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">GROUND 1 
 As noted above, this ground complains that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error when it: 
 (a) confined its consideration of the claims in relation to political opinion to the strength of the applicant's actual political opinion; and/or
 (b) failed to have regard to whether the applicant might be persecuted for his perceived, imputed or actual political opinion, even if, that political opinion was not strongly held; and/or 
 (c) failed to consider the extent of persecution of persons supporting or perceived or imputed to support the Nepali Congress (Party).</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 At [57] of the Tribunal's decision and reasons, the Tribunal observed: 
 That said, given the above relevant evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied the applicant would choose not to engage in the expression of his political opinion in Nepal for reasons other than fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The Tribunal is satisfied the applicant's lack of knowledge or understanding about the Nepali Congress is indicative of a lack of any real interest on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that should the applicant return to Nepal, he would voluntarily choose to again focus on his business, career and family as he has done in the past, and not on his political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The Tribunal is therefore not satisfied the applicant's claimed political opinion would give rise to a well founded fear of persecution for him should he return to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">
 This reasoning of the Tribunal is open to the interpretation that while the appellant may have political opinions, he will choose not to express them when he returns to Nepal and therefore will not find himself in a position where he is likely to be persecuted for his opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The first and third sentences of the quoted paragraph certainly suggest this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">On the other hand, the second sentence indicates that the Tribunal considered that due to a lack of knowledge or understanding about Nepali Congress, the appellant lacks any real interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">I do not think it is possible to take the Tribunal's later general finding at [66], that none of the material claims made by the appellant to be true, to mean that the Tribunal actually found, for example, that the appellant does not generally support Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">The only reasonable conclusion to draw from the way the Tribunal has expressed its reasons is that, as stated in [57], the appellant has no real interest in Nepali Congress or holds no real political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">This is what the Federal Magistrate found in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In many respects it is an odd finding that the Tribunal has made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It seems to assume that only persons who have active or currently expressed political opinions are able to establish a well founded fear of persecution for possessing political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">This indeed leads into the second part of the first ground, namely, that the Tribunal failed to have regard to whether the applicant might be persecuted for his perceived, imputed or actual political opinions, even if not strongly held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Perhaps the Tribunal's finding in the end is intended to convey that the appellant, on the evidence, not only does not have any actual political opinions of his own, but also does not have any perceived or imputed political opinion for which he is likely to suffer persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In other words, that he has no political opinions either strongly held or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">This is consistent with a finding that he has no real interest in Nepali Congress or political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The third part of the first ground asserts that the Tribunal failed to consider the extent of the persecution of persons supporting or perceived or imputed to support the Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The Minister contends that ground 1(a) is answered by the fact that the Tribunal completely rejected all the appellant's material claims --- which included his claim to be a supporter of the Nepali Congress Party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">As I have indicated, I think the generalised finding to this effect at [66] is not usually an appropriate way to find material facts should not be relied upon in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">However, the evidence generally supports this finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">In this case, the Minister says the answer to ground 1(b) is that the claim was not made explicitly and did not arise squarely from the material before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">As indicated below, not only was the claim not made explicitly but on the facts it did not arise at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Minister says the answer to ground 1(c) is that the claim to have been a supporter of the Nepali Congress Party was rejected and there was no claim of being perceived or imputed as being such a supporter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">This too is substantially so on the facts as found by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The Minister's responses to the three parts of ground 1 seem in the end to revolve entirely around the Tribunal's finding in the second sentence of [57] that the appellant lacked knowledge or understanding about the Nepali Congress, which was indicative of a lack of any real interest on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Plainly this finding is not tantamount to a finding that the appellant did not know of the Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">It is simply a finding that he lacked any real interest in that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In this context, as suggested above, the proper understanding of the expression of the Tribunal's finding seems to be that not only has the appellant, on the evidence, been demonstrated not to be politically active, but also that he is not politically interested and is not an actual, perceived or imputed supporter of the Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">In the event, I consider this is the proper basis upon which the Tribunal's expression of its finding in [57] is to be understood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">In other words, the Tribunal found that, at various times, the appellant has been a farmer and then a business operator in the city without ever holding any particular views or being active in his support for, or perceived or imputed to be a supporter of, Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">For that reason, he cannot have a well founded fear of persecution, for a perceived or imputed or actual political opinion that he holds concerning Nepali Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Accordingly, to the extent that a contrary submission arose in the context of the hearing before it, the Tribunal rejected the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">GROUND 2 
 This ground asserts that the Minister made a jurisdictional error: 
 by regarding the targeting by Maoists of business men in Nepal being 'opportunistic' as precluding a finding that persecution for opportunistic reasons could give a rise to refugee obligations for business men in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 As noted above, the Tribunal generally accepted that Maoists act in a brutal and arbitrary manner in Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">This finding at [49] seems to accept that Maoists also target businessmen and extort "donations" from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">What is confusing though, in the Tribunal's reasons at [49], is the expression of the reasons why the appellant is unlikely to be targeted if he were to return to Nepal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The Tribunal there states: 
 However, the Tribunal is not satisfied the applicant was subject to, or had a well founded fear of, harm in Nepal between July 2006 and February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">As stated above, the Tribunal is not satisfied the applicant was subject to any harm, including extortion by Maoists, after July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Nor is the Tribunal satisfied, based on the evidence before it, which it has accepted, that the applicant would be unable to obtain work commensurate with his skills (as a farmer) in his village should he return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 The Tribunal here has focussed on the period after July 2006 --- that is to say, after the appellant left the city and returned to his village and farm before leaving for Australia in 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The Tribunal seems to thereby avoid making any clear findings about whether or not, while in the city, the appellant suffered extortion in the operation of his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">When one goes back to the finding in [47] that "even though the Tribunal accepts the applicant may have been subject to some form of harm by Maoists in 2002 (on his farm) and 2006 (in Ghorahi City), given the other adverse credibility findings herein, the Tribunal is satisfied he has (at the least) embellished these claims", it seems the Tribunal was prepared to accept that there "may have been" some extortion in the city in 2006, yet now discounts the relevance of that possibility because nothing apparently happened to the applicant after July 2006 when he returned to his farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Furthermore, the Tribunal seems to be satisfied that if the appellant confines himself to farming --- and refrains from taking up the challenge of running a business again in the city --- then he should be safe from targeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">In these circumstances, the Tribunal's finding at [66] that, to the extent the Tribunal has "not expressly rejected his material claims herein, I now find that none of the applicant's material claims ... are true", seems rather gratuitous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In my view, as suggested above, for a tribunal to make a generalised finding of fact along these lines is tantamount to making no material findings of fact at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It is an inappropriate practice that should be avoided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The question remains however, whether, if it be the case that the appellant may have been subject to extortion in 2006 while operating as a businessman in Ghorahi City, that conduct bespeaks a real risk of suffering harm by reason of political opinion and/or membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The Tribunal understood that the appellant's claims constituted a legal submission that he was a member of a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention on the basis that he was "a businessman" and that businessmen as a group were and are targeted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">In response to this claim --- that businessmen are targeted as a particular social group --- the Tribunal first found at [58]: 
 As the Tribunal has rejected the applicant's evidence as to his political convictions, it does not understand it need further consider whether the applicant was a member of a PSG [particular social group] for the purposes of the Refugees Convention with respect to his political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">
 This is a finding that does not make logical sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Even if it were the case that a person is shown to be apolitical, in the sense that they do not hold actual political opinions, or there is no evidence to suggest they ordinarily express political opinions, if they are nonetheless a member of a particular social group, which group is taken to express or stand for certain political opinions, then membership of the group may well lead to the imputation of political opinion in relation to each and every member of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Accordingly, the quick dismissal by the Tribunal of this submission for the reason that the Tribunal had already found that the appellant does not personally have "political convictions", lacks solid reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">However, the Tribunal then went on to find that, in any event, businessmen are apparently randomly targeted for extortion in Nepal and, for that reason, (like other persons and occupations) are targeted for opportunistic reasons because they are perceived for having the capacity to provide monies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In this regard, counsel for the Minister draws attention to the decision of the Full Federal Court in RAM v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1995] FCA 1333 ; (1995) 57 FCR 565.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">At 569, Burchett J (with whom O'Loughlin J agreed) stated: 
 In the present case, quite apart from the difficulty of seeing wealthy Punjabis living in circumstances which make them vulnerable to extortion as a sufficient group, it is the greater difficulty of saying that the attacks feared by the appellant would be for reasons of his membership of that group which, it seems to me, he cannot overcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Plainly, extortionists are not implementing a policy; they are simply extracting money from a suitable victim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Their forays are disinterestedly individual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">
 RD Nicholson J also agreed with the judgment of Burchett J but added that the possession of wealth is capable, in the appropriate circumstances, of constituting those who possess it as members of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In a passage I would respectfully agree with, His Honour noted at 570: 
 Wealth is no different in this respect to land ownership...</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The learned judge at first instance recognised this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">He also found, correctly in my view, that there was no evidentiary support that the society to which the appellant belonged recognised the characteristic of wealth as alone creating an identifiable group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">His Honour also found that the group posited (the rich) was too vague, uncertain and extraordinarily wide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Such difficulties are not necessarily obstacles to 'the rich' constituting a particular social group where the evidence establishes that wealth is definitive of such a group, although evidence of width may inhibit findings of particularity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">
 To similar effect it may be argued, as I think the Tribunal ultimately found, that the evidence did not support a finding that businessmen, as a particular social group in Nepal suffered extortion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Rather, individual businessmen were targeted opportunistically for their perceived capacity to provide, if necessary by force, money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">In these circumstances Ground 2 must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">GROUND 3 
 This ground asserts that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by: 
 (a) Failing to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable future in relation to the situation in Nepal in circumstances where the Second Respondent noted that Nepal was passing through a difficult period and its recent history had been tragic; and/or
 (b) Regarding a period between July 2006 and February 2008 in which the applicant had not been persecuted as necessarily determinative that there was no real chance of persecution in the future irrespective of the circumstances which might occur in the future and irrespective of the applicant's claims of persecution prior to July 2008; and/or
 (c) Confining its consideration of past persecution to a closed period of between July 2006 and February 2008 in circumstances where the Second Respondent acknowledged that the applicant claimed persecution for about 9 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 There is no doubt the Tribunal accepted that Nepal is passing through a difficult period and its recent history has been tragic: see [64] of its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">What the Tribunal did decide in respect of the appellant, however, is that he could safely reside in his village and work as a farmer if he were to return to Nepal, because he was safely able to live in his village and work as a farmer between July 2006 and February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">For that reason the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a real chance of being persecuted for a Convention-based reason should he return to his village and work as a farmer: [64] of the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This reasoning at [64] of the Tribunal's reasons must be understood in the light of the other findings made by the Tribunal in respect of the credibility of the appellant, to the effect that the appellant had embellished his claims to have suffered harm by Maoists in 2002 on his farm, and in 2006 in Ghorahi City; and that the appellant lacked knowledge or understanding about the Nepali Congress and thereby lacked any real interest in the party and was not focussed on his political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">At [53] the Tribunal, after analysing the extent of the appellant's political opinion, seems to have formed the view that, while Maoists may have targeted the appellant prior to July 2006, this was only for the reason of obtaining donations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">As to the appellant's fear of being targeted prior to going to the city, the Tribunal made very specific findings of fact that, save to accept that the appellant "may have been subject to some form of harm" on his farm in 2002, he had "embellished" that claim: see [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">In light of this finding, I do not consider that the finding of the Tribunal at [66] (that none of the applicant's material claims are true) applies to this particular reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">What the Tribunal seems to have decided, however, is that because the appellant had not demonstrated that any harm had come to him in the period after 2008 when he returned to the farm from the city, it may be assumed that he was no longer at risk if he lived in his village and on the farm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, at [64] the Tribunal concluded that: 
 However, based on its findings as to the applicant's capacity to safely reside in his village and work as a farmer between July 2006 and February 2008, the Tribunal is not satisfied he has a real chance of being persecuted for a Convention reason should he return to his village and work as a farmer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">
 It seems to me that the Tribunal's finding, having regard to the whole of the evidence, was open, as the Federal Magistrate decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">While the Tribunal appears to have accepted that there was some evidence targeting the appellant while he was on the farm in 2002, taking into account the evidence concerning his period back on the farm between 2006 and February 2008, the overall conclusion was that he is not at real risk of being persecuted for a Convention-based reason should he return to his village and work as a farmer today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">As I say, having regard to the evidence of what apparently transpired between July 2006 and February 2008, and the particular findings of fact made by the Tribunal were open to it (that indeed nothing untoward did happen in that period) then it appears to me that the Tribunal was entitled to conclude that there was no real chance of persecution in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The Federal Magistrate held to similar effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">In the result, I think the Tribunal is properly to be understood as saying two things: I consider that the claimed jurisdictional error on the basis of Ground 3 is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 For these reasons, the appeal of the appellant against the decision of the Federal Magistrate should be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Court therefore orders: The appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The appellant to pay the First Respondent's costs, to be taxed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">I certify that the preceding one hundred and five (105) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Barker.</sentence>
