1 I have before me an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones made on 30 October 2006, supported by an affidavit of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Both the application and the affidavit were filed on 21 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The affidavit exhibits a notice of appeal which seeks to agitate particular grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The matter was listed for determination at 10.15am this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The matter was called at approximately 25 past 10.00am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Since sufficient time has elapsed to enable the applicant to appear before the court to agitate the merits of the application and the applicant has not appeared, I propose to deal with the application from the respondent that the matter be dismissed for non-appearance on the part of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 Accordingly, I dismiss the matter on that footing, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 I have an application from the respondent in relation to the quantum of the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The proposition that is put to the court is that the solicitor-client costs associated with the preparation of a response to the application and incurred in addressing the merits of the application on a solicitor-client basis are approximately $2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The respondent seeks an order for quantum of costs at $1,300 and I am prepared to make an order in relation to this matter on the papers at $1,300 and therefore fix the costs payable by the applicant to the respondent in that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 I make a direction that the title of the respondent be amended from Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to 'Minister for Immigration and Citizenship' and that that respondent become the first respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Consistent with authority, I make an order that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as a second respondent in the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
