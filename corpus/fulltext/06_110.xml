<sentence id="s0">
 (COSTS) 
 
1 These proceedings were dismissed on the first day of hearing on the Commissioner's concession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">This followed a motion by the applicants in each case to strike out certain allegations in the Commissioner's Amended Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The applicants are entitled to their costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They submit that these costs should be taxed and paid on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They submit that the Commissioner has not acted as a model litigant in pursuing these actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Issues raised by the Commissioner in them were not part of the objection decisions and are inconsistent with the income in question, being that of Raftland Pty Ltd, the applicant in Q173 of 202, the case which the Commissioner pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">They allege that the Commissioner has not acted with propriety and that this is shown by the lateness of the concession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 I do not consider there is any evidence of impropriety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It is regrettable that costs were incurred on unnecessary issues and that they were not conceded at an earlier point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On the other hand if the actions were plainly not maintainable one would have expected the applicants to apply to strike them out at an early point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Litigation is often conducted on alternative bases and upon issues which cannot all be successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">A successful party may sometimes be deprived of costs on unmeritorious issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I do not however think that it is suggested that, in every case where alternative claims are made, that an order for indemnity costs should follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">In the present case there are no matters in the Commissioner's conduct of the litigation which suggest that that course is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 There will be orders in each proceeding that the Commissioner pay the applicants' costs of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kiefel.</sentence>
