1 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in SZKGS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2007] FMCA 1549.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The learned Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the first respondent) (in both cases, "the Minister"), refusing to grant to the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant has raised several issues about the correctness of the Tribunal's decision, some of which, if made out, might raise jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Section 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") provides that there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The terms Refugees Convention and Refugees Protocol are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It is convenient to call both of these documents taken together the "Convention".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The appellant arrived in Australia on 10 September 2006, in possession of a valid visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">On 3 October 2006, he applied to what was then called the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">His application was considered by a delegate of the Minister and rejected in a decision made on 19 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Tribunal conducted a hearing on 3 January 2007, at which the appellant attended and gave evidence and made submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 8 January 2007, the Tribunal signed a decision, which was handed down on 25 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 The appellant then applied to the Federal Magistrates Court, seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the Tribunal's decision, a writ of mandamus compelling the Tribunal to hear and determine the application according to law and a writ of prohibition directed to the Minister to prevent action being taken in reliance on the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">His amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court contained effectively three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The first was that the Tribunal was biased against him and failed to consider his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The second was that the Tribunal failed to assess the chance of the appellant being persecuted on his return to China because of his practice of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The third was that the Tribunal failed to give the appellant notice, in accordance with s 424A of the Migration Act , of particulars of information that formed part of the reason for affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">None of these grounds was accompanied by any particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Federal Magistrate rejected all of the grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In addition, the appellant appears to have argued before the Federal Magistrates Court that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 91R of the Migration Act , which contains a definition of persecution and examples of the sorts of things that constitute serious harm for the purposes of that definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">5 The appellant's claims depended upon the proposition that he was a Falun Gong practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He said that he had been arrested, detained and tortured in China and had lost his job because of practising Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal accepted that Falun Gong might be considered to be a religion, and that those practising Falun Gong might constitute a particular social group for the purposes of the application of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal also accepted that Falun Gong practitioners face persecution in China and that such persecution is for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was involved with Falun Gong as he claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In particular, the Tribunal made the following findings:
 
 The Tribunal finds that the applicant's knowledge of Falun Gong was extremely limited and not consistent with the level of knowledge that may be expected from a practitioner of more than ten years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">For this reason, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant was a Falun Gong practitioner or that he had at any time practised the exercises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 ... 
 
 The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has practised Falun Gong in Australia, either in public or in private or that he was engaged with Falun Gong in any other manner in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">
 
 The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner and that if he returns to China now or in the foreseeable future, he will not engage in the practice of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal finds that the applicant will not face persecution in China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future because of his involvement with, or the practise [ sic ] of, Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 As the Tribunal found that the applicant was not involved in the practise [ sic ] of Falun Gong in the past, the Tribunal also rejects the applicant's claim that he was detained by the authorities in 1999 and in 2004 as a Falun Gong practitioner or that he was subsequently interrogated or monitored by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 ... 
 
 The Tribunal does not accept the applicant's claim that he had lost his job in 1997 as a result of being a Falun Gong practitioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 ... 
 
 The Tribunal rejects the applicant's claim that he was on a black list with the Chinese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">When asked how he was able to obtain a passport and depart the country lawfully, the applicant claimed that perhaps the blacklist [ sic ] was only a local one and his name was not on the internet and the authorities were unaware of the applicant being on a black list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal does not accept that explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The independent country information cited above suggests that there are stringent procedures involved in issuing passports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant was able to obtain the passport only because he paid a bribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant is on the "black list" or that he is of any interest to the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 ... 
 
 As the Tribunal found that the applicant was not engaged in the practise [ sic ] of Falun Gong in China, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's spouse lost her job and that his child had difficulties with schooling for the reason of the applicant's involvement with Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 

7 For these reasons, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution as a Falun Gong practitioner if he should return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">8 Although expressed differently, the three grounds appearing in the notice of appeal from the Federal Magistrate's judgment are similar in substance to the grounds of the appellant's amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The grounds of appeal are:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The Tribunal failed to consider my claims for my application for a protection visa because of the Tribunal's bias towards me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal also committed jurisdictional error by failing to give me in accordance with S424A of the Migration Act 1958 notice in writing of particulars of information that formed part of the reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal failed to assess the chance of the persecution I would suffer on my return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">


 
9 In addition to these grounds, the appellant mentioned in the course of the appeal s 91R of the Migration Act , and argued that he was denied the opportunity to present his case in the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">These are grounds not raised in the Federal Magistrates Court, although s 91R was apparently argued in that court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The appellant would need leave to raise additional grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Leave would only be granted if he were able to show that he had an arguable case in relation to such a ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">10 In relation to the ground of bias there can be no question that the Federal Magistrate was correct in rejecting the proposition that the Tribunal displayed apprehended bias towards the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Federal Magistrate applied the correct test at [13] of his reasons for judgment, ie whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Both in the Federal Magistrates Court and in this Court the ground of bias was not particularised and no specific reference was made to anything said or done by the Tribunal that would indicate anything other than impartiality on its part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The appellant did not invite the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court to look at the transcript of the hearing of the Tribunal to see whether the Tribunal had displayed antipathy towards the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The appellant's argument on this ground seems to stem from the fact that the Tribunal rejected his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The mere rejection of a claim cannot itself demonstrate bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Even though the Tribunal made adverse findings as to the appellant's credit and expressed them in firm terms, it cannot be said that the Tribunal was biased against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">When the Tribunal's reasons are examined, it can be seen that it had ample reason for making its findings that the appellant was not a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">11 The ground invoking s 424A of the Migration Act requires closer examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Section 424A so far as relevant to this proceeding provides:
 
 (1) Subject to subsection (3), the Tribunal must: 
 
 (a) give to the applicant...particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the 
 reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and 
 
 (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant 
 understands why it is relevant to the review; and 
 
 (c) invite the applicant to comment on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
 ... 
 
 (3) This section does not apply to information: 
 
 (a) that is not specifically about the applicant or another person 
 and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or 
 other person is a member; 
 
 
 
 
 
 

12 The Tribunal sent to the appellant a letter dated 5 December 2006, inviting him to comment on certain items of information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">These included the facts that: his passport was issued on 28 April 2006; his Australian visa was issued in September 2006; he was issued with visas for Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2006; and in his application for a protection visa, he stated that he left China legally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Tribunal's letter said that this information was relevant as it may indicate that the appellant was of no interest to the Chinese authorities as a Falun Gong practitioner or for any other reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The information may also cause the Tribunal to question the credibility and the authenticity of the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Further, when applying for a protection visa, the appellant had stated that he worked at a plastics factory from 1989 to 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">He was issued with a short stay business visa to travel to Australia on 1 September 2006, on the basis that he intended to travel to Australia for business purposes, related to his employment or business activities in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The Tribunal thought this information was relevant as: it may indicate that he was able to engage in employment or business activities in China until his departure for Australia, which may indicate that he was of no interest to the Chinese authorities as a Falun Gong practitioner; it might have caused the Tribunal to reject his claim that his wife had lost her job because of his engagement in Falun Gong activities; and it might also have caused the Tribunal to question his credibility and the authenticity of his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Finally, the Tribunal's letter referred to information that the appellant was granted visas for Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">He travelled to these countries in 2006, did not seek asylum, and returned to China after each trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Tribunal considered this information to be relevant as it might have indicated that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in China and might have caused the Tribunal to question his credibility and the authenticity of his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The appellant replied briefly to this letter, by letter dated 28 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In essence, he did not contest any of the factual issues referred to in the letter of 5 December.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">He asserted that his purpose was to seek protection from the Australian Government and he would not be able to get protection from any other country except Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">13 The Federal Magistrate dealt very briefly with the ground raising failure to comply with s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">His Honour drew attention to the fact that no particulars were provided and that it had not been shown that the letter of 5 December 2006 did not comply with s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">On that basis, his Honour rejected the appellant's application on that ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">14 In its reasons for decision, under the heading "Evidence from other sources", the Tribunal dealt with information it had received other than from the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That information falls into two parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The first part concerns the nature of Falun Gong and the manner in which China's authorities deal with Falun Gong practitioners in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">That information might be said to have assisted the appellant in establishing his claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The other part of the information was described by the Tribunal in the following terms:
 
 With respect to exit procedures operating in China, the available sources indicate that freedom to travel overseas is generally the case, although passports are difficult to obtain for certain classes of dissident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">More recently, following the defection in May 2005 of a political affairs counsellor at the Chinese consulate in Sydney and his applying for asylum in Australia, the media reported that China's rules for issuing and renewing passports was becoming more stringent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">


 
 The sources also indicate that the Chinese government maintains lists of people wanted by the authorities for whom arrest warrants have been issued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 These lists are usually called "wanted lists" or "most wanted lists".</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">


 
15 In a footnote to this passage in its reasons for decision, the Tribunal cited a number of sources apparently relied on to support these propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">It is clear that the information summarised in this way was part of the reason for affirming the decision under review, in the Tribunal's view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">This is made apparent by the sentence in the Tribunal's reasons for decision:
 
 The independent country information cited above suggests that there are stringent procedures involved in issuing passports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">


 
It is also clear from the rest of the paragraph in which that sentence appeared that the Tribunal relied on the information about "wanted lists" and "most wanted lists" to reject the appellant's claim that he was on a blacklist, in the light of the fact that the appellant was able to obtain a passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">16 The information therefore falls within s 424A(1) of the Migration Act , unless excluded by s 424A(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Tribunal did not give to the appellant notice in the form required by s 424A(1) about this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The information was plainly not specifically about the appellant or about any other relevant person, and is not about a class of persons of which any other relevant person is a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Accepting as I do that the remaining words of s 424A(3)(a) impose an additional requirement and do not merely amplify the opening words of that paragraph, the question is whether the information was just about a class of persons of which the appellant was a member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">In my view, the appellant could be said to have been a member of a class of persons described as "persons applying for passports".</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He could also have been said to belong to a class of persons described as "persons leaving China".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The information that the greater stringency about issuing and renewing passports followed the defection of a political affairs counsellor at the Chinese Consulate in Sydney in May 2005, can be viewed as the Tribunal's recital of the reason for greater stringency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">On this view, the information about issuing and renewing passports and the information about wanted lists, or most wanted lists, fell within s 424A(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Section 424A(1) did not apply to it, therefore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal was not obliged to give particulars of the information to the appellant or to invite him to comment on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">17 In the result, the narrow view taken by the Federal Magistrate of the s 424A ground did not affect the result of the application before the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The appellant has not demonstrated error on the part of the Federal Magistrate that would entitle him to succeed on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">18 The Federal Magistrate dealt briefly, but correctly, with the ground that the Tribunal failed to assess the chance of persecution, should the appellant return to China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">As his Honour pointed out, the Tribunal did consider the issue and determined against the appellant that there was no real chance that he would face any harm because of his alleged involvement with Falun Gong, or his alleged practice of Falun Gong, or his alleged association with Falun Gong practitioners, or for any other Convention-related reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The appellant merely seeks to overturn the factual findings of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Neither the Federal Magistrates Court, nor this Court, can overturn those factual findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">19 Similarly, the Federal Magistrate appears to have dealt correctly with the allegation that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 91R of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Although the appellant referred to that section, he never articulated how it was that the Tribunal failed to apply it correctly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal referred to the section in its reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">There is nothing to indicate that it misapplied the section or that it misunderstood the nature of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">20 This brings me to the final matter argued on this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">This was that the appellant was denied a proper opportunity to present his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The appellant said that the questions asked of him by the Tribunal did not permit him to expand sufficiently on his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The appellant told me that he received assistance in preparing his original application for a protection visa from a bilingual friend, to whom he was introduced, who apparently had some experience in assisting people with applications for visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">When the appellant applied for a protection visa, that person typed various parts of the application form and an accompanying statement for which the appellant provided the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The same person assisted the appellant with his application to the Tribunal for review of the decision of the delegate of the Minister, and with the letter of 28 December 2006, in which the appellant responded to the letter of 5 December 2006 from the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">21 In the course of the hearing of the appeal I took the appellant in some detail to the information that was particularised in the letter of 5 December.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He told me that the reason he did not apply for asylum in the countries he visited in 2006, other than Australia, was that he visited those countries as part of a tourist group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The tour guide had possession of his passport and he did not have the opportunity to use it to apply for asylum in those countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The appellant did not tell the Tribunal this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">He agreed with me, however, that nothing that the Tribunal did or failed to do deprived him of the opportunity to tell the Tribunal this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">Although the appellant may have been hampered by his lack of English and perhaps by the inadequacy of the English of his friend who typed the letter of 28 December 2006, and his failure to tell the Tribunal the full story in that letter may have been the result of these disadvantages, the appellant agreed that these matters were not the fault of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">22 I also drew the appellant's attention to the way in which the Tribunal summarised in its reasons for decision the evidence at the Tribunal hearing in relation to these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">That summary contains the following:
 
 The Tribunal noted that the applicant's passport indicated that the applicant travelled to Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The Tribunal asked the applicant for the purpose of this travel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The applicant said that he was following one of his friends to have a look at these countries because it was hard to stay at his hometown, so he was looking for another place to stay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">His friend paid for the trips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">


 
 The Tribunal asked the applicant why he returned to China after each of these trips if he was fearful about living in China.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The applicant said that he was told it was hard to survive and to get a job in those places and there was no good protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">


 
The appellant agreed with me that these questions were asked in the Tribunal hearing and that he could have told the Tribunal that the tour leader had possession of his passport and that 
 
this was the reason why he did not apply for asylum in those countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He agreed that it was not the fault of the Tribunal that he did not provide the Tribunal with this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">23 In the circumstances, it is clear that nothing that the Tribunal did or failed to do denied the appellant the opportunity to present his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Certainly he was at a disadvantage because of his lack of English and his lack of familiarity with the procedures of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">This is a disadvantage shared by many applicants for visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">It does not mean that they lack the opportunity to put their case adequately before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The existence of disadvantage does not mean that the Tribunal denies to applicants a proper opportunity to present their cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">To the extent to which the appellant would need leave to amend his grounds to make this case on appeal, leave should be refused because the appellant could not succeed on this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">24 For these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">25 Consequent upon my announcement that the appeal would be dismissed, counsel for the Minister sought an order that the appellant pay the Minister's costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The appellant did not advance any reason, and none appears from the nature of the case, why I should not apply the usual principle that costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Counsel for the first respondent invited me to fix the amount of costs at $2,800.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Although this figure is within the reasonable compass of costs for an appeal of this nature, I propose to discount it somewhat, because counsel for the first respondent did not appear to be in a position fully to argue one of the grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The appellant suggested that it would be wrong for me to fix the amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">I consider that the appellant may well find it more economical if I fix the amount at $2,500 today than he would if the additional costs of taxation of costs before the registrar were incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">26 
 
The orders that I make will therefore be:

1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">The appeal be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The appellant pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal, fixed at $2,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Associate:
