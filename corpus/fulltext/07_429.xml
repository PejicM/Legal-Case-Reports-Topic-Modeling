1 This contempt proceeding is now being prosecuted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission against two of the four respondents, Dynacast (Int) Pty Ltd (formerly Phoneflasher.com Pty Ltd) and Alan Bradley Jorgensen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I will refer to the first of these as "Phoneflasher Co", the company so named being the first respondent in the principal proceedings out of which the present matter arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I have designedly avoided using the abbreviation "Phoneflasher.com" as, on the material before me, it would appear that (i) there may be other companies (not necessarily registered in Australia) having these words in their name; (ii) there are both a domain name and a website so named; and (iii) there is some reason to believe that that description is a trade name used in distribution arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">These possible usages of the "Phoneflasher.com" label make confident interpretation of some of the material before me difficult.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The principal proceeding 
 
2 In mid-2004 the ACCC brought proceedings in this Court seeking declaratory and other relief in respect of alleged contraventions of s 52 and s 53(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The respondents were the Phoneflasher Co, Mr Jorgensen and his sister, Jimeale Jorgensen, who was a director of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The company retailed a mobile phone accessory called the "Phoneflasher".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Put shortly the ACCC alleged that the respondents had falsely represented on the phoneflasher.com website that using the accessory would reduce harmful radiation exposure to the user of the telephone and thus had associated health benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Those proceedings proved difficult to prosecute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr and Ms Jorgensen were regularly outside the jurisdiction; they made only strategic use of legal advisers; and service and communication were (by my order) by email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Mr Jorgensen early indicated to the ACCC both that he had authority to bind his sister and the company and that he sought settlement of the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 It would appear that, from email correspondence between Mr Jorgensen and the ACCC, that (i) it was asserted by Mr Jorgensen that the phoneflasher website was an international one and that it was the website of Shanghai Connexion.com Ltd in China; but (ii) the ACCC indicated that the website made no reference to its being owned by that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The significance of this will become apparent below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I would note that at all relevant times for the purposes of the principal proceeding Mr Jorgensen was the registrant of the domain name "Phoneflasher.com".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The "phoneflasher.com" website was linked to this domain name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 In late October 2004 a notice of appearance was filed on behalf of all of the respondents by a firm of solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">On 1 November 2004, Mr and Ms Jorgensen purporting also to act on behalf of Phoneflasher Co agreed to settle the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Consent orders were drawn up with all parties being legally represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">They were signed by the respondents' solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The orders were made by me on 2 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 The declaration of agreed facts which accompanied the orders acknowledged the facts giving rise to the contraventions of s 52 and s 53(c) of the TP Act including (inter alia) that (i) relevant representations were made "on [Phoneflasher Co's] website at http://www.phoneflasher.com"; (ii) Ms Jorgensen, as a director of the company, was directly and indirectly knowingly concerned in its contraventions of the Act; and (iii) Mr Jorgensen as the majority shareholder of, and as an agent of, the company was likewise so concerned in the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">7 Insofar as presently relevant, the consent orders provided:
 
 
 "3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The First Respondent [the Phoneflasher Co] supply to each retail outlet to which it has distributed the Phoneflasher, as its expense and within 30 days of the date of this order: 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.1 a laminated sign in the size, form and format of Annexure 'A' to these orders; and 
 
 3.2 a letter, in the format of Annexure B to these orders and on the First Respondent's letterhead, to each such outlet advising the proprietor of the outlet of the terms of this order and requesting that the sign be displayed in a prominent location near where the Phoneflasher is displayed for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The First Respondent, within 35 days of the date of this order, provide the Applicant with a list of the names and addresses of customers to which it provided signs in accordance with the preceding order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Pursuant to section 86C of the Act, the First Respondent, at its expense:
 
 
 
 
 
 5.1 in the event that the First Respondent is currently trading, within three months of the date of this order, establish a trade practices corporate compliance program for employees and other persons involved in the First Respondent's business designed to ensure their awareness of their responsibilities and obligations in relation to sections 52 and 53(c) of the Act; 
 
 5.2 in the event that the First Respondent is not currently trading:
 
 
 
 
 5.2.1 within seven days of commencing to trade, notify the South Australian Regional Director of the Applicant of that fact; and 
 
 5.2.2 within three months of commencing to trade, establish a trade practices corporate compliance program for employees and other persons involved in the First Respondent's business designed to ensure their awareness of their responsibilities and obligations in relation to sections 52 and 53(c) of the Act; and
 
 
 
 
 5.3 use its best endeavours to ensure that the compliance program established pursuant to order 5.1 or 5.2.2 is consistent with Australian Standard AS-3086.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 
 
 
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Pursuant to section 86C of the Act, the First Respondent, at its expense and within 14 days of the date of this order, place a notice on the internet website 'http:/www.phoneflasher.com' and any other website being used by the First Respondent to promote the Phoneflasher mobile telephone accessory, in the form of an automatically generated active pop-up window or message box that complies with the contents, requirements and format described in Annexure 'C' and that the notice be maintained continually for a period of six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">"
 
 
 Background to the Contempt Proceedings 
 
8 It is necessary at the outset to refer to the ownership and control, first, of the Phoneflasher Co and, then, of Dynacast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The company had had a number of incarnations (including as Dynacast International Pty Ltd) prior to its being given the registered name of Phoneflasher.com Pty Ltd in May 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">According to an ASIC Historical Company Extract, Ms Jorgensen was a director from 2 May 2002 to 8 June 2004 and held 25 per cent of the shares in the company until they were transferred to Mr Kerville on 18 November 2004, ASIC being notified of the transfer on 16 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Jorgensen held 75 per cent of the shares in the Phoneflasher Co at the time of the consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He transferred his shares to Mr Kerville on the same day as his sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr Kerville, who is the third named respondent in the contempt proceedings, was a director of Phoneflasher from 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">At the time of the making of the consent orders he was the sole director of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">9 There is evidence of a meeting on 1 November 2004 (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">on the day before the making of the orders), at which the name of the company was changed from Phoneflasher.com Pty Ltd to Dynacast (Int) Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The resolution signed by Mr Kerville and dated that day was lodged with ASIC on 5 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Neither the Court nor the ACCC were notified of this change prior to the making of the 2 November orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 On 1 April 2005 Mr Kerville ceased to be the director of Dynacast and a Rui Li, the fourth respondent, who has a Queensland address, became the sole director and shareholder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As of 14 July 2006 (the date on which the latest ASIC extract in evidence in this proceeding was obtained), the registered office of Dynacast remained as it had been since December 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There is no evidence in the present proceedings as to the nature of the business, if any, now conducted by Dynacast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Rui Li, though a party to the proceedings, is not now being pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I will return below to Rui Li and the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">They are unrepresented in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 A sealed copy of the orders of 2 November was served on Dynacast's lawyers on 4 November 2004 and a further sealed copy was provided to him on 9 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In addition, a sealed copy of the orders was couriered to Mr Kerville (as director of Phoneflasher) and Mr Jorgensen at Phoneflasher's address on 9 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Copies were also provided by email on the same day at, relevantly, three known email addresses of Mr Jorgensen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">It is clear, in the event, that these orders were brought to the actual notice of both Dynacast and Mr Jorgensen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">12 For reasons I will note below, the ACCC, being unsatisfied that compliance with the orders had been effected, brought the present contempt proceedings in October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">THE CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS 
 
13 The Statement of Charge contains charges contempt by Dynacast in respect of each of the four consent orders (Orders 3 to 6) set out in full above and by Mr Jorgensen in respect only of Order 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Before dealing with each of these in turn there is a preliminary matter to which I need to refer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Representing Dynacast 
 
14 The question of if, when and by whom any of the respondents in both the principal and this proceeding had legal representation has been a recurrent, occasionally confusing, question in these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In this matter it ultimately transpired that Mr Jorgensen appeared for himself and, despite Mr Jorgensen's request to represent the company (then wholly owned by its sole director Rui Li), the company was unrepresented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I will indicate briefly why the latter was so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">15 At the initiation of the contempt proceedings both respondents were self represented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">On 26 April 2006, prior to a directions hearing in the matter, the Court received communication from solicitors purporting to act for Dynacast providing (i) an undertaking to file a Notice of Appearance on behalf of it and (ii) requesting an adjournment of the directions on the basis that they wished to file a Notice of Motion requesting that the hearing be vacated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The adjournment of the directions hearing was refused and the foreshadowed Notice of Motion was not forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The matter was timetabled for hearing on that day and a copy of the orders was sent to the solicitors at their request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Notice of Appearance on behalf of Dynacast was filed on 14 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Mr Jorgensen filed a Notice of Appearance on 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">16 On 27 June 2006, solicitors for Dynacast notified the Court of an intention to represent Mr Jorgensen as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">That notice was provided the next day along with a request for an adjournment for two weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That adjournment was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">However shortly after that date solicitors acting for both respondents ceased to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Mr Jorgensen then contacted the court to indicate that he would be acting on behalf of both himself and Dynacast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">17 Order 9 r 1(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides, insofar as presently relevant, that a corporation may not, without the leave of the Court or a Judge, enter an appearance or defend any proceeding except by a solicitor: see also O 4 r 14(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">18 Mr Jorgensen was notified in writing on 20 July 2006 that the Court was not prepared simply to accede to his request to represent Dynacast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It was explained that any such application should be made by the company by Notice of Motion and supporting affidavit material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Court further requested that as it did not have contact details for the company as such, that the contents of the communication be forwarded accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">A motion and an affidavit of Mr Jorgensen were filed on 27 July seeking leave to represent the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Nothing was provided in support of this by Rui Li.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Nor was any reference made by Mr Jorgensen to Li.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">19 At the hearing, Mr Jorgensen again requested that he be granted leave to represent Dynacast as he had been authorised in previous legal proceedings to act on their behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">20 From the evidence before the Court it would appear that Mr Jorgensen has not been a director of the company since 1999 nor a shareholder since 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">There was also no relevant material as to the present constitution of the company shareholders other than what was revealed in the ASIC extract of 14 June 2006 to which I earlier referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I have no proper evidence of Mr Jorgensen's relationship with Rui Li or of the actual wishes of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">21 It is well understood that the discretion given by O 9 r 1 imposes no threshold requirement, for example, the demonstration of special or exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Nonetheless the discretion must be exercised in accordance with judicial principle in light of the evident expectation of the rule that ordinarily a corporation will be required to be represented by a solicitor: see Termi-Mesh Australia Pty Ltd v Josu Manufacturing Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1241.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">In the present matter Mr Jorgensen was informed of what was expected of Dynacast before consideration would be given to his representation of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It, or he, I know not which, chose not to take the course indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Hence I refused his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The Charges 
 
 (i) The First and Second Charges 
 
22 These now relate only to the Phoneflasher Co and can be dealt with compositely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">They provide respectively:
 
 " First Charge 
 
 
 
 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Order 3 of the orders required the First Respondent to provide a corrective notice and letter, in the terms specified by the order, to all retail outlets to which the First Respondent had distributed the Phoneflasher , within 30 days of the date of the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The date by which the First Respondent was to have complied with order 3 of the orders was 2 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The First Respondent has not to the date of this Statement of Charge, supplied the corrective notice and letters in the terms specified by order 3 of the orders, to all the retail outlets to which it had distributed the Phoneflasher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The First Respondent has committed a contempt of court as it has failed or refused to comply with order 3 of the orders to provide by 2 December 2004 all retail outlets to which it distributed the Phoneflasher a corrective notice and letter in the terms specified by order 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">...
 
 Second Charge 
 
 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Order 4 of the orders required the First Respondent to provide to the Applicant within 35 days of 2 November 2004 a list of names and addresses of retail outlets to which it had provided the corrective notice and letter in accordance with order 3 of the orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The date by which the First Respondent was to have complied with order 4 of the orders was 7 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The First respondent did not supply to the Applicant a list of names and addresses of the retail outlets to which it had provided the corrective notice and letter by 7 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The First Respondent has committed a contempt of court as it has failed or refused to comply with order 4 of the orders by failing to provide to the Applicant by 7 December 2004 a list of names and addresses of retail outlets to which it had provided the corrective notice and letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">"
 (Emphasis added)
 
 

23 The ACCC has submitted that Phoneflasher Co has not complied with either of these orders and it has adduced what are representative instances both of retailers not supplied with the sign and letter and of the failure to provide to it names of retailers who actually had been provided with signs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">24 While I am satisfied that both of these charges have been made out, I am not satisfied that the Phoneflasher Co's contempt has been of the dimension's alleged by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">25 It is well accepted that strict compliance with the terms of mandatory orders, such as Order 3 and 4 of the consent orders in this matter, is required of the party to whom they are addressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Nonetheless the orders themselves must be clear and unambiguous: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 515-516.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It equally is well accepted that breach of an order must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at [15] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">26 In the quotation above of the first charge I have highlighted the words "all retail outlets to which [Phoneflasher Co] had distributed the Phoneflasher".</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I have done so because there is an issue as to the proper construction of the order: on construction see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd, at [19] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The ACCC has tendered evidence taken from the phoneflasher website which indicated that (i) on 6 January 2003, the number of retail outlets in Australia listed as having Phoneflashers available for sale, was 157; and (ii) on 3 March 2005, the website listed more than 350 such retail suppliers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Order 4 of the consent orders required the company to provide the ACCC with the required names and address of the retail outlets to which it had provided corrective signs and letters on or before 7 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">No such names were by then provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Letters informing the respondent of the breach were sent to Phoneflasher Co's solicitors and to Mr Jorgensen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">27 An ACCC officer in late December 2004 observed a Phoneflasher display stand in an Adelaide retail centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">On speaking to the manager she was informed that the manager had not received the notice required to be sent in the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">28 On 27 January 2005, a letter from the company's lawyers was received by the lawyer for the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">It enclosed a letter from Mr Kerville of 23 January 2005 which stated that (i) "the company ceased trading over 18 months ago and there are few customers on the books"; (ii) the person "who took over the distribution at that time has also since ceased trading"; and (iii) the ACCC notices had been sent "to prior Phoneflasher customers shown on the attached list".</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">That list contained eight names and addresses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">29 The ACCC then entered into written and (in the case of six of them) oral communication with the eight named businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">It also sent letters to eight randomly selected retailers of the 157 listed on the 2003 website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The product of these communications was that of the businesses on the list, one had never acquired phoneflashers; two could not remember if they had been supplied with the sign and ACCC letter; one was not sure; one did not think he had; and one said he had not received them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">30 One of the 157 retailers selectively written to by the ACCC was Crazy Johns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It sent an email to the ACCC in response indicating that it was first supplied from Phoneflasher.com in November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It had some of the product in stock but had not had further business dealings with the company for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">To the best of the writer's knowledge Crazy Johns had not been supplied with the sign or the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">31 It is Ms Jorgensen's evidence that she went to a trade show with phoneflasher displays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Three of the listed businesses with whom the ACCC had telephone communications indicated they had purchased their stock at a trade fair, while another said it had been acquired from someone named "Jimeale".</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Ms Jorgensen also gave evidence that she had dealt directly with the principal office of Crazy John's and Telecorp who had distribution arrangements with retail outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">She had no contact with those outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">As I will indicate below I have real doubts as to the true nature of the precise legal relationship of Phoneflasher Co's with Crazy Johns and Telecorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The ACCC has attempted to characterise it as an agency relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It could well be a distributorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">There is equally some evidence to suggest that the lists of businesses appearing on the 2003 and 2005 websites as retail vendors of phoneflasher were, in the main, supplied by Telecorp and Crazy Johns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">32 The evidence that has been put on of the contents of the 2005 phoneflasher website envisages the possibility of a business becoming "a dealer, distributor, importer or a franchisee" of phoneflashers, these types of relationship being with variously Phoneflasher Co and Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The same website describes Phoneflasher Co as a "Joint Venture partner" with Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd ("[which] takes care of the manufacturing operations whilst Phoneflasher.com assumes responsibility for the marketing of the product around the globe").</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">I should add that, in my view, the last reference to "Phoneflasher.com" may well be simply to the website not to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">33 Now let me turn to the proper construction of the First Charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Charge, as I have noted, refers to "all retail outlets to which the First Respondent had distributed the Phoneflasher".</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">This, in my view, can only refer to distributions made by Phoneflasher Co ("whether through an agent or otherwise") to such retail outlets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It would not encompass distributions by an intermediate distributor acting as a principal in selling to its own customers, notwithstanding that the product ultimately sold was a phoneflasher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The order is simply not wide enough in its terms for it to be said that it clearly and unambiguously encompasses "distribution" by Phoneflasher Co in that fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">34 Accordingly, and putting to one side the eight names on Mr Kerville's list of 23 January 2005, I am not, on the evidence, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the names of businesses appearing on the extracts of the 2003 and 2005 phoneflasher websites were retail outlets to which the Phoneflasher company had supplied phoneflashers as a principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The evidence is not unequivocal and I do not regard the cross-examination of Ms Jorgensen when agreeing to the suggestion that Crazy Johns and Telecorp were "agents" as in anyway dispelling that uncertainty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The burden of her evidence was that these entities purchased then on-sold the product to their own franchisees, etc.
 
35 I am left in consequence with the question whether, in relation to the 8 businesses contained in Mr Kerville's list, the charge has been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Notwithstanding that one of the 8 denied it ever stocked the product ("This'n'That"), and that three more were uncertain or unsure as to whether they had received the sign and the letter, I have the requisite satisfaction that at least two of the 8 ("Hannah's Pharmacy" (or "Hanna Pharmacies") and "Haines Newsagency") did not receive the sign or the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">36 I am then satisfied that the First Respondent had not to the date of the Statement of Charge supplied the corrective notice and letters in the terms specified by Order 3 of the orders, to two of the retail outlets to which it had distributed the phoneflasher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">While I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Phoneflasher Co did not supply the notice and letters to any retail outlet it had supplied, I equally do not on the evidence have reason to believe it did so supply any such retail outlet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">37 As to the Second Charge, the evidence is uncontradicted that the First Respondent did not supply the ACCC a list of names and addresses as required by Order 4 by 7 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">By so failing it has committed a contempt of court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I equally am satisfied that it did not later comply with Order 4 when providing the list of retail outlets to the ACCC to at least the extent that that list included the two outlets noted above which I have found did not receive the sign and letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">(ii) The Third Charge 
 
38 Though the charge itself is of some length, the actual issue it raises can be dealt with briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The charge reads:
 
 " Third Charge 
 
 
 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Order 5.1 of the orders required the First Respondent, if currently trading, to within three months from the date of the order, establish a trade practices corporate compliance program for employees and other persons involved in the First Respondent's business designed to ensure their awareness of their responsibilities and obligations in relation to sections 52 and 53 (c) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The date by which the First Respondent was to have complied with order 5.1 if it was currently trading was 2 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The First Respondent:

39 The short point is whether Dynacast was currently trading at the time of the order, this being the contingency upon which Order 5.1 was premised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">I could not, given the state of the evidence, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was so trading at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">40 Four of the five matters referred to in para 30 of the charge (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">excluding 30.2) are consistent with the sale of a company consequent upon the termination of its business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The change of company name (which was tied to the name of a particular product) is emblematic of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Though phoneflashers remained on sale after the consent orders, none of the retail outlets who were contacted by, or who made contact with, the ACCC indicated that they had recent contact (i.e.</sentence>

<sentence id="s166">Most had not dealt with the company for several years though some still had stock on hand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">41 It is the case that, in consequence of Mr Kerville's letter to his lawyers of 25 January 2005 in which he indicated that the Phoneflasher Co had "ceased trading over 18 months ago", the ACCC wrote to him of 17 February 2005 requesting responses to (inter alia) the following questions:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>

No reply was received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">42 In these proceedings, I regard that failure to reply as indicative of the indifference, lack of cooperation and elusiveness demonstrated on occasion by the various respondents both in the principal and in this proceeding, but of no more.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">43 The evidence put on generally for the respondents in this matter, though (save for that of Ms Jorgensen) untested, is generally to the effect that Phoneflasher Co ceased trading in late 2003 or in the first half of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Ms Jorgensen's evidence was to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Kerville's letter to that effect should, I consider, be treated with some circumspection as it could be said to have an obvious strategic character for the purposes of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">44 In all, and bearing in mind the onus borne by ACCC, I am not satisfied that Phoneflasher Co was trading at the time of the consent order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I consider it to be quite likely that those involved in what I might call the "phoneflasher venture" in China and elsewhere simply resolved to shut down and cut loose the Phoneflasher Co in Australia so relieving themselves of the growing inconvenience it was causing them in the principal proceeding --- notwithstanding that its name may have subsisted thereafter (even prominently) on the phoneflasher website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">(iii) The Fourth Charge

 " Fourth Charge

<sentence id="s200">"
 
 
 

47 Mr Jorgensen has defended himself by saying that, while he may have been the registrant of the phoneflasher.com domain name, he did not control the content of the website linked to that domain name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">In a variety of documents he authored (for the most part emails to the ACCC's lawyer dating from 10 August 2004), he has denied personal control of the website and has ascribed ownership and/or control of it to Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd. 
 
48 To understand this defence it is necessary to refer in a little detail to the expert evidence (and its possible limitations) given in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The ACCC called Don Blumenthal to give expert evidence on the Internet system and domain names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Blumenthal is an attorney with the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC").</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The FTC is an independent civil law enforcement agency with the United States government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">His primary responsibility with the Bureau is to manage its Internet Labs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">These Labs are centres for undercover investigation of Internet-based fraud and deception.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Subject to one reservation noted below, I am satisfied as to Mr Blumenthal's expertise and accept his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The following is drawn from his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">49 First, the Internet system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">This is a network of computers which connect to each other using a communications protocol called Terminal Communications Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">"Client" computers (which are on the user side) connect to "host" computers, which are the computers that contain content such as websites or email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Host computers frequently are called "servers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">50 Each computer accessible through the Internet has a numeric TCP/IP address composed of four or six numeric segments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Remembering numeric addresses in order to access a server is cumbersome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">"Canonical", or plain language, addresses were developed to make it easier for individuals on client computers to remember the names of hosts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">These are the now familiar www addresses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">51 The Domain Name System (DNS) was created in the mid-1980's.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It links TCP/IP addresses and canonical names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">When a computer user enters a canonical description, such as www.ftc.gov, into a web browser program, the address is cross-referenced against server databases that translate the verbal address into the appropriate numeric TCP/IP address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">52 Secondly, domains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Two domain levels are of particular relevance in these proceedings: top level domains and second level domains.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Two kinds of top level domains exist: generic top level domains (gTLD) and country code top level domains (ccTLD).</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In the address www.ftc.gov, .gov is the top level domain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Generic top level domains are controlled closely by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">ICANN is a non-profit corporation responsible for governance of the Internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">53 Generic top level domains available to the general public are .com, .org, .net, .edu, .aero, .biz, .info, .coop, .name, and .museum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Of these, .com, .net, .org, and .info can be used without regard to purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Countries to which the country code top level domains are assigned set their own governing policies for the most part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Examples are .au, .us, and .uk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">54 Second level domains complete the "domain name" used by an entity when the entity has chosen to use canonical names to route traffic to its servers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">An individual or organization that has a proposed second level domain name must decide which top level domain is of interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The combination of the top level domain and the second level domain is the full domain name; for example, in www.ftc.gov, ftc is the second level domain and the registered domain is ftc.gov.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The combination of the top level domain and the second level domain is registered with a domain registrar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">55 The server name usually is the first segment in a canonical internet address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">In www.ftc.gov, "www" is the name of the server that contains the website operated under ftc.gov.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">56 Thirdly, ownership of domain names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Domain registration entered the public domain in 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Hundreds of registrars throughout the world are now accredited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Each top level domain has a registry, which is the authoritative list of all domains in the top level domain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">Registries contain, at a minimum, the names of domain name owners and information required to cross reference canonical names into IP addresses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">A US company called VeriSign, Inc., maintains the registries for .com and .net.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">57 The registrant of the domain is the domain name owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Registrations are for specific terms, usually one to three years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">58 Ownership of a registered domain gives the domain owner control over use of the name on the Internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Once a domain name is registered, it cannot be used by anyone other than the registrant or that entity's authorized representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The owner of a domain name, or an entity involved on behalf of the owner in management of the server, determines the IP addresses to which traffic is routed when someone tries to access servers which use the domain name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In the normal course of business, a domain owner or its authorized representative is usually in a position to dictate content on a website and the manner in which it will appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Domain registrations can be transferred to new owners by the domain name holder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The registrar must be notified if ownership of a domain name is to be transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">59 In the present matter it is not in dispute that Mr Jorgensen was the registrant of the phoneflasher.com domain name at all relevant times, though he has now transferred it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">What is in issue was whether, as such registrant, he controlled the website linked to that domain name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">60 Mr Blumenthal's evidence was that, in his experience, the organisation owning a domain name "typically", "ordinarily", "normally" owned and controlled the website (and its content) using that domain name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">He, nonetheless, accepted in cross-examination that he did not have personal experience of any significant number of instances of a registrant being a natural person notwithstanding that a company or companies were linked to that registrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Mr Jorgensen has, as I have indicated, contended that such was the case here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Mr Blumenthal also indicated that the only exception of which he was aware where the domain owner has not controlled the content of a linked website related to marketing affiliation arrangements (or distributorships).</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It is apparent from the above that Mr Blumenthal's professional experience does not extend in any really informed way to the situation of a personal registrant such as is in issue in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">For my own part, while I can readily appreciate why commercial entities would, as a matter of course, use a corporate registrant for their domain names, it has not been suggested that there is any reason of principle or of practicality which would preclude the use of a natural person as registrant notwithstanding that the linked website was to be paid for, owned by, and its content controlled by, a corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">For reasons, variously sensible, devious or nefarious, that particular configuration might well be adopted for a particular commercial purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 Turning now to the fourth charge, it is clear that the Phoneflasher Co agreed to Order 6 according to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">As I have already noted, the consented to factual basis of the consent orders, was that the phoneflasher.com website was the company's website (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">"its website": para 1 of the Order of 2 November 2004 and Annexure C thereto).</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">This in turn provided the factual premise of consent Order 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Whether or not it could in fact comply with the terms of that order is not, in the present matter, to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">It was knowingly agreed to (as I will indicate below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Strict compliance was required and it was not forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The date for compliance with Order 6 was 16 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">I am satisfied that the contempt alleged against the First Respondent has been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">63 An attempt was made to explain, if not justify, the non-compliance through documents supplied by Mr Kerville on 25 January 2005 to the ACCC via the company's lawyers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">64 Both of the documents purport to be copies of facsimiles, though there is nothing on the face of the documents to indicate that they were transmitted on or about the dates they respectively bear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The first, dated 11 November 2004, is from Mr Jorgensen to Baris Gencel of "Shanghai Connexion Ltd" (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">It stated:
 
 "As you are aware Phone Flasher.com Pty Ltd has been embroiled in a dispute with the ACCC here in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">To bring the matter to an end, the parties involved in the dispute have decided to settle the matter rather than fight it out in Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">As part of the settlement terms, we have given certain undertakings, one of which is to include a Pop Up on the Phone Flasher website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">See attached the content that the ACCC requires we place on the Website for a term of 6 months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">We have informed the ACCC on many occasions that we did not own or control the website, however they were still insistent that this POP UP on the Website was implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In anticipation, we thank you for your co operation in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">"
 

65 The reference in the penultimate paragraph to informing the ACCC that the Phoneflasher Co did not own or control the website would seem to relate to the emails sent to the ACCC which I have earlier mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">66 What is said to be a facsimile response from Mr Gencel, 15 November 2004, reads: 
 
 "When you asked that we remove the reference to Radiation on our Website &amp; printing, we felt this was a big ask.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Yet we did our bit &amp; helped you out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">This was despite the fact that the Phone Flasher does in fact reduce the radiation, especially the Non Battery model.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">What do the people in Australia thinks drives the Flashing of the LEDs?</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Cosmic energy or something?</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">But now you want us to put some ridiculous notice on our website for the whole world to see?</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">So your request is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Furthermore, we have made arrangements to have the Website Hosted in the USA where our market is &amp; where we don't have to put up with such nonsense, as seems the case downunder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">"
 

67 These documents invite suspicion and I have been invited, in effect, to disregard them by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">There are, though, indications in the tendered printouts of material from the phoneflasher.com website --- and particularly that of 11 April 2005 --- which suggest that Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd might well be the principal party in the business scheme involving the production, advertising and distribution of phoneflashers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">In the 11 April extract Shanghai Connexion.com is described variously as the Phoneflasher Co's joint venture partner, as the "parent company" (sic) of Phoneflasher Co, as the franchisor of the "Shanghai Connexion Franchise" which will guide and assist franchisees in building their businesses, etc.
 
68 Turning now to the alleged contempt by Mr Jorgensen, I will deal first with the claim that he was at the relevant times an "officer" or "director" of the Phoneflasher Co.
 
69 By way of background to this I should note that s 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) defines "officer" and "director" respectively and insofar as presently relevant, in the following terms:
 
 " officer of a corporation means:
 
 (a) a director or secretary of the corporation; or
 
 (b) a person:
 
 
 
 
 (i) who makes, or participates in making, decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of the business of the corporation; or 
 
 (ii) who has the capacity to affect significantly the corporation's financial standing; or
 
 (iii) in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors of the corporation are accustomed to act (excluding advice given by the person in the proper performance of functions attaching to the person's professional capacity or their business relationship with the directors or the corporation);" 
 
 " director of a company or other body means:
 
 (a) ...
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) unless the contrary intention appears, a person who is not validly appointed as a director if:
 
 (i) they act in the position of a director; or
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the directors of the company or body are accustomed to act in accordance with the person's instructions or wishes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">" 
 
 
 

70 Insofar as both of the definitions refer to a person in accordance with whose instructions or wishes the directors are accustomed to act, I should note the following well settled principles:
 
 
 (i) though the purpose of the definition is to identify those persons, other than professional advisers, who have real influence in, or indeed control of, the corporate affairs of a company, it is not necessary that such influence or control should be exercised over the whole field of its corporate activities: Secretary of State of Trade and Industry v Deverell [2001] Ch 340 at 354; and 
 
 (ii) the influence or control exercised by a shadow director may be strategic in character, defining the context in which, or conditions upon which, the company operates, or else contriving the transactions of significance to the company: Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">
 

See generally Ho v Akai Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] FCAFC 265 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1, 526.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">71 I have already indicated that I am not satisfied that Phoneflasher Co was trading at the time of the consent order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">This, though, is not to say that the company did not then, and in the preceding months, have concerns of immediate significance to it to which had to attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">These related at least to the principal proceedings and its aftermath.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">At the presently relevant times (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">from at least 10 August 2004 until the date of non-compliance with Order 6), I am satisfied that Mr Jorgensen exercised the powers of the company in relation to the principal proceedings and I infer that he did so with the acquiescence of, and not subject to the supervision of, Mr Kerville the company's then only director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">He was, I am satisfied, the company's "ring master" in these proceedings and acted accordingly in manipulating legal representation for the company, in providing instructions to lawyers and in negotiating for, and providing the relevant consents to, the orders made by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The matters referred to in the Statement of Charge in paras 40.2, 40.3, 40.4 are indicative of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">72 For all practical purposes relating to the principal proceedings (the only known matter of continuing significance to the company), Mr Jorgensen presumed, without apparent let or hindrance of Mr Kerville, to act as the company's mind and will notwithstanding that he was not at the time a person who had been appointed to the position of director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I emphasize in this the importance of the matter to the company: cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Austin (1998) 28 ACSR 565 at 570; the strategic nature of the intervention being made by Mr Jorgensen in the company's affairs; cf Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd , at 52-53; and his apparent real influence in the affairs of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">I should add that, while Mr Jorgensen is referred to in a website extract of 28 August 2005 a "Director" in China, I do not consider that this advances the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">That reference could well be to a position he held in Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd.
 
73 The present circumstances are quite unusual, especially as to what actually is known of Phoneflasher Co leading up to, and after, the making of the consent orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">This notwithstanding, I do infer that Mr Jorgensen was a shadow director of the company at all times relevant to the fourth charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">He was not, though, a party to Order 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">74 If Mr Jorgensen is to be found guilty of contempt because of the company's failure to comply with that order, it can only be on the basis that he aided or abetted the breach by the company or that did an act intending to subvert the effect of the order: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v World Netsafe Pty Ltd (No 3) [2003] FCA 159 ; (2003) 127 FCR 542 at [86] - [87] ; LED Builders Pty Ltd v Eagle Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1213 at [50] ; Arledge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt , 12-109 (3 rd ed, 2005).</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">75 The manner in which the ACCC has sought to establish Mr Jorgensen's guilt turns critically on his being the registrant of the domain name, on his alleged control of the website, on his failure to take steps to enable the company to comply with Order 6 and on his subsequent transfer of the domain name to a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">76 I have referred above to the evidence, such as it is, on control of the phoneflasher.com website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">While there are grounds for suspecting that Mr Jorgensen in fact had the practical capacity to procure compliance with Order 6, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he controlled the website and that he could have done what was required in the face of opposition from, or without the consent of, his business associate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">77 I am not prepared to infer in the present circumstances that ownership of the domain name necessarily carried with it control of the website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Here it may well have not, that ownership being merely a matter of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">78 It has been Mr Jorgensen's contention from at least August 2004 that Shanghai Connexion.com controlled the website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">He put this view to the ACCC which did not accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The ACCC insisted, for the purposes of settling the matter, on an order in the terms of Order 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">If I were to accept Mr Jorgensen's contention, it has the consequence that he, hence Phoneflasher Co, agreed to the consent order in the knowledge that the website was not the company's and that neither it nor Mr Jorgensen had the power or capacity as of course to comply with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">I have already indicated that the company, having agreed to the terms of the order binding it and the factual premise of it, could not now set up a different state of affairs of which it was aware at the time of the order to relieve itself of the consequences of its failure to comply with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">79 On the case he puts, Mr Jorgensen stands in a different, and fortuitously fortunate, position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">He may have known at the time of the consent orders that the Order could not be complied with as of course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Nonetheless, that knowledge, coupled with his giving the company's consent to the Order, cannot properly be said to be aiding or abetting the company's non-compliance with the Order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The possibility of non-compliance resulted from the erroneous factual premise of the order itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Neither can it be said that Mr Jorgensen did an act intending to subvert the effect of the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">He simply agreed to the Order insisted upon by the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">80 The self-serving character of Mr Jorgensen's defence is self-evident.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Nonetheless, when considered in light of the available evidence, it is sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he controlled the website and in consequence, as to whether he aided or abetted the company's non-compliance with Order 6 or that he acted intending to subvert the order's effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">81 I do not find the charge of contempt against Mr Jorgensen to have been made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Penalty 
 
82 I have found the Phoneflasher Co to be guilty of contempt as charged in the first, second and fourth charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">83 As to the first and second of the charges, the company made no apparent attempts to comply with the orders in the times respectively prescribed for compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">It was only in response to communications from the ACCC that steps were taken in purported compliance with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">These steps as I have found did not remedy the non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">I am satisfied that the company was indifferent to the obligation imposed on it by the orders and acted, and has continued to act, accordingly up until the time of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">There has been nothing "casual, accidental or unintentional" about its non-compliance with Orders 3 and 4, rather there has been "wilful disobedience": Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 112-113.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The company has offered no explanation for its conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Indeed its indifference to the matter has been reflected in the approach it has taken to the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">It needs to be made aware of the seriousness of its conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at [139] , [144].</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Its conduct, moreover, needs to be considered in the context of its having consented to the very orders it then proceeded to disregard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">84 The only penalty sought by the ACCC is the imposition of a fine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">There is no doubting the Court's power to impose such a penalty: see Info4PC.com Pty Ltd at [138].</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">In deciding an appropriate amount for a fine, the Court ordinarily will take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">I am unable to do so in this case as no proper evidence has been put before me on this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">However I have no reason to believe that the company has significant assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">85 In my view the company's conduct went beyond a lack of appreciation of the importance of strict compliance with court orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Rather it reflected an indifference to the commitment it made in the consent orders and to the processes of, and authority of, the Court itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Bearing in mind that a sentence for contempt is punitive to vindicate the authority of the Court, I intend to impose a fine of $5,000 on the company in respect of the contempt I have found on the first and second charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">86 The contempt found in relation to the fourth charge bears a somewhat different aspect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">I have found that the company was guilty of non-compliance with Order 6 notwithstanding that I was not satisfied that it was capable of complying with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Having agreed to the terms of the order and the factual premise of it, it could not later set up a different state of affairs of which it was aware at the time of the order to relieve itself of the consequences of its failure to comply with the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">87 It is said commonly that the power to impose penalties in cases of civil contempt is to be exercised so as both to ensure that orders are complied with and to deter conduct in contravention of court orders: see e.g.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 695 at [57] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">In the present matter it is the second of these purposes that is of present significance: on this duality in cases of civil contempt see generally Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt 3-6 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">It in turn must be viewed in a context in which the principal proceedings brought by the ACCC was to protect the public interest: see generally Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">88 In relation to the fourth charge the indifference of the company to the importance of court orders is plainly apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">At best the company has acted opportunistically obtaining the benefit of a court order (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">to settle a dispute) and then disclaiming its burden --- and doing so (as Mr Kerville's letter of 25 January 2005 evidences) by taking advantage of a known error in the agreed facts on which the order was based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">The processes of the Court are not so to be trifled with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Though compliance with the order cannot be coerced by any penalty imposed, the imposition of a penalty here nonetheless clearly has a deterrent role to play.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">I will impose a fine of $2,000.00 in respect of the finding of contempt on the fourth charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">Costs 
 
89 The ACCC has sought an award of costs on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Costs can be awarded on such a basis where it is warranted by the interests of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">This is commonly found to be so in contempt cases where such proceedings have had to be brought after judgment to vindicate the authority of the Court and to uphold the public interest in the administration of justice: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Business Reports Pty Ltd (1997) 19 ATPR 41-577 at 44,010; Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) at [67] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">Such is particularly the case where the proceedings have been brought by the ACCC in prosecution of its charter to act in the public interest: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Globex Systems Pty Ltd (2005) 27 ATPR 42-069 at 43,105.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">90 Given the circumstances and character of the contemnor's conduct in this matter, I am satisfied that it is appropriate in the interests of justice to make the costs order sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Conclusion 
 
91 I will declare that:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The first respondent is guilty of contempts by reason of its breaches of Orders 3 and 4 of the consent orders made on 2 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">The first respondent is guilty of contempt by reason of its breach of Order 6 of the consent orders made on 2 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">

92 I will order that:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">In respect of the contempts referred to in para 1 above, the first respondent be fined the sum of $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">In respect of the contempt referred to in para 2 above, the first respondent be fined the sum of $2,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The first respondent pay the applicant's costs of the application on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The application otherwise be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">
