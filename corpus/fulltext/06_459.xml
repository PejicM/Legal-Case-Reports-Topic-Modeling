 Introduction 
 
1 In the reasons for judgment in Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia (No 5) [2005] FCA 1025 (' Rubibi No 5 ') and Rubibi Community v State of Western Australia (No 6) [2006] FCA 82 (' Rubibi No 6 '), I concluded that the Yawuru community possesses communal native title rights and interests in the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I also concluded that, generally, the evidence supports an inference that the native title rights and interests include a right of exclusive possession and occupation of the Yawuru claim area (excluding the inter-tidal zone) where there has been no extinguishment of that right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The remaining matters in dispute concern:
 
 (a) certain discrete issues raised by one or other of the parties since the delivery of the reasons in Rubibi No 6 ; and
 (b) the determination of the areas within the Yawuru claim area in respect of which the native title rights and interests of the Yawuru claimants have been wholly or partially extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">

3 The Yawuru claimants accepted that they bore the ultimate onus of establishing that their native title rights and interests have not been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">4 In the course of the further hearing, I determined some of the disputed issues on an ex tempore basis and gave reasons for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On other issues, I announced the conclusion I had reached and stated that the reasons for the conclusion would be set out in the reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On the remaining issues, I reserved my decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The parties agreed that, in the event that I regarded it as appropriate to have a further view of any of the relevant sites, the further view may be held without their attendance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 In these reasons, which are to be read together with the reasons in Rubibi No 5 and Rubibi No 6 , I have employed the terms that have been defined in those reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I have also used the issue headings and numbers used by the Yawuru claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">6 The findings set out below resolve all of the outstanding issues between the parties and enable a determination of native title to be made under s 225 of the NTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Exclusive possession (Issue 2) 
 
7 At the outset, it is appropriate to deal with the Yawuru claimants' submissions in respect of two issues concerning their claim to exclusive possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The first issue arose because in Rubibi No 6 at [117], I expressed a concern as to how a right of exclusive possession might operate in a practical way in urban and other areas in common use by the general community in the Broome region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Yawuru claimants addressed that concern by referring me to s 212(2) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NTA ') which empowers a state to confirm any existing public access to and enjoyment of waterways, beds and banks or foreshores of waterways, coastal waters, beaches, stock-routes and areas that were public places at the end of 31 December 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">By s 14 of the Titles (Validation) and Native Title (Effect of Past Acts) Act 1995 (WA) (' the State Validation Act '), the State confirmed the access and enjoyment rights referred to in s 212(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The State's response was that my concern is also addressed either by extinguishment or by long established common law rights that prevent the recognition of exclusive native title rights that can, inter alia , be recorded in the determination as 'other interests' under s 225(c) of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">8 The second issue arose because at [119] of the reasons in Rubibi No 6 , I raised the question of whether the determination should limit the exploitation of the resources in the Yawuru claim area to non-commercial exploitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Yawuru claimants opposed any such limitation and contended that that limitation would be inconsistent with their right to exclusive possession, which they claimed entitled the native title holders to determine the purposes for which the land and waters were to be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Yawuru claimants relied upon Sampi v State of Western Australia (No 2) [2005] FCA 1567 (' Sampi No 2 '), in which it was contended that the determination of native title fishing rights should expressly exclude 'non-commercial rights'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">French J stated (at [90]):
 
 'Given that commercial fishing rights are subject to legislative control and that the native title rights and interests are to be exercisable in accordance with the laws of the State and the Commonwealth, it is difficult to see how the determination as proposed by the applicants would extend to commercial fishing rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">' 

9 The Yawuru claimants contended that commercial exploitation of the resources of the land and waters in the Yawuru claim area is likewise the subject of extensive governmental regulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">They also pointed to s 211(2)(a) of the NTA which only exempts native title holders from the restrictions imposed by that regulation for 'non-commercial communal needs'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">10 The State contended that the native title rights and interests claimed and pursued at trial by the Yawuru claimants did not include any right of commercial exploitation of the resources of the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The State pointed out that, in relation to a claim under the NTA , the Court is not concerned with the common law rights that might attach to a right of exclusive possession but rather, with the native title rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs: see Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria [2002] HCA 58 ; (2002) 214 CLR 422 (' Yorta Yorta ') at 442 [40] and De Rose v State of South Australia [2003] FCAFC 286 ; (2003) 133 FCR 325 (' De Rose FC No 1 ') at 377 [162].</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The State then claimed that the evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding of a native title right or interest to commercially exploit the resources of the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">11 WAFIC submitted that the determination should limit the use and taking of the resources of the inter-tidal zone to non-commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">WAFIC also pointed out that the Yawuru claimants had expressly disclaimed any entitlement to use or take the resources for commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">WAFIC adopted the State's contention that the Yawuru claimants' evidence did not support any such entitlement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">WAFIC referred to determinations in other cases that included the limitation sought by it and contended that such a limitation is necessary and appropriate in the present case because, in contrast to Sampi No 2 , the Yawuru claimants are contending that they are entitled to use the resources for commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Finally, WAFIC noted that the premise on which the Yawuru claimants' submission was based, namely that the entitlement to commercial exploitation was an incident of the entitlement to exclusive possession, did not apply to the inter-tidal zone as there is no entitlement to exclusive possession in respect of that zone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">12 The contentions of the State and WAFIC are correct and should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Accordingly, the entitlement of the Yawuru community to use and take any of the resources of the land and waters should be expressed as being an entitlement for 'personal, domestic or non-commercial communal purposes (including social, cultural, religious, spiritual and ceremonial purposes)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Walman Yawuru claim 
 
13 The Walman Yawuru claimants contended that, as a result of the recognition (at [233] and [375] in Rubibi No 5 ) that clan members, including Walman Yawuru clan members, have special attachments to specific areas, they are entitled under s 225(c) of the NTA to have that attachment recognised in the determination as an 'other interest' in relation to the determination area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">At [9] of Rubibi No 6 , I concluded that any special attachment of Walman Yawuru clan members to parts of the claim area is not such as to give rise to a native title right or interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The difficulty that confronts the Walman Yawuru contention is that s 253 defines an 'interest' in relation to land or waters as meaning, inter alia , a legal or equitable estate, interest or right in, or a restriction on use in respect of, the land or waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The special attachment of Walman Yawuru clan members is not, and does not give rise to, an interest as defined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The only 'rights' or 'interests' the Walman Yawuru clan members may have in relation to the Yawuru claim area are those held in any capacity they may have as members of the Yawuru community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Those rights and interests are the native title rights and interests that are to be set out in the determination pursuant to s 225(b) and are not 'other interests' that are required to be set out in the determination pursuant to s 225(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">14 The Walman Yawuru claimants also issued a proceeding in the Court on 16 December 2004 (WAD 285/2004) in which an overlapping claim was made for native title in respect of the Walman Yawuru claim area, which is within the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Section 67 of the NTA requires the Court to deal with the overlapping claim in the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It was not disputed by the representative of the Walman Yawuru claimants that, as a result of the decisions in Rubibi No 5 and Rubibi No 6 , the overlapping claim of the Walman Yawuru claimants must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Accordingly, it is appropriate to order that the proceeding of the Walman Yawuru claimants be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Extinguishment in respect of P. maxima (Issue 31) 
 
15 WAFIC submitted, 'as a matter of formality', that all native title rights to take and use P. maxima (a species of pearl oyster) have been extinguished by the enactment of the Pearling Act 1990 (WA) and the legislative predecessors to that Act (particularly the Pearling Act 1912 (WA)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The reason for the 'formal' submission was that WAFIC accepted that in Sampi (on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People) v Western Australia [2005] FCA 777 (' Sampi ') at [1146]-[1147], French J had rejected the same submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">WAFIC also accepted that the decision of French J would be followed by other single judges of the Court unless it was shown to be clearly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Although WAFIC wished to preserve the point for any appeal, it did not contend that the decision of French J was clearly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Accordingly, I reject WAFIC's submission for the reasons given by French J in Sampi , with which I respectfully agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Description of the native title holders 
 
16 Several issues arose concerning the description of the native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In accordance with the evidence concerning the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the Yawuru community, and the findings in Rubibi No 5 and Rubibi No 6 , I am satisfied that:
 
 (a) Lulu should not be named as one of the apical ancestors; 
 
 
 (b) (i) membership of the native title holding community in the case of a descendant of an apical ancestor does not require the criteria of self-identification or general community acceptance to be satisfied where both parents of the descendant are Yawuru;
 (ii) where only one parent of a descendant is Yawuru, the criterion of self-identification must be satisfied; and 
 
 
 (c) persons who are not descendants of an apical ancestor may nonetheless be members of the native title holding community if they were adopted as children or grown up by a Yawuru person as a member of the Yawuru community, or are persons who were born in or have a long term physical association with the Yawuru claim area and have cultural responsibilities in relation to that area, provided that the criteria of self-identification and general community acceptance are satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">

17 The Walman Yawuru representative made certain criticisms of the criteria in (b) and (c) above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In particular, it was contended that the criterion of general community acceptance should apply where there was only one Yawuru parent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The criterion of general community acceptance referred to in par (c) above is based on the findings and observations I made concerning that matter at [291] and [348] in Rubibi 5 and at [104] and [105] in Rubibi 6 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">I have been troubled by whether that criterion should also apply to the situation of a descendant who has only one Yawuru parent but have decided, primarily on the basis of the evidence referred at [105] in Rubibi No 6 , that that criterion is not required by traditional law and custom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">However, it should be emphasised that in order for self-identification to be genuine, something more is required than an announcement on a particular day that a person identifies himself or herself as a member of the Yawuru community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The genuineness of self-identification is to be determined by reference to all relevant facts, which can include past conduct in relation to self-identification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that traditional law and custom requires that the additional criterion of general community acceptance must be satisfied in the case of a descendant who only has one Yawuru parent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">18 The Walman Yawuru representative also claimed that the evidence did not justify incorporation into the Yawuru community of a person having high cultural knowledge and responsibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In my view, the evidence does justify such a principle, albeit that it will only be activated rarely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">It is to be recalled that it can only operate where the person in question is closely associated with the area, has the requisite knowledge and responsibilities, has self-identified as a member of the community and is generally accepted by other members of the community as a Yawuru person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">'Class N' freehold areas (Issue 4) 
 
19 These areas were the subject of 140 freehold grants in the Broome area made after 1 January 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">If the grants are valid they extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It appeared to be common ground that the freehold grants were future acts under the NTA and that the future act processes that were applicable at the time of the grants were not followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is also common ground that the grants were not validated by subsequent amendments to the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">20 Section 22 of the NTA as originally enacted (cf s 240A of the current NTA ) provided that an impermissible future act is invalid to the extent that it 'affects native title'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Section 227 of the NTA as originally enacted provided that an act affects native title if it extinguishes native title rights and interests, or if it is otherwise wholly or partly inconsistent with their continued existence, enjoyment or exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The freehold grants were future acts that were not validated by any provision of the NTA , with the result that they were impermissible future acts under the NTA as originally enacted and appear to be invalid to the extent that they affect native title: see Neowarra v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 1402 (' Neowarra ') at [586].</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">While it can be accepted that the freehold grants are valid insofar as they do not affect native title, they cannot have any extinguishing effect or confer rights that are inconsistent with the native title rights and interests I have found to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, as a result of my finding later in these reasons that reserve 631 (which included 139 of the relevant freehold areas) was validly created, the native title rights and interests in respect of 139 of the relevant freeholds are not exclusive rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It also appears that the remaining freehold lot was subject to a similar prior tenure or reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Accordingly, such of the rights and interests of the freehold owners as are not inconsistent with the rights and interests of the native title holders can co-exist with those native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">21 The State argued that, as the freehold grants were valid for some purposes, s 47B could not apply to the grants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">I doubt that the argument is correct but nothing turns on it because, as explained above, the freehold grants appear to have had no extinguishing effect on native title with the consequence that there was no extinguishment to be disregarded under s 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In any event, no relevant occupation was established for the purposes of s 47B so the section would not apply to the areas covered by the 140 freehold grants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">22 The Commonwealth made submissions on this issue because two of the 140 freeholds in question are held by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In the course of the Commonwealth's submissions, it became apparent that the 140 freehold grants were in the Cable Beach area and probably had houses constructed upon them by the freehold grantees, or by purchasers from those grantees, who had not been informed of these proceedings or of the likelihood that their rights were subject to the rights and interests of the native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">This extraordinary situation apparently came about because the Western Australian statutory regime relied upon by the State (to ensure that freeholds granted by it after 1 January 1994 prevailed over native title) was held by the High Court in State of Western Australia v The Commonwealth (Native Title Act Case) [1995] HCA 47 ; (1995) 183 CLR 373 ('the Native Title Act Case ') to be invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Plainly, the situation is one that will have to be resolved between owners of the freeholds, the State and the native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">One likely method of resolution is an indigenous land use agreement under which the native title holders may relinquish their native title rights and interests on appropriate terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">23 When this issue arose at the hearing, I expressed grave concern at how the matter had arrived at this stage without the freehold grantees or their purchasers having notice of the likelihood that the freehold grants are invalid to the extent that they affect native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Commonwealth's response to my concern appears to provide the answer which is that, properly construed, the relevant application of the Yawuru claimants did not claim the areas in respect of which the freehold grants were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">If that contention is correct that would preclude the Court from making a determination of native title in respect of the relevant areas but it will not make the problem disappear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">As against the State I have found that, subject to extinguishment, native title exists throughout the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Even if the 140 lots do not technically fall within that area they are not relevantly distinguishable from the surrounding areas in which native title has been found to exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It must follow that the problem created by the State by its 140 freehold grants, which were not validated by the NTA , will still have to be resolved by the relevant parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">24 I now turn to consider whether the 140 lots fall within the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The relevant application (#WN95/7) which was filed on 11 January 1995 was known, prior to the consolidation of the various applications, as Rubibi # 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The application was lodged with the Native Title Tribunal on 11 January 1995, which was prior to the decision in the Native Title Act Case .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">After certain amendments, which were made during January 1995, the application was accepted by the Native Title Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The application was in the form prescribed by Sch 1 of the NTA which, relevantly, provided for a description and a map of the area covered by the application and for the applicants to set out the information known to them about other interests in relation to the land and waters in the claim area: see pars A6 and A7 of the prescribed form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Paragraph A6 of the amended application stated that the area covered by the application was the land indicated on the attached map.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It added that:
 
 'The land claimed is in the State of Western Australia in the West Kimberley Region and covers all areas of land, currently designated Vacant Crown Land or Reserve , as fall within the area edged and hatched in heavy black lines on the accompanying map, save and except [certain specified Reserves].</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">...' (emphasis added) 

25 Paragraph A7 stated that the only interests held by persons 'in the area covered by the application' held by persons other than the applicants are 'various reserves'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Paragraph A7 followed a standard form and stated, inter alia , that any current or former valid grants of estates in fee simple or leasehold estates to persons other than the Crown which, under the laws of the Commonwealth, extinguish native title are excluded from the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">26 The attached map showed the designated Crown land or reserves that fell within the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The map also showed residential areas and streets, which included the 140 lots in question, that were within the boundaries of the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">27 In my view, irrespective of whether the application of the Yawuru claimants is construed literally or consistently with the express or implicit intention of the Yawuru claimants, it is clear that they did not claim, or intend to claim, the relevant freehold lots or any other freehold lots in the claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The area claimed is confined to areas 'currently designated Vacant Crown Land or Reserve' on the map accompanying the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">While there appears to have been several maps created in respect of the application, each of the maps limits the claim to areas currently designated as vacant Crown land or reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">There is nothing in the application or the accompanying map or maps that states that any claim to freehold land is being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I do not accept the contention of the Yawuru claimants that the standard form of exclusion of valid freehold lots that extinguish native title has the consequence of some kind of implicit inclusion in the claim of invalid freehold grants that do not extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">28 Plainly, the explanation for no claim being made for freehold land was that at the time the application was made (ie prior to the decision in the Native Title Act Case ), there was probably no expectation that such claims could be made and no intention that such a claim be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">If there had been such a claim, the other interests required to be set out in par A7 could be expected to have included information about the freehold interests that obviously fell within the outer boundaries of the land covered by the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">No such interests were disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">29 The above is sufficient to lead me to conclude that the Class N freehold areas were not claimed by the Yawuru claimants and therefore cannot be the subject of the native title determination in the present matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Whether certain licences create a right to a freehold grant (Issue 24) 
 
30 The issue is whether the grants of certain freeholds after 1 January 1994 are past acts pursuant to s 228(3)(b)(i) of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Section 19 of the NTA states that a law of the State or Territory may provide that past acts attributable to the State are valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It is not in dispute that the State Validation Act was enacted pursuant to s 19 of the NTA and thereby incorporated the relevant provisions of the NTA concerning past acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">One of the kinds of acts validated are category A past acts, which wholly extinguish native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">By s 229, a category A past act includes a freehold grant made after 1 January 1994 to which s 228(3), which is stated by s 229 to deal with such things as the exercise of options, applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Section 228(3)(b)(i) provides for a past act to take place when the act (ie the grant of the freehold) takes place 'in exercise of a legally enforceable right created by...[an] act done before 1 January 1994'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">An act is defined in s 226(2)(f) as including 'an act having any effect at common law or in equity'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">31 Section 45B of the Land Act 1933 (WA) ('the LA ') at the relevant time empowered the Minister to invite applications for the purchase of town and suburban land by advertisement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Section 43 of the LA empowered the Minister to grant licences to occupy to a purchaser of town or suburban land on payment of the first instalment of the purchase price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Prior to 1 January 1994, the State granted certain licences to occupy under s 43 of the LA to persons whose applications under s 45B to purchase land had been accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The Crown grants of the land were made to each of the purchasers (who had been granted a licence to occupy) after 1 January 1994 pursuant to s 41(4) of the LA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Under the licence, and the relevant provisions of the LA , each of the holders of the licences was entitled to the Crown grant upon payment of the purchase price, which the purchasers were obliged to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The entitlement was subject to any other conditions being satisfied but there is no evidence of any such conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">32 The State contends that the licences to occupy created a legally enforceable right to the grant of the freehold title, which crystallised into a presently enforceable right when the purchase price was paid or tendered for payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">33 The licence to occupy granted under s 43 of the LA is not, relevantly, distinguishable from a terms contract under which a purchaser is entitled to possession prior to payment of the purchase price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The licence is expressed to be subject to the terms specified in it and also to the terms and conditions of the LA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The terms specified in the licence included a requirement to pay the balance of the purchase price and the LA provided for a Crown grant to be made to the purchaser when the purchase price was paid and any other conditions were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">If, as is apparent from s 229(2)(iii), the legislature intended an option to purchase created prior to 1 January 1994 to be a legally enforceable right to acquire land, it must follow that a contract to purchase was also intended to constitute a legally enforceable right to acquire land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">34 In my view, the licences to occupy granted under, and in the context of, the relevant provisions of the LA created a legally enforceable right, albeit in equity, to the freehold grant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Put simply, the act that created the legally enforceable right to the freehold grant was the purchase made prior to 1 January 1994 (evidenced inter alia by the licence to occupy), rather than the payment of the purchase price after 1 January 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The payment of the price and the satisfaction of any other relevant conditions merely resulted in the prior legally enforceable right crystallising into a presently enforceable right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">35 Accordingly, the licences to occupy are past acts pursuant to s 228(3)(b)(i) of the NTA , and the freehold grants made after 1 January 1994 pursuant to the licences granted prior to that date, are therefore valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Reserves 631, 1637, 1640 and 1644 (Issue 28) 
 
36 The Yawuru claimants contended, and the State disputed, that reserves 631, 1637, 1640 and 1644 were invalidly created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The parties accepted that the issue of invalidity in respect of each of the reserves may be resolved by considering the creation of reserve 631, which covers a large part of the township of Broome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The parties accepted that that if reserve 631 was validly created, it would follow that the three other reserves were also validly created because all were created for 'public purposes' under substantially the same statutory scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">37 Reserve 631 was created pursuant to reg 29 of the Land Regulations 1882 (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Regulation 29 provided: 
 
 'The Governor is hereby authorised, subject to such conditions and limitations as he may think fit, to except from sale, and either to reserve to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, or to dispose of in such other manner as for the public interest may seem best, such lands, whether surveyed or not, as may be required for the following objects and purposes:

38 Regulation 30 provided:
 
 'A full and complete description of every such reserve, and of the purposes for which it is made, shall, so soon as possible, be published in the Government Gazette , and set forth on the authenticated maps in the Lands Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">' 

39 In the Government Gazette dated 27 November 1883, a notice was published that the Governor had set aside as 'Public Reserves, the land described in the Schedule below, for the purposes there set forth'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">The lands described in the Schedule were to be set aside as reserve 631.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The purpose for which the reservation was made was described in the Government Gazette as:
 
 'For public purposes, adjoining Broome, Roebuck Bay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">' 

40 Because there is no evidence of the creation of the reserve apart from the notice published in the Government Gazette , the Yawuru claimants contended that the published purpose should be accepted as a full and complete description of the purpose of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Having regard to reg 30 and the presumption of regularity, that contention should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Yawuru claimants then claimed that, because 'public purposes' was not a purpose specified in reg 29, the reserve was not validly created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">41 The law applicable to a challenge to the validity of a regulation made in the exercise of a statutory power to make regulations would appear to be applicable to the analogous exercise of a power to reserve land for certain purposes under a regulation that provides for the exercise of that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">In South Australia v Tanner [1989] HCA 3 ; (1989) 166 CLR 161 at 178-9, Brennan J stated that, as the validity of a regulation depends on whether it answers the statutory description, the problem is one of characterisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">His Honour explained that the character of the regulation is ascertained by the court's own assessment of the directness and substantiability of the connection between the likely operation of the regulation and the statutory object to be served.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated (at 165):
 
 '... there must be conceded a broad, rather than a narrow, approach in determining the nexus between the exercise of the power and the achievement of the purpose for which it is conferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">' 
 

and (at 168):
 
 'In the course of argument the parties accepted the reasonable proportionality test of validity (cf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Deane J. in The Commonwealth v Tasmania (the Tasmanian Dam Case); namely, whether the regulation is capable of being considered to be reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">' (footnote omitted) 

42 Regulation 29(13) is in the broadest of terms and extends to any purpose of public 'utility' or of 'otherwise facilitating the improvement and settlement of the Colony'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">In my view, 'public purposes --- adjoining Broome, Roebuck Bay' is plainly capable of being considered reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose and therefore falls within reg 29(13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is a purpose that is implicitly, if not explicitly, associated with the development of the Broome township and, as such, is both directly and substantially connected to being a purpose of public 'utility' and is also capable of being characterised as a purpose facilitating the improvement and settlement of Broome in the Colony of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">43 It can be accepted that the phrase 'public purposes' has a broad meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">In Bathurst City Council v PWC Properties Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 59 ; (1998) 195 CLR 566 (' Bathurst ') at 590 [58] Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ stated that the phrase 'public purposes' connotes 'the giving to the public of some rights in the land which subtract from the Crown's full ownership'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Their Honours stated at 591 [62]:
 
 'the meaning of "public purposes" depends in part upon the scope and purposes of the particular legislation...' 

44 Further, in the majority judgment in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 (' Ward HC ') at 137-138 [218]-[219], their Honours observed:
 
 
 '218.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Reservation of land under the relevant Western Australian provisions inhibited the Crown's future action in relation to that land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The inhibition, however, was not, and could not be, absolute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">As Windeyer J pointed out in Randwick Corporation v Rutledge , even if land were dedicated to a public purpose, it did not take the land outside the authority of the legislature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Moreover, under the Western Australian statutes, reserves, other than those dealt with by the Permanent Reserves Act 1899 (WA) and its legislative successor, could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by executive act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Even permanent reserves could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Further, as had been held in Williams v Attorney-General for New South Wales ('the Government House Case '), the Crown appropriating lands to a particular purpose, without the creation of a trust, did not mean that the land became dedicated to that purpose, or that it could not later be used by the Crown for some other purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">
 219.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Nevertheless, by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose, even a purpose as broadly described as 'public utility', the executive, acting pursuant to legislative authority, decided the use or uses to which the land could be put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The executive had taken to itself and asserted (pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute) the right to say how the land could be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">This step was not, however, necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">' (footnotes omitted) 
 

45 Although their Honours were not determining the precise legal consequences of a reservation of land for public purposes, there is nothing in the above passages that suggests that there is any particular difficulty with such a reservation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">46 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that reserve 631 was created for one of the purposes specified in reg 29 (13) and was validly created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">47 Reserves 1637, 1640 and 1644 were created for 'public purposes' under the Land Regulations 1887 (WA), which were not relevantly distinguishable from the Land Regulations 1882 (WA), save that the later regulations assumed that reserves could be created for 'public purposes': see regs 2 and 36 (which defined 'public purposes').</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Thus, if there is any distinction to be drawn between the two sets of regulations, it is one that provides added support to the State's argument in favour of the valid creation of the relevant reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">As it was accepted by the parties that the finding in respect of reserve 631 would determine the issue of validity in respect of all four of these reserves, I need not pursue this aspect of the matter further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">It follows that reserves 1637, 1640 and 1644 were also validly created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">Special lease over reserved land (Issue 29) 
 
48 On 1 April 1930, a special lease was purportedly granted under s 153 of the Land Act 1898 (WA) ('the LA 1898 ') over Broome Lot 622 (which comprises all of area 2733).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The lease, which was for a term of five years commencing on 1 April 1930, was for the purpose of 'a foreshore camp, store site and repairing boats'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">49 At the date of the lease, the area leased was reserved land under the LA 1898 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Part III of the LA 1898 (ss 39-46) applied to reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Section 39 conferred power on the Governor to reserve any lands vested in the Crown for certain purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Section 41A conferred power on the Governor to lease reserved land not immediately required for the reserved purpose from 'year to year, or for any shorter term, for any purpose' on such terms and conditions as the Governor may think fit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Section 42 empowered the Governor by Order in Council to vest reserved land in certain persons and granted power to those persons to lease the land on the terms set out in the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">50 Part IV of the LA 1898 (ss 47-52) provides for the sale of town, suburban and village lands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Part XII of the LA 1898 (ss 134-161) contains miscellaneous provisions, which include ss 152 and 153.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Section 152 empowers the Governor to grant leases of land vested in the Crown for certain specified purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Section 153 conferred a general power on the Governor to 'lease any town, suburban or village lands on such terms as he may think fit'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">51 It is common ground that the special lease granted on 1 April 1930 was not a lease that was capable of being granted under ss 41A, 42 or 152 of the LA 1898 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">The issue is whether s 153 empowered the Governor to lease land that has been reserved under Pt III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">52 Each part of the LA 1898 contained discrete provisions for lands in Western Australia, save for Pts I and XII which contained 'Introductory and General Provisions' and 'Miscellaneous Provisions' respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The structure of the LA 1898 suggests that the legislature intended to provide for the creation of reserves and any transactions concerning reserves in Pt III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The general structure of the LA 1898 , together with the comprehensive and detailed provisions contained in Pt III in relation to reserves, indicate that the legislature intended that Pt III constitute a code in respect of the creation of reserves and transactions, such as leases, in respect of reserved land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">For example, Pt III specifically empowers the leasing of reserved land but only upon particular terms, in specified circumstances or for limited purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">If s 153 were to be construed as empowering the Governor to lease reserved land without any of the fetters imposed upon the leasing of that land by Pt III, the section would render nugatory the detailed restrictions imposed in Pt III on the leasing of such land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Such a lease could be for purposes that are inconsistent with the reserved purpose, for purposes that are not specified purposes in s 42 or for a term beyond that provided for in s 41A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">It is implicit, if not explicit, in the statutory scheme for the leasing of reserved land that the lease must comply with the provisions of Pt III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Put another way, the leasing power conferred in respect of reserved land is set out in Pt III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">It follows that s 153 only empowers the Governor to lease town, suburban or village lands that are not reserved lands under Pt III.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">53 Accordingly, the Governor did not have the power under s 153 to grant a special lease of Lot 622 on 1 April 1930 and the special lease granted on that date was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Gaol and police station reserves (Issue 44A) 
 
54 The land on which the Broome gaol and police station have been constructed was validly reserved for those purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">However, part of the reserved land has not yet had any construction take place upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The State relied upon Ward HC at 136 [215] to contend that, by reserving land for the purposes of a gaol and police station, and then erecting a gaol and police station on part of the reserved land, the State has asserted rights over the whole of the land that are inconsistent with the native title rights and interests of the Yawuru community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The issue raised by the State is whether the construction of the gaol and the police station on the parcels of land reserved for those purposes has extinguished native title rights and interests in relation to the whole of the respective reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">55 The Yawuru claimants did not contest the extinguishment claimed in respect of the areas on which the gaol and the police station have been constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">As I later explain, it is common ground that extinguishment has occurred in any event in respect of those areas because the gaol and police station are public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The contest relates to the vacant land in the reserves that has not yet been used for the purposes of a gaol or police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Although a similar issue was considered in Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 (' Daniel ') at [688] and [698], the question of whether the assertion of the right to build a gaol or a prison on part of the reserved land extinguished inconsistent native title rights over the whole of the reserved land was not considered in Daniel or Ward HC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">56 In Ward HC , the question of extinguishment in respect of a reserve was carefully considered in the majority judgment at 137-142:
 
 
 '214.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">It is important to recall that the ultimate question is whether, by the steps that were taken, the Crown created in others, or asserted, rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It was submitted that the features of the statutory regulation of public reserves which we have mentioned indicated that reservation, even without vesting, amounted to dedication to the purpose specified in the instrument of reservation in the sense, so it was submitted, that reservation prevented the Crown from applying the land to some other purpose and created some right in members of the public generally or a section of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 215.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The reference by Brennan J, in the passage of his reasons in Mabo [No 2] that is set out earlier, to use of the land that is reserved, may distract attention from the relevant inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They are, as we have said, whether rights have been created in others that are rights inconsistent with native title rights and interests, and whether the Crown has asserted rights over the land that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Use of the land may suggest, it may even demonstrate, that such rights have been created or asserted, but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights, not inconsistency of use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Further, as has already been pointed out, it is often necessary to examine inconsistency by reference to the particular native title right and interest concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 219.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Nevertheless, by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose, even a purpose as broadly described as 'public utility', the executive, acting pursuant to legislative authority, decided the use or uses to which the land could be put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The executive had taken to itself and asserted (pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute) the right to say how the land could be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">This step was not, however, necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">
 220.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The reason that the right to use the land may have survived reservation is the same reason that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished the right to control access to the land, but not necessarily all the rights of native title holders to use it in accordance with the rights held under traditional laws or customs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The provisions of the Acts providing a penalty for "unlawful or unauthorised use or occupation" of lands (including "lands reserved for or dedicated to any public purpose") did not, on their proper construction, prohibit use or occupation by native title holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It is, therefore, not right to say, as a proposition of universal application, as Western Australia submitted, that reserved lands could not lawfully be used except for the reserved purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The facts that the 1905 amendments to the Land Act 1898 permitted leasing of reserves not immediately required for their purpose or that in 1960 the Land Act 1933 was amended to permit leasing or licensing of certain kinds of reserve for depasturing stock require no different conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Whether a right in native title holders to use the land continued unextinguished depends upon other considerations, particularly what, if any, rights in others were created by the reservation or later asserted by the executive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">
 221.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The designation of land as a reserve for certain purposes did not, without more, create any right in the public or any section of the public which, by reason of inconsistency and apart from the State Validation Act , extinguished native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 233.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The majority of the Full Court treated the use that had been made of reserved land, even land that had been vested in a body or person, as determining whether native title had been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">So, for example, it was held in relation to Reserve 1059 (a reserve which had been created in 1886 for "public utility" but had not been vested in any body or person) that "[t]he general use of the area for watering cattle, and as a pastoral lease destroyed the exclusivity of native title rights".</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Their Honours went on to say that "[t]he close use" of the area of Reserve 1059 which now forms part of another reserve "would have wholly extinguished native title in that area".</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Similarly, in the case of reserves vested in a body, their Honours looked to the use that had been made of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">
 234.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As we have said earlier, we consider that looking to the use that has actually been made of land distracts attention from the central inquiry which is an inquiry about rights created in others or asserted by the executive, not the way in which they may have been exercised at any time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Neither the Full Court nor the primary judge considered that central inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">' 
 

57 The above passages provide the answer to the State's submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">By creating the reserves for a gaol and a police station, the executive did not create rights in others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Rather, the executive asserted its right to say how the land could be used and the assertion of that right extinguished any native title right to control or say how the land could or could not be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">However, that was not necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had, according to traditional laws and customs, been entitled to use it before its reservation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">58 There remains the question of whether, by constructing a gaol and a police station on the reserves, the Crown 'created in others, or asserted, rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land': see [214] in Ward HC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">In my view, the exercise of the right to construct a gaol or police station on part only of the reserved land is not necessarily inconsistent with native title rights and interests in the remaining part of the reserved land if that part of the reserve is not reasonably necessary for, or incidental to, the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station: cf De Rose v South Australia (No 2) [2005] FCAFC 110 ; (2005) 145 FCR 290 (' De Rose No 2 ') at 332 [152] and 335 [166].</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">In De Rose No 2 , that formulation was applied in respect of the extinguishment that occurred upon the exercise by the lessee of the lessee's right under a pastoral lease to construct improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In the present context, the exercise of the right to construct an improvement on a reserve in pursuance of the reserved purpose is analogous to the exercise of the right to construct an improvement under a pastoral lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Accordingly, it is appropriate to apply the same criterion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">As that criterion is similar to, but not identical with, the criterion that is to be applied to the gaol and police station as public works under s 251D of the NTA , it is appropriate to deal with both criteria in the context of the extinguishment that resulted from the construction of the gaol and the police station as public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">59 In summary, construction of the gaol and police station on part of the reserves extinguished native title rights and interests in the areas on which the gaol and police station were constructed and on areas adjacent thereto that were reasonably necessary for or incidental to the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">However, the construction did not necessarily extinguish native title rights and interests in respect of the remaining areas of the respective reserves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Mining and pastoral leases (Issues 26 and 27) 
 
60 It was common ground that, as a result of the decision in Ward HC , the grant of valid pastoral or mining leases was inconsistent with, and therefore extinguished, any native title right or interest to exclusive possession of, or to control access to or use of, the areas the subject of the leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It was also common ground that, as a result of the decision of the Full Court in De Rose No 2 at 329-335 [139]-[165], the exercise by the pastoral lessees of their rights under the leases to construct improvements on the land leased was inconsistent with the continuation of any inconsistent native title rights or interests insofar as they related to the land on which the improvements were constructed and any adjacent land the use of which was reasonably necessary for, or incidental to, the operation or enjoyment of the improvements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">61 The issue on which the Yawuru claimants and the State differed concerned whether the native title right and interest 'to live' on the leased land was inconsistent with the rights conferred by the pastoral or mining leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The State accepted that I was bound by the decision of the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr, Kaytetye, Warumungu, Wakaya Native Title Claim Group [2005] FCAFC 135 ; (2005) 145 FCR 442 (' Alyawarr ') at 480-481 [130]-[132] to find that the native title right to live on a pastoral lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessee under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">In Alyawarr , the Full Court stated at 481 [131]-[133]:
 
 
 '131.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The pastoral leases which have affected the claim area in the present case are historical grants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The relevant extinguishment of native title rights and interests derives only from inconsistency with the rights historically conferred by those leases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">No question of prospective activity under a subsisting pastoral lease arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Consistently with what was said by Nicholson J in Daniel (No 2) and Sundberg J in Neowarra , the right to 'live' on the land can be interpreted as a right to live permanently on the land without any conflict with pastoral leaseholders' rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">That right does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The issue therefore reduces to the question whether a native title right of permanent settlement is inconsistent with a pastoral leaseholder's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">There is no logical reason why it must be so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Just as the right to live permanently on the land does not necessarily give rise to inconsistency with the pastoral leaseholder's rights, neither does the right to erect a permanent structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The existence of such a structure does not preclude a pastoralist's right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">It is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">
 132.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The inconsistency posited by the Northern Territory in respect of the grant of historical pastoral leases long expired, is based on a theoretical conflict which would not inevitably have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">No inconsistency of rights giving rise to extinguishment of the native title right to live on the land and to erect permanent structures thereon is demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The concept of "permanency" referred to here is, in any event, a relative one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">
 133.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The right defined in par 3(b) to live on the land, to camp, to erect shelters and other structures, and to travel over and visit any part of the land and waters, should stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">' 
 

62 Accordingly, subject to the outcome of any appeal in Alyawarr , the State accepts that the determination proposed by the Yawuru claimants, which includes a native title right to live in the areas covered by pastoral leases, should stand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">63 However, the State contended for a different outcome in respect of areas covered by mining leases issued under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) ('the MA ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">The State relied upon the extensive rights conferred under s 85 of the MA to use, occupy and enjoy the land in respect of which the mining lease was granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">The rights included the right to do all things that are necessary to carry out 'mining operations' in, on and under the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The phrase 'mining operations' is given a wide definition in s 8 of the MA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The State also relied upon the decisions in Neowarra (at [522] and [613]) and Daniel (at [741], [768] and [822]) to contend that any permanent native title right to live on the land in respect of which a mining lease has been granted has been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">64 The Yawuru claimants disputed the State's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">They relied upon a later decision of RD Nicholson J in Daniel v State of Western Australia ([2003] FCA 1425 [23]-[25]) to contend that a mining lease is not relevantly distinguishable from a pastoral lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Under both leases, so it was argued, a native title right to live on the land the subject of the lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessees under the relevant leases although the Yawuru claimants accepted that, upon the exercise of some of the lessee's rights, inconsistent native title rights and interests may be extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">65 The passages relied upon by the parties must now be considered in the light of the Full Court decisions in Alyawarr and De Rose No 2 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">As was pointed out in Alyawarr , a right to live upon the land does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Thus, even if a permanent structure was erected in pursuance of the right to live upon the land, that 'does not preclude a pastoralist's right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease': see Alyawarr at [131].</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Their Honours added that it 'is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">66 The same reasoning applies to the exercise of the extensive range of rights conferred under a mining lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">A native title right to live on the land leased is not necessarily inconsistent with any of the rights conferred under a mining lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">In the event there is a necessary inconsistency, the lessee's rights will prevail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">As is clear from the reasoning in De Rose No 2 , if the right under the lease was, for example, to erect improvements necessary for mining operations, the exercise of that right will extinguish any inconsistent native title rights (including the right to live on the land) in respect of the area on which the improvements have been constructed and any adjacent area necessary for their enjoyment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">However, it is not suggested that there has been any exercise of rights that are inconsistent with a native title right to live on the areas the subject of the mining leases that are within the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">67 Accordingly, I do not accept the State's contention that the rights conferred by the grant of the mining leases under the MA are necessarily inconsistent with, and therefore extinguish, a native title right to live on the leased land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">However, the native title right to live on the leased land is qualitatively different from a native title right to live on land in respect of which the holders of the native title right have a right of exclusive possession because, in the latter case, the right of the holder is not subject to the risk of subsequent extinguishment.</sentence>

69 In Rubibi Community v Western Australia (No 4) [2004] FCA 1019 ; (2004) 138 FCR 536, I determined that the date 'when the application is made' is the date of the filing in the Court of the application for native title in respect of 'the area' referred to in ss 47A(1)(c) and 47B(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Plainly, 'the area' referred to in those sub-sections must be an area within the area the subject of a claimant application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">However, as was explained by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [686] and [721], the area need not be the whole of the area claimed as that could lead to clearly unintended consequences in relation to the operation of ss 47A and 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Rather, the relevant area is the particular area with which each of the sections is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">70 Textual, contextual and purposive considerations all point to 'the area' that is referred to in s 47A(1)(c) being 'the area' referred to in s 47A(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">That is, 'the area' is the particular area the subject of the defined freehold estate, the defined lease, the defined vesting or the land expressly held or reserved for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">That was the view taken by Sundberg J in Neowarra (at [686]) and, in my view, is clearly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Insofar as there may be doubt about that matter, pars 5.45-5.49 of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , which inserted ss 47A and 47B, make it clear that the occupation is to be in respect of 'the land' the subject of the past 'land rights type' grant, trust, reservation or other historical act that would otherwise have extinguished native title in relation to that land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s 47A(1)(c) is an occupation in respect of the relevant 'area', that is the whole, rather than merely a part, of the particular area the subject of the freehold estate, lease, vesting etc.
 
71 The situation under s 47B differs from that under s 47A because s 47B requires that at the date the application is made 'the area' is not covered by a freehold estate, lease, reservation etc.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">However, as was pointed out by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [721], the relevant area for the purposes of s 47B is 'the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that, but for the section, native title rights would be extinguished'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">That construction of s 47B is consistent with par 5.56 of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 which states:
 
 'Section 47B is a statutory mechanism designed to allow native title claimants who are in occupation of vacant Crown land to overcome the effect of past extinguishment and have their claim determined by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The current section 47 allows a claim for pastoral lease land, notwithstanding past extinguishment, where the claimants hold the pastoral lease.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">This provision will allow a claim for vacant Crown land where the claimants are in occupation of the land, notwithstanding possible extinguishment by any historical act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">' 

72 It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s 47B(1)(c) must also be an occupation in respect of the whole, rather than merely a part, of the particular area in respect of which, but for s 47B, native title rights would be extinguished: see Neowarra at [758]-[760].</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">73 The more difficult question arising under ss 47A and 47B concerns the requirement that there be occupation of the relevant area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">In Alyawarr at 496 ([193]-[195]), the Full Court discussed several cases which had considered that requirement:
 
 
 '193.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The requirement of occupation in s 47A of the NT Act, which is the same as that in s 47B, was considered by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FC 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Their Honours considered that a broad view should be taken of the word (at [449]): 
 

 "We think this requirement is met where a claimant member is one of many people who share occupancy, and that the land may be relevantly occupied even though the person is rarely present on the lands so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that person wishes to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">" 
 
 
 194.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">In Rubibi Community v Western Australia [2001] FCA 607 ; (2001) 112 FCR 409, Merkel J found the following activities to evidence occupation of an area of land for the purposes of s 47A(1)(c) of the NT Act: 
 

 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">continuing supervisory and protective activities of the senior Yawuru men in relation to the claim area;

<sentence id="s335">the holding of traditional ceremonies on the claim area as and when the senior lawmen authorised those activities;

<sentence id="s336">continued storage of sacred objects on the claim area; 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">occupancy of the Leregon structures constructed on the claim area by members of the Lee family who are acknowledged to be members of the Rubibi claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">
 
 
 In Passi v Queensland [2001] FCA 697 Black CJ, on a consent determination, said that although the islands the subject of that determination were not permanently inhabited the evidence showed that the Meriam people used the land as and when they wished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Its use was consistent with its reserved purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">His Honour was satisfied that the people occupied the relevant islands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">In Daniel at [973] Nicholson J also applied what Beaumont and von Doussa JJ had said in Ward FC 1 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">He equated "connection" and "occupation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">
 195.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">As Toohey J said in Mabo (No 2) at 188 presence on land does not have to be possession at law to amount to occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">He referred to United States and Canadian cases which established occupancy by reference to the demands of the land and society in question "in accordance with the way of life, habits, customs and usages of the [indigenous people] who are its users and occupiers" --- Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma v United States (1967) 383 F 2d 991 at 998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">His Honour observed in particular that "... a nomadic lifestyle is not inconsistent with occupancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">"' 
 

74 In reliance upon the cases referred to by the Full Court, the Yawuru claimants adduced extensive evidence of connection with, visits to and use of, numerous urban and bush areas within the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The evidence was relied upon by the Yawuru claimants to contend that the traditional connection with, and use of, the areas in question over a period of time by certain members of the claimant group constituted occupation of those areas at the relevant date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The Yawuru claimants even argued that they did not have to establish use because the entitlement I had found to exclusive possession of the Yawuru claim area (which was subject to the findings on extinguishment) was sufficient to constitute occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">The argument is erroneous as it fails to distinguish between the criteria under s 223(1) of the NTA that must be satisfied in order to justify a finding of a native title right to exclusive occupation and the discrete requirement in ss 47A and 47B for occupation as a matter of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">75 The State contended that the difficulty with the broad brush approach adopted by the Yawuru claimants is that it equates visits to and use of an area from time to time with occupation of that area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">While use and visitation may be sufficient in some instances, each case will depend on its own facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">76 Although occupation is a question of fact involving matters of fact and degree, some general principles can be discerned from the cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">In Western Australia v Ward [2000] FCA 191 ; (2000) 99 FCR 316 (' Ward FC '), Beaumont and von Doussa JJ considered the meaning of the term 'occupy' in ss 47A and 47B and stated (at 437 [449]):
 
 'A broad view should be taken of the word "occupy" in the requirement in s 47A(1)(c) that one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">' 

77 This approach has been accepted and followed in a number of other cases (see, for example, Daniel at [938], Alyawar at 496 [193] and Neowarra at [682]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">78 Although it has been accepted that a broad and beneficial construction of the word 'occupy' is to be preferred, there remains the difficulty that, generally, occupation of an area requires something more than a traditional connection with or mere use of or visitation to the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">The cases provide some useful guidance in resolving that difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">79 In Ward FC , Beaumont and von Doussa JJ stated (at 437 [449]) that occupancy may be established notwithstanding that the claimant:
 
 'is rarely present on the land so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that person wishes to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">' 

80 RD Nicholson J adopted this approach in Daniel at [973] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Although it is not necessary to establish frequent use of the land, it is clear that frequency of the use of the land can be a relevant factor in determining whether or not there is occupation of that land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">81 In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 (' Hayes ') at 144 ([162]), Olney J pointed out that, given the context in which s 47B was enacted (namely as part of Parliament's response to the decision in Wik Peoples v Queensland [1996] HCA 40 ; (1996) 187 CLR 1), the requirement for occupation of the land should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people had traditionally occupied the land, rather than in the sense of occupation according to common law principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">His Honour then stated at 144 [162] :
 
 'The use of traditional country by members of the relevant claimant group which is neither random nor co-incidental but in accordance with the way of life, habits, customs and usages of the group is in the context of the legislation sufficient to indicate occupation of the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">' 

A similar approach was adopted by French J in Sampi at [1136].</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">82 In Ward FC at 437 [449], use of the land for the reserved purpose was regarded as an indicator of occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">In Daniel (at [973]), RD Nicholson J also regarded it as significant that the claimants made use of the land 'for its purpose as and when [they wished] to do so'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The references in the cases to the 'purpose' of the use, at least in relation to s 47A, indicate that a traditional use of the area, or a use that is consistent with the purpose of the reservation, being for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples, may be more likely to result in a finding of occupation of 'the area'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">The reason for that was explained by Olney J in Hayes in the passage referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">83 In some cases, evidence in relation to traditional connection has been relied upon to establish occupation: see Daniel at [938] and [973].</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Although evidence in relation to connection for the purposes of s 223(1)(b) of the NTA can be relevant to occupation under ss 47A and 47B, it would be erroneous to equate connection with occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">84 The State argued that the kind of occupation contemplated by ss 47A and 47B was traditional occupation, in the sense of use of the land in accordance with traditional laws and customs, rather than random or co-incidental use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Whilst random or co-incidental use may be unlikely to constitute occupation, and traditional use may be more likely to constitute occupation, there is no proper basis for reading a requirement of traditional occupation into ss 47A and 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">However, traditional use was successfully relied upon to establish occupation in Hayes and Daniel .</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Where the use is not traditional, the question remains whether the evidence about connection, use, habitation or visitation is sufficient to warrant a conclusion, as a matter of fact, that the requisite occupation has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">85 Finally, it is not necessary for the occupation of the land to be exclusive or confined in fact to persons who are members of the claimant group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In Ward FC (at 437 [449]), Beaumont and von Doussa JJ noted that it was sufficient for the claim group member to be 'one of many people who share occupancy' and that occupation by non-claimant persons does not preclude the claimants from occupying the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">However, in my view, if the evidence establishes a similar non-traditional use of the relevant area by the general public, the fact that some members of the public using the area are claim group members is unlikely to be sufficient to justify a finding of occupation of the area by one or more claim group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">The Shire of Broome contended that, where the physical presence of a claim group member in an urban area is for a purpose and of a character that is indistinguishable from the physical presence of a member of the public, the presence should not be considered to be 'occupation' for the purposes of ss 47A or 47B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">Although there is merit in the Shire's submission, I would not go so far as to accept it as a criterion for refusing to find the requisite occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">However, general public use of the relevant area is a relevant, if not a determinative, factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Ultimately, the question is whether the requisite occupation by a claim group member has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">86 The Yawuru claimants argued that their traditional connection with the Yawuru claim area, or with specific areas, distinguishes the use of claim areas by claim group members from use by the general public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">While that question is a matter for evidence, I do not accept that the connection contended for can be assumed in respect of use of public areas where the use of those areas by claim group members is not a use for a traditional activity and is not distinguishable from use of the areas by other members of the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">87 In my findings in favour of occupation of a number of areas both within and outside the Broome region and against occupation of certain areas within Broome, I have taken into account the fact that, generally, visits to and use of areas in Broome by the public is largely indistinguishable from visits to and use of those areas by members of the claim group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">88 Plainly, a variety of factors can be relevant to occupation and, as I have just explained, there may be different outcomes, even where the nature of the occupation has superficial similarities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The case put in respect of each area must be considered in its own context and on its own facts having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">89 The State accepted that ss 47A or 47B applied to a significant number of the areas claimed by the Yawuru claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">In the light of principles set out above, I turn to consider the s 47A and the s 47B issues that were raised by the Yawuru claimants and disputed by the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The Shire of Broome ('the Shire') also had an interest in some of the relevant areas but generally adopted the State's submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Accordingly, the reasons given in relation to the State's submissions will also apply to the submissions of the Shire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">(a) The s 47A areas in dispute 
 
 Area 263 (CT 1318/469 --- Stewart and Herbert Streets) 
 
90 The State accepted that the area falls within s 47A but contended, correctly in my view, that as at the date of the application (11 January 1995), there was no relevant occupation of this block.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">Accordingly, s 47A does not apply to this area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Area 354 (CT 1438/103 --- Walcott Street) 
 
91 The State argued that this area is not within s 47A and that there is no relevant occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">This area is a freehold block held by the Mamabulanjin Aboriginal Corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">92 An initial question arises as to whether land held by a body that is incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) ('the ACA Act' ) is land held 'expressly for the benefit' of Aboriginal peoples for the purposes of s 47A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The question arises in respect of Mamabulanjin Aboriginal Corporation, Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation and Broome Aboriginal Media Association ('the associations'), which are associations that are incorporated under the ACA Act and hold areas 354, 1742 and 2128 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">93 The ACA Act is stated to provide 'for the Constitution of Aboriginal Councils and the Incorporation of Associations of Aboriginals and for matters connected therewith'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Section 3 defines an 'Aboriginal association' as an association, society or body whose eligibility for membership is limited to Aboriginals and spouses of Aboriginals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Section 49 provides that a person who is not an Aboriginal or a spouse of an Aboriginal is not entitled to become a member of an Incorporated Aboriginal Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">94 The objects of each of the associations make it clear that the associations are to generally promote the economic and social development of their members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">In fact, the objects of the Broome Aboriginal Media Association and Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation state as their main object, inter alia , the provision of 'direct relief from poverty, sickness, suffering, destitution, misfortune, distress and helplessness' of Aboriginal persons in particular regions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">The Rules or Constitutions of the associations provide for the property and funds of the association to be available at the discretion of the Committee for the purpose of carrying out the objects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">95 In Neowarra at [697]-[698], Sundberg J considered the requirement in s 47A(1)(b)(ii) that the area be held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">His Honour considered that 'expressly' meant not merely impliedly and not arising merely by inference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">His Honour also referred to cases that had decided that for something to be express, rather than implied, it must arise directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">96 Sundberg J then applied the above criteria to an association incorporated under the ACA Act and stated (at [706]):
 
 'The remaining question is whether, as they assert, the Rules of Kupungarri Aboriginal Corporation (under the ACA Act) show that Kupungarri holds the lease "expressly for the benefit of...Aboriginal peoples".</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Kupungarri's property is "available, at the discretion of the Committee, for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the Association".</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The objects in r 6 are all directed to the benefit of a group of Aboriginal people --- education, job training, housing, health services and so on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">The Rules clearly and unmistakably disclose that Kupungarri's property is held by it for the benefit of Aboriginal persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">They make that explicit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">There is no need to imply that from the Rules or any other source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">The case falls within s 47A(1)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">' 

97 I am not satisfied that his Honour was clearly wrong and, indeed, I am in agreement with his Honour's approach (cf Risk v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 404 at [881] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The rules of the associations are not relevantly distinguishable from the rules considered by Sundberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">It must follow that the property of each of the three associations is held by them expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">98 The remaining issue is whether the requisite occupation has been established in respect of area 354.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">I accept, as did Sundberg J in Neowarra at [708], that a combination of activities in the area can amount to occupation by claim group members, notwithstanding that the area is also occupied by the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The problem with the claim under s 47A in respect of area 354 is that the activity relied upon is residence in one of the two houses on the area by a Yawuru claim group member.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">As explained above, s 47A requires occupancy of the whole of the area, not merely part of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Accordingly, the requisite occupancy has not been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Area 691 (CT 1675/397 --- Stewart &amp; Hamersley Streets) 
 
99 The State argued that the area is not within s 47A and that there is no relevant occupation.</sentence>

<sentence id="s473">There was also evidence of hunting of possums, kangaroo and goanna in some of these areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">In relation to the coastal areas, there was evidence of fishing, crabbing and cockling as well as the obtaining of bush medicine and bush tucker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">In most instances, the State accepted that the evidence was sufficient to amount to occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">However, the State claimed that the evidence concerned contemporary usage, rather than usage at the relevant dates, being, for the most part, dates in 1994 or 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">120 In my view, the evidence of the Yawuru claimants establishes that these bush areas were visited and used by claim group members in recent times for traditional purposes as and when the members chose to do so.</sentence>

<sentence id="s479">In those circumstances, I am prepared to treat the visits to and usage of the bush and coastal areas for traditional purposes as similar to the visits and usage of bush and coastal areas outside of the Broome region, and therefore as sufficient to constitute occupation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">It follows that the State's concessions were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">121 The remaining issue is whether the evidence of contemporary usage by claim group members justifies an inference that the same usage had occurred at the relevant dates, which appear for the most part to be in 1994 or 1995.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">This question also arose in respect of several of the areas dealt with above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">I have found this to be a difficult question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">On balance, I have inclined to the view that the same, or a substantially similar, usage by claim group members occurred at the relevant dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">The main reason for that conclusion is that the usage is traditional and of a kind that is likely to have been ongoing over a long period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Accordingly, I am prepared to infer that, at the relevant dates in 1994 and 1995, it is more probable than not that one or more claim group members visited and used these bush areas as and when they chose to do so and in much the same way as those areas are now being visited and used by present claim group members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">Accordingly, the requisite occupation has been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">While it would have been preferable for direct evidence to have been given by claim group members of occupation at the relevant dates, the failure to give that evidence does not preclude the inference I have drawn.</sentence>

<sentence id="s490">Inter-tidal areas 
 
123 The State contended, correctly in my view, that exclusive native title was not recognised in these areas under s 223(c) of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">As a consequence, ss 47A and 47B cannot be relied upon to claim exclusive possession because the sections are concerned with past extinguishment, rather than non-recognition: see Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia [2005] FCA 50 at [263] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Improvements on ss 47A and 47B leasehold areas 
 
124 The State contended that past extinguishment by the exercise of the right to erect an improvement on a leasehold to which s 47A or s 47B applies, is not to be disregarded notwithstanding that the sections require the grant of the lease or prior interest to be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">In my view, the contention is not correct because the past extinguishment only occurred by the grant of the lease or prior interest which conferred the right to construct the improvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">As is clear from De Rose No 2 at [157], the extinguishment arises from the grant of the lease and operates when the improvement is constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">It follows that, if the grant of the lease or other prior interest is to be disregarded under s 47A or s 47B, there can be no extinguishing effect by the exercise of the right to construct the improvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Public Works (Issues 6 --- 22) 
 
125 Public works that are category A past acts (s 229(4)) or previous exclusive possession acts (s 23B(7)) extinguish native title.</sentence>

 '(a) any of the following that is constructed or established by or on behalf of the Crown, or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown, in any of its capacities: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) a building, or other structure (including a memorial), that is a fixture; or 
 (ii) a road, railway or bridge; or 
 (iia) where the expression is used in or for the purposes of a Division 2 or 2A of Part 2 --- a stock-route; or 
 (iii) a well, or bore, for obtaining water; or 
 (iv) any major earthworks; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a building that is constructed with the authority of the Crown, other than on a lease.</sentence>

126 Section 251D provides:
 
 'In this Act, a reference to land or waters on which a public work is constructed, established or situated includes a reference to any adjacent land or waters the use of which is or was necessary for, or incidental to, the construction, establishment or operation of the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">' 

127 The extinguishment provided for in the NTA in respect of public works was confirmed by ss 6 and 12J of the State Validation Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">The Yawuru claimants accepted that certain public works extinguished native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">However, the status of other works, and the extent of any extinguishment by public works, were the subject of dispute at the extinguishment hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">128 Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree, the State's submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines:
 
 'In Hayes v Northern Territory [1999] FCA 1248 ; (1999) 97 FCR 32 ( Hayes ) at page 109 (xiv) Justice Olney found that "it may well be inferred that 'recreation equipment' would be both a structure and a fixture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">" Again, at page 102 (viii), his Honour stated that "... there is no evidence of any building or structure in the nature of a fixture other than possibly a fence ..." Clearly Justice Olney regarded recreation equipment and fences as examples of structures that could be considered as public works for the purposes of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">This accords with the ordinary meaning of structure being simply something "built or constructed".</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">
 
 At page 108 of Hayes his Honour said: 
 
 
 
 "Whether or not a particular structure is to be regarded as a fixture will depend upon the context in which that question has to be determined but the general principles are well established and do not need to be recited here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">" 
 
 
 
 The general principles can be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 217.1 The common law previously looked to the degree of annexation of an item; if substantially affixed, the item was a fixture, otherwise, it remained a chattel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">
 217.2 The importance of annexation has, however, declined over time, and the focus now is on the intention with which the item was put in place; if for better use or enjoyment of the land, the item is a fixture, for better use or enjoyment of the item, it is likely to be a chattel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">
 
 
 
 
 There are two prima facie presumptions applied: 
 
 
 
 
 218.1 first, if an item is affixed to the land, it is presumed to be a fixture, and the burden of proof lies on those who assert it is not; 
 218.2 second, if an item rests by its own weight, it is presumed not to be a fixture, and the burden of proof rests on those asserting that it is.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
 
 
 
 The presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary; for example, stone blocks resting by their own weight and placed to form a dry stone wall would be intended for better enjoyment of the land, and hence a fixture, whereas such blocks stacked in a builders yard would not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">
 
 A concrete rail head or culvert for a drain, on the principles set out above, is more likely to have been put in place to enhance enjoyment of the land, hence would be a fixture, regardless of whether it is affixed or resting of its own weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Likewise, it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures, as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">
 
 In Daniel v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 666 at [1047] Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants were public work previous exclusive possession acts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">
 
 In Sampi at [1126] and [1148] his Honour Justice French found a radio site constructed by Telstra to be a public work previous exclusive possession act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">
 
 As to major earthworks, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Bill 1993 gave as examples: 
 
 
 
 "... dams and weirs whose construction permanently and significantly disturbs or changes the land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">" 
 
 
 
 Excluded from the examples given were digging wells, cultivating land for crops or establishing a walking trail in a National Park.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">
 
 ... 
 
 In any event, as to the extent of the public works in each area, the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia (No 1) [2003] FCA 1399 ; (2003) 134 FCR 208 ( Neowarra ) at [654] to [660] to the effect that: 
 
 
 
 "Section 251D [NTA] is specifically directed to public works, and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss 23B(7) and 23C(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work, especially in relation to access to landlocked works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">"' 
 
 

 Drains (Issue 8) 
 
129 The question of whether certain drains are public works arises in relation to area 122 (R41279).</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">130 Area 122 appears from the air to be roughly the shape of an axe; the drain runs down the side of the part of the area which is the handle of the 'axe' and occupies 17% of the reserve area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">It is an open, unsealed shallow pindan storm water drain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">It was common ground between the parties that to be a public work, the drain would have to be characterised as a 'major earthwork'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">It was also common ground that, if the drain was a public work, native title is extinguished in respect of both the 'axe' head and handle sections because those areas were traversed or used to construct the drain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">131 I undertook a site visit to the area to assist in determining whether there was permanent disturbance and change to the land such that it was appropriate to characterise the drain as a major earthwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">Although the drain was not very wide, its length is such that I am satisfied that it constitutes a major earthwork and therefore extinguished native title in respect of both the 'axe' head and handle sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">McMahon Oval (Issue 12) 
 
132 McMahon Oval is area 135 (R41551).</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">This reserve includes an uncompleted sports oval which covers approximately 40% of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">The oval has never been used as an oval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">There was uncontested evidence that, in the course of creating the oval, the Shire carried out earthworks and installed drainage ditches and paths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">There was also evidence that the whole of the reserve was traversed and disturbed by heavy earthmoving equipment during the creation of the oval and drainage ditches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">A water storage tank was installed in the northern corner of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">I undertook a site visit to McMahon Oval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">I am satisfied that creation of the oval was a major earthwork the construction of which involved usage of the whole of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">It is therefore not necessary to consider whether the drain on the reserve was also a major earthwork, although it probably was not such a work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">133 The Yawuru claimants also contended that, even if the work was a major earthwork, and therefore a public work, native title was not extinguished because the work was not completed (see ss 15(1)(b)(i) and 23C(2) of the NTA ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">It is correct that under ss 15(1)(b)(i) and 23C(2), extinguishment only occurs on completion of the construction of the public work or on its 'establishment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">However, the public work relied upon by the Shire was not the uncompleted oval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">Rather, it was the completed 'major earthworks'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Accordingly, as the earthworks that were competed are 'major earthworks', they result in extinguishment under ss 15(1)(b)(i) and 23C(2), notwithstanding that not all of the works planned for the area have been completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Cemetery (Issue 14) 
 
134 There are two cemeteries that are subject to the Yawuru claimants' claim for native title: the Pioneer Cemetery (area 21, R1643) and the Broome Cemetery (area 23, R1647).</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Each of the reserves on which the cemeteries are situated was created for the purpose of a 'cemetery'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The Yawuru claimants accepted that their native title right to control the use of and access to the reserves had been extinguished by the valid creation of the relevant reserves or reserve 631 (which I have found was validly created).</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">135 The Yawuru claimants and the Shire accepted that the memorial plaque on reserve 1643 and the light, generator poles and iron roofed shelters on reserve 1647 are public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">However, they submitted that a reserve for a cemetery is not itself a public work and that the graves or tombstones in the cemeteries were not public works because they were not memorials constructed by or on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">136 On 5 April 2006, I gave an ex tempore judgment in favour of the Yawuru claimants in respect of the public works in these areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">In summary, I found that the evidence did not support a finding that the graves and tombstones were works that were constructed or established by or on behalf of the Crown or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown in any of its capacities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">It follows that the graves and tombstones in the cemeteries are not public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">137 The Shire and the State also sought to rely on the creation of reserve 1647 and its use as the Broome Cemetery to argue that the graves were established with the authority of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">The argument raises the issue of whether the exercise of the right to use the reserve as a cemetery has extinguished native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">It is apparent from the material before the Court and from the legislation that has applied from time to time to the use of the reserve as a cemetery that the exercise of the right of use, either directly or indirectly, was authorised by or on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">For example, Government Gazettes revealed that under the Cemeteries Act 1897 (WA) ('the CA '), the Governor in Executive Council appointed trustees of the cemeteries, made by-laws for the management of the cemeteries, provided for applications for land in the cemeteries to be used as graves and imposed fees for use of the land as graves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">Accordingly, it is appropriate to view the exercise of the right to use the land within the reserve as a cemetery as the taking of steps authorised by the Crown, which 'created in others, or asserted, rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land': see [214] in Ward HC .</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">It would follow that, to the extent that there has been an exercise of the right to use reserve 1647 as a cemetery for the conduct of burials, the digging of graves and the laying of tombstones, the exercise of that right has had an extinguishing effect on native title in respect of the areas where that has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">However, the extinguishing effect does not extend to vacant areas of the reserve where the exercise of the right to use those areas for the purposes of a cemetery has not yet occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">138 However, at a late stage, the State raised a further issue in respect of reserve 1647.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">Under s 10 of the CA , the Governor may not only appoint trustees of a cemetery but may also by deed of grant vest any lands in the trustees of a public cemetery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The section provides that, when notification in the Government Gazette of appointments and removals of trustees (which is required by the section) is served on the Registrar of Titles, that will result in the legal estate in the trust premises vesting in the trustees (or the new trustees).</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">Also, s 212 of the Municipalities Act 1906 (WA) provides for any vesting of property in councillors as trustees under the CA to be a vesting in the municipality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">139 The Government Gazettes reveal the appointment of, inter alia , councillors as trustees under the CA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">While the evidence does not disclose whether a deed of grant to trustees under s 10 was made, it is probable that such a deed did exist, and that the legal estate in the reserved land ultimately vested in the Shire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">The reason for that conclusion is that it is implicit in the functions of trustees under the CA that the legal estate in the cemetery vests in them upon their appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Also, it is difficult to think of a reason why the Governor would appoint trustees but not vest the legal estate in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">140 When the totality of the statutory scheme is considered, the conclusion is inevitable that the rights attaching to the vesting of the legal estate in the reserve in the trustees and, subsequently in the Shire, is inconsistent with any native title rights or interests in respect of the reserved land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">Accordingly, native title in respect of reserve 1647 has been extinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">141 The parties accepted that the situation outlined in respect of the Broome Cemetery does not apply to reserve 1643 (ie the Pioneer Cemetery).</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">As I have found that the only public work that has any extinguishing consequence at the Pioneer Cemetery is the memorial plaque, native title in respect of that cemetery is only extinguished by reason of the public work being a past act in respect of the area covered by the memorial plaque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">Of course, the creation of the reserve extinguished the native title right to control access to and use of the reserve, but that is not relevant in this context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Gaol (Issue 16) 
 
142 The gaol is located in area 24 (R2551).</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">Earlier in these reasons I explained why the native title right to control the use of and access to area 24 had been extinguished by the creation of reserve 2551 for the purposes of a gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">As explained above, the Yawuru claimants do not dispute extinguishment in relation to that part of the area upon which the gaol was constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">The remainder of the area is outside the gaol perimeter and consists of vacant land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">143 The State argued that the vacant land was properly categorised as being a public work as a result of s 251D of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">It argued that the adjacent vacant land is 'necessary for, or incidental to, the construction, establishment, or operation of the work'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">As explained earlier in these reasons, a similar question arose in the context of the use of the gaol reserve for the reserved purpose, being whether the adjacent vacant land is reasonably necessary for, or incidental to, the operation or enjoyment of the gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">The State argued that the adjacent land is required for privacy, recreational purposes and 'future expansion', thus satisfying both criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">144 On the evidence, the question of future expansion is no more than a mere possibility and can be put to one side as it is hypothetical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">If the expansion occurs, any extinguishing effect of the expansion will need to be considered by reference to the NTA as at that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">145 Both before, and after, a visit to the site it was not apparent that the vacant land was required for privacy or for recreation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Accordingly, the evidence does not establish that the criteria set out above have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">It follows that native title in respect of the vacant land has not been extinguished by the construction of the gaol.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Police station (Issue 17) 
 
146 The same issues arose in respect of the police station which is situated on area 35 (R15019).</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">The Yawuru claimants conceded extinguishment in respect of the area upon which the police station was constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">However, they maintained that native title has not been extinguished in respect of the remainder of the area, which is vacant land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">147 I undertook a site visit to the area and am satisfied that the vacant land does not fall within the criteria for extinguishment discussed above and, as a consequence, native title in respect of that land has not been extinguished by the construction of the police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">Main Roads Depot (Issue 18) 
 
148 The main road depot is located in area 69 (R34891) which was a reserve for the purpose of Depot, Main Roads Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">There was evidence that, prior to 1984, a 2.3 metre high and 561.24 metre long wire mesh security fence was erected around the perimeter of the area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">A septic leach drain, a storage shed, accommodation units and ablutions were also constructed and the area was cleared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">149 I undertook a site visit of the area to assist in determining the items that were public works in the area and the extent of those works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">I am satisfied that the only public works are the actual buildings constructed on the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">150 However, a further issue arose in respect of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">The State contended that the creation of the reserve and the exercise by the State of its right to use the reserve as a depot secured by its perimeter fencing extinguished native title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">It was argued that the extinguishment reasoning in respect of the parts of the reserves used as a gaol, prison and cemetery applies to this reserve save that the whole of the reserve has been used and secured as a depot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">In my view, the State's contention is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">The State, by exercising its right to create and use the reserve as a depot (which included perimeter fencing to secure that use), has asserted rights in relation to the land which are inconsistent with the claimant community's native title rights and interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">In particular, the perimeter security fence is an assertion by the State, in pursuance of the reserved purpose, of its right to exclude others from the depot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">It follows that native title has been extinguished in relation to the whole of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">CALM offices (Issue 19) 
 
151 This issue concerned area 22 which was the subject of reserve 1644, which I have found was validly created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">It was common ground that the vesting of this reserve in the Conservator of Forests on or about 27 May 1983 had the effect of extinguishing native title rights and interests in the area covered by the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">Area 57 (R31340, near Town Beach) (Issue 21) and area 2690 (UCL 187, near Town Beach) (Issue 22) 
 
152 At the further hearing on extinguishment, the parties accepted that the issues and facts in respect of these two areas were interrelated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Accordingly, I have considered them together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">153 In relation to area 57, the Yawuru claimants set out a list of the parts of area 57 which the Shire of Broome initially contended were public works (R31340):
 
 '(a) reticulated lawn parkland, in north western and south western corners of the southern section of the reserve, comprising 2700m2, or 20% of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">
 
 ... 
 
 (b) a bitumenised car park in the central section of the reserve, comprising 4400m2, or 1/3 rd of the reserve, established not later than 1986.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">It was bitumenised in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">It may have been bitumenised before that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">
 
 (c) a track leading to the groyne outside the reserve, in the south eastern third, not later than 1975.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">
 
 ... 
 
 (d) remnants of old railway platform and internal tracks, in the northern part of the reserve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">
 
 ... 
 
 (e) on adjacent reserve 17132 to the west, there is, and has been since 1986, a kiosk, ablutions, playground, barbecue area and more extensive reticulated lawn parkland and plinths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">
 
 ... 
 
 (f) a concrete boat ramp at the southern edge of the reserve, of 240m2, built in 1969 
 
 .... 
 
 (g) A "goods shed (2)", rail lines, shunting lines and siding, a work shop, a retaining wall, a sunken drive and a cottage (apartment was used to accommodate the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union) all constructed before 1950 and removed soon after 1966.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">
 
 ...' 
 
154 UCL 187 is unallocated Crown land adjoining area 57 near Town Beach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">155 The Yawuru claimants did not seriously contest extinguishment in respect of the following parts of area 57 in the list above: (b), (c) (d), (f) and (g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">The Shire accepted that (a) and (e) did not constitute public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">Therefore, the question remaining for determination is whether the areas adjacent to the public works identified in (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g) fall within s 251D of the NTA because they were necessary for or incidental to the establishment, construction or operation of the relevant public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">156 There was historical evidence about the use of the areas adjacent to the public works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The evidence included passages from a book entitled ' Broome: The Exciting Years ' by Thomas Dampier Chapple, in which parts of the area were described as follows:
 
 'In the earlier years the mode of transport from the old jetty to the Jap and Chinatown was in railway trucks pulled by horsepower.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">These were later supplanted by a "puffing Billy" to which were attached two open-sided carriages plus additional trucks for the movement of freight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">The train was owned by the Government and the engine driver was Bob Murray, a genial Scotman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">Again for a shilling you could ride the train from the jetty to Jap town or for 1/6d do the round trip.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">
 
 The arrival and departure of crew was always a noisy and colourful scene as Japanese, Malays, Koepangers, etc piled into the trucks and carriages, to be taken to the Customs Office where they would be signed on or off to their respective Pearling Masters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">It was a chaotic situation in the Customs Office, gesticulating Pearlers claiming their crew and Customs Officers growing more irate by the minute, while endeavouring to process each man who at best spoke little English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">' 

157 On the basis of the historical evidence concerning use of the whole of the area as a railway, jetty, goods shed and sidings, I made ex tempore findings in respect of the southern areas at the further hearing on extinguishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">In substance, I was satisfied that the Shire had made out its case in respect of the southern part of the area that is the subject of issue 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">It was accepted by the parties that that finding would carry with it the unallocated Crown land which is at the very southern portion of the area that is the subject of issue 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">I was satisfied on the evidence that the probability is that the whole of that southern area is land that falls within s 251D of the NTA as it was incidental to the operation of the jetty and railway facilities and therefore is a public work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">In respect of the rest of the unallocated Crown land (the subject of issue 22), which was vacant land, I was not satisfied on the evidence before me that that is a public work or an area that should fall within section 251D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Accordingly, I found that that area is not a public work under s 251D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">158 My ex tempore findings and reasons left as an outstanding issue (in respect of issues 21 and 22), the northern part of the area that is the subject of issue 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">I undertook a site visit to this area to assist in determining whether it would fall within s 251D of the NTA .</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">I am not satisfied that the sparse evidence about the area warrants a finding that the whole of the area falls within s 251D.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">Accordingly, native title is not extinguished in respect of the northern part of the area the subject of issue 21, save for that part of that area on which the old railway platform (about 40 m sq) and the associated railway tracks (about 1600 m sq) were constructed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">Conclusion 
 
159 The determination of native title that is now able to be made brings to an end an epic struggle by the Yawuru people to achieve recognition under Australian law of their traditional connection to, and ownership of, their country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">The struggle commenced when the first application for that recognition was filed by the Yawuru claimants pursuant to the NTA on 2 February 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">The matter proceeded in two parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The first part related to the traditional law ground of the Yawuru community at Kunin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">That proceeding involved numerous exhibits, many witnesses, voluminous evidence, a hearing over 18 days and 1488 pages of transcript.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">The contest in respect of the law ground required resolution of an intra-communal dispute, as well as a dispute between the Yawuru claimants and the State of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">The determination of native title, which granted exclusive possession of the law ground at Kunin to the Yawuru community, was made on 17 October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">Resolution of this part of the matter required two judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">It was hoped that this resolution might enable a mediated outcome, rather than an adversarial contest, to settle the remaining part of the matter, which was the claim to the rest of the Yawuru community's traditional country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">160 The claim to the Yawuru community's traditional country was not able to be resolved by mediation prior to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">The resolution of that claim, which involved a further intra-communal dispute as well as a dispute with the State, WAFIC and certain other parties again involved numerous exhibits, many witnesses, voluminous evidence, a further 53 days of hearing, further transcript of over 5710 pages and five further judgments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">At the conclusion of the substantive hearings in October 2004, the parties requested that the matter again be referred to mediation on the basis that there were promising prospects of a mediated outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">After the expiration of a further 12 months, during which mediation occurred, I was not satisfied that a mediated outcome was likely to be achieved and fixed a further hearing on the outstanding 160 extinguishment issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">161 The earlier hearings involved evidence relating the Yawuru community's continuing connection to its traditional country and continuing acknowledgement and observance of traditional laws and customs since 1829.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">The final hearings, which were held in relation to extinguishment, involved evidence of over 100 years of tenure history in the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">Although many of the extinguishment issues were resolved consensually during the course of the final hearing, the remaining issues were required to be resolved in these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">162 The Yawuru claimants have been largely successful in their native title claim as the claim has succeeded in whole or in part over approximately 4900 sq kms of their traditional country in and around Broome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">The Yawuru claimants have established a communal native title entitlement to exclusive possession of their traditional country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">However, as a result of the criteria laid down under Australian law for extinguishment of native title, the native title of the Yawuru community was partially or totally extinguished in relation to significant parts of the Yawuru claim area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Also, as a native title right to exclusive possession is not recognised under Australian law in respect of the inter-tidal zone and, subject to some exceptions, areas that have been the subject of pastoral or mining leases, the native title rights and interests in respect of most of those areas are not exclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">163 I have outlined the history of the present matter for two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">The first is to explain why native title claims are not only complex but impose demands on the parties and the Court that are unprecedented in adversarial litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">In the usual course, proceedings must be commenced within 3 to 6 years of a cause of action accruing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">One of the reasons for that requirement is the increasing unreliability of evidence that is more than 3 to 6 years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">Yet native title cases require evidence to be given concerning the claimant community's connection with the claim area and the community's observance and acknowledgment of traditional laws and customs since sovereignty, which in Western Australia was 1829.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">While it is obviously unsatisfactory for any litigious dispute to take over ten years to be finally resolved, there are special circumstances attending the resolution of native title disputes that make the delay in achieving resolution understandable, even if not acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">164 The second, and far more important, reason is that it would be remiss of me to depart from the present matter without observing that there may be a better, more efficient, more effective and fairer way of resolving native title disputes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">In making that observation, I make no criticism whatsoever of any of the parties in the present matter as they were fully entitled to have their disputes resolved by the Court, rather than by mediation or any other alternative method of resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">However, the fact remains that there are presently 608 applications in relation to native title awaiting resolution in the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Most of those applications have been before the Court a considerable time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">Four of those applications are either part heard or are reserved for judgment and only one is fixed for a final hearing this year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">It follows that 603 of the 608 applications presently before the Court have no final hearing date fixed in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">In these circumstances, it is fair to describe native title in Australia as being in a state of gridlock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">165 Matters are not failing to proceed to a final hearing because the Court is unable to provide hearing dates or because of the unavailability of the resources necessary for the Court to conduct final hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Rather, the reasons include ongoing mediation, lack of financial resources for claimant communities to pursue their claims, the failure to resolve intra-communal disputes and the many logistical difficulties confronting parties when a native title case is to be brought on for a final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">Another significant brake on the resolution of native title disputes is that the Court's power under s 87 of the NTA to give effect to an agreement to resolve a native title claim is conditioned upon an 'agreement [being] reached between [all] the parties'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Agreement by all parties is required irrespective of whether the interest of a particular party may, or may not, be affected by the terms of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">Usually, the agreement of numerous parties is required and some parties, including publicly funded parties, may have little incentive to resolve the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">166 The purpose of the above observations is to draw the attention of at least the state parties and the indigenous parties to native title disputes to the desirability of seeing the resolution of native title claims as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Achieving native title to traditional country can lead to the enhancement of self respect, identity and pride for indigenous communities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">However, native title can also be seen as a means of indigenous people participating in a more effective way in the economic, social and educational benefits that are available in contemporary Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">Obtaining a final determination of native title, where that is achievable, can be a stepping stone to securing those outcomes but cannot, of itself, secure them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">The above observations are intended to prompt parties to other native title disputes to increase their endeavours to reach compromises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Those endeavours will necessarily involve give and take on the part of all parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Native title litigation, like other litigation, need not be conducted on an 'all or nothing' basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">167 It is also important that indigenous communities appreciate the risk, which recent experience reveals is far from hypothetical, of failure in a native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">Where that occurs, it can have devastating consequences for the claimant community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">It is equally important for state parties to recognise that their quest to ensure that indigenous communities participate in the economic, social and educational benefits available in contemporary Australia can be advanced when a native title claim is resolved or succeeds, but can be set back when a native title claim fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">If claimant communities and state parties can achieve a mediated outcome, they can ensure that a broad spectrum of mutual benefits can follow the resolution of native title claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">Those benefits can include indigenous land use agreements, traineeship programs and various forms of financial and other support for the native title holding body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">168 If settlements do not occur and native title claims have to be resolved in an adversarial proceeding, there remains the risk for the claimant community that native title may prove to be yet another of the prospects held out to indigenous communities where the realisable gain falls short of that originally expected as a result of the decision in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) [1992] HCA 23 ; (1992) 175 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">However, if compromises are able to be achieved, the cause of reconciliation between Australia's past and present will be greatly advanced and the economic, social and educational benefits available to all Australians may be better able to be accessed by members of claimant communities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">169 There remains the question of how the present native title gridlock may be resolved by mediation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">Plainly, some changes to the present system of mediation and resolution are necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">The areas of possible change include:
 
 
 (a) amending s 87 of the NTA to:
 (i) make it quite clear that the requirement of agreement of parties to mediated outcome only applies to the parties whose interests are affected by the outcome (s 87 of the NTA ); 
 (ii) empower the Court to give effect to a mediated outcome of part of the claim when that is agreed to by all parties whose interests are affected by that outcome, leaving it to the remaining parties to contest the balance of the proceeding only insofar as their interests are affected by the outstanding and unresolved part of the claim; 
 
 
 (b) providing for formal and confidential offers of settlement to be made by parties in the course of mediation --- the offers may be presented to the trial court after a final determination has been made so that adverse costs consequences may follow for the parties for whom the final outcome was not greater than that offered in the mediation;
 (c) greater emphasis being placed in mediation on case management and the narrowing of contested issues thereby reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of the trial process;
 (d) reviewing the guidelines for Commonwealth funding of NTA claims to include as one of the guidelines whether there has been a recommendation of a mediator that the funded party has made a bona fide and reasonable endeavour to resolve the dispute; 
 (e) each state party developing a mediated settlement model that may be used generally by the state party for mediated outcomes; and
 (f) adopting a practice in mediation and in the Court of determining issues that have not been resolved by mediation at an early hearing --- such a practice will require the parties to finally decide to either settle or contest the native title claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">

170 Hopefully, if notice is taken of the above observations, it might diminish the risk of, and the harm that can flow from, a final finding at an adversarial hearing that the 'tide of history' has washed away recognition of a community's native title under Australian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">It might also greatly advance the reconciliation between Australia's past and present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy (170) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Merkel.</sentence>
