1 This proceeding has had a long and tortuous history since it was commenced by application on 28 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The efficient progress of the pre-trial stages of the proceeding has been impeded by repeated failures of the respondents to comply with orders made by the Court and by the filing of defences and cross-claims which, for various reasons, were found to be deficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Unsurprisingly, these shortcomings led to the filing of a series of notices of motion and the need for interlocutory hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Costs of three of those hearings were reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The applicants now seek orders in their favour for the costs (some on an indemnity basis) of and incidental to those hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">They also seek indemnity costs generally in relation to a series of unsuccessful attempts by the first and second respondents/cross-claimants to obtain leave to file a revised cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 The applicants seek orders as follows:
 
&#8226; The respondents and cross-claimants pay the applicants' and cross-respondents' costs of and incidental to the Notice of Motion dated 4 October 2007 filed on behalf of the applicants and cross-respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">&#8226; The cross-claimants pay the cross-respondents' costs of and incidental to the Notice of Motion dated 26 November 2007 filed on behalf of the cross-respondents on an indemnity basis, such costs to be taxed and paid forthwith upon taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">&#8226; The cross-claimants pay the cross-respondents' costs of and incidental to the Notices of Motion dated 15, 22 and 28 November 2007 filed on behalf of the cross-claimants on an indemnity basis, such costs to be taxed and paid forthwith upon taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">&#8226; The cross-claimants pay the cross-respondents' costs of the cross-claim on an indemnity basis, such costs to be taxed and paid forthwith upon taxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 As indemnity costs are sought in a number of the proposed orders it will be convenient, before turning to the circumstances in which the various costs orders are sought, to outline the principles which govern the determination of applications for the award of indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These principles are, conveniently, drawn together in the recent judgment of Gilmour J in Barrett Property Group Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 at [3] and [4].</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">His Honour there said:
 "An award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge except as provided by any other Act: Federal Court of Australia Act s 43(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The discretion must be exercised judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">In the normal course, costs are ordered to be paid on a party and party basis: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232; Re Wilcox; Ex parte Ventura Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR [151] at 158 per Cooper and Merkel JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">A costs order is not intended to punish the unsuccessful party but rather to compensate the successful party: Hurst v Education Queensland (No 2) [2005] FCA 793 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This is so even where the ordinary practice is departed from.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The aim is not to punish or deter future litigants but simply to compensate a party fully for costs which normal party-party costs could not be expected to do, where it was unreasonable for that party to be subjected to any expenditure of costs, such as where a hopeless proceeding is brought: Cirillo v Consolidated Press Property Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 179 at [4] - [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Any departure from this general rule requires a special reason: Access For All Alliance (Hervey Bay) Inc v Hervey Bay City Council [2007] FCA 974 at [10] ; Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v Next Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 971 at [5] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The categories in respect of which departure from the usual rule are contained are not closed: John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Limited v [Kimberly-Clark] Australia Pty Limited (1994) 52 FCR [201]; Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd v Turnbull Cooktown Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 903 at [32] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In Colgate-Palmolive, (at p 233) Sheppard J identified various categories which might give rise to an award of indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">These include: 
&#8226; the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud;
 
&#8226; evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties;
 
&#8226; the commencement or continuation of proceedings for an ulterior motive; 
 
&#8226; wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law; 
 
&#8226; the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions; and 
 
&#8226; an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">"
 NOTICE OF MOTION DATED 4 OCTOBER 2007 
 
4 The principal orders sought in the notice of motion dated 4 October 2007 were orders requiring the respondents and cross-claimants to provide further and better particulars of their pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Those further and better particulars had been requested on 4 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">They had not been provided despite consent orders having been made on three occasions (in June, July and August 2007) for them to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 The notice of motion was returnable on 18 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">On that day senior counsel for the respondents obtained leave to file and serve amended defences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He advised the Court that, having regard to the pleadings in those amended defences, it would be inappropriate and unnecessary to renew the orders for provision of further and better particulars of the defences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">6 I granted the respondents leave to file and serve further amended defences on or before 15 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">7 The applicants (as cross-respondents) also pressed for orders requiring the production of further and better particulars of the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I made a self executing order requiring the provision of those further and better particulars on or before 15 November 2007 in default of which the cross-claims were to be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This order was not complied with and it was vacated on 30 November 2007 because the particulars had been sought of claims which were no longer to be pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Leave was also given to apply to file and serve any amended cross-claim on or before 15 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">8 I reserved the costs of this notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">9 The respondents contend that each party should bear its own costs of the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">This is said to be an appropriate order because, so the respondents assert, they were frustrated in their attempts to respond to the requests for further and better particulars because the applicants declined to make discovery of material, sought in correspondence between solicitors, which would have furnished information necessary for the particulars to be provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The particulars sought included particulars of allegations made in paragraph 84 of the cross-claim as it then stood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The allegations were that, sometime prior to the commencement of proceeding VID 750 of 2006, the solicitors for the applicant had sent one or more letters to RG International Pty Ltd which threatened legal proceedings "for infringement of the [a]pplicant's legal rights" unless RG International Pty Ltd undertook to cease selling products "under or by reference to the word marks "EUROTEL" and "EUROTEL DIGITAL"".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The pleadings provided that particulars of the letters would be provided after discovery and inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">10 These requests for discovery were made in a desultory fashion very late in the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">They do not explain repeated failures to comply with orders made by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The more likely explanation was that there was no foundation for the allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The allegations were subsequently varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">New allegations were made in revised versions of the draft cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">These allegations were subsequently varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">New allegations were made in revised versions of the draft cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">These allegations were subsequently withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The applicants should have their costs of and incidental to the notice of motion dated 4 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">THE NOTICE OF MOTION DATED 26 NOVEMBER 2007 
 
11 On 15 November 2007 the first, second and third respondents (as cross-claimants) filed a notice of motion to which was annexed a draft amended cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On 22 November 2007 the first and second respondents (as cross-claimants) filed an amended notice of motion to which was attached a revised version of a draft amended cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">These versions of the cross-claim varied the contentious paragraph 84 and associated paragraphs about which requests for further and better particulars had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As varied, the paragraphs remained objectionable for a variety of reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The applicants (as cross-respondents), in their notice of motion dated 26 November 2007, sought an order that the cross-claimants' notices of motion and the attached pleadings be removed from the Court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">By consent it was ordered that the draft pleadings be removed from the Court file and returned to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Costs of the application were reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">12 At the hearing on 30 November 2007 counsel for the cross-claimants advised the Court that, having considered the objections raised to the versions of the draft cross-claim which had been filed on 15 and 22 November 2007 and a later version filed on 28 November 2007, further amendments to paragraph 84 and related paragraphs were being considered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 The respondents claim to be entitled to an indemnity costs order in their favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">They do so because their solicitors had advised the solicitors for the applicants, on 23 November 2007, that it was proposed to substitute a further version of the cross-claim for the versions filed on 15 and 22 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicants had, thereby, obtained the relief sought and the notice of motion was unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">14 I do not accept the respondents' submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Whilst the applicants had been advised that the versions of the cross-claim which had been attached to the notices of motion dated 15 and 22 November 2007 would be superseded, those documents remained on the Court file.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">They contained objectionable material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">They could only be removed from the Court file by Court order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The orders sought were obtained by consent on 30 November 2007 without any waste of Court time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">15 The applicants were successful in obtaining the order which they sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">They should have their costs of and incidental to the notice of motion dated 26 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I do not consider that the applicants have made good their claim for indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">No special reason for departing from the general rule has been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">THE NOTICES OF MOTION DATED 15, 22 AND 28 NOVEMBER 2007 
 
16 These notices of motion were filed by the first and second respondents/cross-claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">They were successively a notice of motion, an amended notice of motion and a further amended notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The terms of the orders sought in each version of the notice of motion were the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">As already explained, the moving parties sought leave to file and serve an amended cross-claim in the terms of a draft which was attached to the notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The reason for there being successive notices of motion was that the terms of the draft pleading attached to the 15 November 2007 notice of motion were varied at least twice and the varied versions were attached to the subsequent notices of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">17 The notices of motion were made returnable on 30 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">At the hearing on that day, senior counsel for the first and second respondents/cross-claimants advised the Court that, as a result of the submissions made on behalf of the applicants, the version of the draft cross-claim which was attached to the further amended notice of motion dated 28 November 2007 would be withdrawn and consideration would be given to making further amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">18 I granted the cross-claimants leave to apply for leave to file an amended cross-claim on or before 15 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I further ordered that the cross-claimants pay the applicants' costs thrown away in dealing with the cross-claimants' notices of motion dated 15 November, 22 November 2007 and 28 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">This order was intended to compensate the applicants for the costs incurred in giving consideration to the versions of the cross-claim which were superseded by the version attached to the further amended notice of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Otherwise the costs of the motions were reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">19 The respondents submit that each party should bear its own costs of these notices of motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Those costs were the costs of the hearing and, in particular, the applicants'/cross-respondents' costs occasioned by the cross-claimants' desire yet again to amend their cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">20 The applicants press their claim for their costs of these notices of motion to be paid on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">They rely on the following matters:
 
&#8226; The first and second respondents (as cross-claimants) were on notice, no later than 23 November 2007 of the applicants' opinion that the 15 and 22 November 2007, versions of the cross-claim were defective and the reasons for that opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The opinion was accepted by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">&#8226; The 28 November 2007 version of the cross-claim was also defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Again, the applicants' solicitors had advised the solicitors for the respondent that this was the applicants' view and provided reasons for that view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Despite this, the further amended notice of motion was not withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">&#8226; At the hearing on 30 November 2007, counsel for the respondents advised the Court that the respondents no longer sought leave to amend their cross-claim in the form proposed on 28 November 2007 and foreshadowed the making of further amendments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The applicants contend that these events justify the conclusion that the respondents persisted in pleading causes of action which were unsustainable and bad in law despite repeated and detailed warnings from the applicants' solicitors that the claims were fundamentally defective.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The application for leave to amend, contained in the further amended notice of motion of 28 November 2007, was the fourth attempt at pleading a viable cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It was unsuccessful and the cross-claimants did not press their motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Rather, they sought leave to replead yet again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">21 In my view the applicants have made out an exceptional case which warrants a departure from the normal rule that costs be paid on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The interlocutory stages of this proceeding have been unnecessarily delayed by the inability of the cross-claimants to plead viable causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Groundless contentions have been pleaded and then withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Causes of action which were bad in law have been pleaded and then withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">In the circumstances, I consider that the applicants'/cross-respondents' costs of the notice of motion of 28 November 2007 should be paid by the first and second respondents/cross-claimants on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">THE COSTS OF THE CROSS-CLAIM 
 
22 The applicants (as cross-respondents) seek an order that the cross-claimants pay their costs of the cross-claim on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Any such order would overlap with the order which I have just indicated that I am disposed to make in relation to the further amended notice of motion of 28 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Whilst I consider that it is appropriate to award indemnity costs in respect of the cross-claimants' fourth unsuccessful attempt to plead a cross-claim, I do not consider that it is appropriate that the earlier unsuccessful attempts should be so treated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The original cross-claim was defective but this was eventually accepted by the cross-claimants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The second and third attempts at pleading the cross-claim foundered within a matter of days and no attempt was made to defend them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Orders have already been made on a party and party basis in respect of these earlier attempts and I do not consider it appropriate to vary those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Associate:
