1 In the early part of 2006 Finlay Engineering Pty Ltd ("Finlay Engineering") was experiencing economic difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Mr James Sutton was the manager and owner of Finlay Engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Mr Adam Sutton was a director and the secretary of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The company had nine employees whose employment was regulated by the Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998 and by successive certified agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 On 5 April 2006 Mr James Sutton presented these employees with Australian Workplace Agreements ("AWAs").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">He told them that, if they signed the agreements, there would be no change to their terms and conditions of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Each employee signed an AWA on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">None would have done so had he known that the AWA contained a term which reduced the quantum of redundancy payments to which the employees were entitled under the certified agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Had the employees been aware of this and the misstatement made to them by Mr James Sutton, they would not have entered into the AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 The employees were not provided with the AWAs for the seven day period prescribed by s 337(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Nor were they provided with an information statement as required by s 337(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Both respondents were responsible for these contraventions of s 337(8) and (9) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">These contraventions deprived the employees of the opportunity to ascertain the true position relating to their respective redundancy payment entitlements under the AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 None of the AWAs was witnessed as required by the Act : see ss 340(1)(b) and 341 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Adam Sutton later signed the AWAs on behalf of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Mr James Sutton was aware that he had done this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">These contraventions did not contribute to the decision of any employee to enter into an AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 Not long after the AWAs were signed the company appointed administrators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 27 June 2006 it went into liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">This resulted in all the employees being made redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Most of them were long serving employees who would have been entitled to much higher severance payments under the certified agreement which had regulated their employment prior to them signing the AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">This was because the certified agreement provided for an entitlement to three weeks pay for each year of service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The AWAs provided for a less generous entitlement for each year of service and the amount payable was capped at 12 weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 The applicant is a Workplace Inspector appointed under s 167(2) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">An investigation was conducted into the conduct of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">They were initially disposed to deny liability but, at a point before serious expense was incurred by the applicant in preparing for trial, they admitted their liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Agreement was reached between the applicant and the respondents as to the penalties which they considered it would be appropriate for the Court to impose in respect of the various contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">7 The Court is not bound to accept and impose these proposed penalties but will do so if persuaded that, in all the circumstances, they fall within the permissible range: cf NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543 at 565 Jessup J expressed the view, with which I respectfully agree, that the phrase "permissible range" in this context "refers to a range which would be permitted by the court, that is, a range within which the penalty is neither manifestly inadequate nor manifestly excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">"
 
8 The maximum penalties, prescribed by s 407 of the Act , for each of the contraventions in respect of which a penalty is sought (as at 5 April 2006) were as follows:
 
 &#8226; Contravention of s 401(1) - $6,288.60;
 &#8226; Contravention of s 337(8) - $3,144.30;
 &#8226; Contravention of s 337(9) - $3,144.30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">

9 It is proposed that a penalty of $20,000 should be imposed on Mr James Sutton in respect of the nine contraventions by him of s 401(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">10 It is proposed that a penalty of $6,000 be imposed on each respondent in respect of their respective contraventions of ss 337(8) and 337 (9) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">11 It is proposed that no penalties should be imposed in respect of the contraventions of s 341.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">12 I have concluded that it is appropriate to impose the proposed penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In doing so I have had regard to the following matters: 
 
 &#8226; Although there were multiple contraventions by the respondents of the relevant sections of the Act , those contraventions formed part of a single course of conduct which was intended to persuade each of the nine employees to become a party to an AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">&#8226; The monetary penalties imposed distinguish between the contraventions of s 401(1) of the Act on the one hand and the contraventions of ss 337(8) and 337 (9) on the other having regard to the higher maximum penalty applicable for contraventions of s 401(1) and the fact that the contravention of s 401(1) of the Act , was, in each case, the major contributing factor to the employees becoming parties to AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">&#8226; The consequences for each of the employees were serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The longer serving members of the group suffered the most.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">As a group they were deprived of an amount in the order of $149,000 which represented the difference between what would have been payable had their redundancy entitlements been calculated under the certified agreement and the amount to which they were collectively entitled under the AWAs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">&#8226; There is a strong need for general deterrence of the type of conduct engaged in by the respondents in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">&#8226; The conduct complained of undermines the legislative objective that AWAs should be the product of free bargaining between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">&#8226; The totality principle which I explained in greater detail in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [30] and the appropriateness of fixing a total penalty for a course of conduct: as to which see McIlwain v Lamsay Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 158 IR 181 at 216-7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">

13 I have also taken into account, in the respondents' favour, the following matters:
 
 &#8226; Neither respondent has previously been found to have contravened the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">&#8226; Their early admission of liability has saved a considerable amount of time and money which would otherwise have had to be expended in the preparation for and the conduct of a trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

14 There remains the question of to whom the penalties should be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Under s 841 of the Act the penalties can be paid to the Commonwealth or to organisations or persons nominated by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">15 The parties had, initially, proposed that the $44,000 in penalties should be paid to Consolidated Revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I raised with the parties the prospect of paying part of the total penalty sum to each of the employees such as to make good, in each case, the shortfall in their redundancy payments, that shortfall being calculated by deducting from each employee's redundancy entitlement under the certified agreement the amount to be paid to him by the liquidator by way of redundancy entitlements under the AWAs both figures calculated on a pro-rata basis by reference to the sum available to the liquidator for distribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The parties agreed that this would be an appropriate order and the necessary calculations were undertaken and agreed upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">There was a surplus after provision was made for these payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">16 The respondents have admitted that, but for the contraventions of the Act in which they engaged the employees would not have entered into the AWAs and, as a result, been deprived of the more beneficial level of redundancy payment provided for in the certified agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">That being so I consider that it is appropriate that part of the penalties imposed on the respondents should be used to compensate partially the individual employees for their losses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The balance should be paid to the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Associate:
