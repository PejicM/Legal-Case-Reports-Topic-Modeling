<sentence id="s1">That application was amended in the course of the hearing this morning such that the application for the delivery up and transfer of the two motor vehicles was withdrawn and there was substituted an application that an order be made requiring Mr Angeleri to pay to the Applicants the sums which were applied to paying out the loan accounts on the two vehicles.</sentence>

 the Court may make such order or orders as it thinks appropriate against or in relation to the person (including either or both of the orders specified in subsection (4)) and may so make an order against or in relation to a person even though the person may have committed an offence in respect of the matter to which the order relates.</sentence>
