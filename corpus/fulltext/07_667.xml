1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate dated 30 January 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") of 9 February 2006: see [2007] FMCA 75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent ("the delegate") dated 4 August 2005 to refuse to grant protection visas to the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellants are a mother and her two children who entered Australia on 2 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They are citizens of Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They entered on one month visitors' visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The first appellant claimed to have been an active supporter of the United National Party ("the UNP") in Sri Lanka and, as a result, had been subjected to harassment and threats by political opponents throughout the 2004 election period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The first appellant also claimed that one of her children was the victim of an attempted kidnapping and that she believed that the authorities did not act because of her political allegiances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">She alleged that a JVP politician had interfered with the police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The first appellant's husband now works in the United States of America and the appellant claims that she fears raising her children alone in Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 A delegate of the Minister refused the appellant's application for a protection visa and she appealed to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Prior to the hearing she forwarded written submissions to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Attached to those submissions were what were said to be copies of two extracts from police information books.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They were written in Sinhalese and had been translated into English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">One referred to a report of the alleged abduction of the appellant's son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The other referred to an assault allegedly suffered by the appellant's husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The first extract was tendered to support the claim that the appellant's son had been kidnapped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 The Tribunal accepted certain of the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">However it rejected her claim that an attempt had been made to kidnap her son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">One reason for rejecting the claim was that country information suggested that political violence occurred in Sri Lanka at times when elections were being conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The alleged attempted kidnapping had occurred in February 2005 at which time no elections were taking place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Tribunal also expressed doubts about the authenticity of the extracts from police reports but held that, even if they were genuine, they "would only attest to a report being made to a police station and could not represent evidence of the events described therein having occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">"
 
5 The Tribunal also held that it could not accept that those who had allegedly caused harm to the appellant were politically motivated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal said:
 
 "The [appellant] has not provided convincing evidence that any harm she claims to have been subjected to was in fact perpetrated by political enemies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She has made vague connections between the visit by members of the JVP who were clearly on a recruiting/fund raising campaign and the threats over the phone which she claims to have received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She also indicated that she had received requests for money from many other parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal accepts that she may have been approached by funds for a number of political parties given the obviously comfortable financial position in which the family is in, it accepts that she may have been threatened for not complying; the nature of these threats over the telephone has not been detailed to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Even in her own alleged report to the police on the attempted kidnap of her son she states that people are attempting to extort money from her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">There is no mention of a political motive or that the would be perpetrators were political opponents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The attempt to kidnap her son is said to have occurred almost a year after the said election and the loss of this election by the UNP cited as the reason that the applicant was importuned; both the timing and the reason do not appear likely given that political violence tends to occur around election time; the elections which followed the general elections of 2 April 2004 were the presidential elections of 17 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The only indication of presumed political involvement is the original claims by the [appellant] that a certain JVP politician had "interfered with the police investigation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This claims (sic) was not reiterated at the hearing and does not sit well with the [appellant's] insistence that the police did nothing following any of her complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">If there was a police investigation, this indicates that the authorities did take her claims seriously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The [appellant] has provided no further comment on this presumed political interference.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal does not accept that this politician interfered with the police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">" 

6 The first appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates' Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">She claimed that the Tribunal had erred when considering the authenticity of the police reports used to substantiate the claim that her child was the victim of an attempted kidnapping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In particular, the first appellant claimed that the Tribunal had not complied with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") by failing to provide her with written notice that a reason for its adverse decision would be her claim that the kidnapping investigation was neglected as a result of her political affiliations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It was also claimed that the Tribunal had failed to exercise its jurisdiction by not making adequate enquiries as to the validity of the police reports, and did not have sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that they were not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">7 The Federal Magistrate rejected the submission that the Tribunal had erred by failing to meet its obligations under s 424A(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He held that the appellant's failure to reiterate a claim made at the time of her original application for a protection visa was not "information" for the purposes of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">He continued:
 
 "[26] I otherwise accept that the Tribunal in any event had not regarded the applicants' failure to reiterate her claim about the JVP politician as part of its reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 
 [27] I am otherwise satisfied that if the reference to the failure to reiterate the claim about the JVP politician could be regarded as information, then it was not made part of the applicant's submissions and accordingly does fall within the exception pursuant to s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 [28] Ultimately, what has occurred in this instance is that the applicant's claim has been rejected by the Tribunal and as submitted by the first respondent, it cannot be said that a claim that is made and rejected by the Tribunal forms part of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The claim is not the information, according to the first respondent's submissions, but rather it is the information relied upon in rejecting a claim that is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I accept that submission and, in my view, accordingly this ground should fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In reaching that decision, the Court is not assisted by other authorities referred to by counsel during the course of submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal in this case is simply noting a failure to reiterate a claim, and that in my view cannot constitute information of a kind which would attract the application of s 424A of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">As indicated, this ground should therefore fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">" 

8 In dismissing the claim that the Tribunal had failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction in relation to ascertaining the validity of the police reports, the Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal had made a finding that, even if the document was accepted as genuine, that would not necessarily represent evidence of the attempted kidnapping and was ultimately not a significant factor in the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">While the Federal Magistrate commented that the Tribunal had dealt with this issue in a "somewhat unsatisfactory manner", his Honour found that the Tribunal "proceeded to make findings where little or no weight was placed upon the police report and other factors were taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">" The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application on 30 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">9 The notice of appeal filed in this court on 19 February 2007 alleges that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was affected by jurisdictional error and that he ought to have made the following findings:
 
 (a) That the Tribunal denied procedural fairness to the appellant and breached s 424A of the Act by failing to provide particulars of information relied upon when dismissing claims of the attempted kidnapping; 
 (b) That the Tribunal denied procedural fairness to the appellant and breached s 424A of the Act by failing to ensure that the appellant understood that a police report that had been provided would not be accepted as evidence of the attempted kidnapping;
 (c) That the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction by making a finding in relation to the date printed on the police report when there was no evidence to support such a conclusion; and
 (d) That the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction by reaching a conclusion in relation to the police report when expert evidence and translation were required to contradict sworn evidence given at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">

10 At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellants identified two issues raised by these grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">They were:
 
 &#8226; Whether the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A(1) of the Act by failing to give the appellants written particulars "of the information that they had claimed in their application [for protection visas]... that a politician in Sri Lanka had interfered with a police investigation into an attempted kidnap of the first appellant's child" which claim was not reiterated at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">&#8226; Did the Tribunal fall into jurisdictional error by making findings which were not open on the evidence or by failing to exercise its powers of enquiry in relation to the extracts from Sri Lankan police records?</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

11 The appellants contend that the Tribunal was obliged to provide them with notice that the claim of interference, by a politician, with the police investigation had been made in support of the original protection visa applications and that the failure to reiterate the claim at the hearing before the Tribunal might undermine, in the Tribunal's mind, the veracity of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">12 The respondent contends that the Tribunal was not obliged to comply with the requirements of s 424A(1) in respect of this "information" because:
 
 &#8226; The appellants' failure to reiterate the claim did not form "part of the reason" for the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">This was because the Tribunal had found as a fact that "there was no attempt to kidnap the [appellant's] son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" If there was no kidnapping there was no report to the police and no police investigation to be interfered with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">&#8226; A failure to reiterate a claim cannot constitute "information" within the meaning of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">&#8226; If the original claim was "information" which formed part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision that information was given by the appellant to the Tribunal for the purposes of its review and, therefore, it was information comprehended by the exemption provided for in s 424A(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">

13 I am prepared to assume, in the appellant's favour, that the fact that the claim of political interference with the police investigation was made in support of the original applications but not reiterated at the hearing before the Tribunal constitutes "information" for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, the Tribunal is only bound to provide particulars of information "that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">" Information will not be "a part of the reason" for affirming a decision unless it is established that the information "contributed in some way, which renders it an operative causal link, to the decision itself": see SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 256 [182] ; NBKS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 ; (2006) 156 FCR 205 at 224 [79] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">14 The Tribunal's reference to the failure by the appellant to reiterate the political interference claim was made in the paragraph of its reasons which is set out above at [5].</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The context is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The paragraph deals with the question of whether any alleged persecution suffered by the appellant occurred by reason of her political opinion or imputed political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In dealing with this issue the Tribunal puts the appellant's case, in relation to the existence of a Convention related reason for alleged persecution, at its highest and then discounts it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Phrases such as "[e]ven in her own alleged report to the police on the attempted kidnap of her son ...", "[t]he attempt to kidnap her son is said to have occurred ...", "[i]f there was a police investigation ..." are suggestive of considerable scepticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The critical and operative finding was, however, that "there was no attempt to kidnap the [appellant's] son.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">" Once the Tribunal had reached this point in its reasoning nothing which it might have said as to the reason for the kidnapping or the reason for any alleged interference with a police investigation into it could, in my opinion, form an operative reason for rejecting the appellant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">15 Moreover, there is force in the Minister's contention that the claim about political interference had formed part of the claims made in support of the appellant's visa applications and that these claims had been republished to the Tribunal when review of the delegate's decision was sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Section 424A(3)(b) provides that the requirements of s 424A(1) do not apply to information which an applicant "gave" for the purpose of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Most, if not all, cases in which s 424A(3)(b) has been invoked have been cases in which an applicant makes a significant claim before the Tribunal which was not made in support of the original protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">This case differs because a claim which was made in the original application was not repeated during the oral hearing before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Section 424A(3)(b) could only operate in this case if the claims made in support of the original visa application were made (given) to the Tribunal by the appellant: SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at 222, 252, 256.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">16 A written submission was made to the Tribunal on behalf of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Although no express reference was made, in that submission, to the alleged political interference with the police investigation, the Tribunal's attention was directed to the appellant's statement in support of her protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Part of the submission read: "She has also been politically involved as can be seen from the statement she made in support of her protection visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">" As already noted, one aspect of the appellant's political involvement was her work for the UNP which it was said led to the interference by a political opponent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">She thereby expressly relied on the information and invited the Tribunal to have regard to it: see M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The Tribunal was, therefore seized of the political interference claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Was it also seized of the "information" that the claim had not been reiterated during the hearing which it conducted?</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Although there are some decisions of the Court (see for example VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471) which may be understood as supporting the view that omissions from an appellant's account do not constitute "information" for the purposes of s 424A of the Act , the weight of authority supports the conclusion reached by Weinberg J in NBKS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 174 ; (2006) 156 FCR 205 at 212-13 that:
 
 "There is no reason in principle why such an omission (which the Tribunal views as important, and which is plainly adverse to the applicant's case) should be treated any differently, when it comes to s 424A , than a positive statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">This is particularly so when, as the Tribunal seems to have done here, it treats the omission as though it provides implicit support for a positive assertion that is detrimental to an applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It makes no difference whether the omission is to be found in a prior statement of an applicant or as in this case in a statement provided by a third party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">" 

See also SZEEU at 252, 262-3; SZGGT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 435 at [72] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Although his Honour was dealing with a case in which the relevant omission was made in the original application, there is no reason, in principle, why the failure to mention a particular matter when advancing a case before the Tribunal should not also constitute "information" for the purposes of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">17 It follows that I agree with the Federal Magistrate's alternative basis for rejecting this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal was not obliged to give particulars of the information relating to the alleged political interference with the police inquiry which was contained in the appellant's original application and the information relating to her failure to mention the matter during her appearance before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In both cases the "information" was given by her to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Section 424A(3)(b) therefore applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">18 The second ground relied on by the appellants relates to the Tribunal's treatment of the extracts from the police reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It is fair to say that the Tribunal had serious reservations about whether the extract tendered by the appellant supported the claim that her son had been kidnapped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The Tribunal said that:
 
 "The new (last) translation of the relevant document, purporting to be an extract of a report to ... the police about an attempt to kidnap the [appellant's] son, provided to the Tribunal did answer some of the concerns expressed by the Tribunal at the hearing about this document, namely that there was in fact an indication of the police station where the report was said to have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">This was not filled in on the last line of text but appeared as a wet stamp under the signature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal remains of the view that the space for the date in the top part of the document is there to indicate the date on which the report to the police was made, the time, page number and paragraph number of the police book in which it is found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">A place for the date of issue of the extract is provided on the bottom left hand corner of this form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It has not been filled in in the document in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The applicant, in her response to the s 424A letter on this point, stated that the date "2005.02.17", the alleged date of the incident, forms part of the declaration to the police Constable who actually copied the extract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Although the Tribunal can see that this date is there in the Singhalese version, it is notable by its absence in both translations of both documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">At the hearing the Tribunal asked that this clause be read by the [appellant] and it was confirmed that this was an indication of when this report had been made, that is 17 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">There is a further issue with the declaration by the Constable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">On the top of the document the page and paragraph number of the said report in the said book are cited as 321 and 145 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the declaration, 350/145 appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">The adviser has submitted to the Tribunal possible reasons for this less than accurate transcription from the police record book to the present document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">These are that the process of transcription itself, the purpose for which thought the document was being obtained and the different standards applying in Australia and Sri Lanka in the matter of legal documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">At the hearing the Tribunal sought to establish who had obtained this report from the police; the applicant stated that it was her husband.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">When further questions were asked when her husband had returned to Sri Lanka she replied that this had occurred on 5 November 2005, a copy of the relevant page from her husband's passport showed that he had entered Sri Lanka on 9 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The Tribunal asked how he could have obtained this report on 5 November if he was not in Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The answer to this question came in the adviser's response to the s 424A letter where in it is stated that "whilst the primary applicant's husband collected the reports, and sent these back to the primary applicant, her uncle had made a request for the kidnapping extract before her husband returned to Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">This accounts for the earlier date on the kidnapping extract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">" 
 
 The Tribunal does not accept that this document is evidence of the events described therein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The Tribunal does not accept that the errors in it are due to mere administrative incompetence or perceived uses to which the document would be put, not (sic) does not accept that standards in different countries is a relevant issue when it is purported that this is a case made by a person of a portion of what was contained in another book and counter signed for accuracy not only by the person making the copy but also the officer in charge of the police station.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In addition, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the report was requested by an "uncle" and picked up by the [appellant's] husband on his arrival in Sri Lanka; this in itself negates the view that the date on the top of the document is the date of its issue to the person requesting it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The existence of this document, even if it were accepted as genuine, would only attest to a report being made to a police station and could not represent evidence of the event described therein having occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Tribunal therefore does not accept that the [appellant] was threatened by telephone as stated in the extract or that there was an attempt to kidnap her son from school;" 
 

19 The appellants complained that there was no evidence to support the Tribunal's conclusion that the statements at the top of the police reports indicated the dates on which the reports were made rather than the dates on which the reports were sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The appellants further contended that the Tribunal was not entitled to form a view about the extract "simply on the basis of certain English words appearing; expert evidence was needed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">" Counsel for the appellants summarised the relevant submissions as follows:
 
 "The appellant submits that the Tribunal was required to do more than perfunctorily dismiss the reports as, in effect, forgeries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Such a strong adverse finding required a sound basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The appellant's credit had not otherwise been destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It would have been a simple matter for the Tribunal to inquire, utilising its powers under s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act and/or its own resources, in order to obtain a firm basis for a conclusion on the authenticity of the police reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It was not necessary that the confidentiality of the appellant be compromised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The relevant information was on a proforma document, readily discernable (sic) from a police station in Columbo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" 
 

20 The Tribunal did not find that the police reports were forgeries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It plainly did consider that they could not be relied on to support the particular claims being made by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">In the passage extracted above at [18] the Tribunal explains its reasons for concluding that "the space for the date in the top part of the document is there to indicate the date on which the report to the police was made".</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">One reason was that there was provision elsewhere on the form for the date of extract to be written in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">There was also an issue about the accuracy of transcription from the police record book to the extract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It is clear that the Tribunal carefully examined the extract before concluding that it could place little reliance on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The Tribunal explained its reasoning process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Its conclusion was a finding of fact which was open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Expert evidence was not required: there was no allegation that the document had been forged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The Tribunal's misgivings were exposed to the appellant and she was, through her adviser, given the opportunity to respond to the Tribunal's concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">She did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The Tribunal was under no obligation to make further inquiries in order to obtain further information to ascertain (if this were possible) whether or not there was evidence available through police sources or otherwise in Sri Lanka to support the appellant's claim relating to the kidnapping of her son, the reporting of the incident to the police and the conduct of the police investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">21 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY .</sentence>
