 INTRODUCTION 
 On 30 October 2009, I made the orders that appear at the front of these Reasons for Judgement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The main order was that the first respondent, to which I will refer as "AFAL", be wound up as if under s 461(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">That order was made under s 62ZJ of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">AFAL is a general insurer within the meaning of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I also ordered that Murray Smith of McGrathNicol (Mr Smith) be appointed as liquidator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Finally, by consent I ordered under s 62S(1)(b) of the Act that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) pay the remuneration and allowances of Mr Smith in his capacity as judicial manager of AFAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">These are the reasons why I made those orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">CONSIDERATION 
 The proceeding and the legislation
 On 3 July 2009, Edmonds J made an order under s 62M of the Act in proceeding NSD 592 of 2009 that AFAL be placed under judicial management and an order under s 62R(1) of the Act appointing Mr Smith as judicial manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">His Honour also ordered that any remuneration and/or allowances that Mr Smith was to receive as judicial manager be paid out of the property of AFAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Section 62K of the Act provides, relevantly, that APRA may apply to the Federal Court for an order that a general insurer be placed under judicial management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It was APRA that made the application before Edmonds J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">According to s 62M of the Act, on an application under s 62K, the Federal Court may order that a general insurer be placed under judicial management if the Court is satisfied of the matters set out in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">His Honour's order that the judicial manager's remuneration and allowances be charged on the property of AFAL was made under s 62S of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On 16 October 2009, Mr Smith commenced the present proceeding seeking an order that AFAL be wound up pursuant to s 62ZJ(1)(b) of the Act or, in the alternative, pursuant to s 461 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The affidavit that accompanied the application had annexed to it a report that Mr Smith filed with the Court pursuant to s 62ZI(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Subsection (2) of s 62ZI provides for the possible courses of action that a judicial manager may recommend in his or her report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">One of those courses of action is that the general insurer be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In his report Mr Smith recommended that AFAL be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Section 62ZJ(1) of the Act provides that on an application for an order to give effect to a course or courses of action recommended in a judicial manager's report under s 62ZI, APRA and any other person interested is entitled to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I ordered that APRA be added as second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Ross David Porter, John Austin Punch, Anthony Richard Royle and Brian Edward Smith, the directors of AFAL, filed a notice of motion seeking directions permitting them to file affidavit evidence touching on certain matters mentioned in Mr Smith's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the event, however, they did not pursue the motion or seek to adduce any evidence or to make submissions or otherwise seek to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Facts
 AFAL commenced operations on or about 28 April 1986 as a general insurer authorised under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Among other things, AFAL was established to write insurance products relating to the diagnosis of cancer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In about 1988, AFAL commenced writing other forms of insurance including personal accident and sickness insurance, travel insurance, mobile telephone cover insurance, insurance cover for the incurring of legal fees, motor insurance cover for prestige motor vehicles, insurance cover in relation to salary continuance, and insurance cover for heavy motor vehicles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">From 1986 to about December 1995, AFAL assumed 100% of the risk of the business it wrote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">From about December 1995, however, AFAL entered into underwriting agreements, the effect of which was that a significant proportion of the risk for certain pool business that was written was assumed by a lead insurer or other underwriter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">On or about 19 December 1995, AFAL entered into an underwriting agreement with Triton Underwriting Insurance Agency Pty Ltd (Triton) and Mercantile Mutual Assurance (Australia) Limited (Mercantile) under which Mercantile was to take the role of lead underwriter for any business that was written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In or about December 1998, AFAL entered into an underwriting arrangement with Triton and Am-Re Managers Asia Pacific (Am-Re), under which Am-Re was to be the lead underwriter for business written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In his report and affidavit, Mr Smith deals with various purported transfers of parts of AFAL's portfolio to Am-Re and to Trans Pacific Insurance Corporation (TPIC), respectively, and concludes that he cannot be sure that there are not outstanding liabilities to policyholders remaining with AFAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">On 1 July 2002, AFAL's insurance licence was varied by APRA and the company was placed into run-off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">From that date to the time of Mr Smith's appointment as judicial manager, AFAL carried on its insurance business solely for the purpose of discharging liabilities under contracts of insurance entered into before 1 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">On 23 April 2009, Mr Brian Silvia of BRI Ferrier was appointed as provisional liquidator of TPIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Mr Smith has been informed that Mr Silvia intends to make a claim against AFAL alleging that the purported transfer of AFAL's business to TPIC was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, Mr Smith has not been presented with, or been able to locate, any evidence supporting this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In the period April 2009 to May 2009, there were meetings and correspondence between AFAL, AFAL's then legal advisers and APRA regarding AFAL's financial position in relation to its potential liability for the claims that were previously being settled by TPIC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">TPIC was ordered to be wound up on 25 June 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In his report as judicial manager, Mr Smith considers the various courses of action provided for in s 62ZI(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">He concludes, for reasons that he gives, that each of the possible courses of action other than a winding up is not appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">One of the primary reasons why Mr Smith recommended a winding up is AFAL's financial position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">According to AFAL's balance sheet as at the date of his appointment, as reconstructed by Mr Smith based upon his initial investigations, AFAL had assets worth approximately $512,000 and liabilities totalling $280,000, leaving net assets of $231,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, this does not take into account liabilities that are now to be settled by AFAL, given the fact that TPIC is in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On an adjusted basis, there is a deficiency in the order of approximately $1,023,900, and that does not take into account Mr Smith's fees as judicial manager and other costs associated with the judicial management (see [29] below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Mr Smith estimates that AFAL will not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable payment of its debts as and when they fall due within the year ended 31 December 2010 (excluding his remuneration and expenses as judicial manager).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Mr Smith expresses the opinion, on the basis of AFAL's negative net asset position and forecast negative cash flow, that AFAL is insolvent and is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It does not seem necessary for me to summarise Mr Smith's lengthy and detailed report dated 16 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Smith concludes, in terms of s 62ZI(1)(a) of the Act, that it is in the best interests of policyholders, while promoting financial system stability in Australia, that AFAL be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">At para 41 of his affidavit made on 16 October 2009 to which his report was attached, Mr Smith summarises his reasons for supporting a winding up as follows: 
(a) AFAL's insolvency and negative asset position, and the fact that AFAL would not be able to generate the cash flows necessary to meet its debts as and when they will fall due for the year ended 31 December 2010;
 
(b) uncertainties concerning the liabilities of AFAL;
 
(c) AFAL was placed into run-off in 2002 and the natural extension of this is for it to be wound up in due course, and a present order for winding up will crystallise that process;
 
(d) there is no viable alternative rescue or recovery proposal to allow AFAL to continue in run-off;
 
(e) a liquidator will be able to investigate and examine AFAL's affairs including, but not limited to, any preferential payments and uncommercial transactions; and
 
(f) AFAL appears not to have complied with various regulatory requirements, in particular, the condition of its insurance licence requiring it to prepare an actuarial valuation as at 31 December each year and to provide that valuation to APRA within three months of the end of the year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Application of the Act to the facts of this case
 Section 62ZJ(1)(b) of the Act provides that this Court may make an order giving effect to such course or courses of action as it considers in the circumstances to be most advantageous to the general interest of the policyholders of the general insurer concerned, while promoting financial system stability in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">For the reasons given by Mr Smith and outlined above, and, in particular, because of the insolvency of AFAL, I thought it to be most advantageous to the general interest of AFAL's policyholders, while promoting financial system stability in Australia, that AFAL be wound up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The relevant course of action is described in s 62ZI(2)(d) as being "to wind up the general insurer", but there is no definition of the concept of a "winding up" in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Various other provisions of the Act refer to provisions of the Corporations Act (see, for example, s 62ZH dealing with disclaimer of onerous property).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The winding up takes place under the Act and perhaps it is implicit that the Corporations Act 's winding up regime applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Nonetheless, I considered it desirable to include in the order for winding up a reference to the winding up being as if under s 461(1) of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">If any difficulty should arise in the application of the Corporations Act regime to the winding up of AFAL, Mr Smith, as liquidator, will be able to apply to the Court for directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In conformity with rule 5.5 of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 , Mr Smith, a registered and official liquidator, signed a consent to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Those rules do not in fact apply to a proceeding under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Nonetheless, the evidence of Mr Smith's consent, the declaration that he is unaware of any conflict of interest or duty, and the rates of remuneration charged by his firm are relevant evidence in support of his appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">APRA would have taken the rates into account when consenting to the order referred to in the next paragraph.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">APRA consented to the making of an order under s 62S(1)(b) of the Act that it pay the remuneration and allowances of Mr Smith in his capacity as judicial manager of AFAL, including, but not limited to, his costs and expenses of the present proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">As noted at [4] above, in his orders of 3 July 2009 Edmonds J ordered that any remuneration and/or allowances that the judicial manager was to receive be paid out of the property of AFAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">I was not asked to set aside that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I assume that it has not been acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">My order, being later in time, will prevail and will now be the order to be acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">CONCLUSION 
 It was for the above reasons that I made the orders on 30 October 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I certify that the preceding thirty (30) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.</sentence>
