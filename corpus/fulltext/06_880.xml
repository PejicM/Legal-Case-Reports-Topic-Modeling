 1 Earlier this year I handed down judgment which dealt with several aspects of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Importantly, I held that the first applicant, Colorado Group Limited, was entitled to maintain registration of the "Colorado" trade mark only in respect of backpacks and that the respondent, Strandbags Group Pty Limited, had infringed the mark by using it on backpacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Colorado Group was entitled to maintain its registration for backpacks because Strandbags Group had not established that it (Colorado Group) was not the first user of the mark for that article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I rejected an argument put by Colorado Group that by reason of its use of the mark on backpacks it was also the proprietor of the mark in respect of bags, wallets, purses and belts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">That argument was rejected because I did not accept that these goods were the same kind of articles as a backpack.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 Those findings did not dispose of the trade mark case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There are still two issues that must be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The first is whether Colorado Group is entitled to claim proprietorship of the Colorado mark in respect of wallets and purses, not on the basis of having first used the mark on backpacks but by reason of its later use of the word in relation to wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The second issue is whether Colorado Group can rely on s 120(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) to support a finding that Strandbags Group infringed the registered trade mark by using it on handbags, wallets and purses or in relation to the bringing together of such goods for the benefit of customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 As regards the first issue, there is a contest about who first used the word "Colorado" as a trade mark in relation to wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Each side claims to be the first user of the mark in respect of these articles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Strandbags Group also has an alternative argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It says that even if it (or its predecessor, Edgarlodge Pty Ltd) was not the first user of the mark on those articles it is, nonetheless, the first user of the mark in respect of handbags and handbags are goods of the "same kind" as wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Both sides accept that for the first issue no distinction is to be drawn between wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 To resolve the dispute it is necessary for me to refer to findings already made as well as to look further into the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I have already found that Colorado Group (through its subsidiaries, Williams the Shoemen Pty Limited and Mathers Shoes Pty Ltd) first used the Colorado mark, probably from as early as 1982, but then only on backpacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The backpacks were sold in Williams the Shoemen and Mathers Shoes footwear stores throughout Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It was not clear whether the mark was used alone as Colorado Group contended or was used only in combination with the "simple mountain motif", which was the case put by Strandbags Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Because of the inconclusiveness of the evidence (we are after all talking about the 1980s) I was not prepared to make the finding Strandbags Group sought, the onus being on it to make out its cross-claim for removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">5 In February 1991, the operation of the footwear businesses was transferred to Colorado Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In July 1992, Colorado Group began developing a range of products to be sold through a retail chain of Colorado stores.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The idea was to capitalise on the success of the Colorado shoe range.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Beagley, the General Manager for buying and marketing, was instrumental in establishing the chain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He said that it was intended that a full range of "Colorado" branded products be sold in each store; the range consisting of clothing, footwear, accessories and leather goods such as belts, bags and wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">6 Three stores were opened in July 1993, one in Victoria and two in New South Wales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Others soon followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">From the first opening, each store was stocked with a full range of products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In one way or another each product bore some form of a Colorado trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is not clear, however, whether the word "Colorado" was used alone or in combination with the "simple mountain motif".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I found that the predominant use of the word was in association with the mountain motif.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Beagley said this was the case as regards wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">7 Colorado Group suggests that the use of the word "Colorado" in combination with the "simple mountain motif" was use of the word as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I cannot accept this argument, although I toyed with it in my earlier reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The early cases that bear on the point were decided under the Trade Marks Registration Act 1875 (UK), 38 &amp; 39 Vict, c 91.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I referred to some of them in my previous reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 10 of the 1875 Act provided that "any special and distinctive word or words or combination of figures or letters used as a trade-mark before the passing of this Act may be registered as such under this Act".</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Thus, to obtain registration of a word mark, it was necessary to show not only that the word was "special and distinctive" but also that it had been "used as a trade-mark".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">This requirement was met if the word was used alone as a word.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">If it was used in combination with other words or with a device that was not sufficient: In re J B Palmer's Trade-Mark (1883) 24 Ch D 504; Re Spencer's Trade Mark (1886) 54 LT NS 659; In re Grossmith's Trade Mark (1889) 6 PR 180; Perry Davis &amp; Son v Harbord (1890) 15 App Cas 316; Powell v The Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Company, Limited [1894] AC 8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In Re Chorlton and Dugdale's Trade Mark (1885) 53 LT NS 337, 338 Pearson J explained that for words to be registered as a mark they must "have been used solely and not in combination with any device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I think that 'used as a mark' means 'used by themselves as a trade mark' not 'used as part of a trade [mark]'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The same position holds under the present Australian Trade Marks Act , albeit the language is now different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">8 There is an exception to the general rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In BP plc v Woolworths (2004) 62 IPR 545 I held that in very limited situations it was possible to dissect a total image to obtain proprietorship (and trade mark registration) of only one component of the total image.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The test I adopted was whether the component created "a separate and distinct commercial impression" from the other components, so that it might be said of the distinct component that it performs a trade mark function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Another way of putting it is to determine whether the individual component for which registration is sought comprises a separate and distinct trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In other words, although two or more elements (words, devices or both) may be used in combination and constitute a combination mark for which registration may be obtained that does not deny absolutely the possibility that one or more of those elements is an individual mark for which registration can also be obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Admittedly the cases where this will occur are rare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is more likely to occur in the case of a word and device mark, because often the word is the dominant portion of a combination mark: In re Tekelec-Airtronic , 188 USPQ 694 (1975); Continental Specialities Corp v Continental Connector Corp , 192 USPQ 449 (1976); In re Dempster Bros, Inc , 132 USPQ 300 (1961).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">9 How are these principles to be applied to Colorado Group's combination mark -- "Colorado" with the "simple mountain motif"?</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There is no evidence of the impact made by the individual components of the combination mark and, while helpful, that kind of evidence would not, of course, be determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">All I have to go on is my own impression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">And, in my judgment, this is not a combination mark which is comprised of several distinct trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">10 If Colorado Group cannot rely on the combination mark, it is necessary to decide when it first used the Colorado mark alone in respect of wallets or purses or, for that matter, any goods of a similar kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">As stated, there is no evidence of use of the word alone for wallets or purses before at least 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">But there is evidence that in some instances the word "Colorado" was used alone in relation to other goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Mr Beagley said the word was used alone in 1993 in respect of "bags", which appears to be a reference to handbags, shoulder bags and other fashion bags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">He explained, for example, that the kind of material used for some bags made the application of the motif design impossible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">This evidence was not challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The question to be resolved, then, is whether this use was the first use of the mark in relation to such goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">11 Edgarlodge began applying the word "Colorado" to goods as part of a combination mark consisting of the word "Colorado" together with the Indian head device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The combination mark was designed in April 1991 at the request of Edgarlodge's director, Mr Evans, and was registered shortly thereafter as a combination mark in respect of handbags, travelgoods and belts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The combination mark was first applied to a range of handbags that were sold at Edgarlodge' s 11 Queensland stores beginning 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">12 In August 1992, Edgarlodge opened its first "Colorado" theme store which had the word "Colorado" on the shopfront.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Previously the Edgarlodge stores had operated under the name "The Travel Bug" or "Bagstop".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">It has been suggested that the use of the word on the shopfront amounted to trade mark use in relation to goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">I do not accept that this use of the word, even if it were a fancy word, is use as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In one way or other, the use of a word or device as a mark must involve its use in connection with particular goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Unless there be some connection between the two the mark would not identify the source of the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">A storefront name does not serve that purpose particularly where a variety of goods and "brands" are sold in the store.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The average consumer would not think that a shop name is a badge of origin: rather he or she is likely to think that it is the name, or the business name, of the proprietor of the establishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">13 It was also said that the use around this time of the word "Colorado" on invoices and the like was use as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">That may be true.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Unfortunately, no example of any invoice or "the like" current at the time was produced -- no doubt because there are none available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">I am not prepared in these circumstances to speculate whether "Colorado" may have been used as a trade mark in this way in relation to any goods let alone the goods in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">14 There is more evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I mentioned that one of the first items sold in the "Colorado" theme store from about 1991 was a range of handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The handbags, which bore Edgarlodge's combination mark, were supplied by a Hong Kong manufacturer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The manufacturer applied the combination mark to the goods before they were shipped to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">A sample from the first range is in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The combination mark appears embossed on the front of the handbag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Inside the handbag, however, there is a brushed metal plate which bears the word "Colorado" alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">This use of the Colorado mark was not disputed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In addition, a small number of handbags were manufactured for Edgarlodge in 1992 and had on the front an embossed logo comprising the word "Colorado" on a diamond shaped label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I have not seen the handbag, only a drawing of the label.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">My impression is that the diamond shaped label is not part of the mark: it is merely the means by which the word "Colorado" is appended to the handbag.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">15 The handbags sold well and the range of "Colorado" goods quickly expanded to include others, among them being wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The combination mark was applied to the new range, either by it being embossed on the article itself or by it appearing on an attached metal plate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">A coin purse sold at the time which was in evidence showed the combination mark embossed on the front.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">16 There is no evidence that the word "Colorado" alone was directly applied to the wallets or purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Evans said that, to the best of his knowledge, the combination mark (word and Indian head) was used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Ms Blackman, who was employed by Edgarlodge between 1986 and 1998 as warehouse and store manager, said that "for the first few seasons" wallets featured the combination mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">A summary stock take from January 1993 referred to "Colorado leather wallets" in stock at the Liverpool store.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">I do not take this to be a statement of the type of mark that appeared on the wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">17 The word "Colorado" did appear on its own on cardboard credit card inserts (pieces of cardboard the size of a credit card) that were placed inside wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The contentious issue is when did these cards first appear?</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Strandbags Group says that they were in use as early as 1992.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">On one reading of his affidavit this is what Mr Evans said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">But he clarified his position in cross-examination when he conceded that the credit card inserts were introduced "post-1995".</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In contrast, Ms Blackman said: "For wallets, I recall that the word 'Colorado' alone was stamped directly onto the leather.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The word 'Colorado' was also printed on a business card insert which was then placed inside the wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">" It was her evidence that "[w]e always had that insert, from the very beginning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">" I think the likely position is that the cardboard insert with the word "Colorado" was first used after 1995, as Mr Evans stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">18 The word "Colorado" appeared on a swing tag which was attached to handbags and purses and, until 1995, wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">A sample swing tag was produced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">On one side of the swing tag appears the combination mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">On the other side there is the statement: "Be a COLORADO collector".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">According to Mr Evans and his wife, Ms Malouf-Evans, these tags were in common use from 1991, having been attached to most Colorado branded goods, including handbags and wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Mr Evans said that a sample of this swing tag was submitted to the Trade Marks Office together with the application for the registration of the combination trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">19 There can be no doubt that a swing tag bearing a trade mark is use of the mark in relation to the article to which the tag is attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">This is recognised by the Trade Marks Act itself which, by s 9(1)(a) , provides "a trade mark is taken to be applied to any goods ... if it is ... affixed or annexed to [the goods]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The only question is whether the use of the word "Colorado" in the phrase "Be a COLORADO collector" is use of the word as a trade mark in circumstances where the word also appears on the opposite side of the tag as part of a combination mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">20 The answer must be considered from the perspective of the public, or that section of the public that would purchase these kinds of goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Would a person in this class understand that the word "Colorado" is being used as a trade mark; that is, as a statement concerning the origin of the goods?</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">I am in no doubt that the answer to this question is in the affirmative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">In my opinion a consumer looking at the swing tag would form the view that the goods are being distinguished by two marks, the combination mark and the word "Colorado".</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">This conclusion is in accordance with Richards v Butcher [1891] 2 Ch 522.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">21 The position reached to this point then is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Edgarlodge was the first to use the word "Colorado" in relation to handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Edgarlodge's use of the word "Colorado" in respect of purses and wallets also predates Colorado Group's use of the word in respect of these goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">22 I turn now to s 120(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">That section provides that a person will infringe a registered trade mark if he or she uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the registered trade mark in relation to: (a) goods of the same description as that of the registered goods; (b) services that are closely related to the registered goods; (c) services of the same description as that of services in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or (d) goods that are closely related to registered services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">There is a qualification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">A person is not taken to have infringed the trade mark if the person establishes that the relevant use is not likely to deceive or cause confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">23 Having previously found that the Colorado mark used by Strandbags Group was substantially identical with or deceptively similar to Colorado Group's registered mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">It remains to be considered whether handbags, wallets and purses are goods "of the same description" as backpacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The applicants also submitted (to be fair, less strenuously) that these were goods "closely related" to the service of bringing together backpacks for the benefit of customers and that the service of bringing together handbags, wallets and purses for the benefit of customers is a service "closely related" to backpacks or is a service "of the same description" as the service of bringing together backpacks for the benefit of customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I will consider these issues in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">24 I can dispose of the "same description" inquiry fairly swiftly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Whether goods are "of the same description" is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">According to the authorities, the three principal factors to be considered are: (1) the nature of the goods, including their origin and characteristics; (2) the uses made of the goods, including their intended purposes; and (3) the trade channels through which the goods are bought and sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">It is not essential that all criteria be met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">See Re Jellinek's Application for a Trade Mark (1946) 63 RPC 59; John Crowther &amp; Sons (Milnsbridge) Ltd's Application for a Trade Mark (1948) 65 RPC 369; Reckitt &amp; Colman (Australia) Limited v Boden [1945] HCA 12 ; (1945) 70 CLR 84; McCormick &amp; Co Inc v McCormick (2000) 51 IPR 102.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The expression "same description" is not to be construed restrictively and regard is to be paid to the business or commercial context in which the goods in question are bought and sold: Rowntree plc v Rollbits Pty Ltd (1988) 10 IPR 539, 546; Australian Wine Importers' Trade Mark (1889) 6 RPC 311, 318.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Goods are not of the same description simply because they can be used for the same purpose, for example for personal adornment: Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158, 220; Camiceria Pancaldi and B Srl v Le Cravatte Di Pancaldi Srl (1994) 30 IPR 547.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">25 I do not think it can be said that handbags, purses and wallets are of the same description as backpacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Backpacks, especially those in respect of which Colorado Group or its predecessor applied the mark (being school backpacks), are not put to the same use as handbags, wallets or purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The nature of the products is, to my mind, quite different.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Backpacks are highly functional and directed toward comfort, weight-bearing, support and durability while wallets and purses have a predominant fashion purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">While perhaps not decisive, a person wishing to buy a backpack would not find a handbag, wallet or purse to be an acceptable substitute or alternative: see San Remo Macaroni Company Pty Ltd v San Remo Gourmet Coffee Pty Ltd (2000) 50 IPR 321, 330; Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Brook (1996) 69 FCR 401, 410-411.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">In any event, a consumer is not likely to think that these goods originate from the same source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">That is, I do not accept that either the trade or the public would regard the goods as similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">26 I do not treat as relevant, as Colorado Group asserted it was, that both it and Strandbags Group sell these goods from the same stores and to the same sorts of customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The fact that goods may be found in the same shop or in the same department within a department store is more a symptom of modern marketing methods which "tend to unify widely different types of products in the same retail outlets or distribution networks", than any great similarity in the goods: Continental Connector Corp v Continental Specialities Corp , 492 F.Supp 1088, 1096-1097 (1979).</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In my view, correspondence in the channels of trade is no longer a very helpful line of inquiry in relation to many goods, although there may be exceptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">27 The final question is whether the service of bringing together handbags, wallets and purses for sale is a service "closely related" to backpacks or whether it is "of the same description" as the service of bringing together backpacks for sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">I think these claims are hopeless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">I do not understand how it can be said that the service of bringing handbags, wallets and purses together is "closely related" to backpacks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There is no relationship between the two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In my opinion, speaking generally it is only when retailing services consist of supplying the very goods in respect of which it is said the services are related that the services and goods will be closely related: see Warnaco US Inc v Estee Lauder Cosmetics Ltd (2001) 50 IPR 143, K Mart Corporation v Artline Furnishers Supermarkets Pty Ltd (1991) 23 IPR 149.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">Put another way, I cannot imagine that the public would expect the same business to supply handbags, wallets and purses as well as backpacks: Winglide Pty Ltd v Corporate Express Inc (1999) 46 IPR 627, 630.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">For much the same reasons, I reject the submissions that the service of bringing together handbags, wallets and purses for the benefit of customers is a service "of the same description" as the service of bringing together backpacks for sale and that handbags, wallets and purses are goods "closely related" to that service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">28 In view of these findings, it is not necessary to deal with the qualification in s 120(2) which, had it been necessary, I would have given Strandbags Group leave to pursue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I do observe, however, that it would not have been easy for Strandbags Group to establish lack of deception or confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">29 It is also not necessary to deal with s 122(1)(f) , which provides that, in spite of s 120 , a person does not infringe a trade mark where the person uses the mark in good faith and "the court is of the opinion that the person would obtain registration of the trade mark in his or her name if the person were to apply for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">" For the sake of completeness and in the event this case goes further, I propose to state my views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">(Again, had it been necessary I would have permitted Strandbags Group to amend its pleading to canvass this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">) 
 
30 On the facts as I have found them, Edgarlodge was, and its successor Strandbags Group is, unambiguously the proprietor of the Colorado mark in respect of handbags because of first use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">There was a contest about its first use in relation to wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Even if that contest had been resolved differently it would not have affected the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In my earlier judgment I explained that a person is entitled to registration of a mark not only in respect of goods to which the mark has been applied but also to goods or classes of goods that are "of the same kind": Jackson &amp; Co v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 160.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">This is because it is assumed that a consumer is likely to believe that the other goods originate from the same source as the goods in respect of which the mark has been used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">31 In my view purses and wallets are goods of the same kind as handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Both are intended as fashion items and are used to carry small, everyday items such as money, credit cards, keys and like objects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">True, handbags are usually larger than both wallets and purses but I do not think this affects the kind of goods they are.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">At any rate, it is often very difficult to tell the difference between what is a purse and what is a handbag these days, with many handbags being quite small in size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">A consumer would expect a handbag and a purse or wallet bearing the same mark to come from the same source.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Some are even matching in design.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Indeed, many leading fashion houses sell lines of handbags, purses and wallets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">32 Were it necessary this analysis would produce the following consequence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">That is, Strandbags Group would not infringe Colorado Group's mark when it applied the mark to wallets or purses, as well as handbags.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">33 In the result, there will be declarations of trade mark infringement in relation to backpacks (with an injunction restraining further infringements) and that the first applicant is entitled at its election to damages or an account of profits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">In addition there will be orders requiring the respondent to state in an affidavit the number of backpacks sold and the proceeds of sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The Registrar will be directed to amend the registration of the trade mark so as to delete references to bags, belts, wallets and purses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Certain other orders will be made as has been discussed with the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">34 The only outstanding issue is costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It is not easy to know what to do with the costs because each party has had a significant measure of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Indeed each party concedes that there should be some apportionment of costs, but they differ markedly on what is the appropriate apportionment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">I think that the costs should lie where they fall save in relation to the accounting of profits or assessment of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The latter costs should be paid by the respondent unless Colorado Group recovers less than any amount offered by way of compromise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
