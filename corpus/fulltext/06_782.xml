1 The issue is whether "GO ON..." should remain registered as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The applicant ('Unilever') seeks an order under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Act') that the Register of Trade Marks be rectified by cancellation of Australian Trade Mark No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">898159 for GO ON... ('the trade mark') in Class 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The respondent ('Nestl&eacute;') registered the trade mark with effect from 17 December 2001 ('the date of registration') in respect of a broad category of goods in Class 30:
 
 'Coffee, coffee essences and coffee extracts; mixtures of coffee and chicory; preparations to be used as substitutes for coffee; tea, tea extracts; cocoa, and preparations having a base of cocoa; chocolate, chocolate products (for food), non-medicated confectionery and candy; sugar; mayonnaise; flour, preparations made from cereals and/or rice and/or flour for food for human consumption; breakfast cereals, bread, biscuits (other than biscuits for animals), cookies, cakes, pastry; ice cream, water ices, frozen confections, and preparations for making ice-cream and/or water ices and/or frozen confections; honey and honey substitutes; snack foods; prepared meals, desserts and puddings; all included in this class.</sentence>

4 Unilever is in the same trade as Nestl&eacute; and has also applied for registration of the trade mark "GO ON...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Unilever has used the expression "Go On...treat yourself" in relation to the promotion of its ice cream products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Nestl&eacute; has threatened Unilever with infringement proceedings under s 120 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is not in dispute that Unilever has standing as an "aggrieved person" to bring an application for cancellation of the registration of a trade mark (s 88(1) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 The Court may cancel the registration of a trade mark on any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under Division 2 of Part 5 of the Act (s 88(2)(a) of the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Section 57 in Division 2 Part 5 , in turn, provides that the registration of a trade mark may be opposed on any of the grounds specified in Division 2 of Part 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Section 41 is within Division 2 of Part 4 of the Act and, accordingly, provides the grounds for cancellation of the trade mark on which Nestl&eacute; relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 It is not in dispute that the Court considers the question as at the date of registration ( Unilever Australia Ltd v Karounos [2001] FCA 1132 ; (2001) 113 FCR 322 at [13] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Unilever accepts that it bears the onus of demonstrating that the mark should not have been accepted under s 41(3) or s 41(5) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 During the hearing, Nestl&eacute; offered to limit the category of goods for which the trade mark was to be registered to ' ice cream, water ices, frozen confections and preparations for making ice cream and/or water ices and all frozen confections '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This would result, it was submitted, in a higher degree of inherent adaptation to distinguish Nestl&eacute;'s goods.</sentence>

8 Nestl&eacute; distinguishes cases decided under the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth) ('the 1955 Act') as being from a time when certain marks were held to be inherently unregistrable no matter how distinctive they might have become in fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That position, Nestl&eacute; submits, was altered by the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 Decisions under the 1955 Act concerning the inherent adaptation to distinguish a trader's goods are relevant to the same question under the [1998] FCA 440 ; Act ( Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 83 FCR 50 at 59).</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The history of trade mark legislation in Australia is discussed in detail in Kenman Kandy Australia Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [2002] FCAFC 273 ; (2002) 122 FCR 494 by French J [35]---[44] and by Stone J at [134]---[143] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Act did not change the nature or policy of trade mark use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The changes brought about by the Act were, according to the Working Party to Review Trade Mark Legislation established by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business in 1989 and its report entitled ' Recommended Changes to the Australian Trade Marks Legislation ', in part to ensure that Australia recognised the ' developments in marketing and technology throughout the world '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Registrable marks would no longer be confined to signs consisting of words, letters, numerals, figurative elements or combinations of these but would also include colours, shapes, sounds, tastes or smells and aspects of packaging.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">These changes were described in the Second Reading Speech for the Act as ' ...an evolution from, rather than a revolutionary change of, the 1955 Act ' (House of Representative Debates (1995) pp 1909-1911).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">10 In commenting on these changes in Kenman Kandy Stone J recognised at [142] that:
 
 'the changes effected by the 1995 Act were not radical changes in that, while they expanded the ambit of trade mark operation, they did not change the nature or policy of trade mark use... [nor] ...detract from the fundamental requirement that a trade mark must have the capacity to distinguish one trader's goods from those of another; s 41(2) of the 1995 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">' 
 

11 A trade mark must distinguish goods as provided by s 17 of the Act:
 
 'A trade mark is a sign used, or intended to be used, to distinguish goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">' 
 

12 By s 41(2) the registration of the trade mark must be cancelled if the trade mark is not capable of distinguishing the goods in respect of which it is registered from the goods or services of other persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">13 Nestl&eacute; points to the scheme of s 41 and, in particular, s 41(6)(a) which relevantly provides for a trade mark that is not inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">If an applicant establishes that, because of the extent to which it has used the trade mark before the filing date, it does distinguish the goods, then the trade mark is taken to be capable of distinguishing those goods from the goods of other persons pursuant to s41(6)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">14 Note 1 to s 41(6) states that trade marks in this category, namely trade marks that are not inherently adapted to distinguish goods, are mostly trade marks that consist wholly of a sign that is ordinarily used to indicate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin or some other characteristic of the goods or the time of production of goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">This note is a guideline only and does not have legislative force.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It has, however, been observed by Wilcox J in Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks (2000) 47 IPR 579 at [30] that ' it fairly reflects the trend of relevant judicial authority '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 Slogans are composed of more than one word and can include phrases such as "go on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">They are commonly used in the course of trade and advertising.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There are numerous examples of phrases and exhortations that can obtain distinctiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">No different test is applied in assessing slogans as trade marks or in determining their inherent capacity to distinguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Slogans can be registered as trade marks if they are capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of other traders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">16 The increasing use of slogans in advertising and their use by traders as trade marks, as well as the inclusion of colours, shapes, colours, tastes or smells and aspects of packaging in the Act, has broadened the ways in which distinctiveness can been acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In particular, it has led to the use of multiple trade marks, with distinctiveness being acquired by a slogan by use with another strong trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">There are examples of ' brand cueing ' which exhibit similar language to GO ON... such as "Good on you mum Tip Top's the One!</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">" and "Anyhow... Have a Winfield".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The use of a slogan in conjunction with a registered mark may lead, in time, to recognition by the public that separate use designates the origin of a product and distinguishes it from other products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">17 Nestl&eacute; submits that, taking account of s 41(6), there is no class of words excluded by policy from trade mark registration and no trade marks that are incapable of distinguishing goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Nestl&eacute; submits that the Act has changed the previous position that certain marks could never become distinctive because they were inherently unregistrable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">That is not a correct analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">18 The effect of s 41(2) is that a trade mark without a capacity to distinguish the designated goods must not be registered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">There are three ways of determining capacity to distinguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">19 The first is that the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish the goods from those of others (s 41(3)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">20 The second is that the trade mark is to some extent inherently adapted so to distinguish and, because of the combined effect of that inherent adaptation, the use or intended use of the trade mark and any other relevant circumstances, the trade mark does or will distinguish the goods as those of the trader (s 41(5)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">If the trade mark does or will, to the satisfaction of the Court, distinguish the goods, it is taken to be capable of distinguishing the goods from those of other persons (s 41(5)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">If the Court is not so satisfied, it is taken not to be capable of distinguishing the goods from those of other persons (s 41(5)(c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">21 The third is that a trade mark that is not inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods but, because of the extent of use prior to the filing date of the application to register the mark, the trade mark does distinguish the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It is then taken to be capable of distinguishing them for the purposes of s 41(2) (s 41(6)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Otherwise, the trade mark is taken not to be capable of distinguishing the goods (s 41(6)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">22 Nestl&eacute; concedes that s 41(6)(a) has no application to this trade mark as there was no use of GO ON... by Nestl&eacute; prior to the registration date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Nestl&eacute; accepts that, if neither s 41(3) nor s 41(5) apply, the trade mark cannot survive and that, if Nestl&eacute; fails under s 41(5), it also fails under s 41(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">23 It follows that a trade mark may lack a capacity to distinguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">If the trade mark has no inherent adaptation to distinguish, it lacks a capacity to distinguish and should be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Is the trade mark inherently adapted to distinguish Nestl&eacute;'s goods?</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 
24 Nestl&eacute; relied upon the acceptance for registration without requisition or opposition from which, it submits, it can be inferred that the Registrar considered that the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish Nestl&eacute;'s goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">25 The acceptance for registration has marginal relevance in the context of this application for cancellation of registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">26 Nestl&eacute; submits that GO ON... is not descriptive of the goods for which the trade mark is registered; it has no reference to any characteristic of the goods; not to their quality, type or origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">"Go on...ice cream" does not make any allusion to the quality of the goods themselves and is not an expression usually applied to or descriptive of ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Accordingly, Nestl&eacute; submits, cases that relate to descriptive marks can be distinguished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">27 I accept that the trade mark is not descriptive of the goods to which it is applied and does not indicate a characteristic of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">GO ON... can be viewed as an exhortation, not describing the goods at all but an emotive direction to do something or take action and, as used by Nestl&eacute;, to taste ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As Dixon CJ explained in Mark Foy's Limited v Davies Coop and Company Limited [1956] HCA 41 ; (1956) 95 CLR 190 at 194 (' the Tub Happy Case' ) :
 
 'Many uses of words are purely emotive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">A word or words are often employed for no purpose but to evoke in the reader or hearer some feeling, some mood, some mental attitude.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">' 
 

However, the fact that the trade mark is not descriptive of the goods does not mean that it has an inherent capacity to distinguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Relevant principles 
 
28 The expression "inherently adapted to distinguish" has been the subject of much judicial analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">In Kenman Kandy Lindgren J, although in dissent in the application of the principle, elucidated the concept and the principles at [81] to [84].</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">His Honour commented that sub-sections 41(5) and (6) make it clear that the expression excludes from consideration any secondary significance a mark acquires from use and that there are degrees of inherent adaptation to distinguish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">It depends on the nature of the mark itself and is therefore not something that can be acquired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The nature of the range of goods to which the mark is to be applied is also to be taken into consideration as are the various ways in which it might be used or is proposed to be used in relation to those goods (at [84]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">His Honour proposed that inherent adaptation to distinguish can be tested by assessing how it would be perceived and understood by members of the public seeing it used for the first time, because that test excludes the possibility of a trade mark significance arising from use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">29 The question of distinctiveness is not whether the mark will be adapted to distinguish if registered but whether, irrespective of registration and as determined before registration, the trade mark is likely to distinguish the goods ( Registrar of Trade Marks v W &amp; G Du Cros Ltd [1913] AC 624; Clark Equipment Company v Registrar of Trade Marks [1964] HCA 55 ; (1964) 111 CLR 511).</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is insufficient that the mark may have the potential or capacity to acquire a distinctive character in the future ( Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio (Australia) Pty Ltd (2004) 209 ALR 93 at [30]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The power of advertising may mean that any mark other than a pure description may acquire the capacity to distinguish a trader's goods, regardless of whether or not it does so at any particular time ( Ocean Spray at [25]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Acquired distinctiveness is achieved only because the relevant community has, since the priority date, been educated to see the mark as an indicator of the origin of particular goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">An inherent capacity is an ' essential permanent characteristic ' and ' intrinsic ' to the trade mark ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 5th edn, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1993 (1933)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">30 As Gibbs J remarked in Burger King Corporation v Registrar of Trade Marks [1973] HCA 15 ; (1973) 128 CLR 417 at 424 that inherent adaptability is ' something which depends on the nature of the trade mark itself...and therefore is not something that can be acquired '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There is a distinction between ' inherently adapted to distinguish ' and ' inherently capable of distinguishing '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Sufficient distinguishing characteristics may mean that it is to be expected that distinctiveness will result, whatever the type and scale of the user and that distinctiveness can be acquired by appropriate user, thereby overcoming a negative quality in the mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">In Burger King Gibbs J observed at 425 that an inquiry as to inherent adaptability must be made where the question is whether the trade mark is capable of becoming distinctive as well as when the question is whether it is in fact distinctive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">31 The more apt the word or expression is to describe the goods, the less it is inherently apt to distinguish them as the goods of a particular manufacturer ( Clark Equipment at 515).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The setting or context in which the use occurs is relevant in determining whether the use is descriptive or for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade between the product and the trade mark applicant, as a badge of origin ( Shell Co (Australia) Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 424---5; Johnson &amp; Johnson Australia Pty Ltd v Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 326 at 350---1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The question of factual distinctive character is one of degree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">For common or descriptive or laudatory words, however, extensive use is unlikely to be sufficient ( British Sugar plc v James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd [1996] RPC 281 at 306 approved by Wilcox J in Ocean Spray at [24]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">It is necessary to ascertain ' the probability of ordinary persons understanding the words, in their application to the goods, as describing or indicating or calling to mind either their nature or some attribute they possess ' ( the Tub Happy Case at 195).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">32 In Clark Equipment at 514 Kitto J (citing Du Cros at 635) said that the applicant's chances of success in distinguishing its goods ' largely depend upon whether other traders are likely, in the ordinary course of their businesses and without any improper motive, to desire to use the same mark, or some mark nearly resembling it, upon or in connexion with their own goods '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Kitto J concluded at 516 that some words are ' so adapted for descriptive purposes that no amount of acquired distinctiveness can justify their registration '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is ' the common right of the public to make honest use of words forming part of the common heritage, for the sake of the signification which they ordinarily possess ' (at 514).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Other traders ought to be at liberty to use words for the sake of their ordinary meaning ( Ocean Spray at [33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Clark Equipment test does not, however, identify all circumstances in which a trade mark will not satisfy the test ( Kenman Kandy at [98] per French J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">33 An expression may not in any way be descriptive of any of the characteristics of a product but it does not necessarily follow that it is in some way distinctive of the product so as to distinguish it from the products of other traders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">On the other hand, a descriptive word may to a degree have a capacity to distinguish and be inherently adapted to distinguish because the description itself involves an unfamiliar, obsolete, unexpectedly evocative or purely emotive usage ( Austereo at [39]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">34 Care is to be taken of the precise expression the subject of the trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Unusual punctuation or grammar may set the expression apart as unidiomatic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">A word descriptive of one category of goods may not be descriptive of a different category and thereby have a capacity to distinguish with respect to that different category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">One test is whether the description is of the character of the products or services ( T.G.I.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Friday's Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday's Inc [2000] FCA 720 ; (2000) 100 FCR 358 at [62] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">If not apt for normal description and not likely to be required by other traders in the normal course of trade and capable of distinguishing the goods nominated, the trade mark may be registered ( Effem Foods Pty Ltd v Unilever Plc (2000) 50 IPR 627 at 633).</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">35 Evidence of use does not assist in the consideration of inherent capacity or adaptability of the expression to distinguish or become distinctive ( Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks [1959] HCA 69 ; (1959) 102 CLR 650 at 658).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Evidence of use is relevant only to the question of whether the mark possessed the required capability at the priority date ( Austereo at [33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Evidence that a particular expression has assumed a secondary and distinctive meaning after registration may afford some indication that, initially, the expression had a capacity to become distinctive but as the High Court noted in Samuel Taylor at 657, use in combination with another trade mark makes it ' difficult to see how the critical words could have acquired a distinctiveness of their own '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">36 Even where extensive use is relied upon, care must be taken before concluding that substantial use has displaced the common meaning and has come to denote the mark of a particular trader, particularly where it has been used in conjunction with a trade mark ( British Sugar at 302).</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The evidence should establish that the proposed trade mark is a reliable badge of trade origin on its own and covers the full range of goods covered by the registration ( British Sugar at 303).</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Examples in Australia and other jurisdiction 
 
37 In Austereo the words "sounds different", the proposed trade mark, had been used in combination with one of more Nova trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Finn J observed that the "sounds different" formula when considered severally is made up of descriptive words that are commonplace in industry usage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The composite formula while not entirely devoid of inherent adaptation to distinguish, was ' by no means sufficiently adapted to distinguish as to justify its being characterised as, of itself, being inherently adapted to distinguish ' (at [48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Finn J rejected the submission that the words were an indirect evocative reference to an aspect of Nova's radio broadcasts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">38 In Top Heavy Pty Ltd v Killin (1996) 34 IPR 282, Lehane J considered the use of "Chill Out" as a trade mark in connection with Coca-Cola.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">His Honour drew a distinction between the Tub Happy Case where the phrase "Tub Happy" was held to have no particular meaning and was registrable and "Chill Out" which has a meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The question in Top Heavy was whether use on T-shirts indicated a trade origin rather than, or at least as well as, conveying some other message to the reader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">His Honour observed that the question often arises as to whether a claimed trade mark is capable of being read as descriptive but that is not necessarily the question in all cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">There was no evidence that the phrase had acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Lehane J concluded that the message was an exhortation to the reader, reinforced by certain images and an advertising message that Coca-Cola was a suitable medium or accompaniment of relaxation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It was not a message about trade origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">39 Some assistance can be gained from other jurisdictions where capacity to distinguish is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">The United Kingdom Trade Marks Act 1994 s 3(1)(b) ---(d) provides that trade marks which are ' devoid of any distinctive character ' cannot be registered, such as words that are purely laudatory or descriptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">40 HAVE A BREAK...HAVE A KIT KAT and HAVE A KIT KAT are registered trade marks in the United Kingdom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Nestl&eacute; sought to register HAVE A BREAK.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The Court of Appeal found that HAVE A BREAK lacked inherent distinctiveness and approved the hearing officer's conclusion that the mark would be ' understood by consumers as an origin neutral invitation to consume a snack ' ( Nestl&eacute; SA's Trade Mark application (Have a Break) [2004] FSR 2 at 23).</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">41 Robin Jacob QC in I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOGURT Trade Mark [1992] 109 RPC 533 considered whether that phrase was one used or proposed to be used for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade between the yoghurt and the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">He drew a distinction at 537, as in the Have a break case , between a phrase that is no more than an exhortation to buy, a phrase used ' purely in an advertising sense and not in a trade mark sense at all ' and, for example, a trader's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">He noted that in between there may be phrases which serve both functions, that is branding and as an advertising slogan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In those circumstances, intended use is relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Use of the slogan with another trade mark may indicate the mere advertising extreme but not necessarily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">If used with no other name, it is more likely to be a true trade mark as there is no other indication of source of the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Such was the case with "I can't believe it's yogurt" and that was sufficient for Mr Jacob to conclude that the public would take the phrase as the brand name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">He also concluded that there would be no interference with other traders in yoghurt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">42 An applicant sought to register "Cycling IS..." in relation to "clothing, footwear and headgear" and "advertising, all relating to the cycling industry" ( "Cycling IS..." Trade Mark Applications [2002] 37 RPC 729).</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">There was no claim to distinctiveness through use prior to the date of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">At [32] Geoffrey Hobbs QC observed:
 
 'There is a degree of foreseeability in the conclusion that a syntactically unusual juxtaposition of words in the nature of a lexical invention would not be understood purely descriptively by the relevant class of persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">There is likewise a degree of foreseeability in the opposite conclusion that a sign or indication would simply be perceived by such persons as a new form of description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The latter conclusion points to unregistrability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">' 
 

"Cycling IS..." includes, of course, the reference to cycling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">There, as in GO ON..., '[t] he ellipsis visibly (and when represented audibly by a pause) invites people to add meaning to the words ' (at [62]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The balance for registration purposes was, in Mr Hobbs' opinion at 745, on one hand the fact that the sign is ' cryptic to a degree which makes it more likely than not that they would carry connotations of trade origin ' and, on the other, that it is ' visually and linguistically meaningful in a way which is more likely than not to relate the goods and services to the activity of cycling without also serving to identify trade origin '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">He recognised at [72] that the treatment of the words was not unconventional and concluded at [73] in refusing registration, that the sign identified cycling for marketing purposes, which other bicycle retailers might wish to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">43 The European Court at First Instance considered "LOOKS LIKE GRASS...FEELS LIKE GRASS...PLAYS LIKE GRASS" in Fieldturf Inc v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market Case [2004] EUECJ T-216/02 and stated at [25]:
 
 'Registration of a trade mark which consists of signs or indications which are also used as advertising slogans, indications of quality or incitements to purchase the goods or services covered by that mark is not excluded as such by virtue of such use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">However, a sign which, like an advertising slogan, fulfils functions other than that of a trade mark is distinctive...only if it may be perceived immediately as an indication of the commercial origin of the goods or services in question, so as to enable the relevant public to distinguish, without any possibility of confusion, the goods or services of the owner of the mark from those of a difference commercial origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 

The trade mark was held at [29] to possess the necessary ' minimum of distinctiveness ' but was also held merely to concern the properties of the goods, which describe the goods and do not immediately indicate their commercial origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">44 In the United States under the Lanham Act SS 67.763, slogans can be registered on the Supplemental Register even if they possess some descriptive meaning, as long as they possess some degree of distinctiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The trade mark "NO WORK...NO WASTE...GOOD TASTE" was held to be registrable for instant coffee because it possessed a degree of distinctiveness and ingenuity in phraseology as applied to the goods and so could distinguish them ( re Hills Bros. Coffee Inc, 120 USPQ 537).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">In considering whether "MORE GUN FOR THE MONEY" could be registered in re O F Mossberg &amp; Sons Inc, 175 USPQ 191, it was held that this was ' a merely informational phrase...completely void of imagination ' which tells the purchaser that guns are being sold for less money than those of competitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The Court was of the view that a laudatory expression ' must have some degree of ingenuity or say something in a slightly different way from that expected to be said about a product '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">In re Carvel Corporation, 223 USPQ 65, PO TM TAppBd, 1984, "AMERICA'S FRESHEST ICE CREAM" was not found to have any extra element or different twist or to consist of an unusual combination of words to enable the slogan to qualify for Supplemental Register registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">"THE BEST BEER IN AMERICA" was held to be unregistrable because it was ' so highly laudatory and descriptive as to be incapable of acquiring distinctiveness as trademark ' ( re Boston Beer Co., 198 F3d 1370 (Fed.</sentence>

<sentence id="s156">2001), 59 USPQ2d 1161 it was held by the Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit that "BOSS" did not qualify as a trademarked slogan because it merely reminded consumers of the brand, and a slogan must be something other than a house mark or product mark which provides such reminder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Consideration 
 
45 Expressions that are purely emotive may have an inherent adaptation to distinguish ( Wella AG v Registrar of Trade Marks (1996) 33 IPR 374 per Lehane J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">One question is whether the mark is free of associations or significations that prevent its inherent adaptation ( Kenman Kandy at [146] --- [146] per Stone J with whom French J agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">46 "Go on" is used and has been used as an exhortation by other traders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">There was evidence of use by other traders of "Go on...indulge" or "Go on indulge" or "Go on --- indulge" or "Go on, indulge yourself!</sentence>

<sentence id="s164">That is, there were examples of use, after the application date, of variants of "Go on..." or "Go on" followed by a pause indicated by a comma or a dash, by a variety of traders for a variety of "indulgent" goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Those uses were sometimes closely associated with other trade marks and sometimes used in descriptive passages removed from the trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">47 Unilever prepared a schedule of extensive uses of "Go on" by other traders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Examples included; "Go on...give one a try" and "Go on, treat yourself today" (Kentucky Fried Chicken); "Go on...spoil yourself!</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">" (Happy Snax and the AIDS Trust of Australia); "Go on...give in to temptation" (News Magazines Pty Limited's Donna Hay Magazine); "Go on...take it all off!</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">" (the Leukaemia Foundation of Australia).</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">There was also an audio example of Ernie Dingo for the National Tourism Initiative urging customers to "go on", try the promoted holiday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">48 Whenever "Go on" is used, the context is almost invariably connected with what may be called an indulgence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">That is the way in which Nestl&eacute; has used "Go on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It is a common expression and may be an exhortation that other traders would wish to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Examples of use by other traders of "Go on" (without the ellipsis) indicated non-distinctive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">49 "Go on" is not an expression that was invented by Nestl&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the relevant definition of "go on" is ' continue, persevere '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">In the Macquarie Dictionary ( Macquarie Dictionary , 3 rd edn &amp; rev, Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, Sydney, 2003 (1981)), it is ' to go ahead; proceed; continue '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">It is and was prior to the registration date a commonly used expression in connection with a range of goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It was generally used in connection with goods seen to be indulgent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">50 Other examples of use, prior to the date of registration included: "Go on, dare to try it" by Dairy Farmers in Australia on radio (23 February 1998) to promote flavoured milk; Ernie Dingo on radio, "Go on [pause] get out there [pause] see Australia" (21 November 2000, 28 March 2001 and 5 April 2001).</sentence>

<sentence id="s184">51 As in Top Heavy , GO ON... is part of an exhortation to try the product and no more likely to be taken as distinguishing the goods than "indulge" or "treat yourself".</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The phrase "Go on" is a common English expression that other traders, without improper motive, would want to use in respect of their own goods for the signification the expression ordinarily possesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">52 As Finn J said in Austereo at [48], the expression is not sufficiently adapted to distinguish Nestl&eacute;'s goods as to justify it being characterised as, of itself, being inherently adapted to distinguish; ' it cannot "do the job" of distinguishing entirely on its own '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Subsequent use in conjunction with Nestl&eacute; and other Nestl&eacute; trade marks may have resulted in a capability to distinguish but that is, as it was in Austereo , insufficient to support an inference that the required capability existed at the priority date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">53 The decision in Cycling IS... is apposite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">There was, as here, no claim to distinctiveness through prior use and the use of the expression was not unconventional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">As in Top Heavy, there is no evidence that the phrase had acquired a secondary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">The expression is not a lexical invention and is an expression that others marketing indulgent products, like ice cream, might wish to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">As Mr Hobbs concluded in Cycling IS... , neither the nature of the expression nor its presentation are sufficiently striking to function as an indication of trade origin in relation to the specified goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">54 The issue is not whether the trade mark is ' adapted to acquire distinctiveness ' but rather ' is the trade mark instantly adapted to distinguish the proprietor's goods in his future trade?</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">' ( Thomson v B Seppelt &amp; Sons Ltd [1925] HCA 40 ; (1925) 37 CLR 305 at 312 per Isaacs J as discussed in Oxford University Press v Registrar of Trade Marks (1990) 17 IPR 509 at 525 and Blount at 61).</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Section 41 of the Act is concerned with capacity to distinguish and the extent of that capacity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">This was, as pointed out in Oxford (by Lockhart J at 514 and by Gummow J at 522---3), the approach taken by the High Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Muller [1980] HCA 35 ; (1980) 144 CLR 37 at 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The distinction made was between "inherently adapted so to distinguish"; "adapted to distinguish" by reason of a combination of inherent adaptation and use or other circumstances; and "capable of becoming distinctive", becoming "adapted to distinguish" by reason of extensive use or other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">55 An inherent capacity to distinguish should exist as an intrinsic characteristic of the mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It is not the same as acquired distinctiveness achieved through advertising and actual use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">That is dealt with in s 41(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">56 In British Sugar , Jacob J at 306 said, with respect to "devoid of any distinctive character", that ' the phrase requires consideration of the mark on its own, assuming no use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Is it the sort of word (or other sign) which cannot do the job of distinguishing without first educating the public that it is a trade mark?</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Stone J in Kenman Kandy at [145] observed that signs which are descriptive of the character or quality of the relevant goods cannot be inherently distinctive because the words have significations or associations that invite confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">It is the absence of association and signification that accounts for signs and invented words being found to be inherently adapted to distinguish a trader's product (at [146]---[148]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The ' concept is negative not positive '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">57 This is not a case where, to paraphrase Kitto J in Clark Equipment at 513, a mark that seems unadapted for the purpose of signifying trade origin has come by actual use or special circumstances to be so closely associated with Nestl&eacute;'s goods in the mind of the public that its apparently disqualifying signification is effectually obscured and distinctiveness in fact achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">In such a case, the extent of inherent lack of adaptation is weighed against the degree of acquired distinctiveness in determining the question whether the mark is registrable as being adapted to distinguish the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The question also arises whether other persons are likely to want to use the mark, legitimately, in connection with goods for the sake of the signification that the words ordinarily possess.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">If the words of the trade mark fall into that latter category, the mark will not be adapted to distinguish although it may be distinctive as a common law mark ( Oxford at 525).</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">58 In TGI Friday's , the Full Court at 368 distinguished between the expressions "TGI Friday" and "Thank God It's Friday", the latter being an expression regularly used in relation to and expressing notions of relaxation and refreshment (and, it can be deduced, not inherently adapted) and TGI Friday's which is not idiomatic English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The presence of the apostrophe to indicate the possessive form of Friday, Friday's, was sufficient to ' give the mark inherent distinctiveness '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Nestl&eacute; submits that the ellipsis in the trade mark is similarly sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Nestl&eacute; submits that, in determining capacity to distinguish, expressions such as "Go On...", "Go On ---", and "Go On" with no punctuation following, are separate and no notice should be taken of the desire of traders to use forms that differed from the trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Similarly, it submits, use for different and well separated classes of goods should be disregarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">59 Does the punctuation make a difference?</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Nestl&eacute; has used the ellipsis to create a pause in anticipation of the action the reader is being exhorted to undertake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The variants of "Go on" used by other traders prior to the registration date, frequently used punctuation such as a comma, a dash or an ellipsis following the words to indicate a pause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In each such case, with one exception, there was a punctuation mark or indication of a pause after the "go on", the same pause indicated by "...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">There were numerous examples in evidence of use after the registration date of "go on" with different punctuation devices to indicate a pause including an advertisement for a Donna Hay Magazine, "go on...give in to temptation" that prompted a letter from Nestl&eacute;'s solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">No distinction can be drawn aurally with the punctuation device of an ellipsis, a comma or a dash.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">For example, GO ON..., "Go On" and "Go On (pause)" are common English expressions that other traders would be likely, without improper motive to desire to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">60 Continued registration of the trade mark would limit the rights of Unilever and other traders to use the phrase "Go on".</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">It may also limit their right to use "Go on" with other punctuation that indicates a pause, as does an ellipsis, without fear of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">In this respect, aural representations of the trade mark in television or radio advertisements are relevant and the different devices indicate the same pause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Potential infringement by a mark substantially identical or deceptively similar to the trade mark is relevant to a consideration of inherent adaptation to distinguish ( Kenman Kandy at [95] per Lindgren J and at 161 per Stone J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">61 The ellipsis does not provide a source of distinction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">TGI Friday's does not stand for the general proposition that all grammatical differences are significant or sufficient to provide an inherent adaptation to distinguish ( Bayer Pharma Pty Ltd v Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft [1960] HCA 35 ; (1965) 120 CLR 285), let alone where different forms of punctuation convey the same pause without a different meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">62 An ellipsis indicates an ' omission from a sentence of a word or words which would complete or clarify the construction '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The three dots do not indicate words necessary for an understanding of the phrase but simply make the complete syntactical construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">In Cycling Is... reference was made at [7] to an extract from "Mind The Stop.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">A Brief Guide to Punctuation with a Note on Proof-Correction" by G V Carey which noted that ' " [t] hree full-stops in combination are used to mark the point where words are omitted in a quotation" and " [t] his symbol is also occasionally convenient in ordinary narration when something is left for the reader's imagination to supply" '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">63 The use of the ellipsis in GO ON... could be an indication that additional words or phrases are needed to complete the sentence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Those words may be supplied or used so that the missing words are to be completed by the reader/listener.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">This is in contrast, for example, to the expression "Go on!</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">" which has a different meaning, ' an exclamation of astonishment verging on disbelief ' (Macquarie Dictionary) and does not suggest the addition of words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">64 It is not suggested that the capital letters provide a source of distinctiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">65 The expression "GO ON..." is commonly understood, and would have been commonly understood as at the date of registration, as being the first part of a two part exhortation, linked by a "pause".</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Moreover, that interpretation accords with the Nestl&eacute;'s intended meaning of those words and that punctuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The use of one part of a phrase with variations does not necessarily render the constant part, GO ON... incapable of being a trade mark alone rather than as a composite phrase ( cf blank space undertakings DR Shanahan, Australian Law of Trade Mark and Passing Off , 3rd edn, LBC (2003) at [10.35] --- [10.40]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">66 Nestl&eacute; relies upon the availability of a multiplicity of tag lines to support the capacity of GO ON... to distinguish the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The second part of the expression, for which registration is not sought, is not defined or limited and could include, for example, "try it" or "buy this" as well as "indulge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The fact that the possible tag lines are not limited and that, as the evidence demonstrates, different tag lines have been used by other traders with a variety of goods, argues against such support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">If the registered trade mark were, for example, "Go On...Indulge" or "Go On...Have a Drumstick" or "Go On...Go Fruity", each of which are used by Nestl&eacute;, it could be said that there was a greater extent to which each mark was inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">However, they are not the registered marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Conclusion on inherent adaptation to distinguish 
 
67 The fact that a word or expression is emotive does not preclude registrability ( the Tub Happy Case; Wella; Kenman Kandy ) but there should be no association or signification which prevents it from being inherently adapted to distinguish ( Kenman Kandy at [155]), such as currency in ordinary usage and an accepted meaning ( Wella at 376), even if the mark says nothing tangible about the character of the goods to which it was to be applied ( Wella at 377).</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">GO ON... does not directly refer to the character or quality of the designated goods but it does have an association or connotation with goods of an indulgent nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">68 GO ON... is a common expression which was to be used and has been used by Nestl&eacute;, as it has commonly been used by traders, as an exhortation to indulge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">There is no adaptation of the expression itself or the context of its use to change that common expression into a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The context of use was for a class of goods, an indulgence, with which the expression was commonly associated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">The tag lines which were always to follow reinforced that context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The proposed reduction in the class of goods for which the trade mark is registered does not affect that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">69 The ellipsis indicates a pause or a "lead in" to the tag line to follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">That punctuation is not sufficient to adapt the expression so that it had a capacity to distinguish Nestl&eacute;'s ice creams as at the date of registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">70 It follows that GO ON... is not inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Nestl&eacute;'s intended use of GO ON... 
 
71 If the trade mark is, to some extent inherently adapted to distinguish the designated or proposed designated goods, and had a capacity to distinguish the goods, Nestl&eacute;'s intended use of the trade mark becomes relevant (s 41(5)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">The case was argued on that alternative basis, so I will deal with the intended use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">72 The application for registration is prima facie evidence of an intention to use ( Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co. [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 403).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Nestl&eacute; checked the availability of the trade mark and rejected a first choice because of perceived difficulties with registrability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">73 Unilever does not dispute that, as at the date of registration, Nestl&eacute; intended to use GO ON... but contends that such use was not trade mark use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Nestl&eacute; does not suggest that its intention was to use the mark other than as set forth in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">74 Unilever contends that the requisite intention on the part of Nestl&eacute;, to use the mark as a trade mark as at the registration date in relation to the goods in class 30 (or the proposed narrower class), was absent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Unilever has the onus of demonstrating the absence of intention but submits that inferences should be drawn, from the absence of evidence from Nestl&eacute;, specifically evidence of an appropriate officer of Nestl&eacute; and the absence of the complete authorised user agreement, as to its actual intention or its intention to use of GO ON... as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">75 A Nestl&eacute; document entitled the "Call to Action" ('CTA'), which predated the date of registration, detailed plans for the use of GO ON....</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The totality of the evidence presented by Nestl&eacute; indicated that the intended use of GO ON... was as set forth in the CTA and the "Visibility Strategy", which accompanied the CTA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">GO ON... was not designed to stand alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Nestl&eacute; submits that individual usage should not be considered in isolation because Nestl&eacute;'s campaign of planned use shows that the consistent and dominant branding element was to be GO ON.... Nestl&eacute;'s intention was to use GO ON... as an exhortation to use its products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The intended use was always in conjunction with an open-ended series of tag lines, with additional words such as "Treat Yourself" or "Indulge" or "Have a Drumstick", to convey a second message.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">76 Nestl&eacute;'s evidence includes details of the strategy for, promotion of and adoption of GO ON... in connection with Peters ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">This was to enable the requisite distinctiveness of GO ON... to develop, particularly by ' its association with Nestl&eacute; as the trade source of the goods in the Nestl&eacute; ice cream range '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">GO ON... was to be and was used in close association with ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">It was to be and was used as part of an exhortation such as "Go on...Treat Yourself!".</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">In some cases the tag line, such as "Treat Yourself!</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">", took prominence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">In others there was emphasis on the GO ON... rather than on the completing phrase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In many of the examples GO ON... was in close proximity to the completing phrase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">77 GO ON... was an element of the "Blue Water" or "Project Blue" campaign (the terms are used interchangeably) for the marketing of Nestl&eacute; Ice Cream worldwide and an important element of the development of several product brands within the parent NESTL&Eacute; PETERS brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">GO ON... was to be applied consistently using the same font, similar angle, blue background, a photograph of a person or persons eating ice cream and the Nestl&eacute; Peters brand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The "Visibility Strategy" referred to three phrases associated with ice cream: "GO ON...indulge!</sentence>

<sentence id="s336">Specifically, GO ON... was envisaged as a ' call to action for Nestl&eacute; Ice Cream (NIC), not individual product brands '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The CTA recorded that it was ' not intended for, and should not be used as a brand signature of Nestl&eacute; Ice Cream ' (emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The stated intention was that, by consistent use over time, GO ON... would become a ' recognisable property of the Nestl&eacute; Ice Cream brand ' and Nestl&eacute; did seek trade mark protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">83 The intended use of GO ON... was for its ordinary signification as a persuasive phrase, as a "call to action" and not as a brand signature for Nestl&eacute; ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">84 Unilever contends that the only possibility envisaged for the use of the trade mark was as a composite mark and that Nestl&eacute;'s intended use of, for example, "GO ON...Indulge" or "GO ON...Grab a Drumstick" could not be regarded as a use of GO ON.... Composite marks have been recognised, such as WOOLWORTHS METRO ( Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCA 1020 ; (1999) 45 IPR 411), BUDEJOVICK[yacute] BUDVAR ( Anheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovick[yacute] Budvar, N&aacute;rodn&igrave; Podnik (2002) 56 IPR 182), FUN SHIP and FAIRSTAR the FUNSHIP ( Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Ltd (1994) 120 ALR 495).</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">85 GO ON... was not designed to stand alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">The tag lines were variable, non-distinctive matter that may be market specific.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">However, the intention was that GO ON... would be the constant and characteristic expression used in connection with Nestl&eacute; ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Two trade marks can be used together and still remain separate, rather than represent a composite mark ( Wellness Pty Ltd v Pro Bio Living Waters Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 242 at [22]---[28]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">The intended use, if it was trade mark use, was not of a composite mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">Was the intended use of GO ON... use as a trade mark?</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">
 
86 Unilever accepts the onus to demonstrate that Nestl&eacute; did not have an intention to use GO ON... as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The intention is to be determined as at the date of registration ( Nikken Wellness Pty Ltd v van Voorst [2003] FCA 816 at [59] --- [61].</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">87 Use must be use in the course of trade to distinguish one trader's goods from another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">It is ' use of the mark in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connexion in the course of trade between the goods with respect to which the mark is used and that person ' ( Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [1984] HCA 73 ; (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 432).</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Accepting that Nestl&eacute;'s intention was to use the registered mark, did Nestle intend to use it for the purpose of distinguishing those goods from the goods of other traders ( Johnson &amp; Johnson at 351), for the purpose indicating that the goods are those of Nestl&eacute; and not for another purpose ( In the Matter of an Application for Registration of a Trade Mark by Magdalena Securities (1931) 48 RPC 477 at 488-490)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">88 The registered trade mark is GO ON..., not "GO ON...Enjoy Ice Cream" or "GO ON...Treat Yourself" or any other variation that may be added to the registered trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Unilever contends that there was no intention to use GO ON... as a trade mark but only ever as an exhortation, rather than for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade with Nestl&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">89 Was GO ON... intended to be used to indicate the origin of the goods with which it was associated?</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The context of use and the way it has been displayed in relation to the goods and in advertisements is relevant to infringement ( Johnson &amp; Johnson at 347) and also to use as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">The way that GO ON... has been positioned in the advertisements in relation to distinguishing words (trade marks) and non-distinguishing words (emotive phrases) is relevant to the determination of whether GO ON... was intended to distinguish the designated goods as being those of Nestl&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">90 Other evidence of use by Nestl&eacute; demonstrated:
 
 &#8226; On at least one occasion, the use was "Go On...Enjoy Ice Cream!</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">": associated with not only the Nestl&eacute; and Peters trade marks but also Bulla and Streets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">&#8226; The copy-line on the advertisements was intended to ' empower and invite ' with the background showing the ' corporate identity, ie swimming pool and corp. logo '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">&#8226; In advertisements from other countries, such as Thailand, a two line expression is used, in the language of that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">The pictorial concept is similar to that in Australia and the Nestl&eacute; brand is included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">The exact translation is not generally provided, except for Israel where the expression is "go for licking it".</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">In South Africa, "Go On..." is used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">

91 Unilever also applied itself for registration of the mark GO ON.... Nestl&eacute; submits that Unilever's adoption of its GO ON... campaign and its application for a trade mark is an indication that the phrase can be used as a trade mark and that it was not necessarily devoid of any distinctive character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">Evidence of use by Unilever demonstrated:
 
 &#8226; "Go on...treat yourself" in association with the Streets logo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">&#8226; In a TV script it is written as "Go On, treat yourself".</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">&#8226; Placement of GO ON... by Streets in a way that co-ordinated the colouring and typeface with its Streets Blue Ribbon ice-cream branding elements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">&#8226; T-shirts were suggested, designed with "Go on...treat yourself" on the front, with the Streets brand only on the back but, as produced, the Streets logo and "Blue Ribbon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">The Cream of Ice Creams" were also on the front below the slogan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">


 
92 Use of a trade mark with another word or as a composite mark does not preclude use of that trade mark as a trade mark, as long as the trade mark does not lose its identity and remains recognisable ( Canada (Registrar of Trade Marks) v Cie internationale pour L'informatique CII Honeywell Bull, SA I [1985] 2 FC 766).</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The question is whether a purchaser would be likely to infer that, with the different forms of use, the identified goods had the same origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">93 A trade mark which is clearly inherently adapted to distinguish is unlikely to be affected by additional material in its ability to distinguish (DR Shanahan, Australian Law of Trade Mark and Passing Off , 3rd edn, LBC (2003) at [10.35]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">GO ON... is not such a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">94 While the intended use was of the constant, GO ON..., the different tag lines may have an effect on the distinctiveness of the mark as no single complete exhortation was intended to be in constant use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Even if GO ON... had a degree of inherent adaptation to distinguish or acquired some distinctiveness by association with other Nestl&eacute; marks, the intended use as part of a two part expression with a multiplicity of tag lines would reduce the capacity of the trade mark in those different expressions to distinguish the goods as those of Nestl&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Further, use in connection with a clear trade mark such as NESTL&Eacute; or PETERS detracts from a conclusion of acquisition of distinctiveness ( British Sugar at 303; Austereo at [51] to [52]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">95 A reader of GO ON... or a listener of "Go on" followed by a pause, the consumer of the trade mark as used, would not infer, as at the application date, that those words, used alone or together with the additions such as "treat yourself" or "indulge" would make the link with Nestl&eacute;.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">96 Nestl&eacute; envisaged that GO ON... would be standardised and ' become an ownable property '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">The intention was to use GO ON... as at the registration date as a marketing tool but not as a badge of origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">Nestl&eacute;'s intention was to use GO ON... in a way that the expression may, over time, become a trade mark, a badge of origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Despite evidence of the extensive use of "go on", there is no evidence of a particular association of those words as at the application date with Nestl&eacute; or any other particular trader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The intention was that, by association with the NESTL&Eacute; PETERS trade mark, the expression would acquire distinctiveness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">That would, presumably, come about as a result of extensive, marketing and advertising in connection with Nestl&eacute;'s goods, so that the exhortation comes to distinguish those goods and denote their origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">That, however, comes within the rubric of s 41(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">97 Use in connection with another trade mark does not preclude trade mark use ( Wellness ; Chris-Telle Pty Ltd v Australian Swimming Inc (2005) 64 IPR 110).</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">However, the intended use as recorded in the CTA was not a use of the trade mark to indicate, of itself, a connection with Nestl&eacute; or to denote the origin of the ice cream.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">One use, "Go On...Enjoy Ice Cream!</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">" is not associated with any brand and indicates that the use was, as in I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOGURT , no more than an exhortation to buy some innominate ice cream, rather than as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">98 Nestl&eacute; did not intend to use GO ON... as a badge of origin for Nestl&eacute; Peters ice creams as at the registration date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">CONCLUSION 
 
99 GO ON... is not inherently adapted to distinguish the goods in respect of which it is registered or the class of goods for which registration was proposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The trade mark is not capable of distinguishing the designated goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">There was no use of the trade mark before the filing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Even if GO ON... were to some extent inherently adapted to distinguish the designated goods, the intended use of GO ON... by Nestl&eacute; was not use as a trade mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">It follows that GO ON... should not remain registered as a trade mark.</sentence>
