<sentence id="s1">On 11 May 2006 the first respondent gave discovery on behalf of himself and the second to fifth respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 On 7 May 2007 the applicant's solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the first to fifth respondents asking that they swear a separate affidavit of discovery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They also sought discovery of particular Austrade documents, copies of which had already been provided informally.</sentence>

<sentence id="s5">However, by a letter dated 22 May 2007 they enclosed a document entitled "Fourth Respondent's Further List of Documents".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The solicitors for the applicant complained that they did not know which of the documents referred to in the respondents' discovery list related to which respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Nor did they know whether the fourth respondent's further list of documents were additional documents in the possession of the fourth respondent over and above the documents set out in the earlier affidavit sworn on behalf of all respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">By their letter dated 22 May 2007 the applicant's solicitor sought particular discovery of various documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The solicitors for the respondents replied on 1 June 2007 rejecting the request in various of the classes of specified documents and conceding others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 On 28 June 2007 the applicant filed a motion seeking discovery by each of the first, second, fourth and fifth respondents separately and particular discovery of specified documents or classes of documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">They also sought leave to further amend the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 On 10 July 2007 I made orders on the motion giving leave to the applicant to amend its statement of claim in terms of the minute filed with the motion and giving the respondents leave to file amended defences by 31 July 2007.</sentence>

<sentence id="s20">7 I make the following rulings in relation to each of the documents or classes of documents sought by the applicant having regard to the provisions of O 15 r 8.</sentence>
