 3 The applicant arrived in Australia on 5 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Against these background circumstances there are four grounds on which review is sought of the reasoning of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Leave was granted at the hearing of the application for these to replace those grounds outlined in the original application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It is convenient to address the content of the reasons as appropriate in connection with each of those grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">GROUND 1: CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY 
 
4 The first ground is that the Tribunal was in jurisdictional error because it failed to ask the right question in relation to the issue of the applicant's conversion to Christianity and rather took into account his perceived subsequent failures as a Christian in considering his claimed conversion at 11 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">5 The Tribunal's reasoning appears in the following paragraphs:
 
 'The applicant claimed that he converted to Christianity at 11 years of age.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">As a result he was outcast by his family and they threatened to kill him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The applicant in his evidence to the Tribunal did not even have a rudimentary knowledge of the basic tenets of Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">He did not know the significance of Easter or what that event entailed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">He did not know why Jesus was important to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">He appeared to be ignorant of the very basis of Christian beliefs namely that Jesus died at Easter time so that Christians could have everlasting life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Tribunal accepts that it must judge the applicant's credibility and assess his evidence with an appreciation of the fact that he was only 11 years old at the time he converted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">However, the applicant is now 17; he has had 6 years to pursue his conversion to Christianity and to grasp some of the basic tenets of the religion and yet has not done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It is clear that when he lived in South Africa and he had the opportunity to attend church and learn more about Christianity, he did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Further, his evidence to the Tribunal was that in Australia he had attended church on one occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">He did not have a bible and the reasons he gave for failing to obtain a bible in Australia were not logical or reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The only reason the applicant could provide for preferring Christianity to Islam was not based on any assessment of the tenets or beliefs of the religion; it was rather the ease of the practise of that religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He felt that as being a Christian you only had to go to church once a week, it was far less onerous than the religious observance required by a Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal notes the applicant's claim that he gave up his family life, his education and all that was dear to him because of his conversion to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Tribunal would have expected, if this was the case, that he would have had a deeper understanding of the religion and over the years taken some steps to acquaint himself with the tenets of the faith and beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 The Tribunal finds the account of the applicant's reasons for his conversion, the situation around his conversion and events that had happened quite unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Although the Tribunal accepts that although he was only 11 or 12 years old at this time, it was a momentous occasion and step in his life, which had huge ramifications and the Tribunal would have expected his account of his discussions with his father, his family and his community to be significant and something he could provide details of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His account of seeking protection from the authorities was vague and he appeared to change his evidence when confronted with new details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">For all these reasons the Tribunal does not accept that it was his religious beliefs or tenets that caused him to leave [his country].</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Tribunal does not accept that it was his family's or village's response to his religious beliefs that caused him to leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a convert to Christianity at most he has ceased being a practising Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">' 

6 The Tribunal then considered whether there might be a perception by society and the applicant's family that he was converting to Christianity which would lead to a real chance of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Its reasoning was as follows:
 
 'As discussed with the applicant's advisors at the hearing, the Tribunal must not only look at whether the applicant is a practising Christian or a Christian at all, but also at the society's and family's perception of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The Tribunal must consider whether there was a perception that he was converting to Christianity which would lead to a real chance of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">
 
 The applicant had claimed that when he returned to his village he was chased from his village and his brother fired an arrow at him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">His later evidence has been that he is unsure who fired an arrow at him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">There appears to be a basic inconsistency in the applicant's claim that his family cast him out, told him he was no longer their son and refused to have anything to do with him and yet wanted to pursue him in a separate country to try hundreds of kilometres away and harm him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Further, the Tribunal has found that the applicant did not have the religious conviction that would led [sic] him to either make sacrifices or to stand up to this sort of pressure from his family and community in order to protect these beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This is particularly so as an 11 or 12 year old boy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's family or anyone else from the applicant's village tried to harm him because he told them he was converting to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The Tribunal refers to the letter from Ms Lonely [a Department for Community Development psychologist] and is not persuaded by this letter that his family intended to harm him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Her statement that physical verbal and emotional abuse in his family life was an ongoing occurrence is not consistent with his claims of his family suddenly turning on him a month before he left [his country].</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Consequently the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's brother threatened him over the phone or that the applicant's family told his friend Jay that they were still seeking to harm him and would pursue him to South Africa and harm him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The Tribunal does not accept that there is a real chance that he would be harmed by his family or anyone from his village for any perception that he may have converted to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">' 

7 Counsel for the applicant contends that although the Tribunal stated in its reasons that it must assess the applicant's credibility in light of the fact that he was only 11 years old, it did not do that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">It is submitted that the Tribunal considered the applicant's claims through the filter of what the Tribunal thought were appropriate understandings and beliefs for a Christian to have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The applicant submits that the Tribunal's views as to matters which (arguably) constituted some norm for Christians were irrelevant to the question of whether the applicant did convert when 11 years old.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Therefore, it is said, the Tribunal failed to address the real issue and took into account irrelevant considerations: SCAT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 76 ALD 625 at [22]-[30] per Madgwick and Conti JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">8 The respondents' submissions usefully summarise what was relied upon by the Tribunal in these paragraphs as follows:
 
 (a) The applicant had no rudimentary knowledge of Christianity's basic tenets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">While the applicant converted at 11 or 12 years he is now 17 years and has had 6 years to pursue his conversion and grasp some of the basic tenets but has not done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">He had the opportunity to do so while in South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In Australia he has attended church once and has not obtained a Bible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">The reason he gives for preferring Christianity over Islam is ease of practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">(b) Notwithstanding the significance of converting from Islam to Christianity the applicant could not provide details of 'his discussions with his father, his family and his community' at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">The applicant had recounted to the Tribunal the extent of his family's religious observance describing his father as a devout Muslim who attended the mosque every day and that his family observed Ramadan and other Muslim holidays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He claimed that he gave up his family life, his education and all that was dear to him because of his conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">(c) The applicant's account of his attempt to obtain protection from the authorities in his country was vague and appeared to change when he was confronted by new details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The applicant claimed that he went to the police in the company of an adult friend but did not tell the police that he had been shot with an arrow, claiming they would not listen to anything more once they heard it was a family matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">(d) The applicant was unsure who fired an arrow at him when he returned to his village and was chased away for a second time; he was not sure it was his brother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">(e) There was inconsistency between the claim that his family were casting him out and refused to have anything to do with him and the claim that they wanted to pursue him to South Africa and harm him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">(f) The applicant had no apparent religious conviction which would enable him as an 11 or 12 year old to protect his beliefs by making sacrifices and standing up to the pressure from family and community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">(g) The psychologist's report of ongoing occurrences of abuse in the family was not consistent with the applicant's claim that his family suddenly turned on him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The applicant's evidence was that he thought his family would accept his conversion because children of other Muslim families had done so without problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">

9 I agree with the respondents' submission that the Tribunal did not assess the applicant's claim on the basis of what the Tribunal thought was expected understandings and beliefs from a Christian convert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It was relevant in assessing the credibility of the applicant for the Tribunal to weigh up the applicant's commitment as a child to Christianity and in that regard his lack of the most basic knowledge of the Christian religion was relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">The Tribunal was entitled to look at evidence arising after the alleged fact of conversion to cast light on the existence of that fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">10 The essential point of the way the applicant presses this ground is that the Tribunal did not ask the question, being the correct one to be answered, whether it was satisfied that the applicant had converted at age 11, even if he had failed to meet the tests the Tribunal imposed of Christian conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In my view there was no failure to ask the correct question in this respect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Tribunal was entitled to take into account the ex post facto evidence, these therefore not being irrelevant considerations and it is clear that it reached the view that it was not satisfied that a conversion had taken place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">11 By way of supplementary submissions, it is submitted that the applicant may have a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of a perceived conversion to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The applicant does not take issue with the way in which the Tribunal framed the question for itself, namely, 'the Tribunal must consider whether there was a perception that he was converting to Christianity which would lead to a real chance of persecution' (see above at [6]), but states that the Tribunal did not then properly consider the question as framed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">12 It appears to be common ground that conclusive authority does not exist that decides whether the Convention 'head' of religion can include the perception of one's religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">This is contrasted with several decisions of the High Court that have held a person may face persecution for the reason of their perceived political opinion or their perceived membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">See Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 416 per Gaudron J and at 433 per McHugh J, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 570-571.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It is submitted that the High Court has not suggested that perception is conceptually sufficient or limited to one's political opinion or membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">13 The respondents refer to Wang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1599 ; (2000) 105 FCR 548, as an example where the Court has indicated, but without deciding, that the perception of one's religion could constitute persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Merkel J as part of a discussion of past and future conduct in assessing the genuineness of religious beliefs, stated at [90]:
 
 'However, as persecution can occur by reason of an imputed political or religious belief, the genuineness (or lack thereof) of a religious or political belief is not always determinative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">As was observed (at 120) by Brooke LJ in Danian [v Secretary of State for Home Department [1999] EWCA Civ 3000 ; [2000] Imm AR 96 ], referring to the decision in Bastanipour [v Immigration and Naturalization Service (1992) 980 F (2d) 1129 ]: 
 
 "In that case the court held that the central question was not whether an Iranian national's conversion (while in prison) from Islam to Christianity was sincere or genuine: rather, it was a question of how the purported conversion would be viewed by the authorities in Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">"' 

14 I accept the submissions by the respondents that the consequence of the decision of the Full Court in WAEW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 260 at [14] and [17] the religion ground in art 1A(2) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees requires a manifestation or practice of personal faith or doctrine in a like-minded community and does not extend to the perception of religious belief or imputed religious belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Consequently, it was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider the perception of conversion, it having found there was no conversion by the applicant that would invoke the religion ground in that article: see also Wang at [5]-[7], [20] and [81].</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">GROUND 2: APOSTASY 
 
15 Under this ground the applicant seeks review because of a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself the relevant question of whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of being persecuted by reason of being a child apostate of Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">16 The relevant finding of the Tribunal in this respect was that already set out above where the Tribunal stated that it found 'the applicant is not a convert to Christianity at most he has ceased being a practising Muslim'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">17 The applicant claims that this issue that is, the claim of being an apostate of Islam, was a viable claim which the Tribunal was obliged to consider as a matter of law: Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 at [36] and [39] per McHugh and Kirby JJ and SCAT at [22]-[30] per Madgwick and Conti JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">18 Similarly, it is submitted, there is an analogy with the reviewable error the Tribunal committed in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 where the Tribunal failed to deal with an important aspect of the appellant's case: see at [18], [23]-[24] and [27] per Gummow and Callinan JJ and at [49]-[50] per Kirby J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">19 The respondents' submissions point to the statement by the Tribunal, quoted above as part of the material on the issue of perception, where it stated it did not accept there was a real chance the applicant would be harmed by his family or anyone from his village 'for any perception' that he may have converted to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">20 The respondents referred to a post-Tribunal written submission from the applicant's adviser (of the Catholic Migrant Centre) that relied on two grounds which are said to be interlinked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The first was that he was a street kid and the second that he is a child apostate suffering persecution from his family for his apostasy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">I agree with the respondents that there is serious doubt whether any (new) claim of this type was made by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The reference to apostasy, in my view and read in its context, sweeps up the issue of conversion to Christianity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">21 As the reasons on the previous ground have found, the Tribunal's findings inextricably embrace consideration of the possibility that the applicant would be a 'child apostate of Islam'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">If there were any omission to directly address apostasy, it was not an omission which affected the exercise of the Tribunal's power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">This is in the context where the other findings of the Tribunal are that his country of origin is predominantly a Christian country and that there was state protection available to the applicant against non-state actors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">GROUND 3: STATE PROTECTION 
 
22 In this ground the applicant claims there is reviewable error in the failure by the Tribunal to consider whether there was appropriate state protection from harm from his parents and fellow villagers available in his village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">23 The reasoning of the Tribunal on this appears in the following paragraph:
 
 'Further, and in the alternative even if the applicant did have some localised problems from his family and local community because he was perceived to have converted to Christianity (and the Tribunal does not accept that this is the case) the information provided by the applicant's adviser sourced from SIMA [Community Based Organisation] was that there had been changes in societal attitudes in [his country] and children could now obtain protection from harm from their parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">Therefore the applicant would be able to obtain state protection from harm he feared by non state actors, his family and local community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Therefore the persecution he claimed to fear would not have an official quality and is not persecution within the meaning of the Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">' 

24 The ground of review in respect of this reasoning is particularised by reference to the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">It is said the Tribunal considered whether children were able to obtain state protection from harm from their parents generally in his country as a result of recent changes in societal attitudes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">However, it is asserted the Tribunal did not consider whether any state protection, such as it was, would extend to the applicant in his village, and, did not consider what state protection was available at all in his village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Rather, it is asserted the Tribunal concluded 'baldly' that the applicant would be able to obtain state protection from both his family and the local community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The essential contention is that the Tribunal did not address the right question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">25 The finding that there had been changes in societal attitudes in the applicant's country and that children could now obtain state protection was based on evidence provided by the applicant's advisers to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The information was that police were very ready to protect children without any fear and do not turn away from domestic violence complaints.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There was no evidence before the Tribunal that this position did not extend to the applicant's village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">26 The applicant contends that the duty to consider the particular issue arises from Appellant S395/2002 at [39] per McHugh and Kirby JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">However, the Tribunal, being firm in its view that the applicant had not converted and did not face harm from his family and community, was under no duty to examine the possibility that state protection did not extend to the applicant's village.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">This was not a case like Appellant S395/2002 where the Tribunal had failed to address the real question, saying that if the appellant acted discreetly he could avoid harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">27 The respondents also submit foreshadowing the absence of success of the fourth ground of review, that if state protection was not available in the applicant's village when the applicant returned there was evidence that protection was available elsewhere in his country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Thus, this was not a case where the applicant could not obtain protection in his own country: NAIZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 at [12] - [13] and [42].</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">GROUND 4: RELOCATION 
 
28 Here the applicant says there is reviewable error when the Tribunal concluded it was reasonable for the applicant to relocate when it had not considered, firstly, what were the practical realities facing the applicant in any relocation within his country and, secondly, whether the applicant's brother would seek to find and harm him in another part of that country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">29 The reasoning of the Tribunal relevant to this ground is as follows:
 
 'Also in the alternative, in addition the applicant's claim must fail because it would be reasonable for him to relocate to another part of [the applicant's country] in order to avoid this claimed risk of harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">[The applicant's country] is a predominantly Christian country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Country information provided by the applicant's advisers stated that Muslims make up 6% of the population (... Church Torched 1/10/2001 HRWF).</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The US Department of State International Religious Freedom Report ... 2004 stated that protestants make up 38% of the population, Roman Catholics 28% and Muslims claim to make up 15-20% of the population.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">
 
 The applicant has a number of skills that are transferable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Whilst living in South Africa he managed to learn how to cut hair, to shave people, he worked in the market unloading goods and was also able to be paid by more than one team as a soccer player.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">This suggests that the applicant has skills and could gain employment in other parts of [his country].</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">He was in constant employment in South Africa and he has indicated that he speaks English, Swahili and some Zulu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">He has skills that could be used in other parts of [his country].</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The Tribunal finds that it would be reasonable for him to relocate to avoid his claimed fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">This reinforces the Tribunal's view that there is no real chance that he would be persecuted for reasons of his religion if he was returned to [his country].</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">' 

30 I am unable to agree that the Tribunal's reasons show a failure by it to consider the 'practical realities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In my view its reasons show that it did precisely that.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">There was no evidence before the Tribunal suggesting that as a matter of practical reality relocation was unreasonable for the applicant: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 at 442-443 and NAIZ at [16], [22] and [63].</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">31 In relation to the position concerning the applicant's brother, this must be addressed in the context that the Tribunal had found that the applicant could return to the support of his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It did not accept the applicant's claims that his brother had threatened him over the telephone and intended to pursue him to South Africa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Relocation was considered by the Tribunal as an alternative if the applicant had some localised problems from his family and community because he was perceived to have converted or be converting from Islam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">CONCLUSION 
 
32 For the above reasons I consider that that the applicant is not able to make out any of the grounds of review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Consequently, the application for review must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.</sentence>
