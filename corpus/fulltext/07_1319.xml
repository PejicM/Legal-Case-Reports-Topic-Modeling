<sentence id="s48">9 I will refer to the Letter of Credit as the "Westpac letter of credit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The applicant's claim 
 
10 The following is a summary of Orrcon's claim as set out in its statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">11 Dong Bu Steel Co Limited ("Dongbu") is and was at all material times a Korean manufacturer of steel products including spiral steel pipes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">As I understand it, Dongbu's parent company is and was at all material times Daewoo International Corp ("Daewoo") of Seoul, Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">12 In October 2006 Orrcon engaged in negotiations with the State of Queensland for the supply of steel pipe by Orrcon to the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The pipe was to be used in a project to be undertaken by the State of Queensland called the "South East Queensland Water Grid Projects" ("SEQ Water Grid Projects").</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">13 In November 2006 Mr Studdy, for and on behalf of Capital Steel, engaged in negotiations with Orrcon for the supply of steel pipe by Capital Steel to Orrcon to be used in the SEQ Water Grid Projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The steel pipe was to be manufactured by Dongbu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Orrcon alleges that it had various communications with Mr Studdy and Capital Steel between 27 October 2006 and 21 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Those communications consisted of electronic messages, specifications and telephone conversations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As a whole they are referred to in Orrcon's statement of claim as "the November conduct".</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">One important aspect of the communications in the circumstances of Orrcon's claim is the reference to the yield strength (in terms of megapascals (MPa)) that the pipe was to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">14 Orrcon entered into a contract with Capital Steel "for the supply of 33,000 metres each of 960 mm and 1086 mm x 8 mm spiral steel pipe manufactured by Dongbu to AS1579 with 300 MPa yield strength and with mill test certificates".</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The communications alleged to make up the contract are set out in the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It is not necessary to set them out in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">At the time the contract was made, Capital Steel and Mr Studdy knew that the pipe to be supplied under the contract was being acquired by Orrcon for re-supply to the State of Queensland for the SEQ Water Grid Projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">15 The terms of the contract between Orrcon and Capital Steel are said to be as follows:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The price of the pipe was AUD19,337,670 (exclusive of GST).</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The pipe was to be delivered in five shipments ex-South Korea at the end of January, February, March, April and May 2007 to Port Kembla, Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Payment was to be made 120 days from the provision of clean bills of lading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Orrcon was to establish an irrevocable letter of credit for the contract price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The pipe was to comply with the specifications and, in particular, certain minimum technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">If less than 50 per cent of the pipe length formed from any heat, coil or heat treat lot complied with all requirements of the specification, Orrcon was entitled to reject all the pipe from the affected heat, coil or heat treat lot.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Pipe quality and project delivery were of the essence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 

16 As will become clear, Orrcon's right to reject pipe (term 6 [15] above) is important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">17 It is alleged by Orrcon that it was a term and condition of the contract that Capital Steel was not entitled to make a claim for payment under the letter of credit unless all of the pipe delivered complied with the specification and AS1579 in all respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Orrcon alleges that such a term and condition arises as a matter of construction from the description and specification of the pipe to be delivered and the requirement that payment was not due unless the pipe was delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">In the alternative, Orrcon alleges that such a term arises by implication and pleads the well-known factors for the implication of a contractual term (see Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited v State Rail Authority of New South Wales [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 (" Codelfa ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">18 In December 2006 and in accordance with the specification, a pre-production meeting was convened at Dongbu's manufacturing plant in Korea for the purpose of reviewing the quality plan and manufacturing procedures to be followed during production of the pipe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The meeting was attended by representatives of Capital Steel, Dongbu and Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It is said that during the meeting the representatives of Orrcon were told of certain aspects of the manufacturing process which bore upon the minimum yield strength of the pipe and that Pohang Iron and Steel Company (otherwise referred to as "Posco") was to provide the raw material, hot rolled coil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There was discussion about the minimum yield strength of similar sized water pipes manufactured by Dongbu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">There then followed communications between Capital Steel and Orrcon, and the upshot of those communications for present purposes was that Orrcon agreed to what it alleges were reduced minimum mechanical properties, the most important one of which was the proposed minimum for yield strength of the steel pipe of 270 MPa (aim 290 MPa).</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">I note that Capital Steel asserts that a figure of 250 MPa was agreed, but it accepts that question is one for trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">19 On 11 December 2006 Orrcon entered into a formal contract with the State of Queensland for the supply of pipe for the SEQ Water Grid Projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It alleges that it did so relying on the November conduct and the representations at or about the time of the pre-production meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Also relying on those matters it alleges that it instructed Westpac to issue an irrevocable import documentary credit number SD3BM872029 in the amount of AUD19,337,670 in favour of Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That was done on 21 December 2006 and the letter of credit was said to contain the following terms:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Partial shipments were permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">2. Credit was payable within 120 days from the bill of lading date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The latest date of shipment was 20 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The date of expiry was 11 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">
 
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The documents required to be presented to Westpac were a full duplicate set of clean "on board" or "shipped", negotiable marine bill of lading to order blank endorsed marked "freight pre-paid" and commercial invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The payment documents must be presented to Westpac within 21 days after issue of the transport document but within the validity of the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">
 

20 Orrcon instructed Westpac to amend the letter of credit to increase the document presentation period from 10 to 21 days and to extend the expiry date from 30 June 2007 to 11 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">21 On 22 February 2007, Orrcon sent Capital Steel a letter dated 5 February 2007 confirming the terms of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">22 Three shipments of pipe were made by Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Orrcon says the pipes delivered were defective in that they did not comply with the specification or AS1579.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The particulars of non-compliance are that the pipe did not have the reduced minimum specified mechanical properties because the yield strength of the pipe was consistently less than specified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Orrcon also alleges that the yield strength of the coils from which the pipes were manufactured were significantly variable through each coil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Details of the shipments and the invoices rendered by Capital Steel as alleged by Orrcon are as follows:
 
 First shipment :
 On about 23 February 2007, Capital Steel shipped 500 lengths of each size of the pipe from Korea and on or about 9 March 2007 Capital Steel rendered tax invoice number 2371 for AUD4,305,632.10 (including GST) to Orrcon for purported delivery of the first shipment .</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">
 Second shipment :
 On or about 14 March 2007, Capital Steel shipped 476 lengths of each size of the pipe from Korea and on or about 30 March 2007 Capital Steel rendered tax invoice number 2381 for AUD4,133,114.77 (including GST) to Orrcon for purported delivery of the second shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Third shipment :
 On or about 14 April 2007, Capital Steel shipped 501 lengths of each size of the pipe from Korea and on or about 18 April 2007 Capital Steel rendered tax invoice number 2424 for AUD4,346,689.83 (including GST) to Orrcon for purported delivery of the third shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">

23 It is alleged that Capital Steel presented documents to Westpac purporting to draw on the letter of credit for each of the three shipments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The documents consisted of invoices, packing lists, original bills of lading and mill test certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It is not necessary for me to set out the details of the documents presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">On 14 March 2007, Capital Steel presented documents to Westpac purporting to draw on the letter of credit for the first shipment and on the same day and in reliance of the authenticity of the first shipment payment documents, Westpac issued Orrcon with a schedule of term drawing under documentary credit for AUD4,334,360.25 with a maturity date for payment to Capital Steel of 25 June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">On 10 April 2007, Capital Steel presented documents to Westpac purporting to draw on the letter of credit for the second shipment and on the same day and in reliance of the authenticity of the second shipment payment documents, Westpac issued Orrcon with a schedule of term drawing under documentary credit for AUD4,133,114.77 with a maturity date for payment to Capital Steel of 12 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The maturity dates in relation to the first and second schedules were extended to 24 August and 10 September 2007 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">On 9 May 2007, Capital Steel presented documents to Westpac purporting to draw on the letter of credit for the third shipment and, on the same day, in reliance on the authenticity of the third shipment payment documents, Westpac issued Orrcon with a schedule of term drawing under documentary credit for AUD4,346,689.83 with a maturity date to Capital Steel of 11 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">24 Orrcon alleges that conduct by Capital Steel in November 2006 and at the meeting in December was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TPA").</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It alleges that Capital Steel knew or ought to have known that Dongbu intended to source its hot rolled coil from Tangshan Iron and Steel Co Limited ("Tangshan") rather than Posco.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">It alleges that the pipes delivered by Capital Steel were defective and did not comply with the specification or AS1579.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Further, or in the alternative, Orrcon alleges that the first, second and third purported drawings down on the Westpac letter of credit (or any one of them) was conduct by Capital Steel that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of s 52 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">It is unnecessary for me to set out the details of this plea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">It is sufficient to say that it relates to the accuracy of the mill test certificates in terms of the pipe actually delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Orrcon alleges that Mr Studdy aided, abetted, counselled or procured Capital Steel's contravention of s 52 and was directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to that contravention within the meaning of s 75B of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">25 Orrcon makes a further plea which is important in terms of its present claim for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">It is a plea of unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and it is in the following terms:
 
 
 "42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Further and in the alternative, by its knowing failure to deliver pipe that complied with the specification and AS1579 in breach of its obligations under the contract but nevertheless making and seeking to rely on the first, second and third purported drawings down on the letter of credit is particularised in paragraphs 31, 33 and 37 above, in circumstances where it lacks the financial capacity to repay those drawings down, Capital Steel has engaged and is engaging in unconscionable conduct within the meaning of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">" 
 
 
 

26 A good deal of the argument before me focused on whether Orrcon had established a serious question to be tried in terms of that plea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">27 Orrcon also alleges that by reason of the delivery of defective pipe, the failure to deliver the pipe on time or at all and the making of the first, second and third purported drawings down on the Westpac letter of credit, Capital Steel had breached its contract with Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">Those breaches were such that Orrcon was entitled to terminate the contract which it did by letter dated 12 July 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">28 Orrcon alleges that it has suffered loss and damages as a result and it claims the following:
 
 
 "1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Orrcon has been unable to supply the pipe under the head contract and thereby Orrcon has lost profits of AUD9,376,781.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Orrcon has incurred additional costs of AUD2,682,453.14 comprising:
 (a) testing costs of AUD1,297,770.02;
 (b) handling costs of AUD647,807.54;
 (c) transportation costs of AUD657,134.70;
 (d) travelling costs of AUD79,740.88.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">"
 
 

29 In terms of final relief, Orrcon claims various declarations, injunctions and damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Importantly, it claims a mandatory injunction requiring Capital Steel to countermand the drawing requests it has made pursuant to the Westpac letter of credit and to consent to the cancellation of the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">It also seeks an injunction restraining Capital Steel from making any further demands on Westpac pursuant to the Westpac letter of credit and an injunction permanently restraining Westpac from making payments to Capital Steel pursuant to the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Commonwealth Bank 
 
30 The Commonwealth Bank was joined as a party to the proceeding and is the fourth respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">It is convenient at this point to outline briefly the basis upon which it claims an interest in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">31 The Commonwealth Bank has been the principal banker to Capital Steel since approximately October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Among the various facilities that it has extended to Capital Steel is a trade finance facility for the purpose of supporting Capital Steel's international trade and related domestic transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">32 It seems that on 14 March, 10 April and 9 May 2007, Westpac informed the Commonwealth Bank in the latter's capacity as advising bank that the Westpac letter of credit drawings had been accepted in respect of the subject amounts and informed the Commonwealth Bank that it would remit those respective amounts at the respective maturity dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The maturity dates have been extended by the consent of all parties and no moneys have as yet been remitted by Westpac, as the maturity dates have not yet arrived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">However, the Commonwealth Bank has advanced discounted amounts to Capital Steel on the faith of the communications it received from Westpac and those amounts have been used to pay Dongbu or its holding company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The Commonwealth Bank asserts, and this does not appear to be in dispute, that if Westpac does not make payment under the Westpac letter of credit it may need to protect its position by making a demand on Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It appears that Capital Steel would not have the funds to meet that demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The Commonwealth Bank applied to be joined because it had an interest in whether or not interlocutory relief was granted and because it wished to be in a position to "address the Court on the broader issue of policy considerations relating to the integrity of the letters of credit".</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">33 Mr Phillip Grainger is an employee of the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">He is a manager, trade --- services, sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He was involved in the provision of a facility to Capital Steel in relation to the pipe to be purchased by it and to be supplied by it to Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">At the request of Capital Steel the Commonwealth Bank issued letters of credit in favour of Daewoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Mr Grainger relied on the Westpac letter of credit and decided that it was unnecessary for Capital Steel to provide further security for the facility which it then sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Had Mr Grainger thought that there was any risk that Westpac would not pay out in accordance with the Westpac letter of credit, he would not have authorised the granting of a facility to Capital Steel without first obtaining further tangible security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Mr Grainger gave evidence as to the importance of the integrity of the letters of credit being preserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">34 Mr Grainger gave details of the process whereby the Commonwealth Bank granted a temporary increase in the trade finance facility it provided to Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">In the context of that increase, on 2 January 2007 Mr Studdy, for and on behalf of Capital Steel, signed what is referred to as a request for assignment of proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The key clause in the document signed by Mr Studdy on that day is as follows:
 
 "Capital Steel and Pipe Pty Limited being the beneficiary of Irrevocable Documentary Credit No: SD3BM872029 established by Westpac Banking Corporation, Sydney, dated 22 December 2006, which documentary credit is held by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Trade Services, Level 3, 120 Pitt Street, Sydney, hereby irrevocably authorises the CBA, upon their receipt of clear proceeds from drawings under the documentary credit to apply the funds in the consideration of any amount that may be payable (or having already been paid) with regard to the documentary credit(s) that Capital Steel and Pipe Pty Limited seeks to have established in favour of Daewoo International Corp and/or Dongbu Steel Co Limited, of Korea.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">"
 

35 That document was said to have been given in response to a condition of the facility provided by the Commonwealth Bank to Capital Steel to the effect that Capital Steel was to sign a letter "assigning proceeds of the Westpac letters of credit (issued by Orrcon in favour of Capital Steel and Pipe Pty Ltd) to the CBA".</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">36 On 9 January 2007, the Commonwealth Bank issued an import documentary letter of credit (IDLC No 3523722255) in favour of the supplier of the first shipment of steel, namely Daewoo International Corp of Seoul, Korea, ("Daewoo") in the sum of USD1,922,915.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">A condition of the Commonwealth Bank's approval to the issue of the documentary letter of credit in favour of Daewoo was the prior receipt or advice of the Westpac documentary letter of credit from Orrcon in favour of Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Mr Grainger states that had it not been for the receipt of the Westpac letter of credit, he would not have authorised the issue of the letter of credit in favour of Capital Steel's Korean supplier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">The Commonwealth Bank has paid Daewoo under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The Commonwealth Bank has forwarded to Westpac the documents required under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">That was done on 8 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">On 13 March 2007 the Commonwealth Bank was advised by Westpac that it had received acceptance from Orrcon of an amended amount of AUD4,334,360.25.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">On 16 March 2007, Westpac confirmed in writing that at maturity it would remit the relevant amount to the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">A similar process occurred in relation to the second and third shipments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Details are set out below ([74]-[82]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">37 Mr Grainger gave evidence to the effect that if the Court granted the relief sought by Orrcon and restrained payment by Westpac of the amounts payable under the Westpac letter of credit then the Commonwealth Bank would have an unsecured loan exposure to Capital Steel of approximately AUD13,000,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Although the Commonwealth Bank has security securing the indebtedness of Capital Steel, that would not be sufficient to secure payment of such an amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">If interlocutory relief is granted, the Commonwealth Bank may consider taking control of Capital Steel and taking such other steps as may be available to it to minimise its exposure by realising such tangible security as it holds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">38 Although this is an interlocutory application, it must be said that by and large the evidence of Mr Grainger as set out above was not challenged by Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">In any event, most of the matters asserted by the Commonwealth Bank are established by the documents put before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">39 It was the evidence of the Commonwealth Bank which appears to have prompted Orrcon to put forward the reformulated orders (see [5] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The third and fourth orders are designed to prevent prejudice to Capital Steel resulting from the first and second orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The seventh order is designed to prevent prejudice to the Commonwealth Bank because it is intended to provide that any loss suffered by the Bank will be paid by Orrcon irrespective of whether or not Orrcon is successful in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">I will discuss these matters in detail in the context of the balance of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Issues on the application for interlocutory relief 
 
40 The test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction was most recently considered by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 1672.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">I refer to the observations of Gleeson CJ and Crennan J at 1682-1683 [19] and Gummow and Hayne JJ at 1691-1692 [65]-[72].</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">41 Capital Steel submits that Orrcon has not established that there is a serious question to be tried that the steel pipe Capital Steel supplied under the contract was defective in the sense that it did not comply with the terms of the contract between it and Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">If a serious question to be tried is not established in relation to that matter then, it is submitted by Capital Steel, Orrcon's case falls away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Further, or in the alternative, Capital Steel submits that Orrcon has not established that there is a serious question to be tried that relief would be granted restraining payment under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The focus of the argument here was that there was not a serious question to be tried that Capital Steel has been guilty of unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Further, or in the alternative, Capital Steel submits that the balance of convenience favours refusing the interlocutory relief sought by Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">A serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation that the pipe was defective 
 
42 Orrcon relied on evidence from Dr Graham Powell who is a research metallurgist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">He has prepared a report dated July 2007 and a supplementary report dated August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Orrcon also relied on evidence from Dr John Field who is a statistical consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">He has prepared a report dated 9 August 2007 and a supplementary report dated 12 August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Orrcon also relied on evidence from Mr Victor Konstantinoff who holds a Bachelor of Science degree and is the branch operations manager employed by ETRS Pty Ltd ("ETRS").</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">43 The evidence before me is to the effect that ETRS is a specialist testing laboratory that specialises in providing non-destructive inspection and testing, metallurgical testing and analysis, failure investigation and condition assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Tensile testing of materials, including steel, is a common procedure undertaken by ETRS and the provision of that service is one of ETRS's key capabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">44 On 26 March 2007, Orrcon engaged ETRS to conduct testing on samples of steel pipe provided to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">ETRS conducted tests on the samples provided by Orrcon to ETRS in May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The testing was of transverse pieces of the sample pipes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">Mr Konstantinoff identified the test reports produced by ETRS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">45 I allowed brief cross-examination of Mr Konstantinoff by Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">It transpires that ETRS also performed tests on samples of steel pipe provided by Orrcon throughout April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">It seems that ETRS misunderstood its instructions and in April carried out tests of longitudinal pieces of the sample pipes rather than transverse pieces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">46 Dr Powell was provided with the ETRS test reports dated May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">He was not provided with the test reports dated April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I allowed brief cross-examination of Dr Powell.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">It was put to him by counsel for Capital Steel that he would need to "withdraw" the conclusion reached in his report until such time as he had had the opportunity to consider the test reports carried out in April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">He did not agree with that proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">He said that longitudinal results yield stress results that are always larger than the transverse results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">He said that the transverse results are critical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">He referred to the change in the microstructure of the steel and what happens in the rolling of the steel from the slab to the coil and the effect the rolling has on the segregation in the coil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">The transverse results are lower than the longitudinal results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Dr Powell agreed that he did not consider whether the samples were statistically representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">47 Dr John Field was given the results of the sample tests carried out by ETRS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Based on the results of the sample tests, he was asked to estimate the proportion of the overall number of pipes which did not comply with the contractual provision as to unit strength.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He expressed a conclusion as follows:
 
 "Subject to the reservations about the representativeness of the sample expressed in the previous section, it can be stated with 95 per cent confidence that at least 62.5 per cent of the pipes delivered had yield strength below 270 MPa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Thus, the delivery does not meet a minimum yield strength specification of 270 MPa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">"
 

48 Dr Field was questioned by counsel for Capital Steel on whether the sample he relied on for the purposes of drawing a conclusion as to yield strength between pipes within a coil was sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He agreed that had he been given certain information as to variations between pipes within a coil, he might have concluded that it was not safe to assume that the testing which took place predominantly from the middle of the coil was in fact representative of yield strength of the entire coil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">49 Capital Steel submitted that the reservations expressed by Dr Field were such that Orrcon had not established a serious question to be tried that the pipes delivered to it by Capital Steel did not comply with the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">I do not agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">In my opinion Capital Steel's challenges to the expert evidence put forward by Orrcon are matters to be determined at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There appear to be some difficult factual issues which can only be properly determined at trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In my opinion, the evidence put forward by Orrcon establishes that there is a serious question to be tried that the pipes delivered by Capital Steel to Orrcon did not meet the terms of the contract alleged by Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">A serious question to be tried in relation to the allegation of unconscionable conduct 
 
50 Section 51AA of the TPA provides as follows:
 
 
 "(1) A corporation must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the State and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">(2) This section does not apply to conduct that is prohibited by s 51AB or s 51 AC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">"
 
 

51 Orrcon submits, and Capital Steel denies, that there is a serious question to be tried that Capital Steel, in trade or commerce, engaged in conduct that was unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the State or Territories and that it is entitled to injunctive relief against Capital Steel, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank under ss 80 and 87 of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The factual elements of Orrcon's plea of unconscionable conduct which is set out in [25] above are as follows:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Capital Steel's knowing failure to deliver steel pipe that complied with the specification and AS1579 in breach of its obligations under the contract; and
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">Capital Steel making and seeking to rely on the first, second and third purported drawings down on the letter of credit; and
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Capital Steel doing those things in circumstances where it lacked the financial capacity to repay those drawings down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">
 

52 Orrcon submits that as a matter of law a category of unconscionable conduct (relevant to this case) is the insistence on the strict application of legal rights in circumstances where to do so is regarded, on the facts of the particular case, to be harsh or oppressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">53 Orrcon's plea of conscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA raises four issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They are as follows:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">What is the relationship between the autonomy principle and unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA?</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Is it arguable as a matter of law that the facts as pleaded by Orrcon, if established, constitute unconscionable conduct within s 51AA?</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Is there a serious question to be tried that Orrcon will establish the facts it alleges amount to unconscionable conduct and, in particular, factual elements 1 and 3 in [51] above?</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Is there a serious question to be tried to the effect that, assuming unconscionable conduct of the type pleaded is established by Orrcon, relief in the nature of injunctions will be granted restraining Capital Steel from making any further demand under the Westpac letter of credit and Westpac from making any payment under the Westpac letter of credit having regard to the interest of the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">

54 I will address each of these questions in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The relationship between the autonomy principle and s 51AA of the TPA 
 
55 I was referred to a number of clauses in the UCP rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It is sufficient to set out the terms of article 3 and to refer to articles 7, 9 and 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Article 3 provides:
 
 "Credits v Contracts
 
 
 
 a Credits, by their nature, are separate transactions from the sales or other contract(s) on which they may be based and banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract(s) even if any reference whatsoever to such contract(s) is included in the credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to pay, accept and pay draft(s) or negotiate and/or to fulfil any other obligation under the credit is not subject to claims or defenses by the applicant resulting from his relationships with the issuing bank or the beneficiary.</sentence>

56 In United City Merchants (Investments) Limited v Royal Bank of Canada [1983] 1 AC 168 the plaintiffs sued the defendants under a letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Lord Diplock, with whom the other law Lords agreed, discussed the autonomy principle and the reasons for it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Although a lengthy passage, I set it out in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Lord Diplock said (at 182-183):
 
 "It is trite law that there are four autonomous though interconnected contractual relationships involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">(1) The underlying contract for the sale of goods, to which the only parties are the buyer and the seller; (2) the contract between the buyer and the issuing bank under which the latter agrees to issue the credit and either itself or through a confirming bank to notify the credit to the seller and to make payments to or to the order of the seller (or to pay, accept or negotiate bills of exchange drawn by the seller) against presentation of stipulated documents; and the buyer agrees to reimburse the issuing bank for payments made under the credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">For such reimbursement the stipulated documents, if they include a document of title such as a bill of lading, constitute a security available to the issuing bank; (3) if payment is to be made through a confirming bank the contract between the issuing bank and the confirming bank authorising and requiring the latter to make such payments and to remit the stipulated documents to the issuing bank when they are received, the issuing bank in turn agreeing to reimburse the confirming bank for payments made under the credit; (4) the contract between the confirming bank and the seller under which the confirming bank undertakes to pay to the seller (or to accept or negotiate without recourse to drawer bills of exchange drawn by him) up to the amount of the credit against presentation of the stipulated documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">


 
 Again, it is trite law that in contract (4), with which alone the instant appeal is directly concerned, the parties to it, the seller and the confirming bank, 'deal in documents and not in goods,' as article 8 of the Uniform Customs puts it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">If, on their face, the documents presented to the confirming bank by the seller conform with the requirements of the credit as notified to him by the confirming bank, that bank is under a contractual obligation to the seller to honour the credit, notwithstanding that the bank has knowledge that the seller at the time of presentation of the conforming documents is alleged by the buyer to have, and in fact has already, committed a breach of his contract with the buyer for the sale of the goods to which the documents appear on their face to relate, that would have entitled the buyer to treat the contract of sale as rescinded and to reject the goods and refuse to pay the seller the purchase price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The whole commercial purpose for which the system of confirmed irrevocable documentary credits has been developed in international trade is to give to the seller an assured right to be paid before he parts with control of the goods that does not permit of any dispute with the buyer as to the performance of the contract of sale being used as a ground for non-payment or reduction or deferment of payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">"
 

57 Lord Diplock said that there was one established exception to the general statement of principle as to the contractual obligations of the confirming bank to the seller and that was where the seller, "for the purpose of drawing on the credit, fraudulently presents to the confirming bank's documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that to his knowledge are untrue" (at 183).</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Capital Steel accepts that there are two other exceptions and they are breach of a negative stipulation and unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">That concession by Capital Steel appears to be correct having regard to the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">58 In view of Capital Steel's concession, the real issue in this case is whether Orrcon has established a serious question to be tried that Capital Steel has been guilty of unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Is it arguable as a matter of law that the facts as pleaded by Orrcon if established constitute unconscionable conduct within s 51AA?</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">
 
59 Orrcon submits that there was unconscionable conduct in this case because Capital Steel was purporting to exercise a legal right, namely, the right to claim payment under the letters of credit in circumstances in which the purported exercise of that right is harsh or oppressive or unreasonable and in bad faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">60 In order to fall within the terms of s 51AA of the TPA the conduct must be unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law, from time to time, of the States and Territories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi [2003] HCA 57 ; (2003) 217 CLR 315 the High Court considered the meaning of the terms "unconscientious" and "unconscionable".</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">In the joint reasons of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ their Honours made the point (at 324 [20]) that the terms are used across a broad range of the equity jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It is wrong to suggest that "sufficient foundation for the existence of the necessary 'equity' to interfere in relationships established by, for example, the law of contract, is supplied by an element of hardship or unfairness in the terms of the transaction in question, or in the manner of its performance" (at 325 at [26]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Their Honours discuss the Court's previous decisions in Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406 and Stern v McArthur [1988] HCA 51 ; (1988) 165 CLR 489.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Their Honours endorse (at 328 [37]) the approach taken by Mason CJ in Stern (at 503) that Legione and Ciavarella v Balmer [1983] HCA 26 ; (1983) 153 CLR 438 established that the Court will not readily relieve against loss of a contract for sale validly rescinded by the vendor for breach of an essential condition "and, in particular, equity was not authorised 'to reshape contractual relations into a form the Court thinks more reasonable or fair where subsequent events have rendered one side's situation more favourable'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">61 The Full Court of this Court considered the scope of s 51AA in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 62 ; (2002) 117 FCR 301 (" Samton ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The Court identified five categories of case in which equity will intervene under the rubric of unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">62 It said (at 318 [48]):
 
 "Under the rubric of unconscionable conduct, equity will:
 
 
 
 (i) Set aside a contract or disposition resulting from the knowing exploitation by one party of the special disadvantage of another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The special disadvantage may be constitutional, deriving from age, illness, poverty, inexperience or lack of education --- Commercial Bank of Australia v Amadio .</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Or it may be situational, deriving from particular features of a relationship between actors in the transaction such as the emotional dependence of one on the other --- Louth v Diprose ; Bridgewater v Leahy [1998] HCA 66 ; (1998) 194 CLR 457.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) Set aside as against third parties a transaction entered into as the result of the defective comprehension by a party to the transaction, the influence of another and the want of any independent explanation to the complaining party --- Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] HCA 48 ; (1988) 194 CLR 395.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) Prevent a party from exercising a legal right in a way that involves unconscionable departure from a representation relied upon by another to his or her detriment --- Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher ; Commonwealth v Verwayen .</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">(iv) Relieve against forfeiture and penalty --- Legione v Hateley ; Stern v McArthur .</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">
 
 
 
 
 
 (v) Rescind contracts entered into under the influence of unilateral mistake --- Taylor v Johnson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">" 
 
 
 

63 The Court said that the above list may not be exhaustive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The Court made the point that unconscionable conduct within s 51AA was not limited to cases where advantage was taken of a person under a special disability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">At the same time the Court said that equity does not provide a remedy simply on the basis that, in the opinion of the judge, conduct is unfair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The section cannot be applied "to unconscionable conduct at large" (at 319 [50]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">The Court referred with approval to a passage in the earlier decision of French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">In that case French J said (at 509):
 
 "[It] prohibits conduct in respect of which a judge in equity would have been prepared to grant relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">The imposition of the prohibition precedes any actual or notional judicial decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">The judge deciding a case under s 51AA will be asking himself or herself whether he or she would have been prepared to grant relief at equity on the basis of an assessment of the conduct in question as unconscionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">"
 

64 It is not immediately apparent that the facts alleged by Orrcon fall within one of the five categories identified in Samton .</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">In one sense one can say that it is unconscionable or unconscientious to enforce legal rights oppressively or in bad faith but on one view of the authorities the real question is whether there is oppression or bad faith because the circumstances fall within one of the well-known cases in which equity will intervene on the ground that the conduct is unconscionable or unconscientious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">65 Orrcon referred to three first instance decisions in support of its contention that the facts as pleaded by it arguably constitute unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">66 In Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd [1998] 3 VR 380 (" Olex Focas "), Batt J granted injunctions in respect of mobilisation guarantees given in connection with a construction project on the ground that there was a serious question to be tried as to whether the party making a demand under the guarantee had acted unconscionably within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">His Honour took a broad view of what might constitute unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">I refer to his Honour's observations at 404.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">In Samton the Full Court said (at 319 [50]) that it did not need to pass on the correctness of the decision in Olex Focas .</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">67 In Boral Formwork and Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Action Makers Ltd (in administrative receivership) (2003) ATPR 41-953 (" Boral Formwork "), Austin J considered whether an order should be made restraining a bank which had issued a letter of credit from paying any amount in excess of an undisputed amount to the beneficiary under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The parties seeking the order alleged that the beneficiary under the letter of credit had engaged in conduct that was unconscionable within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">Austin J noted that the principle of autonomy applicable to a standby letter of credit could not override the provisions of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">He referred with approval to the observations of Batt J in Olex Focas .</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Austin J considered the significance of the beneficiary being insolvent when the call is made on an irrevocable instrument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">He said (at [81]):
 
 "If the parties have agreed to protect the beneficiary from credit risk, there is unlikely to be anything unconscionable in the consequence that the beneficiary may (for the benefit of its creditors) call on the irrevocable instrument at the account party's expense, leaving the account party to claim in the beneficiary's insolvency if the dispute is resolved in its favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">"
 

A little later, his Honour said (at [94]):
 
 "I hope it is clear, that in deciding to grant the relief sought by Boral, I have given anxious consideration to the principle of autonomy and the dangers associated with any judicial intervention with the performance of unconditional commercial obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The terms of the irrevocable instrument and the underlying contract, properly construed, are highly relevant to the decision whether conduct in connection with those arrangements is unconscionable for statutory or equitable purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">It is not normally unfair or unreasonable or otherwise unconscionable to exercise commercial rights under an autonomous commercial contract, even if (for example) for the purpose of applying pressure to resolve a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Even if the conduct is unconscionable, the principle of autonomy is relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion to grant injunctive relief or leave the plaintiff to other remedies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">Here the circumstances, involving as they do a call on the letter of credit on a false basis, are sufficiently special to overcome the hesitation which the principle of autonomy generates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">"
 

68 In Clough Engineering Limited v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881 , Gilmour J was concerned with an application for leave pursuant to O 8 of the Federal Court Rules to serve an application out of the jurisdiction and for orders to restrain Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd ("ONGC") from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew such demand in respect of certain performance guarantees granted by the three respondent banks to ONGC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The applicant, Clough Engineering Limited, sought a declaration that ONGC by demanding and threatening to make a demand on the performance guarantees granted by the banks had engaged in, or proposed to engage in, unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Gilmour J granted leave to serve and he made an order restraining ONGC from taking any further step to demand or obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from the banks under the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Gilmour J said that there was authority which clearly supported the proposition that an inappropriate threat to call or a call on performance guarantees can be unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA and he referred to the decision in Samton .</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">His Honour considered that it was appropriate to grant an injunction restraining ONGC from making a call on the performance guarantees and he appears to have relied on the fact that there was a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC's conduct was unconscionable within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">He also relied on another exception to the autonomy principle, namely, breach of a negative stipulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">69 Shortly after his Honour made these orders, the banks applied to have them set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Gilmour J refused to set aside the orders: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (No 2) [2007] FCA 927.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">His Honour said (at [43]):
 
 "I remain satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether ONGC has acted unconscionably in contravention of s 51AA of the Act in calling on or threatening to call on the performance guarantees despite there being no legal right on its part to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">As Austin J said in Boral Formwork v Action Makers (2003) ATPR 41-953 at [14] when referring relevantly to s 51AA of the Act: 'the principle of autonomy applicable to a standby letter of credit, cannot override the statute'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">I am also satisfied that upon the same factual matrix, there is a serious issue to be tried whether ONGC is in breach if [sic] the negative stipulation conditioning the right to call up the performance guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">"
 

70 I do not think I should attempt to determine the boundaries of unconscionable conduct in s 51AA of the TPA on this interlocutory application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">I am prepared to proceed on the basis that it is arguable that a seller of goods who presents the necessary documents under a letter of credit and at the time of doing so has a level of knowledge about the goods and whether they comply with the contract may be guilty of unconscionable conduct within s 51AA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">I am prepared to proceed on the basis that such unconscionable conduct could found an order restraining payment under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">That, of course, is a very general proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">However, I am satisfied that the level or nature of the knowledge established on a serious question to be tried basis in this case cannot constitute unconscionable conduct within s 51AA such that relief in relation to the Westpac letter of credit would be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">My reasons for reaching that conclusion are best explained under the next heading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Is there a serious question to be tried that Orrcon will establish the facts it alleges amount to unconscionable conduct and, in particular, the first and third factual elements?</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">
 
71 In order to determine if there is a serious question to be tried in relation to the first and third elements it is necessary to refer to the facts in more detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">72 Although the contract between Orrcon and Capital Steel envisaged that there would be five shipments of steel pipe there were in fact only three shipments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">73 The first shipment of steel pipe arrived at Port Kembla on 13 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Daewoo/Dongbu was paid for the first shipment under a letter of credit issued by the Commonwealth Bank at the request of Capital Steel and that payment was made on 8 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">On 13 March 2007 Capital Steel was advised that the necessary documents had been accepted under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">It was the Commonwealth Bank which forwarded to Westpac the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit and that was done on or about 8 March 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">In addition to paying the supplier for the first shipment, Capital Steel paid ocean freight of USD493,065.07 and customs duty and associated costs of $448,614.08.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">74 The second shipment arrived at Port Kembla on 6 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">On 29 March 2007 the Commonwealth Bank paid Daewoo/Dongbu for the second shipment under a letter of credit relating to that shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">On or about 30 March 2007 the Commonwealth Bank sent the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit to Westpac in relation to the second shipment, including a draft for $4,133,114.77.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">On or about 5 April 2007, Capital Steel was advised that Orrcon had accepted the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">In addition to paying the supplier for the second shipment, Capital Steel paid ocean freight of USD489,060 and customs duty and associated costs of $394,102.27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">75 The third shipment arrived at Port Kembla on 7 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">On 1 May 2007 the Commonwealth Bank sent the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit to Westpac, including a draft for $4,346,689.83.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">76 On 4 May 2007 Orrcon had not notified Westpac that it accepted the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit presented by the Commonwealth Bank to Westpac in relation to the third shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">According to the evidence of Ms Priscilla Stark, who is the office manager of Capital Steel, she spoke by telephone to Mr James McDonald, who is an accountant employed by Orrcon, on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Mr McDonald said:
 
 "Orrcon will not accept the letter of credit documents because the previous Dongbu pipes are non-conforming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">Orrcon will not accept the letter of credit until it has in writing what was discussed and agreed upon at the meeting in Brisbane with Dongbu representatives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">"
 

77 Ms Stark asked Mr McDonald about the pipes arriving on Monday and Mr McDonald said that Orrcon still wanted to take them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Ms Stark then spoke to Mr Robert Campbell of Orrcon by telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">She advised him that the vessel was arriving on Monday and that Orrcon was not accepting the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Mr Campbell said that his trucks were in place and ready to take delivery of the cargo on Monday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">78 Capital Steel's position was that it would not permit Orrcon to take physical possession of the pipes until Orrcon had notified Westpac that it accepted the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit in relation to the third shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Capital Steel understood that Orrcon would become owner of the pipes once they passed the ship's rail and wanted to be assured of payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Correspondence then passed between Dongbu, Capital Steel and Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">It culminated in a series of electronic messages sent on 7 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On 7 May 2007 Mr Leon Andrewartha, the managing director of Orrcon, sent an electronic message to Mr Studdy of Capital Steel as follows:
 
 "Thanks for the e-mail and it is of comfort to Orrcon that Dongbu will replace all pipe which is not to the specification required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">The issue, however, is that two letters of credit have already been presented that commits Orrcon to paying for pipes that have a high reject rate and cannot be used for the intended purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">The third shipment and presentation of the letter of credit will exacerbate this problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Will Dongbu/Capital offer extended terms to cover this problem?</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">(remembering that the letter of credit has terms associated with it).</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Will Dongbu/Capital commit to meeting Orrcon's costs in assessing and testing the pipe already received (and that of the third shipment)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">"
 

79 On the same day, Mr Studdy of Capital Steel responded to Mr Andrewartha's electronic mail in the following terms:
 
 "Thank you for your e-mail and you would be no doubt aware that the vessel has berthed and Rob Campbell has been in contact with our office this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">As advised to Rob, we have been in contact with Dongbu this morning regarding the two points raised in your e-mail and can now advise as follows:
 
 
 
 1) Dongbu/Capital will extend the payment terms under the current L/C for the third shipment from 120 days to 180 days, without any additional costs to Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">2) Dongbu advise they are prepared to contribute towards the associated costs in assessing and testing the pipe already received including that of the third shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">3) The above concessions are dependent upon Orrcon's acceptance of the L/C documents for the third shipment currently with your bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">Upon your written confirmation, we will advise our bank that Orrcon will accept the documents tomorrow morning as well as the revised payment terms, as we understand today is a public holiday in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">
 
 
 Please therefore confirm by return so as the discharge of the third shipment can progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">"
 

80 On the same day, Mr Andrewartha responded in the following terms:
 
 "Thanks for expediting the resolution of these issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">As you know I have been in close contact with Rob Campbell during this morning in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">The way forward as I see it is:
 
 
 &#61863; If there is acceptance that Capital Steel/Dongbu will extend the payment terms for shipments 1, 2 and 3 from 120 to 180 days;
 &#61863; Additionally there is acceptance that Capital Steel/Dongbu will pay to Orrcon, all costs associated with sample cutting, testing, handling and transport, stockpiling, de-metring and end reparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Pipes shall be tested in accordance with ASTMA370.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">If a pipe from a mid coil sample tested in the transverse direction is below 270 MPa then all pipe associated with that coil will be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Orrcon accepts that the 270 MPa is in the aged condition and that an agreed tolerance will apply in accordance with AS1391.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">&#61863; That these conditions are accepted by return e-mail independently by both Capital Steel and Dongbu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">
 
 
 then Orrcon is prepared to commit to make the required changes to the letter of credit that would see it accepted upon the opening for business of the relevant financial institutions on Tuesday morning, 8 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">You are aware of the sensitivity and urgency of this matter, so I am sure you will be able to resolve this favourably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">Furthermore, Orrcon is agreeable to Dongbu or Capital having a nominated person available at their expense to monitor all activities associated with testing and management of segregation of reject pipe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">Ed, if you can expedite these couple of issues, then I am sure we can satisfactorily complete this project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">"
 

81 Ultimately the parties agreed and the steel pipes were unloaded and delivered to Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">Capital Steel had to pay the sum of $23,742.35 in demurrage costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">82 On 9 May 2007 Westpac accepted the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit in relation to the third shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">Again, in addition to paying the supplier for the third shipment, Capital Steel paid ocean freight of USD512,160.89 and $400,074.13 for customs duty and associated costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">In addition, Capital Steel paid the sum of $43,000 for marine insurance for the five anticipated shipments of Dongbu steel pipe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">83 As to the first factual element of Orrcon's unconscionable conduct plea, Orrcon's case is that Mr Studdy's knowledge can be attributed to Capital Steel and that he knew that the steel pipe delivered under the contract failed to comply with the specification and AS1579 in breach of Capital Steel's obligations under the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">In support of Orrcon's claim that there was a serious question to be tried on that issue I was referred to a number of facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">The first was a meeting held on 2 March 2007 involving Mr Studdy of Capital Steel and Mr Campbell and Mr Cunningham of Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Notes of the meeting indicate that Mr Campbell expressed various concerns about the conduct of Dongbu and Capital Steel and the effects that that conduct may have on Orrcon's contract with the State of Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">He said that Dongbu had changed the agreed coil supplier without prior notice or prior approval and that Dongbu was not providing the necessary data about the production of the steel pipes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Cunningham advised Mr Studdy that Orrcon would be "back charging" Capital Steel for any remedial work required to pipe that did not conform with the requirements of the project Manufacturing and Inspection Process Diagram.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">84 The next fact to which I was referred was an electronic message from Mr Studdy of Capital Steel to Mr D H Yoo dated 4 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">Mr Yoo is alleged to be a director of an entity trading as "World Trade and Marketing" and an agent of Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">The electronic message is in the following terms:
 
 "Orrcon are receiving further results from ETRS on the supplementary testing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">They now have four coils where pipe is well under 270 MPa min.yield.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">Most is around 250 MPa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">This currently represents 35 pipes with 1/3rd of testing completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">They will advise further once final results are known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">Please inform Dongbu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">"
 

85 The next fact to which I was referred was an electronic message from Mr Studdy of Capital Steel to Mr D H Yoo dated 10 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">It is in the following terms:
 
 "Further to our e-mail dated 4 April and our today's telecom, we reconfirm verbal advice that up to 90 pipes, repeat 90 pipes from the first shipment, have been rejected by the Queensland Government due to the fact the yield strength is below and/or around 240 to 250 MPa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">As you know, Qld Govt/Orrcon were prepared to accept pipes that were somewhere below 300 MPa --- in fact pipes 270 MPa and above were deemed to be acceptable but 240-250 MPa is unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">These rejected pipes will have to be replaced and I sincerely hope there will not be too many more that fall into this category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Please inform Dongbu.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">"
 

86 In terms of the facts from this point in time, I refer to the events and correspondence surrounding the third shipment which are summarised in [75]-[82] inclusive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">87 The plea that Mr Studdy knew that the steel pipe did not comply with Capital Steel's obligations under the contract must be considered in the following context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The legal right which Orrcon submits it is harsh or oppressive to insist on is payment under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">There is nothing further for Capital Steel to do to secure payment under the Westpac letter of credit and the question of knowledge must be considered at the various times the necessary documents were accepted by Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Orrcon's case on knowledge is strongest at or about the time the documents in relation to the third shipment were accepted by Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">At that time it was known by Capital Steel that some steel pipe probably did not comply with the terms of the contract but, at the same time, Dongbu had agreed to replace whatever pipe did not comply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Neither party knew whether the right of rejection under the specification arose and in fact Orrcon itself could not have known that until it knew the results of the testing carried out in May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">It will be remembered that Orrcon was entitled to reject all the pipe from an affected heat, coil or heat treat lot if less than 50 per cent of the pipe length formed from the heat, coil or heat treat lot complied with the requirements of the specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">I do not think the level of knowledge on the part of Capital Steel which Orrcon has shown it may establish at trial is sufficient to establish unconscionable conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">A further question which I do not need to resolve is whether there can be unconscionable conduct where (as appears to be the case here) neither party to the contract knows more than the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">88 I agree with the submission made by Capital Steel that there is not a serious question to be tried that Mr Studdy knew, or could have known, that the steel pipe failed the yield strength requirements in the transverse direction at any time prior to the presentation of the documents under the Westpac letter of credit for each of the three shipments and Westpac and Orrcon's acceptance of those documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">89 As to the third factual element of Orrcon's unconscionable conduct plea, namely, Capital Steel's inability to repay, there would appear to be a serious question to be tried that at the time Capital Steel through the Commonwealth Bank presented the necessary documents to Westpac in relation to the drawing down of the letter of credit Capital Steel lacked the financial capacity to repay those drawings down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">In that regard, it is sufficient to refer to a conversation deposed to by Mr Michael Quinn, Manager, Credit Management, of the Commonwealth Bank with Mr Studdy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Mr Quinn said:
 
 "Ed, if Westpac does not make payment to us under the letter of credit on 24 August, the bank will be placed in a position whereby it may need to seek repayment of the funds already advanced to the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">If that were to happen would the company be able to return those funds?</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">"
 

90 Mr Studdy said:
 
 "If that were to happen, there would be no way that we could find that sort of money that would be the end of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">"
 

91 It is not clear to me that this matter could be an element of unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA and I note the observations made by Austin J in Boral Formwork and Scaffolding Pty Ltd v Action Makers Ltd (see [67] above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">Capital Steel is the seller of the steel pipe and Orrcon is the buyer of the pipe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">It may be that Orrcon has more assets than Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">However, it was Capital Steel which obtained the benefit of the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">It was not prepared to take the risk that it would not be paid for the goods it was selling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Orrcon, which had dealt with Capital Steel in the past, did not seek any security against the contingency that the goods delivered would not be in accordance with the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">It would be odd if the financial position of Capital Steel was an element of unconscionable conduct in those circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In any event, even if it can be an element of unconscionable conduct, I have no doubt that it cannot be sufficient of itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">92 For these reasons I do not think there is a serious question to be tried that Orrcon will establish unconscionable conduct within s 51AA of the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Is there a serious question to be tried to the effect that, assuming unconscionable conduct of the type pleaded is established by Orrcon, relief in the nature of injunctions will be granted restraining Capital Steel from making any further demand under the Westpac letter of credit and Westpac from making any payment under the Westpac letter of credit having regard to the position of the Commonwealth Bank?</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">
 
93 The Commonwealth Bank asserted that by reason of the assignment of 2 January 2007 it had an interest in the proceeds payable under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">The Commonwealth Bank asserted that by reason of facts it identified and which it submitted could not be challenged, it is not even arguable on a serious question to be tried basis that the Court would grant an injunction restraining payment under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">94 As I understood it, Orrcon did not suggest that the Commonwealth Bank was in any way guilty of unconscionable conduct, or that Orrcon has a cause of action against the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">The facts put forward by the Commonwealth Bank in support of its submission may be summarised as follows:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">The Commonwealth Bank provided various facilities to Capital Steel for which it held various securities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">In relation to the transaction the subject of this proceeding it provided a trade finance facility of $18,590,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">On 2 January 2007 the Commonwealth Bank received the Westpac letter of credit from Westpac and it sent it on to Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Relying on that letter of credit the Commonwealth Bank issued its own letter of credit in favour of Daewoo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In providing the facility to Capital Steel the Commonwealth Bank relied on the Westpac letter of credit and did not take into account its security position (under existing securities) in the form of tangible security.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Had it not been for the Westpac letter of credit the Commonwealth Bank would have required further tangible security before issuing its own letter of credit in favour of Daewoo which further tangible security was unlikely to be forthcoming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The Commonwealth Bank issued a letter of credit in favour of Daewoo in relation to each of the three shipments and the necessary documents were presented under each letter of credit and Daewoo was paid by the Commonwealth Bank, which treated the moneys paid as a capital advance to Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The Commonwealth Bank then forwarded the necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit to Westpac authorising payment to Westpac.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">In each case Westpac advised the Commonwealth Bank that the documents had been accepted, and confirmed that it would remit the face value of the drawing on maturity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">After receiving the notification referred to in 7, the Commonwealth Bank advanced to Capital Steel an amount equal to the face value of the drawing after deducting the amount paid to Daewoo and interest thereon and an interest component in relation to the period between such advance and the maturity date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The Commonwealth Bank has advanced a total of approximately $13,000,000 to Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">

95 The Commonwealth Bank asserts that it would not have made any of the payments but for its reliance on the Westpac letter of credit and the subsequent communications from Westpac that the necessary documents had been accepted and that it would remit payment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">It also submits that it had no knowledge of the contractual dispute between Orrcon and Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">96 Based on the facts I have summarised, the Commonwealth Bank submitted that the Court would not grant interlocutory relief restraining payment under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">It referred to the doctrine of estoppel, the principle that he who seeks equity must come to the Court with clean hands, the doctrine of acquiescence, considerations of hardship and unfairness, the fact damages are an adequate remedy, and that as between Orrcon and the Commonwealth Bank it is Orrcon which should bear the loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The Commonwealth Bank's submissions raise some difficult issues of law and fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">I do not need to consider them as I have concluded that interlocutory relief should be refused on other grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">A serious question to be tried in relation to other allegations 
 
97 Before leaving the issue of whether there is a serious question to be tried, I should mention that in the course of submissions Orrcon suggested that the breach of a negative stipulation exception to the autonomy principle may be relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">Orrcon alleged in its statement of claim that it was a term and condition of the contract that Capital Steel was not entitled to make a claim for payment under the Westpac letter of credit unless all of the pipe delivered complied with the specification and AS1579 in all respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">The Westpac letter of credit refers only to AS1579 and that Australian Standard does not refer to the minimum yield strength alleged by Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">I agree with the submission of Capital Steel that none of the documents which are alleged to form the steel contract contain the words pleaded and, accordingly, there is no express term to the effect alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Nor do I think it can be said that there is a serious question to be tried that there was an implied term to that effect, having regard to the factors referred to in Codelfa .</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">98 There was also a suggestion in Orrcon's written submissions that the presentation of mill test certificates to Westpac was misleading or deceptive conduct and that a contravention of s 52 of the TPA may be sufficient to found interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">That submission was not developed in any detail by Orrcon and it is difficult to see how it could succeed in light of the fact that, among other things, mill test certificates are not necessary documents under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The balance of convenience 
 
99 I will consider first the balance of convenience having regard to the interlocutory orders as sought in the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">I will then consider the balance of convenience having regard to the reformulated orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">100 Of the four orders sought by Orrcon the freezing order (that is, paragraph 7) was not pressed at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The first injunction sought is a mandatory injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">A mandatory interlocutory injunction is rarely granted because usually an interlocutory injunction is ordered to preserve the status quo not to alter it (Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity Doctrine and Remedies , 4 th ed at 788).</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The second injunction prohibiting Capital Steel from making any further demand under the Westpac letter of credit is probably misconceived because Capital Steel is not required to take any further action under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">Absent a court order Westpac is under an irrevocable and unconditional obligation to pay the stated amounts on the stated dates without any further action on the part of Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">The third injunction prohibiting Westpac from making any payment under the Westpac letter of credit would probably lead to Orrcon amending its Statement of Claim to claim a declaration that it is not bound to pay Capital Steel the price under the contract (or a substantial part of it) and Capital Steel bringing a claim for the payment of the price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">101 Although there was no specific evidence before me as to Orrcon's financial position, the suggestion was that Orrcon has substantial financial resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">There was evidence before me that Capital Steel would not have the financial resources to pay a substantial amount to Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">Orrcon submits that payment now under the Westpac letter of credit would leave it with no effective remedy against Capital Steel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">It would have paid the price under the contract but any set-off or cross claim it has against Capital Steel would be of no real value because of Capital Steel's financial position and the fact that the moneys under the Westpac letter of credit would have been paid to the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">On the face of it that is a weighty consideration in favour of Orrcon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">However, as against that consideration there are a number of matters suggesting that interlocutory relief should not be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">102 The most important consideration is the fact that Orrcon gave the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">It agreed to the issuing of an irrevocable letter of credit and that it would be governed by the UCP rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">The UCP rules make it clear that the letter of credit transaction is quite separate from the underlying sale of goods transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Orrcon had dealt with Capital Steel in the past and it had the choice whether it would ask Westpac to issue the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">The letter of credit was in fact designed to give Capital Steel the security of knowing that it would be paid the price for the goods and avoid the difficulty of not being paid because Orrcon asserts that the goods delivered do not comply with the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">Furthermore, Orrcon instructed Westpac to accept the necessary documents under the letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">103 Another important consideration is the prejudice caused to Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank if an injunction restraining Westpac from making any payment under the Westpac letter of credit is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Capital Steel presently owes the Commonwealth Bank over $12,000,000 and, absent payment under the Westpac letter of credit, it does not have the resources to meet that liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">The Commonwealth Bank may well take action against Capital Steel and guarantors and mortgagors under the securities it holds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">It may place Capital Steel into receivership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">It may prove very difficult later to unravel action taken or to restore the status quo should that be the appropriate course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">104 As far as the Commonwealth Bank is concerned it is an innocent party and Orrcon did not contend otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">It advanced substantial money on the faith of the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">If Westpac is restrained from paying moneys under the Westpac letter of credit then the Commonwealth Bank will or may be involved in expensive and time-consuming action in order to protect its position as best it can.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">105 Two other matters should be mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">They are not of critical significance in terms of the balance of convenience, but at the same time they are not irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">First, Orrcon has the steel pipes which were the subject of the three shipments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">It was asserted that the contract between Orrcon and the State of Queensland had been, or was likely to be, terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">On the evidence it is not possible for me to make any findings, even on a serious question to be tried basis, on that issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Even if I assume that Orrcon's case on that issue is correct, Orrcon has the steel pipes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">They may have no value, some value or considerable value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">On the evidence I simply do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Secondly, Capital Steel has delivered goods to Orrcon pursuant to unrelated transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">It has not been paid by Orrcon and it asserts that Orrcon owes it in the region of $1,400,000-$1,500,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Orrcon has not provided an explanation for not paying for the goods at least as far as the particular transactions are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Those facts have been established on a serious question to be tried basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">Those two matters although, as I have said, far from being of critical significance in terms of the balance of convenience, show that Orrcon's loss, if interlocutory relief is refused, may not be as great as it suggests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">106 As far as the interlocutory orders as originally formulated are concerned, the balance of convenience clearly favours the refusal of those orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">107 The reformulated orders are an attempt by Orrcon to overcome the prejudice to Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank if Westpac is restrained from making any payments under the Westpac letter of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The claim for a mandatory injunction is not pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">The prejudice to Capital Steel is dealt with by prohibiting the Commonwealth Bank from claiming its debt from Capital Steel and from taking any action under its securities in relation to that debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The prejudice to the Commonwealth Bank is dealt with by Orrcon's undertaking to pay damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">This undertaking was initially proffered in the usual terms, but counsel for the Commonwealth Bank pointed out that his client was an innocent party and irrespective of whether or not Orrcon is successful may suffer substantial loss by way of a diminution in the value of the securities between the interlocutory orders and trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">It would seem that submission led Orrcon to amend its reformulated orders by adding the words, "regardless of the outcome of these proceedings upon a final hearing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">108 Capital Steel submits that the Court did not have the power to make orders against the Commonwealth Bank and it referred to Australian Broadcasting Authority v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199, Cardile v LED Builders Pty Limited [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380, s 23 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and O 25A r 5(5) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">I do not need to consider that question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">On any view, the reformulated orders involve a substantial interference in the commercial relationship between Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">Even if the orders cover all contingencies in terms of possible loss to the Commonwealth Bank, and I am not completely satisfied that is the case, there will be time and expense involved in establishing any loss which may be suffered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Although the reformulated orders go some way towards addressing the prejudice to Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank if interlocutory injunctions are granted, the balance of convenience still favours the refusal of relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Conclusion 
 
109 It was for these reasons that on 22 August 2007 I dismissed Orrcon's application for interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">I certify that the preceding one hundred and nine (109) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.</sentence>
