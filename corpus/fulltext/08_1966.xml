<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The appellants, who I will collectively refer to as the "McMullan interests", operate a website on the internet which provides articles about developments in the insurance industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The domain name for the website is InsuranceNEWS.com.au.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The respondent ("JEM") also operates a website which provides articles on developments in the insurance industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The domain name for its website is "InsuranceNewsAustralia.com".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In the Court below, JEM obtained an order restraining the McMullan interests from using the domain name "InsuranceNEWS.com.au".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The Federal Magistrate held that the two domain names were "so similar that they are likely to mislead or deceive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He considered that JEM had made out its case under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The essential issue for resolution on the appeal is whether it was open to his Honour to make an order against the McMullan interests under the Act on the evidence before the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In that regard, the Court is required to examine whether the Federal Magistrate failed to determine whether JEM's website had an inherently descriptive or distinctive name and, if descriptive, whether the name had acquired a secondary distinctive meaning through extensive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">FINDINGS OF FACT BELOW 
 
4 Identification of the facts found by the primary judge is critical to the resolution of the appeal, as much of the debate between counsel centred on what the Federal Magistrate did or did not find as a fact or facts before him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 Apart from identifying the names of the two relevant websites, his Honour observed that the McMullan interests' service is free and is reliant on advertising income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">JEM, on the other hand, provides insurance news stories to subscribers by email in accordance with a password-protected log on service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It relies on subscriptions rather than advertising revenue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 His Honour described the physical characteristics of the two websites as follows:
 (i) Colours 
 
JEM's website had an orange coloured background with some deep red colouring and a small map of Australia in "solid red".</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The McMullan interests' website has a thin orange line across the top of the page but no other colour background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The word "NEWS" in the domain name is coloured bright orange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Each article is accompanied by a large coloured banner provided by an advertiser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">(ii) Similarity 
 
His Honour found at [11] that, apart from the similarity of domain names and content, the two websites are not "strikingly similar", but the nature of the material provided and the layout used "leads to some degree of similarity, such that the casual observer may not notice the difference unless regularly accessing the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">"
 NAMES 
 
7 At [13], the Federal Magistrate noted that "au" is a country code referable to Australia and that "com" signifies "a company or similar".</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He then said that the domain names are "remarkably similar" and likely to cause confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">THE NATURE OF THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESS 
 
8 At [39], the Federal Magistrate accepted that JEM is a high quality independent service which is reasonably well known in the industry although perhaps chiefly to the "older members" of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">JEM has a loyal subscriber base, with a relatively small turnover or "churn" rate amongst subscribers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">THE CONCLUSIONS BELOW 
 
9 At [63] to [66] of the judgment below, the Federal Magistrate made the following conclusions of fact:
 
&#8226; most of the members of the group of users of the two websites would be seeking access to information;
 
&#8226; care would need to be taken to ensure the correct website is typed in on a user's computer;
 
&#8226; the almost identical domain names is the main source of confusion such that "(a) potential reader who had seen reference in the print media is likely to be misled or deceived by the (McMullan) site when attempting to visit the [JEM] site";
 
&#8226; "readers who have not carefully saved the web address are just as likely to go to the wrong site and not realise it is run by a different company";
 
&#8226; the McMullan interests could have named their site in another way while still using the words "insurance news" so that it was not almost identical to JEM's website name;
 
&#8226; the names are so similar as to be likely to mislead or deceive;
 
&#8226; even if the names are entirely descriptive (as to which no precise finding is made), the similarity of the names together with the appearance of the websites is misleading and deceptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">REFERENCES TO "DESCRIPTIVE" NATURE OF WORDS IN THE WEBSITES' NAMES 
 
10 At [17], by reference to the High Court's judgment in Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Pty Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216 , his Honour noted, correctly, that "...a party is not able to obtain a monopoly over a name which is not distinctive but rather descriptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">"
 
11 At [63], his Honour referred to the names of the websites as using "common words".</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">At [64] he referred to "the descriptive nature of the words".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">12 Although there is no precise finding to this effect the Federal Magistrate appears to accept that the words "insurance" and "news" and "Australia" were words which are "descriptive" rather than "distinctive".</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It would be surprising if any other result ensued because they are self-evidently descriptive words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Although more than one descriptive word is combined, each component retains its descriptive significance in relation to the services at issue; the combination results in a composite that is itself descriptive: see Brookfield Communications Inc v West Coast Entertainment Corporation [1999] USCA9 74 ; 174 F3d 1036 (1999); Finance Express v Nowcom Corporation 564 FSupp2d 1160 (2008).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">13 Moreover, the Federal Magistrate's comparison of the two domain names by substituting "company" for "com" and "Australia" for "au" is misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The ".com" top-level domain signifies the sites' commercial nature, and the ".au" signifies where the domain is registered: see connect.com.au Pty Ltd v GoConnect Australia Pty Ltd (2000) 178 ALR 348 ; Prime Publishers Inc v American-Republican Inc 160 FSupp2d 266 (2001).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Federal Magistrate's commentary about the similarity in capitalisation of the website names is also not significant as web addresses are not capital-sensitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">14 Significantly, I cannot see that his Honour made any finding about whether the words which comprise JEM's web address had acquired a secondary distinctive meaning through extensive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">That is because he appeared to consider that it did not matter whether they had or had not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It was sufficient, according to his Honour, in order to grant the relief sought by JEM, to find that the names were similar and the websites had a similar appearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That is despite his earlier acknowledgement that a party does not obtain a monopoly over a name which is merely descriptive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 At [40], his Honour referred to JEM's businesses having "a good will that is worthy of protection".</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">That is not a finding that its domain name has acquired a distinctive meaning by extensive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It is merely an acknowledgement of the existence of an ongoing business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Nor is evidence concerning the number of 'hits', referred to at [47] of the reasons for judgment below, evidence that the domain name had acquired a distinctive meaning through excessive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 JEM changed its website name to its current name in June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There was no evidence in the Court below that its name had acquired a distinctive meaning through extensive use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">As counsel for the McMullan interests observed in the absence of evidence supporting a finding of distinctive use and, in the absence of such a finding, JEM's claim could not properly succeed in the Court below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">17 In connect.com.au Pty Ltd, Emmett J observed at [57] that for a descriptive name to become distinctive, "a very substantial amount of use in the relevant market would be necessary for it to acquire any secondary meaning".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">At [58] his Honour said:
 ...where a descriptive trade name is used there will always be the possibility of confusion...[and] where a descriptive trade name is used it will be difficult for that name to become distinctive of a particular business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Application to like businesses would not ordinarily mislead the public: see Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd (1978) 140 CLR 216.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">18 At [60] Emmett J earlier said:
 "There is a price to be paid for the advantages flowing from the possession of an eloquently descriptive trade name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Because it is descriptive it is equally applicable to any business of a like kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Its very descriptiveness ensures that it is not distinctive of any particular business and hence its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">" 
See also the discussion at [61] regarding possible confusion by the public where "descriptive words are used by two traders as part of their respective trade names", even where the trade names include differentiating words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">19 Similar observations have been made by Stephen J at 228 in the Hornsby Building case and by a Full Court of this Court in Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Lane Industries Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (2003) 26 IPR 261.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">20 At 228 - 229 in the Hornsby Building case, Stephen J (with whom Jacobs J agreed) referred to the use of descriptive words in a business name as not entitling a claim for a monopoly in these words.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">At 229, his Honour referred to the concept stressed by Emmett J in connect.com.au Pty Ltd that "(t)here is a price to be paid for the advantages flowing from the possession of an eloquently descriptive trade name".</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">See also Barwick CJ at 221 (with whom Aickin J agreed).</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">21 I also note that in Dodds Family Investments at 269, the Full Court said:
 The causative connection is reputation, an association in the minds of consumers between the originator's designation and its goods or services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Merely descriptive words will not ordinarily effect such an association: per Gummow, French, Hill JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">CONFUSION 
 
22 Although the Federal Magistrate, at [65], considered the names of the two websites and the get-up of those sites in combination provided the requisite confusion, this finding is at odds with his Honour's earlier observation at [11] that the two sites are not strikingly similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">So much is evident, at least, when it is remembered that one site is a free service and another a subscriber based service --- thereby lessening possible confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As described by the Federal Magistrate the appearance of the two websites is not sufficiently similar to give rise to confusion on the basis of appearance alone or in combination with the names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The fact that some interested people may be confused between the two sites is an insufficient basis to establish a reasonable likelihood of an appreciable or relevant confusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">That is especially so where there is no finding as to whether the number of possible confused people was significant or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">See Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">CONCLUSION 
 
23 Having regard to the foregoing it is apparent that JEM's claim under the Act should not have succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The lack of a finding about whether the words --- insurance, news and Australia - had acquired a distinctive meaning through extensive use is fatal to JEM's ability to maintain the orders it secured below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">His Honour did not deal with the claim made by JEM under the tort of "passing off".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Rather, his Honour found it unnecessary due to his finding that the respondents succeeded under the TPA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It may be likely that no such claim could be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">In any event, the parties consider, and I agree, that no different result would ensue concerning the passing off claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The appeal should be allowed, the operative orders below set aside and the appellants should have their costs of the appeal and of the proceeding below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
