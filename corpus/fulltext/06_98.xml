1 On 21 December 2005 I delivered my reasons for an order which I made on that day dismissing the applicant's appeal against a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 4 September 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant, through no fault of his own, was not present on that occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He was unwell, suffering from the illness which is the subject matter of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 In any event, counsel for the Repatriation Commission, the respondent to the appeal, made an application for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Because the applicant was absent I thought the question of costs should be reserved so that the applicant might be heard if he wished in opposition to the application for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The matter was called on again this morning when the applicant appeared and made submissions why, in the circumstances of this appeal, costs should not follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The question of costs is always in the discretion of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However, there are certain rules, none of which bind a Judge which need to be borne in mind in exercising that discretion which, of course, must be exercised judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Ordinarily, costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">There are exceptions; for example, when the conduct of the successful party may disqualify that party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The subject matter of the litigation may make it inappropriate for the usual order to follow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Matters of public interest may mean that the usual order ought not to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 In this case the applicant has submitted that this appeal was brought not only for the applicant's sake but also for other persons in a similar position to the applicant who do not have the ability to prosecute their own appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 I have considerable sympathy for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The applicant, as I noted in my reasons, was conscripted to serve in the Australian Forces in the 1960s and, whilst a conscript, was sent to serve in Vietnam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In the performance of his duties, the applicant contracted serious physical and psychological illnesses which have impacted to a considerable extent on his and his wife's lives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This appeal arose out of the applicant's belief that the Commission had not recognised the seriousness of his disabilities and had thereby under-compensated him for a long period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 As I explained in my reasons, the question of the merits of the claim was for the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The only matter for me was whether the Tribunal had erred in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In the end result, I found that the Tribunal had not made any error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 Whilst I have considerable sympathy for the applicant, there seems to me no reason why the usual rule should not take effect in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In other words, in the exercise of my discretion acting judicially, I can think of no reason why the Repatriation Commission should not be entitled to its costs and there must be an order accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">8 However, I would ask those advising the Repatriation Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission these reasons so that the Commission might consider whether, having regard to the contribution Mr Sleep has made and to the consequences which he has suffered, it would be appropriate not to enforce the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">However, that is a matter for the Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The only order I can make is that there be an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Associate:
