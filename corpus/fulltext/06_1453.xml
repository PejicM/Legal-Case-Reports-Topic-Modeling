1 This is an appeal against an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 31 July 2006 dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 24 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to cancel the appellant's Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa under s 116(1)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) because of a breach by the appellant of condition 8202 which attached to that visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who was born on 21 December 1981 and who entered Australia on 25 April 2002 when he was the holder of a Subclass 573 (Higher Education Sector) visa which was valid until 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">3 On 13 March 2004 the appellant was granted a further Subclass 573 visa to which condition 8202 (meet course requirements) and other conditions, not relevant, attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The visa was valid until 22 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 On 23 March 2005 the Macquarie University gave notice to the appellant under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (the ESOS Act) advising that he had breached a condition of his Student visa relating to satisfactory academic performance in the course in which he had been enrolled at Sydney Institute of Business and Technology (SIBT) at Macquarie University.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The notice gave particulars of his attendance and academic progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 The notice advised the appellant he had to report personally to a Compliance Officer at the Department or his visa would be cancelled on the 28 th day after the date of the notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 On 19 April 2005 the appellant attended at the Department and was issued with a notice of intention to consider cancellation pursuant to s 116 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The notice stated that a breach of condition 8202 may have occurred for failing to achieve satisfactory academic progress in 2004/2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">7 The appellant was interviewed on 31 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On the same day the delegate decided to cancel the appellant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The reasons given were:
 
 'I am satisfied that Mr Shiang (sic) has breached visa condition 8202 by failing to meet course requirements with unsatisfactory academic progress during 2004/3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Therefore, student visa has been cancelled s116(1)(b) and s116(3) and reg 2.43(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mandatory cancellation applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 

8 The appellant applied to the Tribunal on 6 June 2005 for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">9 On 11 May 2005 the appellant wrote a letter in support of his application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In that letter he said that he had encountered many difficulties in his study mainly because he had never encountered economic issues in his home country and therefore could not quite understand the basic concepts in economics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He said some of his teachers had problems in their teaching approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He also said the design of the syllabus was a problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He said that he did not sit for his final exam last time because he suffered from nerve pain in his ankle, kneecap and hip, such that he was unable to walk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He said he had received three conditional warnings that his failure rate should not be more than 50 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">His exams fell on Chinese New Year's Eve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">He developed food poisoning and was unable to attend the examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He sought a deferred examination which was granted but the notice of intention to cancel his visa was received in the meantime and he was excluded from enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">10 The Tribunal wrote to the SIBT at which the appellant was enrolled as part of his Bachelor of Commerce-Accounting course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It asked SIBT to complete a form relating to the appellant's academic results for Semester 3, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">SIBT responded advising that the appellant had not maintained at least satisfactory academic results for that semester.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 On 18 August 2005 the Tribunal sent a copy of SIBT's response to the appellant for comment in accordance with s 359A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">He was invited to comment on the following information:
 
 'On 16 August 2005, the Tribunal contacted your education provider, SIBT in relation to your academic results for Semester 3, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">As a result, SIBT certified that you did not achieve at least satisfactory academic results for Semester 3, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">' 
 

12 He was further advised:
 
 'This information is relevant to the review because it is a requirement of your visa that you comply with condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Condition 8202 requires that you achieve an academic result that is considered to be at least satisfactory by your education provider in each term or semester and that you attain an attendance record of at least 80% for the course or the term or semester if your course is structured in such a way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Failure to comply with condition 8202 shall lead to mandatory cancellation of your visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">If the Tribunal finds that you have not complied with condition 8202, it may have no option other than to affirm the cancellation of your visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">' 
 

13 He was invited to reply within five working days and if he failed to comply the Tribunal might proceed in accordance with s 359C of the Act without taking any further action to obtain his comments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He did not respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">14 The Tribunal concluded that the appellant had not complied with condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">It said:
 
 '27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The review applicant's education provider, SIBT, has advised that the review applicant did not achieve an academic result which it considered to be at least satisfactory for Semester 3 of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The review applicant has provided reasons as to why he achieved poor results whilst at SIBT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">However, in relation to a cancellation pursuant to section 116 and regulation 2.43, the Tribunal's role is limited to determining whether there has been a breach of the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The Tribunal does not have any discretion to set aside a visa cancellation where there has been a substantiated breach of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Once non-compliance with the condition is established the Tribunal is bound, by the operation of s116(3), to affirm the visa cancellation ( MIMA v Hou [2002] FCA 574 ; MIMA v Nguyen [2002] FCA 460).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 
 28.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal finds that the review applicant breached condition 8202 in relation to academic results in Semester 3 of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Given the finding of a relevant breach, the combined operation of subsection 116(3) and regulation 2.43 requires that the visa held by the review applicant be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The delegate's decision to this effect should be affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">' 
 

15 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The grounds of the application were:
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">In the matter of Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) FMCA 127 , Driver SM (sic) found that the Tribunal would be in error if it found that the principles in Shrestha could be applied so as to result in a residual discretion not to cancel a visa where the evidence was that condition 8202 had not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Although not central to the outcome in Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the reasoning of Driver FM applies the decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Shang.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Submissions were made to Emmett J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Nguyen in relation to the impact of the provisions of section 137L and the new automatic cancellation provision in Subdivision GB, these submissions should be given judicial support such that they could be applied by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The mandatory nature of the cancellation power under section 116, as now confirmed by the Federal Court of Australia, when read in conjunction with the provisions of section 137L should lead to more favourable legislative provisions being available to those who do not report to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in accordance with a notice issued under the Education Services for Overseas Student Act 2000 than those who do report to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">In light of judicial consideration of this issue, it is the applicant's view that the reasoning of Madgwick J in Shrestha's case should be applied to this application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In the paragraph 25 of Findings and Reasons of the MRT decision, the Tribunal Member found that the applicant had a poor attendance rate in relation to his review and this poor attendance was a breach of visa condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">As a matter of fact, attendance rate was not an issue in the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Tribunal has made an error in this finding and reached a decision which otherwise would not have been reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">
 
 6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">In the same paragraph, the Tribunal has made a finding that the applicant was doing Bachelor of Information Technology when his visa was cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">This finding is incorrect as the applicant was not a student of information technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Tribunal has made an error in this finding and reached a decision which would not otherwise been (sic) reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">' 
 
 

16 The Federal Magistrate addressed the rather discursive grounds before him which he said did not identify any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Scarlett FM dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">17 The notice of appeal to this Court was in the following form:
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The decision contains errors of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Grounds for argument have been identified and will submit to court in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Legal representations are sought and will step in in due course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 
 

18 Shortly before the hearing, the appellant retained counsel who immediately before the hearing provided the Court with an outline of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The matter was adjourned for a short time to allow the respondent to consider the appellant's contentions and the matter then proceeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">19 Before addressing the appellant's argument, it would be useful to set out the relevant legislation and subordinate legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">At the relevant time, s 116 provided:
 
 ' Section 116.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Power to cancel 
 
 
 
 (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: 
 
 ... 
 
 (b) its holder has not complied with a condition of the visa; or 
 
 ... 
 
 (3) If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 

20 It was argued by the appellant that s 116(3) of the Act was only enlivened if the Minister were satisfied that there had been a breach of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">21 The grounds for cancellation of the visa are prescribed by reg 2.43 which also at the relevant time provided:
 
 ' Regulation 2.43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Grounds for cancellation of visa (Act, s.116) 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (2) For subsection 116(3) of the Act, the circumstances in which the Minister must cancel a visa are: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, that the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) condition 8104 or 8105 (if the condition applies to the visa); or 
 
 (ii) condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 
 

22 Condition 8202 was, and is in the following form:
 
 '(1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">
 
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course; or 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 or 571 (Schools Sector) visa who is a secondary exchange student -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 (3) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records -- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term and semester of the course; and 
 
 
 
 (b) in any case -- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory; 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 
 
 (4) In the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">' 
 

23 It can be seen that if the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition 8202 the Minister must cancel the visa holder's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It was contended, because of the provisions of condition 8202, that a visa holder could only comply with that condition if the visa holder complied with both paragraphs (2) and (3) of condition 8202: Gerhard v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 495 ; Tian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 238.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">24 The appellant contended that when the Minister was called upon to consider whether there had been a failure to comply with condition 8202 the Minister had to satisfy herself as to the whole of the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In those circumstances, the Minister had to address whether or not the appellant had complied with both paragraph (3)(a) and paragraph (3)(b) of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">It was submitted that in this case the Minister had only applied her mind to condition 8202(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Therefore, it was argued, the Minister had failed to address the right question, reg 2.43(2)(b) was not enlivened and therefore s 116(3) had no application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">25 It was conceded in argument that if the Minister had addressed paragraph (3)(a) of condition 8202, the Minister would still have found that there had been a failure to comply because of the appellant's failure to comply with condition 8202(3)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Nevertheless, it was submitted there was jurisdictional error because the Minister did not address each of the criteria attaching to the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">26 In my opinion, that argument must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">It is true that to comply with condition 8202 a visa holder must comply with both conditions 8202(2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That is made clear by condition 8202(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">I also agree that the obligations imposed in condition 8202(3) are cumulative so that a visa holder must comply with both paragraphs (a) and (b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It follows, therefore, that if a visa holder does not comply with condition 8202(2) the visa holder will have failed to comply with the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It also follows that if the visa holder does not comply with paragraphs (a) or (b) of condition 8202(3) then, again, the visa holder, even if the visa holder has complied with condition 8202, will have failed to comply with condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">27 That does not, however, mean that before the Minister can be satisfied that there has been a failure to comply with condition 8202 the Minister must address all of the matters in condition 8202(2) and (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It is enough if the Minister is satisfied that either condition 8202(2) has not been complied with or either of paragraphs (a) or (b) of condition 8202(3) have not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">28 If the Minister is satisfied that one of the three criteria has not been complied with, then that is enough for the Minister to be satisfied that the condition has not been complied with and therefore enliven reg 2.43(2)(b) requiring the Minister under s 116(3) to cancel the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">29 If the construction were as contended for by the appellant, it would mean that the Minister would need first to consider whether the holder met the requirements of subclause (2) of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">If the Minister were satisfied that the holder is not enrolled in a registered course, on the appellant's argument, the Minister would then have to consider the matters in subclause (3) of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There would, however, be no education provider who could provide the information to the Minister in subclause (3)(a) or provide the certificate contemplated in subclause (3)(b) because the holder would not have been enrolled in a registered course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">30 That demonstrates, in my opinion, that there is no obligation of the kind contended for by the appellant resting upon the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">31 Moreover, the inquiry which is being undertaken for the purpose of s 116 is not as to whether the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has complied with any part of condition 8202 but only whether the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Because as the appellant contends all of the matters in condition 8202 are cumulative upon each other, the Minister can be satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with the condition when the Minister is satisfied that any one of the criteria has not been complied with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">32 In this case, the Tribunal satisfied itself that the appellant was in breach of condition 8202.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">That meant that because of the provisions of reg 2.43(2)(b), s 116(3) was enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">In those circumstances, the Minister was obliged to cancel the appellant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">33 In this case, once the Minister was satisfied that paragraph (3)(b) of condition 8202 had not been complied with, the Minister was under statutory obligation to cancel the appellant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">In those circumstances, it cannot be said that the Tribunal's decision is wrong or that the Federal Magistrate erred in dismissing the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">34 The appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.</sentence>
