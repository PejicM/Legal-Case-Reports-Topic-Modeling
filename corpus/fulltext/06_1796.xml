1 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Piggott Wood &amp; Baker (a firm) [2006] FCA 1774 I upheld the Liquidator's claim for remuneration for work done and expenses incurred in responding to requests by ASIC for information as to the progress of the winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I directed the parties to file written submissions on costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Notwithstanding the very tight time frame dictated by the onset of the long vacation, the parties have provided concise and well argued submissions, for which I thank them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 Because the Liquidator has succeeded in obtaining the relief claimed there will be an order that he recover his costs of and incidental to the interlocutory applications dated 22 September and 5 December 2006 out of the Guarantee Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">These are part of his costs and expenses in terms of the Winding Up Order as amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 While it is true that the Liquidator failed in his primary submission that the District Registrar's confirmation of the remuneration and expenses in question was final and conclusive, the making of that submission did not significantly increase costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The hearing was disposed of in a day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The payment of the Liquidator's costs out of the Guarantee Fund is consistent with the terms of the Winding Up Order as amended and s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 (Tas).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Payment out of the proceeds of the winding up is not appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I am informed that there is no present fund against which costs orders could operate and there is no guarantee that there will be any further funds in fact recovered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Moreover, the fund derived from recovered monies is not a pooled fund and there would be great practical difficulty in apportioning the costs across individual loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 Counsel for ASIC undertakes on behalf of his client not to seek or otherwise procure payment of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">I should note in this context that nothing in my substantive decision should be taken as criticism of ASIC, which has been acting properly in performance of its statutory functions and, through its counsel, provided the Court with helpful submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 The Solicitors' Trust was given leave to be heard, read affidavits and made submissions opposing the Liquidator's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It was reasonable for it to do so in order to protect the integrity of the Guarantee Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">7 As I read its counsel's submissions, the Trust does not seek any costs order for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Presumably this is because its costs will be recovered from the Guarantee Fund as an ordinary cost of administering the Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">If there is any doubt about this, I would be prepared to make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 However, the Trust did seek an order that ASIC should pay a "substantial proportion" of the Liquidator's costs since the Liquidator's application was brought as a result of ASIC's stance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I do not propose to make such an order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">ASIC has not acted unreasonably.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In substance this was a case where both the Liquidator and ASIC were seeking the advice and directions of the Court in the course of a winding up by the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Associate:
