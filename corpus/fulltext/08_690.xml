 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 20 March 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 12 May 2007 and handed down on 1 June 2007: see MZXRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 318.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of India who arrived in Australia on 17 November 2005 on a student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">On 8 December 2006 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, as it was then known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 25 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 14 February 2007 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
3 The appellant claimed that he suffered persecution on the grounds of religion and membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He was a Hindu whose Muslim girlfriend became pregnant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He also claimed that, as a result his girlfriend's family searched for him to kill him and threatened his family with weapons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant asserted that he and his family were beaten and that his family had to flee their home and could not send him money to finish his studies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He claimed that he would be killed if he returned to India, and that the authorities could not protect him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 On 21 February 2007 the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellant pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") which invited him to comment on: the length of time it took the appellant to lodge his protection visa application and the absence of any evidence which supported his assertion that his family was required to flee their home town due to the conflict with his girlfriend's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 15 March 2007 the Tribunal received a reply from the appellant, which stated the reason the appellant lodged his application "late" was "due to the latest information [he] received from India" and attached a letter in support of his assertion that his family were in hiding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal sent the appellant a further s 424A letter on 27 March 2007 which invited the appellant to comment on: the failure by the appellant to advise the Tribunal that he was denied an Australian student visa in 2004, as he had provided fraudulent documentation; the fact that the appellant lodged his protection visa application approximately three weeks before his student visa was due to expire; contradictory evidence from the appellant and his mother in relation to the appellant's beatings, the appellant's parents alleged captivity and actual living circumstances and the identity of the appellant's alleged girlfriend; and the appellant's mother's inability to provide corroborative evidence in relation to how the appellant met his alleged girlfriend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The appellant replied to this letter on 17 April 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was a credible witness for the following reasons:
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant omitted to advise the Tribunal that he had attempted to travel to Australia in 2004 as a student, and only acknowledged this when it was put to him at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 17 April 2007, in response to the 27 March 2007 s 424A letter, the appellant claimed that the reason for his application in 2004 was to leave India with his girlfriend and to live with her overseas in safety;
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The appellant's student visa ceased on 7 August 2006 and the appellant would have been required to leave Australia by 31 December 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The appellant did not refer to any details of the reasons for the cessation of his student visa and told the Tribunal he intended to continue his studies in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Departmental information indicated that the appellant did not have any further options for remaining in Australia when he lodged his protection visa application on 8 December 2006' 
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant had remained in Australia for over one year before applying for a protection visa;
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appellant's limited knowledge and vague evidence in relation to his purported girlfriend;
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The appellant's mother gave evidence that contradicted the appellant's evidence at the Tribunal hearing; and
 
6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The appellant gave vague evidence about the harm allegedly suffered by his parents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">6 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was in a relationship with a Muslim girl and found that neither he nor his family suffered persecution as a result of such a relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Tribunal was not satisfied the appellant was a person to whom Australia had protection obligations under the Refugee Convention and affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
 7 On 27 June 2007 the appellant filed an application seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The appellant claimed that: 
 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error by denying the appellant procedural fairness;
 
2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal misinterpreted or misapplied the relevant law, asked itself the wrong question and failed to address the correct issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal, he claimed, "focussed too narrowly on the factual questions of whether the events alleged by the [appellant] had occurred rather than on the issue of why the [appellant] feared persecution";
 
3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The decision of the Tribunal was affected by bias and that its decision was similar to the delegate's decision, which indicated that the Tribunal and the delegate had worked together and that the Tribunal did not fairly consider his application;
 
4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error by failing to consider relevant documentary evidence; and
 
5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The Tribunal failed to consider relevant material that supported the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution in performing its decision-making function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 The Federal Magistrate could discern no denial of procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">He examined the Tribunal's decision, and the Court Book materials, and noted that the Tribunal had sent the appellant two "comprehensive" s 424A letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">His Honour noted that the Tribunal had permitted the appellant's mother to give evidence at the hearing, at the appellant's request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 His Honour also rejected the second ground, noting that:
 
 "It is clearly permissible to look to past events as offering a reasonable guide to what may be expected in the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In the context of the facts revealed by this particular case, the Tribunal's approach was entirely open to it, and, in my view, wholly proper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">" 

10 The Federal Magistrate accepted the First Respondent's submission that there was simply no basis on which to make out any finding of bias on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">His Honour noted that the fact that the outcome of the decisions of the Tribunal and the delegate were the same was not sufficient for establishing bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In any event, his Honour noted that the delegate had accepted that the appellant had a relationship with the Muslim girl and that the Tribunal had rejected this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">11 In relation to the appellant's allegation that the Tribunal failed to consider relevant material, the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal dealt with all aspects of the appellant's claim but "did not believe him" and did not fall into jurisdictional error by rejecting the appellant's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">12 The Federal Magistrate also dismissed four additional claims raised by the appellant at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">First, his Honour rejected the assertion the interpretation was inadequate as there was no evidence or anything in the materials that indicated any difficulties of interpretation prevented the appellant from putting material before the Tribunal or improperly influenced the proceeding or its outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Secondly, his Honour rejected the appellant's claim that his mother had been asked questions that were unduly sensitive, and found the Tribunal's decision recorded and dealt with the mother's evidence in a manner that was "wholly unobjectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">" Thirdly, the Federal Magistrate found that there was no basis for the appellant's assertion that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 430 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Finally, his Honour found that there was no basis for the appellant's claim that the Tribunal was asked to examine independent country information and declined to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">His Honour found that there had been no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 
13 The notice of appeal to this Court was filed on 7 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The appellant claimed that his Honour erred in: finding that the Tribunal was not biased; not finding that the Tribunal erred in rejecting the appellant's claims in relation to his girlfriend as this was contrary to the delegate's decision and not supported by the evidence; and finding that the Tribunal was not obliged to look at independent country information put forward by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">14 At the hearing today the appellant was assisted by an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The appellant confirmed that he had had the decision of the Tribunal explained to him and that friends had assisted him to prepare his application to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">15 The decision of the Federal Magistrates Court had been interpreted for him by the interpreter before the hearing commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The appellant understood the Federal Magistrate's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">16 The appellant had received assistance from legal aid personnel in preparing his notice of appeal and also had assistance in preparing submissions which were filed in support of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The written submissions of the Minister had been translated for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The notice of appeal contained three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">17 The first ground appearing in the notice of appeal reads as follows:
 
 "The learned Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal was examining the truthful (sic) or otherwise of my assertions without realizing it has (sic) dealt with a closed mindset not open for persuasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">" 

I understand this to raise an allegation of actual bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">This ground was also raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It was dismissed for want of supporting material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I can find no evidence in the Tribunal's reasons or in other material appearing in the Court Book which supports such a serious claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It was properly rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The second ground appearing in the notice of appeal reads:
 
 "The Tribunal decision of not believing that (sic) I had an affair with a Muslim girl was contrary to the delegate (sic) decision and was not supported by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The learned magistrate erred in holding with (sic) the Tribunal at this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">" 

The reason that the Tribunal rejected the evidence of the appellant relating to the alleged affair was that the evidence given by the appellant was vague and inconsistent and had been contradicted in material respects by his mother's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There was a reasonable basis for the Tribunal concluding that it doubted the appellant's credibility on this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">If the ground also suggests that the learned Magistrate erred in holding that there was evidence that entitled the Tribunal to reject the appellant's credibility, and I am not sure that the Federal Magistrate was invited to make such a finding, the learned learned Magistrate did not err in so holding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The third ground appearing in the notice of appeal reads 
 
 "The learned magistrate in finding that the [T]ribunal was not obliged to look at country information put forward by me and it was a jurisdictional error not to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">" 

18 I have carefully read the Magistrates reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">I can find no finding to the effect alleged in the third ground in those reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Indeed, it would be surprising if there were one because there is no evidence that the appellant invited the Tribunal to look at country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">19 I therefore reject the grounds advanced in the notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">20 The written submissions that were filed in support of the appeal contain three paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The first deals with the allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Some attempt is made to particularise the ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It is said that the Tribunal was hesitant to permit the appellant's mother to give evidence, and when it agreed to do so, sought to discredit both the appellant and his mother rather than establish the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The appellant cites by way example question relating to the colour of his alleged girlfriend's eyes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">He says that the colour of her eyes was not relevant to fact finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">I disagree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It was relevant to determining the appellant's credibility, particularly when the appellant's mother was asked the same question and gave a different answer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">21 The paragraph also alleges that the Tribunal engaged in what is described as character assassination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It is said that this occurred because the Tribunal gave too much weight to the failed student visa application made by the appellant in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It is said that this was not an issue before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In my view, the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to this evidence if only to assess the credibility of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The paragraph concludes by alleging that the Tribunal embarked upon its review "with a mind fixed upon rejecting my claims".</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">This is an even stronger assertion of actual bias.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">What I have already said in relation to the first of the grounds appearing in the notice of appeal applies with even greater force in relation to this contention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">22 The second paragraph of the submissions contends that the Tribunal was obliged to give reasons for not believing that the appellant had an affair with a Muslim girl.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">In my view, it is clear from the Tribunal's reasons that it did explain precisely why it rejected the appellant's claim to have an affair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The paragraph concludes with a further allegation of actual bias which I reject for the same reasons as I have earlier explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">23 The third paragraph of the submission states that the appellant had placed before the Tribunal the contention that, because he was a person of Hindu faith, he had a well founded fear of persecution by reason of his membership of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">He does not identify what that group was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He does however say that his fear of persecution arose from his association with a woman of Muslim faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">He complains that the Tribunal has not assessed this claim and thereby fallen into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It is clear enough that the particular social group to which the appellant refers is a group which contains people who have associated with persons of the opposite sex who have a different religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Tribunal did consider the appellant's claims which were founded upon his relationship with a Muslim woman.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It found that he did not have such a relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">There was therefore no evidentiary foundation for the claimed fear of persecution by reason of his alleged membership of a particular social group which contained men and women of different faiths.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">24 When invited to elaborate on his grounds of appeal at the hearing this afternoon, the appellant raised yet another fresh ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It was that, when he appeared before the Tribunal, he had verbally requested that additional witnesses should be heard but that the Tribunal did not indicate a willingness to receive such evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">No ground based on this alleged failure was raised in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">No ground based on this alleged failure of the Tribunal to receive the evidence was raised in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There is no evidence before the Court that such a request was made and rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There is in evidence a document in which the appellant was invited to notify the Tribunal of any witnesses he wished to have called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The only witness nominated by him in that document was his mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">She was heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In any event, the Tribunal was under no obligation to receive additional evidence: see s 426 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">25 The appellant seeks therefore to raise this afternoon four grounds that were not raised on earlier occasions or in the notice of appeal filed in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">No explanation is given as to why these grounds were not earlier raised other than it had not occurred to the appellant to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">For reasons which I have given in dealing with each of the grounds, I consider that none of them has any prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I have nonetheless given them careful attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">26 In my opinion, none of the grounds raised in the notice of appeal, or in the additional submissions warrant a finding that the Tribunal committed any jurisdictional error in determining the appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Nor can I find any basis in the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons to suggest any appellable error on his part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tracey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">Associate:
