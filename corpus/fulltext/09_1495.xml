<sentence id="s0">
 INTRODUCTION The modern poker machine bears only passing resemblance to the original machines which first appeared in the United States in the latter part of the 19 th century.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Today, poker machines are referred to in the industry as gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">They are computer operated and viewed on video screens which simulate the spinning reels that were a feature of poker machines until the advent of the electronic era.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">In 1974, the Report of the Western Australian Royal Commission into Gambling described the playing of poker machines as a "mindless, repetitive and insidious form of gambling which has many undesirable features".</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">More recently, Jagot J referred to the concerns raised by a Local Council about the vulnerability of persons to the misuse and abuse of gaming machines and the extent to which these concerns are addressed in the provisions of the Gaming Machines Act 2001 (NSW): see Waugh Hotel Management v Marrickville Council [2007] NSWLEC 775 ; (2007) 156 LGERA 414 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Notwithstanding these remarks, the manufacturers of those machines are nevertheless entitled to have their intellectual property protected against counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The essence of the applicants' case is that the respondents were participants in a joint venture to counterfeit and sell, principally in South America, second hand gaming machines assembled in Australia using pirated copies of materials in which the applicants hold the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The allegations of copyright piracy were vigorously denied by the respondents in proceedings which occupied more than four weeks of court time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The principal question which arises is whether I can infer copyright infringement in the absence of direct evidence of the gaming machines which are said to have been counterfeited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">OVERVIEW The applicants (collectively "the Aristocrat companies") are engaged in various ways in the manufacture, distribution and sale of gaming machines and gaming machine components in Australia and internationally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The respondents participate in various ways in the business of refurbishing and supplying used gaming machines to overseas markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">There are three groups of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The first group is Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd ("Global") and its principal, Mr Anthony Edward Andrews (collectively "the Global respondents").</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The second is Impact Gaming Pty Ltd ("Impact") and its principal, Mr Francis George Bernard Cragen (collectively "the Impact respondents").</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The third is Tonita Enterprises Pty Ltd ("Tonita") and its principal, Mr Riad Allam (collectively "the Tonita respondents").</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">There was no real question that there was a joint venture for the supply of refurbished gaming machines to overseas markets between the Global/Impact respondents from about April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Nor can there be any real dispute that from about the same time, the Tonita respondents, or Mr Allam personally, carried out significant technical work and business functions for the Global/Impact Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Aristocrat companies obtained Anton Piller orders which were executed at the premises of each group of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Large numbers of components of Aristocrat gaming machines were seized at each of the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Aristocrat companies claim that the seized materials include counterfeit copies of materials in which they held the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Much of the seized materials consisted of computer hard drives, but the materials included certain items of hardware and software which were an important part of the Aristocrat companies' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The first was game software stored on sets of removable memory chips called Erasable Programme Read Only Memory chips which are known in the industry by the acronym EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The software stored on the EPROM storage devices enable electronic games to be played on the modern form of poker machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">All EPROMs produced by the Aristocrat companies contain labels which identify, amongst other things, the particular Aristocrat game contained on the EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Aristocrat companies claim that their EPROM labels have certain specific recognisable formats and characters and that they are printed using specific printing methods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Aristocrat companies claim that the seized EPROMs were counterfeit because a number of their witnesses gave evidence that the labels on the EPROMs were not in the format used by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In addition, a number of electronic EPROM label files and templates were amongst the material seized from the respondents, a fact which the Aristocrat companies say is evidence of the fabrication of EPROM labels and the EPROMs to which they were attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The second important item seized on the Anton Piller raids was compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It is a regulatory requirement in NSW that a gaming machine must have an approved compliance plate affixed to it before it leaves the premises of a licensed dealer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The compliance plate affixed to such a gaming machine has a unique serial number which enables the regulatory authority in NSW to access information about that machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">There are similar regulatory requirements in Queensland and the ACT (but much of the South American market appears to be unregulated).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The seized materials included nearly 100 compliance plates which resemble genuine Aristocrat compliance plates but which the Aristocrat companies claim to be counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Various features of the seized compliance plates are relied upon to support the Aristocrat companies' contention that the seized items are not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">One such feature is that some of the seized compliance plates were blank, and it is said that blank compliance plates would not normally be available in the market place for legitimate purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, a complication arises in relation to this issue because in a transaction referred to as the "Uruguay" or "Nuevestar" transaction, the Aristocrat companies put into circulation certain blank compliance plates originally destined for South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I will describe the transaction in more detail below but it appears that some of the blank compliance plates associated with it re-entered NSW when the Global/Impact respondents obtained an interest in the gaming machines that were the subject of that transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The allegations of counterfeiting were hotly contested by all of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">One of the most bitter contests related to the materials seized on the raid at the premises of the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Four imaged copies of computer hard drives were seized at those premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I will describe the seized materials in more detail later but they included an imaged copy of a loose hard disk drive known as the "Loose HDD" which Mr Allam claims to have been planted at his premises to incriminate him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Loose HDD contained software of a kind used to burn EPROMs (the "Dataman software") and folders that were connected to an EPROM programming device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The folders contained files that indicated that the Dataman software had been used in connection with game software that was found on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There was no suggestion that another computer seized at the premises of the Tonita respondents (the "Georges Hall Desktop 2") had been deliberately planted for an ulterior purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That computer showed that the Dataman software had been used in the same way on it as the use which was detected on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">However, the Tonita respondents submit that the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer was located in an area at the Tonita respondents' premises which was easily accessible by all employees at the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Anton Piller orders were obtained upon the basis of evidence given by Mr Christos Channa, a disaffected former employee of the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Channa provided the Aristocrat companies with a disk described as CCC-14, which he said he had obtained from Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The disk contained binary game files and there was evidence that it had been viewed on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Mr Allam claimed that the disk, CCC-14, was fabricated either by Mr Channa or another person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tonita respondents made a substantial attack on Mr Channa's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">At the heart of the attack was the fact that Mr Channa received payments from the Aristocrat companies for providing evidence in support of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The essence of the defence of the Global/Impact respondents is that for many years, they have been engaged in refurbishing and supplying used gaming machines with genuine Aristocrat artwork and software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The essence of the Tonita respondents' defence is that Mr Allam operates his own business which is, and was at all times, distinct from that of the Global/Impact business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">As I have said, the allegations of counterfeiting are strenuously denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The respondents also complained that the "snowstorm of paper" tendered against them by the Aristocrat companies was insufficient to establish the necessary elements of the serious claim made against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">In particular, they submitted that, notwithstanding the substantial resources of the Aristocrat companies, there was no physical evidence of infringing material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In my view, the often repeated refrain of the respondents as to the absence of physical evidence is an overstatement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It ignores the force of the evidence obtained on the execution of the Anton Piller orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Ultimately, the Aristocrat companies identified 54 transactions of the respondents in relation to 618 Aristocrat gaming machines which they claimed that the respondents sold with infringing copies of Aristocrat games and artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The total value of the 618 machines, according to the respondents' invoices was $1,096,690.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">At the heart of the case is the question of whether the mass of material tendered by the Aristocrat companies is sufficient to satisfy their evidentiary onus and whether the denials of Mr Andrews, Mr Cragen and Mr Allam ought to be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">THE CAUSES OF ACTION RELIED UPON The Aristocrat companies pleaded and particularised a large number of causes of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">After the evidence closed, they provided a document setting out the claims which they maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">
 3.1 Copyright 
 The Aristocrat companies claim that the respondents have, in the course of carrying out their business or businesses, reproduced, manufactured, supplied, offered to sell or distributed: These acts are said to have been carried out either separately or as part of the manufacture and sale of machines that were sold as Aristocrat gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Aristocrat companies claim that Aristocrat game software is a literary work within the meaning of s 10(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">They claim that Aristocrat compliance plates and their layout are artistic works within the meaning of that sub-section of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">They also claim that Aristocrat artwork constitutes artistic work within the meaning of s 10(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The respondents did not challenge the subsistence of copyright or the Aristocrat companies' claim of ownership in the literary or artistic works in those items.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Aristocrat companies claim that the respondents, by doing the acts which I have set out in [36] above, have infringed their copyright in those works under s 36 of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In addition to the claims of primary infringement under s 36 , the Aristocrat companies also allege that by dealing with infringing copies of the works with knowledge or constructive knowledge of the infringements, the respondents are guilty of secondary infringement of copyright under s 38 of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Aristocrat companies claim compensatory damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act in an amount in excess of $1.5 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">They also claim additional damages under s 115(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Although the Aristocrat companies also claim damages for conversion under s 116 of the Copyright Act , that claim is made in the alternative, if the damages awarded under 
 s 115(2) are not an adequate remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">In respect of each type of primary infringement by any respondent, the Aristocrat companies maintain a claim of authorisation infringement under s 36(1) and s 36(1A) against all of the respondents, but only from 24 May 2004 which was the date of incorporation of Impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">A number of infringements are alleged to have occurred before that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Authorisation infringements in respect of those transactions are maintained only against Global and Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 3.2 Trade Marks 
 The Aristocrat companies claim that by engaging in the acts referred to in [36] above, the respondents have infringed their registered trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The relevant marks include ARISTOCRAT and the names of various games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">They accept that if damages are awarded under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act , no further damages for trade mark infringement would be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 3.3 Trade Practices Act 
 The Aristocrat companies allege that by "rebirthing" gaming machines with counterfeit Aristocrat works, the respondents have represented in trade or commerce that the rebirthed machines emanate from the Aristocrat companies and have their approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">They claim that the representations were false because the rebirthed machines have important components that are not authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Nevertheless, as with the claims of trade mark infringement, the Aristocrat companies accept that if they are awarded damages under 
 s 115(2) of the Copyright Act , no further claim for damages under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) would be appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">
 3.4 Conversion of Behong stock 
 The Aristocrat companies make a claim against the Tonita respondents for conversion of a large number of items of stock and equipment acquired by those respondents from Behong Import &amp; Export (Australia) Pty Ltd ("Behong"), a scrap merchant located in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Behong was appointed by one of the Aristocrat companies as its authorised scrap collector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">I will refer in more detail below to the basis upon which the claim of conversion is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It is sufficient to say by way of introduction that the Aristocrat companies claim that the effect of their contractual arrangements with Behong was that Behong was prevented from on-selling for reuse as gaming machine equipment the stock obtained by Behong under the scrapping contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Aristocrat companies claim that the Tonita respondents acquired from Behong second hand gaming machines and equipment, the property in which remained with the Aristocrat companies, and that by using the components in the assembly of other machines, the Tonita respondents converted the components to their own use, or to the use of the Global/Impact respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The Aristocrat companies also allege that the Global/Impact respondents are joint tortfeasors with the Tonita respondents in the tort of conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 3.5 Accessorial liability 
 The Aristocrat companies claim that each of the respondents is liable as a joint tortfeasor with the other respondents for copyright infringement, trade mark infringement and conversion, as explained briefly below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The claim against the Global/Impact respondents is that: The claim against the Tonita respondents is that they were engaged by the Global/Impact Joint Venture for reward, to supply services and to procure parts and equipment for the purposes of the joint venture and that they are "so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act[s], that it is just that [they] should be rendered liable": Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 220 ALR 1 at [434] ; cf Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 at [1] , [74], [161].</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Alternatively, the Aristocrat companies claim that, in any event, the Tonita respondents were acting with the full countenance and approval of the Global/Impact respondents who are therefore vicariously liable for the unlawful acts of the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS AND STRUCTURE OF THE JUDGMENT The 54 transactions identified by the Aristocrat companies cover the period from September 2001 to February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Since the Global/Impact Joint Venture commenced at the earliest on 24 May 2004, the transactions which took place before that date were alleged only against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The transactions before that date cover those which were numbered 1 to 33 in the Aristocrat companies' schedule of infringing transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">One of the transactions falling into this category was known as the "Play King Transaction" because it involved the sale by Global to a company in Peru known as Play King SA ("Play King").</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Play King Transaction is of some importance in these proceedings, in particular because there was direct evidence that a number of the machines which were the subject of the transaction were inspected in Peru and found to be counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I will therefore deal separately with the Play King transaction before turning to the balance of the Aristocrat companies' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">All of the claims in respect of the remaining transactions depend upon whether I am prepared to draw the inferences of infringement sought by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The inferences of infringement are said to flow from a vast quantity of material that was adduced in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">This included: I will deal separately with each of these evidentiary bases for the claim of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Before doing so, I will set out certain background facts which are not controversial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">They are drawn from a document entitled "Factual Findings Contended for by the Applicants".</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">In stating these facts, I have taken into account the submissions of the respondents, in particular the comments of the Tonita respondents who resisted some of the findings sought by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">BACKGROUND FACTS

<sentence id="s112">AI primarily sells products to its subsidiary companies in various markets for on-sale to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">AI is responsible for the export, distribution and sale of Aristocrat's products to third parties outside Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">ATI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AI, and is based in the state of Nevada in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">It is engaged in the manufacture and supply of Aristocrat gaming machines in North and South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The Aristocrat companies led evidence that under the Aristocrat corporate group's internal organisational arrangements, Aristocrat is the designated holder of all of their intellectual property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">They summarised the relevant licence arrangements in the table below.</sentence>

<sentence id="s128">The Tonita respondents challenged the summary of licence arrangements put forward by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In essence, they argued that the evidence that had been produced did not support the findings for which the Aristocrat companies contend, and in particular, the agreements had not been proven to be relevant and important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The records which had been produced, they argued, were in a "poor state", thereby calling into question the accuracy and reliability of any records held by the Aristocrat companies in relation to licensing and the absence of any license held by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Global/Impact respondents also challenged the purported terms and effectiveness of the license agreements relied upon by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In particular, they denied that none of the respondents were licensed by the Aristocrat companies, and submitted that the respondents, as recipients of second-hand Aristocrat gaming machines, have an implied license to use the intellectual property contained in those gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">

<sentence id="s171">In the case of those Aristocrat gaming machines that use EPROMs in order to operate, the data must be "printed" to a complete set of EPROMs before it can be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Each Aristocrat gaming machine uses multiple EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">It is not in dispute that one of the manufacturers of devices used to burn EPROMs is known as "Dataman".</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Dataman supplies portable EPROM burning devices, which allow files contained on EPROMs to be easily uploaded to a computer hard drive and then burned onto blank EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Those burning devices also enable the software contained on an EPROM to be copied and stored on a computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">It is also not in dispute that Dataman software may be downloaded over the internet, however the relevance of this fact is challenged by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The Aristocrat companies led evidence that game software is divided into a number of separate files, which are contained on individual EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">In addition, EPROMs contain a number of pins or "legs" which enable them to be plugged into motherboards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The EPROMs must be plugged into specific locations within the motherboard of a gaming machine in order to function properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">EPROM locations are typically identified by reference to the letter "U" and a number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The respondents did not challenge this evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">However, they argue that the Aristocrat companies have provided no explanation of how the game software is divided into separate files, such that if less than a full set of such files is located, the Court might be in a position to assess the substantiality of an alleged taking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">
 5.2.3 Artwork 
 Artwork includes the visual themes, words, symbols and images which are physically printed and appear on the bottom ("belly panel") and top ("top panel") sections of a gaming machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">
 5.3 Conversion kits 
 It is possible to make changes to gaming machines (ie to change the relevant game), by way of, for instance, conversion kits, or by using components such as EPROMs and corresponding artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Conversion kits comprise game software on EPROMs and artwork panels that correspond to the game on the EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Conversion kits sold by the Global respondents also provided components to enable an upgrade of gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">
 5.4 Aristocrat Gaming Machines 
 There are different versions of gaming machines, which are referred to as "Mark IV", "Mark V", and "Mark VI".</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">It is possible to upgrade a Mark IV series to a Mark V series 1, and series 2 Mark V to a Mark VI.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Aristocrat gaming machines are comprised of the following components: The respondents do not dispute that copyright subsists in the component parts of an Aristocrat gaming machine listed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Copyright is specifically claimed by the Aristocrat companies in Aristocrat games, game software, artwork and compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">
 5.5 Aristocrat Trade Marks 
 At all relevant times, Aristocrat claims to have been the registered owner in Australia of approximately 80 registered trade marks upon or in relation to Aristocrat gaming machines and Aristocrat conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">The Tonita respondents concede the accuracy of the list of trade marks provided by the Aristocrat companies, with the exception of seven trade marks which they say are either not held by Aristocrat or have lapsed, expired or been withdrawn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Global/Impact respondents do not accept that Aristocrat owns the registered trade marks as claimed, but have not given reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">By reference to distribution and license agreements which are in evidence, the Aristocrat companies claim that at all relevant times, AI and ATI have been authorised users of Aristocrat trade marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">They also claim that each of the respondents has used one or more of the Aristocrat trade marks in the course of undertaking their activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">The respondents do not concede this, and the Tonita respondents in particular argue that it is unsafe for the Court to assume the accuracy of those assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
 5.6 Gaming Machine Markets 
 
 5.6.1 Markets in Australia and overseas 
 Markets exist for gaming machines and conversion kits throughout the world, including in Australia, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America and South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 5.6.2 Regulatory background 
 
 5.6.2.1 NEW SOUTH WALES 
 The market for gaming machines in NSW is heavily regulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">In order to undertake gaming machine-related activities, such as servicing gaming machines, selling spare parts, and dealing with compliance plates, it is necessary to hold the relevant licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">The regulatory authority in NSW used to be known as the Liquor Administration Board or "LAB", until it became the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing (the "OLGR").</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">The OLGR is responsible for administering various pieces of legislation including the Gaming Machines Act 2001 (NSW).</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The manufacture, use and servicing of gaming machines is controlled by the Australian and New Zealand Gaming Machine National Standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">These Standards regulate the configuration of a gaming machine, and together with the NSW Gaming Machine Communications Protocol, ensure that data regarding the machine's operation is sent to the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is a regulatory requirement in NSW that a gaming machine must have an approved compliance plate affixed to it before it leaves the premises of a licensed dealer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Each gaming machine contains a unique serial number on its compliance plate which enables the machine to be identified and tracked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">In NSW, Aristocrat serial numbers start with the prefix XAW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">After the prefix there is a 6 digit number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">For every gaming machine or conversion kit purchased in NSW, the purchaser must request an approval form from the OLGR to authorise the venue for its purchase and installation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Approval forms must include details such as the serial number, game being operated and venue of the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">The OLGR maintains records on all gaming machines in operation in registered clubs and hotels, based on the information supplied by venues and sellers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Aristocrat receives periodic reports from the OLGR on all Aristocrat gaming machines in circulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">The reports display the number of Aristocrat gaming machines in circulation in NSW, identified by serial number, as well as the games installed in those machines and the venue where those machines are located.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">In addition to the records held by the OLGR, the Aristocrat companies maintain their own database records of serial numbers which they have given to Aristocrat gaming machines that have been sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">This database was known as "Manfact" up until 2000 when it changed to "PeopleSoft".</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">
 5.6.2.2 REGULATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICAN EXPORT MARKETS 
 The regulation of gaming machines differs in each country in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The first South American country to pass national laws regulating gaming machines was Argentina in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Certain Latin American countries, such as Peru, require games to be specifically approved and adapted to local conditions (known as "homologated machines") and may require Spanish language games and artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">They also require demonstration that a machine has a unique serial number and has been genuinely manufactured.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In Peru, gaming machine sales consist predominantly of refurbished machines due to a combination of high import duties (45%) and relatively low average daily revenue generated by machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">In the past six years, the gaming industry has been largely unregulated and it has only recently become a more strongly regulated industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">
 5.6.2.3 RESPONDENTS' SUBMISSIONS ON REGULATION 
 The respondents do not deny the existence of the regulatory regime set out above, except that they challenge any attempt by the Aristocrat companies to relate regulatory activities that take place in NSW to any other state in Australia or any other jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The respondents do challenge certain aspects of the factual background relied upon by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">First, they deny that the "periodic reports" received by Aristocrat from the OLGR can provide assistance to the Court, as the OLGR only has jurisdiction in NSW and gaming machines are at times moved outside of NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">The respondents also contest the extent of information received by the Aristocrat companies from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">They say that the only witness who attested to the receipt of periodic reports from the OLGR acknowledged that he did not have any involvement in their actual receipt, was not familiar with how the original files arrived, and was not employed in the research department which received the reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I will discuss this in further detail below: see section 11 on the data matching exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">In addition, the respondents challenge the reliability of the Manfact and PeopleSoft database records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">They argue that the records from those databases become inaccurate as soon as a gaming machine leaves Aristocrat's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">They say that two of the witnesses for the applicants conceded that the records of gaming machines located outside NSW may have been inaccurate in certain cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">
 5.7 Joint Venture 
 
 5.7.1 Overview 
 The arrangements between Mr Andrews/Global and Mr Cragen/Impact for the sale of refurbished gaming machines to markets overseas constituted a joint venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The Global/Impact respondents admit that the Joint Venture was in place, but only from April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The Aristocrat companies allege that the Joint Venture was in place since May 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The Joint Venture's operation included the following features: Impact held any licences required for the Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The activities of the Joint Venture, including obtaining supplies for second hand gaming machines and storing them, and refurbishing gaming machines and packing them for delivery, took place at Impact's premises, the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Global had no staff permanently located at Botany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Mr Andrews went to Botany from time-to-time to ensure the activities were being conducted properly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Mr Andrews kept records relating to the Joint Venture at the Florey Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">
 5.7.2 1999/2000 to June 2003 
 From 1999 or 2000, Mr Cragen and Mr Andrews jointly supplied second hand gaming machines to customers and then issued invoices in the name of whichever of their companies (ie Global or Bondtren/Impact) had had dealings with the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">
 5.7.3 June 2003 to April 2004 
 Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen dealt with each other in relation to the supply of gaming machines to markets overseas from (at least) late 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">
 5.7.4 April 2004 to present 
 The Aristocrat companies allege that since about April 2004, Mr Andrews, Global, Mr Cragen and Impact have operated on the basis of a "joint venture arrangement" between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The Global/Impact respondents accept that from about April 2004, Impact started to become a major supplier to Global for selected transactions, and that in those selected transactions, surplus revenue may have been shared on a joint venture basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">However, as stated above, they deny that the Joint Venture was in place until April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">In about April 2005, the manner in which the Joint Venture was conducted changed at Mr Cragen's behest; thereafter, all receipts were banked into Impact's account only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">
 5.7.5 Mr Allam/Tonita's association with Joint Venture 
 Mr Allam's association with the Joint Venture included the carrying out of the following work: Mr Allam was described and regarded by Mr Andrews as the Joint Venture's "technical guy" and "main guy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Invoices were issued by Tonita to Impact which listed items including EPROM model numbers and conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">
 5.8 Nuevestar/Uruguay Transaction 
 In 2002, ATI entered into an agreement with a Uruguayan company called Nuevestar S.A. for the supply of 1300 "upright" Mark V Aristocrat gaming machines, and 1000 Mark V "slant top" Aristocrat gaming machines into the Brazil market (the "Nuevastar transaction" but also referred to during the course of the hearing as the Brazilian machines and the Uruguay project).</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The Aristocrat gaming machines were supplied by ATI into a bonded area in Montevideo for alteration and were then shipped to Brazil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">At that time, gaming machines sold in Brazil were required to be approved by the Brazilian regulatory authorities as having a particular type of cabinet which was unique to Brazil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">As a result of Brazilian gaming regulations, all of the components were removed from the Aristocrat steel cabinets and installed in Brazilian approved gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The Aristocrat gaming machine cabinets and spare parts were removed and stored in a warehouse in the Uruguay bonded area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">They did not have any games in them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">In order for the gaming machines to be put back into the market, the gaming machines would have had to have EPROMs and artwork installed onto them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">After the gaming machines were placed in the Uruguay bonded area, Aristocrat was approached by Nuevastar about repurchasing the unused cabinets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Aristocrat declined the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Evidence from the respondents' witnesses indicated that the gaming machines which formed part of the Nuevastar transaction were disassembled when shipped to Uruguay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Evidence from those witnesses also suggested that as part of the component parts of the gaming machines, loose blank compliance plates were shipped to South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">
 5.8.1 Purchase by Global/Impact and others 
 In 2004, Impact acquired a one-third interest in the unused Aristocrat gaming machine cabinets from the owners of the warehouse in which they were stored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Mr Vladimir Trajkovski and Mr Andreas Kan were business associates of Impact and Global in a venture to utilise the new cabinets for the sale of refurbished Aristocrat gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Meetings were held during the course of 2005 to set down groundwork for the arrangement between Mr Andrews, Mr Cragen, Mr Trajkovski and Mr Kan in relation to the refurbishment of Aristocrat gaming machines and placement of them into the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">One such meeting was held in Sydney in August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">Mr Andrews accompanied Mr Allam on a visit to South America on behalf of the Joint Venture in early 2005, during which a meeting took place with Mr Trajkovksi in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Approximately 100 of the gaming machines were brought back into Australia and dealt with at the Botany Premises, and then re-exported.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 5.8.2 Involvement of Mr Allam/Tonita 
 Mr Allam/Tonita participated in activities associated with the refurbishment and supply of the machines in the Nuevestar transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">Mr Allam dealt with technical issues for customers in South America via Mr Andrews, and he would sometimes be in direct contact with customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">The Aristocrat companies also claim that Mr Allam was responsible for supplying a stock of EPROMs and artwork which would allow the gaming machines to be refurbished and sold and that he manufactured counterfeit compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">
 5.9 Behong 
 
 5.9.1 Behong Agreement 
 Behong was a scrap merchant located in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">From 1 July 2005 until 30 November 2006, Aristocrat had a contractual agreement with Behong pursuant to which Behong was the appointed scrap collector for Aristocrat ("Behong Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">Under the Behong Agreement, Behong would pick up scrap inventory, comprising unusable or obsolete inventory of gaming machines and components designated for disposal, from Aristocrat's Rosebery plant, including second hand gaming machines and artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">The services provided to Aristocrat by Behong under the Behong Agreement, were described as "scrap metal containment, removal, disposal and purchasing services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The Behong Agreement included a term prohibiting Behong from on-selling for reuse material supplied to it under the Behong Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">Clause 3.5.2(b) states that Behong must "only use such rubbish and waste for scrap reclamation and must not be sold for reuse".</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">In closing addresses, the Aristocrat companies abandoned reliance on this clause but they pointed to other provisions of the Behong agreement to support the claim of conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">
 5.9.2 Mr Allam/Tonita's dealings with Behong 
 Mr Allam was first introduced to Behong and its principal, Mr Hong, through Mr David Fisher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">Mr Fisher is an electronics and gaming machine technician who has known Mr Allam for about 17 years and has provided technical services to him over a number of years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">With Mr Fisher's initial assistance, Mr Allam and Tonita purchased certain items, including Aristocrat gaming machine parts and components, from Behong in the period 1 February 2006 to 30 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The quantity included the following: The Aristocrat companies allege that as Behong was prohibited under the terms of the Behong Agreement from selling the waste obtained from Aristocrat for reuse, Behong remained the bailee of the waste until it completed its obligation to destroy it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">Consequently, the Tonita respondents' acts in dealing with the waste constituted acts of conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">The Tonita respondents do not deny that they obtained significant quantities of material from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Indeed they rely upon the fact of having obtained second-hand material from Behong to explain the presence of some of the items seized from their premises in Anton Piller raids (discussed below).</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">However, the respondents dispute that a relationship of bailment existed at the relevant time between Aristocrat and Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">They submit that the terms of the Behong Agreement do not prohibit the re-sale of the waste and that the Aristocrat companies ceased to have title or any right of possession in the waste after delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">They say that no claim in conversion can therefore be made against any of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">
 5.10 Procedural History 
 
 5.10.1 Global proceeding 
 Part of the current proceeding was initially brought against Global and Mr Andrews, and commenced by way of an application for search orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The first Anton Piller orders were made by Allsop J on 30 June 2006 against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">The search orders were executed on 3 July 2006 at: the Florey Premises; and the Mascot Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">
 5.10.2 Impact/Tonita proceeding 
 A separate proceeding against Impact, Mr Cragen, Tonita and Mr Allam (NSD 133 of 2007) was commenced by way of application for search orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">Those orders were made by Branson J on 31 January 2007 and searches took place at the following premises on 1 February 2007: Search orders were also made in relation to Mr Cragen's residence in Killarney Heights, NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">However, those search orders were unable to be executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">Mr Cragen gave evidence that at the time of the search orders he was in Argentina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">
 5.10.3 Consolidated proceedings 
 On 22 June 2007, I ordered that the Global proceeding and the Impact/Tonita proceeding be consolidated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">THE PLAY KING TRANSACTION 
 6.1 How the transaction occurred 
 On 12 July 2002, Mr Andrews received an email from one of his overseas customers, Mr Sergio Ortega Barrie about the possible supply of ten Aristocrat Mark IV gaming machines at $US650 per machine to Mr Barrie's client, Play King, in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">There was further communication between Mr Andrews and Mr Barrie about the price and number of the gaming machines to be supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It was Mr Andrews' usual practice to send pro forma invoices to his clients before sending the final commercial invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Mr Andrews' evidence is that around 14 July 2002, he sent to Mr Barrie a pro forma invoice number 352 for the supply of 20 Aristocrat Mark IV gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Pro forma invoice number 352 does not contain details of the games that were to be supplied but it does state a total price of $13,000 for the gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">At or about the same time, Mr Andrews contacted Mr Lawrence (Laurie) Birks, the principal of a Queensland based company known as Gaming Machine Consulting Services Pty Ltd. Mr Andrews' evidence was that he dealt with Mr Birks' company on about seven occasions and that the Play King transaction was one of the earliest of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">There is no written record of Mr Andrews's first communication with Mr Birks, which was by way of a telephone conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">Mr Andrews gave evidence of the conversation in very brief terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">He said that he asked Mr Birks whether Mr Birks could supply 20 Aristocrat gaming machines and that Mr Birks said he could.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">No details of the machines or their serial numbers or the games, or even the price, are mentioned in Mr Andrews' evidence of the conversation with Mr Birks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">However, he says that after the conversation, Mr Birks sent him a list of 20 Aristocrat Mark IV gaming machines that Mr Birks could supply and that Mr Andrews prepared a new pro forma invoice number 360 from that list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">Mr Andrews was unable to find the list, but the pro forma invoice was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">Pro forma invoice number 360 was dated 14 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">It was for the supply of 20 Mark IV machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Details of the serial numbers and the games were included on the invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The price stated on the pro forma invoice was US$650 per machine, with a total price of US$13,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">Following the dispatch of pro forma invoice number 360, Mr Andrews apparently had email correspondence with Mr Barrie in which Mr Barrie requested that the number of machines be increased to 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Mr Andrews was unable to locate those emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Mr Andrews' evidence is that he then telephoned Mr Birks who told him that he (Mr Birks) could supply the increased number that had been requested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Mr Andrews says he then raised commercial invoice number 360 dated 14 July 2002 but, curiously, there are a number of differences between the details on this invoice and the details recorded on pro forma invoice number 360.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">First, the price per machine on the commercial invoice is lower than on the pro forma.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The price on the pro forma was US$650 per machine whereas on the commercial invoice it was US$500 per machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">This discrepancy does not seem to be explained in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Second, the details of the games which were recorded on the pro forma invoice do not appear on the commercial invoice, which lists the machines only by reference to their serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">The explanation for this appears to be that, nearly a month later, on 7 August 2002, Mr Andrews received an email from Mr Barrie requesting Mr Andrews to remove the names of the games from the invoice as it was said not to be a requirement of Peruvian Customs that the name be stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Mr Andrews is unable to locate the email correspondence with Mr Barrie about this alteration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">But assuming the explanation to be correct, it must follow that the commercial invoice number 360 which was in evidence as the final invoice was not raised on 14 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">The evidence referred to later indicated that this commercial evidence was not raised until August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">The evidence given by Mr Andrews as to the terms of the sale by Mr Birks' company for onsale by Global to Play King was set out in Mr Andrews' affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">The evidence discloses that the agreed price was A$525 plus GST per machine, making a total of A$18,400.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">There was documentary evidence of the payment of this sum by Global to Mr Birks' company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">The 32 machines that were the subject of the Play King transaction were shipped to Peru in August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Global's Shippers Letter of Instruction addressed to JAS International (Aust) Pty Ltd of Alexandria, NSW ("JAS") was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Importantly, whilst Global was shown on the Instruction as the shipper, the pick up address was recorded as being Mr Birks' company, with the address described as Unit 3, 35 Tradelink Road, Hillcrest, Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Mr Birks' name was shown next to the company's name as the contact person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The consignee was recorded on the instruction as Play King and its address in Peru was set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">Mr Andrews gave evidence that on or about 7 August 2002, he arranged for an inspection report on the 32 gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">There was a copy of the inspection report in evidence which described the goods as 32 used/refurbished Aristocrat Mark IV "slot machines, as per the attached invoice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">It appears that Play King paid an initial deposit on the 32 machines and Mr Andrews' evidence was that Play King paid the balance on 7 August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">A copy of the payment advice was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Mr Andrews' evidence is that on or about 8 August 2002, he forwarded an "amended" commercial invoice number 360 to JAS, who was apparently the freight forwarder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">Mr Andrews says that the copy of the invoice which was in evidence was the final version of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">He says that it was in the same form as the document to which I referred at [186] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">On or about 18 September 2002, Mr Andrews received an email from Mr Barrie informing him that one of the serial numbers on commercial invoice number 360 did not match any of the machines that had been shipped and that the Peruvian Customs Department was threatening not to release the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Mr Andrews does not have a copy of the email from Mr Barrie but he produced in evidence a copy of a letter (not on letterhead) dated 25 September 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">The letter was addressed "to whom it may concern" and advised of an error in commercial invoice number 360 because of a last minute substitution of one of the machines forming part of the shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">
 6.2 The inspection by Mr Coster 
 In April 2006, that is to say nearly four years after the Play King transaction took place, Mr Garry Coster carried out an inspection of the gaming machines at the offices of Mincetur, which is the Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">At the time of the inspection, Mr Coster held the position of Special Projects Manager of Aristocrat and, in that capacity, he was engaged in the conduct of an investigation into counterfeit Aristocrat gaming machines in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Mr Coster carried out his inspection on 13 April 2006 at a warehouse occupied by Mincetur in Lima.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">A lawyer acting for Play King was present during the inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The lawyer showed Mr Coster a copy of an invoice that appeared to record that the seized machines had been purchased by Play King from Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Mr Coster initially formed the view that each of the seized machines was counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">He formed that view on the basis that the artwork and the EPROMs incorporated into the gaming machines were non-genuine, and the hand engraving of the serial numbers on the compliance plates was of poor quality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">Mr Coster's affidavit evidence continued as follows: The factors which indicated to me that the artwork was non-genuine included that it was of an inferior quality to genuine Aristocrat artwork (for example, the artwork appeared faded and some figures were distorted), and most of the artwork panels did not bear the Aristocrat Copyright Information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">The factors that indicated to me that the EPROMs were non-genuine included that the EPROM labels were coloured either red or yellow (whereas genuine Aristocrat EPROM labels are white), the labels were handwritten (whereas genuine Aristocrat EPROM labels are typed), the labels did not bear the full names of the Aristocrat games, and the labels did not bear Aristocrat Copyright Information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">On 20 May 2006 I returned to the Mincetur warehouse to conduct a further inspection of the seized machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">A Mincetur officer provided me with a copy of a document which I recognized to be the invoice shown to me by the lawyer acting for Play King S.A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I checked a sample of the serial numbers recorded on that invoice against the serial numbers recorded on the compliance plates affixed to the seized machines and placed a tick against those serial numbers on the invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">A copy of that invoice appears at page 81 to 82 of Exhibit GDC-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">I took photographs of the exterior of a sample of the gaming machines, as well as photographs of the EPROMs contained inside the gaming machines and compliance plates with serial numbers which correspond with the serial numbers in the invoice referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Copies of those photographs appear at pages 83 to 96 of Exhibit GDC-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">The invoice to which Mr Coster referred to at [45] of his affidavit was a copy of commercial invoice number 360.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">He placed ticks against six serial numbers on the invoice, which the Aristocrat companies say represented a sample of the machines originally inspected by Mr Coster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">From a comparison of the games and serial numbers recorded on the pro forma invoice with the serial numbers ticked by Mr Coster during his inspection on 20 May 2006, it appears that the following games were loaded on to the "counterfeit" machines identified by Mr Coster in Peru: Oscar; Enchanted Forest (on two machines); Butterfly Delight; Heart Throb; and Golden Canaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">
 6.3 Whether the Play King machines were counterfeit 
 It seems to me that, as was submitted by counsel for Global, Mr Ogborne, there are three reasons why the Aristocrat companies' claim in relation to the Play King transaction must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">First, the machines in this transaction did not come into the possession of Global or Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">They were shipped directly from Mr Birks' company in Queensland direct to Play King in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">The Aristocrat companies sought to meet this difficulty by relying on s 38 of the Copyright Act , which provides that a person is a "secondary" infringer if he or she knows, or ought reasonably to have known, that the making of the article constitutes an infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">However, for reasons set out below, I do not consider that Aristocrat has proved the requisite element of knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Second, the machines inspected by Mr Coster had counterfeit Spanish language artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">However, there is nothing to suggest that the subject machines left Australia with anything but English language artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Third, Mr Coster's inspection took place nearly four years after the machines left Australia and at a time when they had been operating in Peru for some period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">It seems to me that on the whole of the evidence I should infer that the substitution of the artwork took place in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Senior counsel for the Aristocrat companies, Mr Cobden SC, sought to overcome the second and third difficulties by submitting that an evidentiary onus shifted to Global once it was established that the machines were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">He relied, in particular, on what he said was a pattern of trade in counterfeit products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">Mr Cobden also submitted that an inference ought to be drawn against Global by reason of its failure to call Mr Birks to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">I reject both of those submissions, which I will deal with in more detail below after I turn to the factual questions which I have decided adversely to Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">
 6.4 Play King machines never in the possession of Global 
 Mr Andrews gave evidence as to his method of business operations in the period before the inception of the Global/Impact Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Relevantly, Mr Andrews' evidence was that Global generally did not maintain an inventory of gaming machines at its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">On receiving a sales enquiry from a customer, Mr Andrews said that he would contact Global's suppliers and arrange for machines to be located and supplied directly from that supplier to the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">Mr Andrews' evidence was that, as a result, he would generally not inspect the gaming machines being supplied for overseas customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">There was no challenge to the proposition that Global followed this practice in supplying gaming machines to Play King.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">Indeed, the evidence which I set out above as to the way in which the Play King transaction was effected makes it plain that the 32 machines were sourced in or from Queensland by Mr Birks' company and that they were shipped direct from Mr Birks' premises to Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">This was established by the oral evidence of Mr Andrews as to the steps which he took to fill the order and in particular by the contemporaneous documentary evidence to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">The most telling documentary evidence on this question is the instruction given to JAS, the freight forwarding company, which shows the pick up address as being Mr Birks' Queensland premises, and the SGS inspection report which shows the place of inspection at the same premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Mr Andrews was cross-examined on his evidence about the Play King transaction but no challenge was made to his evidence of his dealings with Mr Birks or to his evidence that the machines were sourced by Mr Birks and shipped directly from Queensland to Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">It follows from this evidence that Global could not have been responsible for producing any infringing components identified on the gaming machines in Peru during Mr Coster's inspection in May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">It also follows in my view that the Aristocrat companies have failed to establish that Global knew or ought to have known of any infringement of its copyright in the components of the machines identified by Mr Coster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">I will address the knowledge question in more detail when I deal with the "pattern of trade" and Jones v Dunkel submissions made by Mr Cobden.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">
 6.5 Spanish Artwork 
 Mr Coster's evidence was that the local regulations in Peru require games and artwork on gaming machines to be in Spanish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">He also gave evidence that, in his experience, there is a very significant problem of machines being "rebirthed" in Peru with the insertion of Spanish games and Spanish artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Mr Coster accepted in cross-examination that all of the counterfeit artwork on the Play King machines which he inspected was in the Spanish language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">He also said that the Play King machines which he inspected with English language artwork on them contained genuine artwork, however the machines with English artwork that he identified as counterfeit contained other indicia of counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">The quality of the artwork was one of three indicia of counterfeiting to which Mr Coster referred in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">The other two were the EPROM labels and the poor quality hand engraving of the compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">In cross-examination, Mr Coster retreated from his evidence about the compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">He said that the fact that they were hand engraved did not indicate that the machines were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">Indeed, he said that there was nothing about the compliance plates which indicated to him that the machines were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">Mr Coster was not cross-examined about the other indicator of counterfeiting, namely the EPROM labels, but I will return to that question when addressing the significance of the four year gap between shipment and inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Before turning to that question, it is sufficient to say that the importance of the evidence that the artwork on the infringing machines was Spanish is that it was not supplied by Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">It was not suggested to Mr Andrews that he had supplied Spanish artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that the artwork which was shipped from Australia to Peru was in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">This evidence is to be found in the SGS report which describes the machines as "shrink wrapped".</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">Photographs apparently taken by SGS at the time of its inspection show the machines shrink wrapped and packed in cartons and English language artwork can be seen in the photographs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">
 6.6 Four year gap 
 The machines which Mr Coster inspected at the Mincetur warehouse in April 2006 were seized by Mincetur from Play King.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">Mincetur is not the Customs Department; it is the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism and it is important to bear in mind that the machines were seized after they had been in operation in Peru for some period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">Mr Coster quite fairly said that he could not speculate as to how long the machines had been in operation, but he agreed that they had been in operation for a period of time before they were seized by Mincetur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">Mincetur's functions include monitoring and administering the licences required to operate and import gaming machines into Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Whilst carrying out his duties in Peru, Mr Coster received many communications from Mincetur seeking his assistance in the identification of counterfeit Aristocrat gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Sometimes he attended the premises of gaming machine operators.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">On other occasions, he was requested by Mincetur to inspect Aristocrat gaming machines held by Peruvian customs officials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">Mr Coster's evidence was that Peruvian customs officials inspect all containers of gaming machines and parts when they enter Peru, including the accompanying documentation, to verify that the serial numbers and other details match the corresponding machines in the shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">He went on to say that these examinations often result in the impounding of the counterfeit Aristocrat machines, subsequently identified by Mr Coster, while genuine machines are released.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">It is plain from Mr Coster's evidence that the six counterfeit machines identified by Mr Coster in April and May 2006 were not seized by Customs when they entered Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">It seems to me that the inescapable inference from this, and from the fact that the machines were seized after they had been operating in Peru for some period, is that any counterfeit components on the machines identified by Mr Coster were installed on the machines while they were in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">This is clearly established in relation to the Spanish artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">I would also infer that the EPROM labels, on which Mr Coster relied, were placed on the machines in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Having regard to the extent of the "rebirthing" problem in Peru, the period of nearly four years which elapsed between the date of shipment and the date of inspection, and in particular the Spanish artwork, it cannot be inferred that any infringing components on the machines inspected by Mr Coster were part of the machines that were shipped to Play King in about August 2002 by Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">It is true that there are emails to which I will refer later that show Mr Andrews' willingness to supply original English language Aristocrat artwork to customers in South America, to be copied there as part of the "rebirthing" process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">But it was not established that this occurred in relation to the Play King transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">
 6.7 The pattern of trade and the evidentiary onus 
 In determining whether an alleged "infringer" has the requisite knowledge under s 38 of the Copyright Act , regard may be had to the "knowledge, capacity and circumstances of the particular defendant": Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 91 per Burchett J; see also at 97 per Tamberlin J, at 104 per Lehane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">Raben Footwear was concerned with the construction and effect of ss 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act which contain the same element of knowledge as s 38 , namely "knew or ought reasonably to have known".</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">Accordingly, the same approach may be adopted on this question in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">Mr Cobden's submission that knowledge could be inferred from Global's "pattern of trade" rested upon the fact that the Play King transaction was the twelfth in the list of 54 transactions identified by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">However, in my view, this submission must be rejected for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">First, it was not established that any of the eleven transactions which preceded the Play King transaction involved the supply of gaming machines sourced by Global through Mr Birks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">Mr Andrews' evidence was that he had about seven dealings with Mr Birks' company, and that the Play King transaction was more than likely to have been "early on in the run of seven occasions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">But it was not suggested to Mr Andrews that any of the other transactions involved counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">Second, it was not put to Mr Andrews that he knew or ought to have known from the first eleven transactions, or from his dealings with Mr Birks that Mr Birks was involved in the supply of counterfeit machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Third, there was no evidence in the present case of the type which resulted in a finding of constructive knowledge in Raben Footwear .</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">In that case, the importer made inquiries from the manufacturer as to whether all copyright conditions had been met but received only a guarded and limited assurance: see Raben Footwear at 92.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">
 6.8 Jones v Dunkel 
 The Aristocrat companies submitted that I was entitled to draw an inference of knowledge from the failure of Global to call Mr Birks to give evidence: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">I reject this submission for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">First, the rule in Jones v Dunkel only applies where a party is required to explain or contradict something: Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Limited [2000] HCA 18 ; (2000) 200 CLR 121 at [51] ; J.D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Aust ed, 2004) at [1215], pp 41-42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Here, there was no challenge to Mr Andrews' evidence that the Play King machines were shipped directly from the Queensland factory of Mr Birks' company to Play King in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">Nor was it put to Mr Andrews that he knew or ought to have known from his past dealings with Mr Birks that Mr Birks was involved in the supply of infringing materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Indeed, no such evidence was adduced by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">The Aristocrat companies had the burden of proving the elements of secondary infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">Once it appeared that the machines had been shipped from Mr Birks' premises, it was for the Aristocrat companies to establish the requisite level of knowledge on the part of Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">But absent any evidence of infringement by Mr Birks, or indeed any suggestion of such to Mr Andrews, the rule in Jones v Dunkel has no application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Second, the rule cannot be employed to fill gaps in the evidence or to convert conjecture and suspicion into inference: Cross on Evidence at [1215], p 41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Yet this is precisely what Aristocrat seeks to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Third, even if the rule were applicable, the appropriate inference is that Mr Birks' evidence would not have assisted Global's case: Jones v Dunkel at 308, 312, 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The rule could therefore not be elevated to the level at which the Aristocrat companies sought to put it, namely to draw an inference that Mr Birks' evidence would have been damaging to Global's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">It is true that Mr Birks swore an affidavit which was filed by Global and that a forensic decision was ultimately taken by Global not to call Mr Birks to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">But the mere filing of an affidavit, and even a decision taken late in the trial not to rely on that evidence, cannot alter the effect of the three propositions which I have set out above as to the inapplicability or inutility of the rule in relation to the Play King transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">
 6.9 Other matters in relation to Play King 
 Mr Cobden's submission that Global had an evidentiary onus to explain or negative the inference of infringement rested largely on the "pattern of trade" referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">To the extent that he relied on other evidence to support the submission that an evidentiary onus fell upon Global, I reject the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">As I have said, the Aristocrat companies have the onus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">Whether the standard is the balance of probabilities or the Briginshaw standard as was submitted by the respondents, there was nothing in the evidence adduced by Mr Coster which imposed any onus of proof on Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">To the extent that Global had any evidentiary onus, that was discharged by Mr Andrews' oral evidence and the documentary evidence to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">Although I have reached an adverse view of Mr Andrews' credit, it does not follow that I would reject all of his evidence as untruthful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">It seems to me that Mr Andrews' evidence of the Play King transaction was consistent with the documentary evidence and I accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS During the course of the hearing, the Aristocrat companies placed great weight on a bundle of business communications involving either the Global, Impact or Tonita respondents, or a combination of one or more of the groups of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">Initially, each piece of communication tendered into evidence was not tendered against all three sets of respondents --- some correspondence was tendered against only the Global respondents, some against the Global and Impact or Global and Tonita respondents, and some against all three sets of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">However at the conclusion of the hearing, I made orders, admitting on a provisional basis against all respondents, evidence the use of which was previously limited on the basis that it was only admitted against particular respondents and not against other respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">The majority of this evidence is found in Exhibit A1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">Exhibit A1 was a bundle of documents that were extracted from documents of the Global respondents available to the Aristocrat companies in around late 2006, following the initial disputes between the Aristocrat companies and the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">A number of other documents were also tendered as separate exhibits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">
 7.1 Communications going to infringement 
 The Aristocrat companies submit that many of the communications contained in Exhibit A1 constitute "instances of unguarded communications that make plain the true nature of the joint venture's trade (a counterfeiting operation)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">A large number of email communications were extracted and put to the respondents' witnesses in cross examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">In this section, I will outline the most relevant of those communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">The first relevant document was an email tendered as a separate exhibit from Mr Andrews to a person described as "Aldo" in the "To" line.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">This email was dated 9 August 2002 and had been printed from a disk drive that was seized from Mr Andrews' premises in the execution of the Anton Piller order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">The email discussed options for acquiring artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">The relevant parts are as follows: 
 
 There are three options for artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">The first and most cost effective is to supply good quality second hand art work with game prom chips 
 

 
 
 Second hand artwork in stock as follows ... 
 

 
 
 Second choice is to provide Digital artwork of the artwork panels --- This produces artwork that is the same as the Aristocrat artwork but is not screen printed (Its usually a bit hard to tell except the original screen printed artwork is a bit sharper)
 ...
 Third choice is to provide the proper product that is screen printed but again the cost escalates ... 
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Andrews strongly denied that the "second choice" outlined in this email was a reference to an option of copying Aristocrat artwork by some digital method.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">He said that as the email was from 2002, he did not recall what the reference to providing the "proper product" meant in the "third choice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">The next relevant document was an undated email from Mr Andrews to the email addresses "lmn48@hotmail.com" (belonging to a Mr Nevada, a business partner of the Joint Venture) and "monica-linda@terra.com" which states in relevant part: 
 
 I'm sorry but we cant get the slant tops out this week because of some parts etc but have booked them to be loaded for next Thursday to make the ship cutting off on the 4/3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">This will also give us the opportunity to change some of the games around to try to give you some that you dont have there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">If you find any that work OK we could send you a set of art work to match the game and you could just copy the game chips, make some additional new artwork and convert some of your existing machines in your sites to these games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Andrews accepted that this email appeared to contain a suggestion from him that if Mr Nevada liked some of the games that Mr Andrews sent him, Mr Andrews would be able to send him more artwork and Mr Nevada would be able to copy corresponding game chips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">He stated that the fact that Mr Nevada would copy games in South America concerned him now, "but everybody did it in South America --- they're serial counterfeiters over there".</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">The next relevant document is an email chain contained in the tender bundle between Mr Andrews, Mr Allam and a Mr Richard Foote dated 9 and 10 November 2004 that was originally tendered against the Global and Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">The first email in the chain is from Mr Andrews to Mr Foote and states: 
 
 Hi Richard
 Just testing your email address --- Riad will probabl;y [sic] send me the software later on tonight and I'll forward it to you then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">
 
 To this email, Mr Allam replied: 
 
 hi toni
 [t]his is the new version of wcard bet 50 to suit 1c 2c 5c 10c and20c riad 
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Cobden put it to Mr Andews that the "new version of wcard" to which Mr Allam referred was software that was suitable to run an Olympic game called Wildcard Bet 50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">Mr Andrews accepted that "wcard" meant "Wildcard", however refuted the suggestion that the software that had been sent by Mr Allam and that was referred to in the email was an Olympic game, but "was to do with the bill acceptor that was attached to the machine".</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">The next relevant document is an email chain dated 12 and 15 November 2004 between Mr Andrews and a Mr Kirill Mendelson, a customer of the Joint Venture who had purchased a large quantity of gaming machines for sale in the Russian market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">The subject line of the emails is "Manufacturers Plates", which Mr Andrews acknowledged in cross-examination referred to compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The most relevant part of the email chain is a part of an email from Mr Andrews to Mr Mendelson, copied to Mr Cragen, as follows: 
 
 Hi Kirill
 I can organise the manufacturers plates for you as per your discussions with George.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">
 

 
 
 I need to let me know [sic] the exact information you want on the plates as follows 
 

 
 
 Mark 6
 Date of Manufacture --- do you want them all made in the same year or do they have to be a month and year
 Serial Numbers --- (is there a set serial number you need to use for each machine as per the import you have made or can they be random that we think up or can they be running numbers
 ...
 You can use the XAW5.......series which is normally used by Aristocrat for their conversions of MVPs to Mark 6 or if they are an original Mark 6 then the series of serial numbers will be XAW6............etc. 
 

 
 
 Please let me know what you want and we will sort it out for you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">
 
 This document was originally tendered against the Global and Impact respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Mr Cragen accepted that this email resulted from a discussion between himself and Mr Mendelson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Mr Cragen strongly denied in cross-examination that in the discussion, Mr Mendelson had asked him to make up fake Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">He said that Mr Mendelson had indicated that he was willing to purchase the entire Uruguay shipment for sale in Russia, and wanted two sample machines to be sent to him beforehand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">Mr Cragen said that he believed that Mr Andrews' email was a reference to the possibility of sending leftover compliance plates from Sydney on the sample machines, or using the numbers that were on leftover compliance plates that had been removed from stripped machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">The email was also put to Mr Andrews in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Mr Andrews did not accept that the email was an offer from him to arrange to have compliance plates made and have serial numbers placed on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Mr Andrews stated that in the email, he was offering to procure original compliance plates for Mr Mendelson that had been taken off gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">He said that if Mr Mendelson provided him with the information that he required on compliance plates, he (Mr Andrews) would be able to source compliance plates that contained that information from his supply of compliance plates that had come off original machines and that were kept in bins at the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">If Mr Andrews was unable to source compliance plates containing the particular information that Mr Mendelson wanted, he said that he would have "gone back and said I can't supply that".</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">The next document is an email chain between a Mr Kevin Hirst, who was involved with Huricane, Mr Andrews and Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The email chain is dated 18 November 2004 and was initially tendered against the Global and Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In an email to Mr Andrews, Mr Hirst indicated that he was waiting for a "complete set of game Roms [sic]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">He continued: 
 
 Riad has sent only 2 color proms and both of them are blank files So he has either mis read the prom or has a defective ones.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">
 

 
 
 With regard to the EPROM size the ones in the games that we have erased are 16 times the size of the files that Riad has sent for the Low res games and will require about 1-2 days to convert the Files there are 42 files involved that will require modification and I am not certain that we have all the ROMs for all the games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">[sic] 
 
 Mr Andrews acknowledged in cross-examination that he understood this email to be a reference to a misread EPROM, that is to say that there was a mistake when copying an EPROM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">However, he denied that the email referred to the exercise of copying game EPROMs on to a computer by Huricane.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">In response to the above email, Mr Allam replied by email in the same email chain as follows: 
 
 If Kevin requires the games that I sent to him by mail, I still have the complete set of games on eprom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">If he wants then I will send the games to him tomorrow by mail (express post).</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">
 

 
 
 Thanks
 Riad 
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Allam denied that he had ready access to games such that he would be able to mail them immediately because he kept a master copy of the games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">The next relevant document is an email chain between Mr Andrews and Mr Mendelson (copied to Mr Cragen) with the subject "Atronic".</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">The emails are dated 17, 18 and 19 February 2005 and were originally tendered against the Global respondents only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">There are several relevant parts within the chain of emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">First, in an email to Mr Mendelson, Mr Andrews says: 
 
 Hi Kirill
 Re the Atronic shipment ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">I have been advised that the plates that were to be put on the machines dont have the Atronic logos and I'm trying to get a list of the serial numbers by COB this afternoon so that I can get Riad to make them up by Tuesday next week and I'll take them to Melbourne with me for fitting on the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">I need some dummy invoices made up for say 80 machines and 50 machines by that date ... 
 [D]id you fix up the last lot of freight ... or is this being held pending the recent problems with the incorrect plates / serial numbers for the shipment of 119?</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">
 
 When questioned on this part of the email, Mr Andrews conceded that it was possible that the email was a reference to Mr Allam making up or engraving some compliance plates for the "Atronic" machines, a set of gaming machines that had been purchased from Tabcorp.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">Mr Andrews gave evidence that because of the way the machines were manufactured, and the practice of the Victorian gaming industry, it was necessary to arrange for the manufacture of additional compliance plates for the Atronic machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">The second relevant part of the email chain is in the reply to Mr Andrews' email from Mr Mendelson as follows: 
 
 Please make sure that the tags are attended to and for a change we have the right ones attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">
 

Mr Andrews indicated that he believed that the reference to "tags" in this email was to compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Mr Andrews then replied to Mr Mendelson as follows: 
 
 Hi Kirill
 Is there any particular year of manufacture you want on the plates or do you want me to just go with the series of dates within the numbers of the ones that have passed before (I should be able to get close based on previous lists) or do you want to nominate dates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">
 
 Mr Andrews acknowledged that this email was a reference to engraving on blank compliance plates the year of manufacture and serial numbers that suited Mr Mendelson, however he denied that this involved using serial numbers that were on existing lists obtained from Tabcorp because those number had been accepted by regulatory authorities in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">He explained the practice of engraving compliance plates for the Atronic machines by reference to the Victorian gaming system, which involved putting two sets of serial numbers on compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">The next relevant document is an email chain between Mr Andrews, Mr Allam and Mr Dante Rivera, a business acquaintance of the Joint Venture's located in South America, copied to Mr Cragen, Mr Andes Kan and Mr Vladimir Trajovski.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">The subject of the emails is "ARISTOCRAT PROGRAMS" and the emails are dated 22 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">The first email in the chain of two emails is from Mr Rivera and is addressed to Mr Allam as follows: 
 
 Sr. Ria please send me by e-mail new information about this game programs Star Drifter, King of the Nile, Money Tree because the old ones that you sent me recently they are failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">
 
 The second email is an email in response to Mr Rivera from Mr Andrews as follows: 
 
 Hi Dante
 All the Mark VI games were given to Walter on a CD --- Please get him to give you a copy of the games you require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">
 

 
 
 We are not happy to send this type of information over the email which is why we gave this CD to Walter to take back with him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">... 
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Andrews identified "Walter" as a Mr Walter Di Palma, a gaming machine technician from Argentina who appeared as a witness in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">Mr Andrews denied that Mr Di Palma was in fact given a CD of games, indicating that he had "made a mistake".</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">Mr Andrews also stated that he understood from Mr Allam that the problems with the games that Mr Rivera referred to in his email were caused because Mr Rivera "was an incompetent technician and the problem was with the way in which he put them on the board, rather than the games being faulty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">Mr Andrews denied that he had made the reference to not sending information over email because he did not want a record kept of those communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">Another email containing a similar statement from Mr Andrews, dated 5 November 2005, was also in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">The relevant part is as follows: 
 
 Please don't ask for software by email --- Just call 
 
 This email was not put to Mr Andrews, although it was put to Mr Cragen and Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Mr Cragen also denied that the reason for this comment was that Mr Andrews did not want a record kept of those communications, and said that he believed that Mr Andrews was referring to the fact that he would not send software by email, but could send the relevant chips by post.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The email from Mr Andrews to Mr Rivera was also put to Mr Cragen and Mr Allam in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">Mr Cragen said that he had "made extensive inquiries about that particular email" and was told that the information that was contained on the CD given to Mr Di Palma was game training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">He indicated that he had made those inquiries after this proceeding had started, but that he had not seen the email at the time that it was sent in 2005 as "it was an email address that I didn't really get to all the time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Mr Allam also denied that the CD referred to in the email contained Aristocrat Mark VI games given to Mr Di Palma by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">The effect of Mr Allam's evidence was that he had given Mr Di Palma instructions on how to assemble Mark VI machines and how to put games and artwork on the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">He said that Mr Di Palma had taken pictures relating to these instructions and downloaded those pictures onto a blank CD given to him by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">Mr Allam said that this CD was the CD referred to in the email by Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">Mr Di Palma also gave evidence at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">Exhibited to his affidavit was a CD which he said was the CD given to him by Mr Allam in around June or July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">There was some question as to whether the CD exhibited to the affidavit was in fact the same CD that was given to Mr Di Palma by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">In his cross-examination of Mr Di Palma, Mr Cobden suggested to Mr Di Palma that the CD that had been exhibited to his affidavit was in fact a CD that was manufactured in Argentina, and words to the effect that it was made in Argentina were marked on the CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">In addition, the manuals that were on the CD exhibited to Mr Di Palma's affidavit apparently related to American gaming machines which are different to machines from Australia, and were written in English, which Mr Di Palma does not speak.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">Mr Di Palma stated that the manuals were useful to him despite this as they assisted him to "orient" himself in relation to the machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">Mr Di Palma also denied that he was ever given a CD by Mr Allam which contained Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The next relevant communications are two email chains between Mr Andrews, Mr Vladimir Trajkovski, Mr Andres Kan and Mr Cragen dated 21 and 25 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">The emails relate to machines that formed part of the Uruguay transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">The first email chain contained an email from Mr Andrews as follows: 
 
 Hi Vladimir 
 

 
 
 What has happened to all the original artwork we sent down to you for projects --- I thought you were supposed to keep these and return them to us here?</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">If we cant get the originals back then we will have to charge the group for these sets of artwork which have a value in the local market place here of arouns$1000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">[sic] 
 

 
 
 I cant believe we are sending more of the same gear down there when I was fairly sure that we had made it very plain that we were to have all the originals returned to us.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Andrews denied that the implication to be drawn from this email was that he had sent original artwork to Vladimir with the intention that it would be copied in South America, the copies distributed for sale, and the original returned to him in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">He said that the reference to sending artwork back was meant to convey that the surplus that was not used in the project was to be sent back to him in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">Mr Cragen also denied any understanding that Mr Trajkovski was borrowing the artworks with an intention of copying them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The second email chain contained another email from Mr Andrews as follows: 
 
 Hi Vladimir
 ...
 2/ I have attached a full list of all the original artwork sent --- This was given to you / Dante with the instructions that these were to be returned to us here as each one has a value in this market place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">
 

 
 
 So I need to know 
 

 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 c) Original artwork was given to Tony Nuevo and this was again given with instructions for their return to us here ... 
 
 
 Mr Andrews again denied in cross-examination that this email was a reference to sending artworks to Mr Trajkovski, all of which he expected to be returned to him in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">Following this email in the chain was an earlier email that had been sent by Mr Trajkovski to Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">The relevant part is as follows: 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">Original artwork, it was sent to us in the last seconds prior to shipping to install them in the machines to Macedonia as we did not have any graphics (what Riad sent was partial) and those where [sic] only 3 or 4 games if I remember well, we did not have time to take copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">But all of this was talked on the phone with you and Riad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">
 
 In relation to this email, Mr Andrews denied that he understood Mr Trajkovski to mean that he had to use some original artworks, because contrary to the understanding he had with Mr Andrews to make copies of the artwork and send the originals back, he did not make the copies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">Mr Cragen also denied that he understood this explanation to be the case at the time that Mr Trajkovski had sent the email, but conceded that when he read the email now, that may be a possible interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">The next relevant communication is an email from Mr Antonio Nuevo to Mr Allam, Mr Cragen and Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">The relevant part of the email is as follows: 
 
 G'Day Riad,
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">I need the software for Flame of Olympus MK6 can you please send it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">We also need the blank [c]hips for ten MK6 boards, we only received for 20 boards and we have 30 boards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">
 
 In cross-examination, Mr Allam denied that he knew that the reason that Mr Nuevo had ordered and had received blank chips for Mark VI boards was for the purpose of copying Aristocrat game software on to those chips in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">He said that it was possible that Mr Nuevo was using blank chips for legitimate purposes, such as for use on other brands of gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The next relevant document is an email from Mr Andrews to Mr Trajkovski and Mr Cragen dated 10 April 2005 which states in relevant part: 
 
 In future all correspondence regarding the Uruguay project and any other sensitive subject such as parts etc for this project etc is to be sent to the following address 
 

 
 
 kgbird1947@yahoo.com.au 
 
 The Aristocrat companies submit that this email, and Mr Andrews' use of a web-based "and therefore untraceable" Yahoo email address, was evidence of the adoption of protocols to avoid detection of infringing activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">Mr Andrews denied that this was the purpose of adopting a web-based email address, and also denied any connection between the adoption of this email address and the discovery that Anton Piller raids were being carried out in the Vidtech proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">The email was also put to Mr Cragen, who said that he did not recall having received it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">A further relevant email was tendered as Exhibit X and was dated 20 September 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">This email was from Mr Nuevo to Mr Allam, Mr Cragen and Mr Andrews, and was copied to a Mr Santiago Sanjur, a business partner of Mr Nuevo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">The subject line was "URGENT" and the email stated: 
 
 G Day Riad,
 The CD Tony Andrews handed me in Vegas only has Indian Dreaming MKVI on it, I was also missing Tiki Torch MKVI as I specified on the mail below .... 
 
 The earlier "mail" referred to was then reproduced and stated relevantly: 
 
 G'Day Riad,
 On the CD you gave me with the MKVI games, I am missing MKVI Indian Dreaming &amp; MKVI Tiki Torch, can you please send ASAP via Email ... 
 
 This email was put to Mr Cragen and Mr Allam in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">Mr Cragen denied having read the email and said that he did not recall having seen the email at the time that it had been sent to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">Similarly, Mr Allam said that although the email was sent to him, he did not remember receiving it and said that "I don't read every email that is coming, you know, to me".</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">He also denied ever having given Mr Nuevo a CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">The last email correspondence of note is an email from Mr Andrews to the email address "jesika@iinet.net.au" dated 10 November 2005, which forwards an email sent to Mr Andrews from Mr Sanjur, copied to Mr Nuevo and Mr "Jorge L. Martin C.".</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">The email from Mr Sanjur which was forwarded by Mr Andrews reads in relevant part: 
 
 Hello Tony, ...
 Tony with regards to the art work for these games, We will translate them into Spanish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">If you can get to Us ASAP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">The pay tables glass, before the machines arrive to Panama it will greatly appreciated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">[sic] If you can get the art in a cd it will be even better.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">I have the Aristocrat Games translated into Spanish and can offer Art for them if you need ... 
 
 This email was put to Mr Andrews in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Mr Andrews accepted that in the email, Mr Sanjur requested artwork for translation and copying, however he denied that he in fact ever sent artwork over for this purpose or that he ever sent artwork to Mr Sanjur on a CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">He said that he did not know why Mr Sanjur had made this request of him and that he had not responded to the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">
 7.2 Findings in relation to the email communications 
 The emails were not tendered as proof of the facts stated in them, but the contents of the communications are revealing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">I reject the explanations given in cross-examination by each of Mr Andrews, Mr Cragen and Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">The explanations were, in my view, quite unconvincing and were at odds with the terms of the communications which were, themselves, reasonably clear on the face of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Nor do I accept that Mr Andrews, Mr Cragen or Mr Allam did not read the emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">They were significant business communications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Email is an important, if not the prevalent, means of communication between parties in the modern world, especially where business operations are conducted with parties overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Of course, business people sometimes fail to read every communication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">But no convincing explanation was given as to why this might have occurred in relation to the emails mentioned above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">All of them are of sufficient importance to enable me to find that, on the balance of probabilities, the addressees read the emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">Having regard to the volume of material tendered in this case, I do not consider it necessary to analyse and explain each of the emails set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">To a large extent, they speak for themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">I make the following findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">First, Mr Andrews offered to provide a customer with artwork that was digitally copied from Aristocrat artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">This is plain from the email to "Aldo" from 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">Second, Mr Andrews offered to another customer in South America to send him artwork which could be matched to games that could be copied in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Mr Andrews accepted that this was the effect of the undated email referred to in [272] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">The offers contained in the emails were not offers to do an act which would have constituted an infringement of the Aristocrat companies' copyright under ss 36 or 38 of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">But they do indicate Mr Andrews' willingness to assist the "serial counterfeiters" in South America in carrying out their actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">There were other offers to the same effect, including the email chain dated 21 and 25 October 2005, and a request from South America for artwork to be translated into Spanish: see email of 10 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">The email chain of 21 and 25 October 2005 is an example of Mr Cragen's tacit acceptance of the Joint Venture's role in the South American counterfeiting operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">Third, Mr Andrews offered to arrange for Aristocrat compliance plates with fake serial numbers to be made for a customer of the Global/Impact Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">He did so following a conversation between Mr Cragen and the customer about the supply of gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">This is quite clear from the email chain of 12 and 15 November 2004 and, in particular, from the extract set out at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">Mr Cragen accepted that the email resulted from a discussion between himself and the customer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">I am inclined to accept Mr Cragen's denial that the customer, Mr Mendelson, asked him to make up fake Aristocrat compliance plates, but I do not consider that he gave me a truthful account of the conversation which took place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">The inference I would draw from the email communication, and from Mr Cragen's concession that a discussion took place, is that he discussed the topic of the compliance plates with Mr Mendelson and that he would leave it to Mr Andrews to contact Mr Mendelson about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">Implicit in this is, at very least, the acceptance by Mr Cragen that the Global/Impact Joint Venture was prepared to supply gaming machines with false Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Fourth, Mr Allam gave Mr Walter Di Palma a CD containing Aristocrat Mark VI games which he (Mr Allam) had burned onto the CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">That is the effect of what Mr Andrews said in his email of 22 July 2005 to Mr Rivera and of his evidence of his conversation with Mr Allam about this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">I reject Mr Allam's denial that the CD referred to in the email contained Aristocrat Mark VI games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">I also reject Mr Di Palma's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">The CD he produced in his evidence was not given to him by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">The email to Mr Allam and others of 20 September 2005 also dealt with the topic of the delivery of an unauthorised CD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">I am satisfied that Mr Allam gave such a CD to Mr Nuevo and that Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">Fifth, Mr Allam was requested by a South American customer, Mr Nuevo, to provide blank EPROMs for Aristocrat Mark VI gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">I think it is plain that he knew the purpose of this request was to enable Mr Nuevo to copy Aristocrat game software onto EPROMs in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Sixth, I accept that Mr Andrews adopted protocols to avoid detection of the Global/Impact Joint Venture's involvement in copyright infringement, in particular the adoption of a web-based, Yahoo email address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">Although there are other innocent explanations which could have been given for the adoption of this course, Mr Andrews' email of 10 April 2005 was written shortly after an Anton Piller raid on a business associate of his, Mr David Parry: see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Vidtech Gaming Services Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 229.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">I cannot accept that it was mere coincidence that the adoption of the Yahoo email address and the sending of the email set out in [314] by Mr Andrews corresponded with the raids on Mr Parry's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">MR CHANNA'S EVIDENCE 
 8.1 Overview of Mr Channa's evidence 
 Mr Channa's evidence is of importance to the case for two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">First, Mr Channa provided evidence to the Aristocrat companies which formed the basis on which they obtained the Anton Piller orders against the Impact and Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">Second, Mr Channa's evidence, if I accept it, includes direct evidence of copyright infringement by the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">It also includes evidence of material contained on a computer disk which Mr Channa claims to have received from Mr Allam (CCC-14).</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The content of the disk includes material which establishes copyright infringement, although Mr Allam denied that the disk belonged to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">Mr Channa gave oral evidence in the proceeding before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">The affidavit evidence which he gave in support of the Anton Piller orders was not relied upon, but the respondents put to Mr Channa in cross-examination some inconsistencies between his earlier evidence and the evidence adduced before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">Mr Channa now lives in England where he works as a maintenance person in a cheese factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">He speaks very little English, his first languages being Arabic and Greek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">He gave his evidence in Arabic through an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">During the period from about February to December 2006, Mr Channa was employed by Tonita or Mr Allam as an assistant at Impact's Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">As I said earlier, Mr Allam used those premises to carry on a part of his business activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Mr Channa's evidence in chief was that Mr Allam used to pick Mr Channa up by car every morning and take him to the Botany factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">He proceeded to give evidence of his observations at those premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">This evidence commenced with a statement by Mr Channa that he saw "chips" being fitted into a machine or device at the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">He said he was told by Mr Allam that the device was used to load and unload programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">He said he witnessed Mr Allam using the device in this way approximately five times a month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">I took the effect of this evidence by Mr Channa to be that he saw Mr Allam burning or copying EPROMs using an EPROM burning device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Mr Channa went on to say that there were "chips" without a sticker and that Mr Allam used to get the sticker and put it on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">Mr Allam would give Mr Channa stickers with numbers on them and Mr Channa would match the numbers on the stickers to a number in a book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">I took the effect of this evidence to be that Mr Channa saw Mr Allam placing EPROM labels on EPROMs using numbers that Mr Channa matched with numbers in a book, apparently kept by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">Mr Channa gave evidence that he was told to hide compliance plates at the Botany Premises by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">He testified that Mr Allam said to him "don't let anyone see them because they are illegal, prohibited".</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">Mr Channa also testified that Mr Allam told him to "hide them, get somewhere and hide them in case they come to check the place".</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">Mr Channa testified that on Mr Allam's instruction, he hid the plates in various locations, including by burying them in a plastic bag in the backyard of the workshop, or hiding them in the ceiling or drawers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">Mr Channa also testified that some plates that he had hidden had printing on them and others were blank, and he observed Mr Allam printing on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">When the blank plates were delivered to the Botany Premises, Mladen (an employee of Mr Allam) would print on them and then give them to Mr Channa, who would hide them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">Mr Channa also said in his evidence in chief that there were the same devices and equipment at Tonita's Bankstown Premises as at Impact's Botany factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">He also gave some evidence of Mr Allam's acquisition of stock from Behong's scrap yard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">He said that Mr Allam had told him that the items in the scrap yard were not allowed to be sold and that he had gone to those premises up to 100 times over a period of six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">Mr Channa said that he had never attended the scrap yard alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">In his evidence in chief, Mr Channa also addressed the topic of visits that he made to Mr Allam's home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">This topic was relevant because it was part of Mr Allam's case that Mr Channa had planted important items of evidence at Mr Allam's home in an attempt to "incriminate" him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">Mr Channa's evidence on this topic was that he had attended one of Mr Allam's homes to cut a tree and that he had attended another to paint it and clean the carpet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">He said he had visited the first house on four or five occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">I referred in the introduction at [27] to the disk which was described as CCC-14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">Mr Channa's evidence was that the disk was given to Mr Allam by a man at the Botany factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">He said: 
 
 The man came and gave it to Riad and Riad took it and left it in my in the ... and left it with me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">He forgot to take it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">
 
 The cover of the disk CCC-14 has the word "Riad" written in handwriting on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">Mr Channa denied in cross-examination that he had written Mr Allam's name on the disk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">The final topic of importance in Mr Channa's evidence in chief was a bundle of photos taken by Mr Channa about one and a half months before he left Mr Allam's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">The photos record Mr Channa's observations of the factory floor at the Botany factory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">
 8.2 Preliminary observations at to Mr Channa's credit 
 It will be necessary to return to the topic of Mr Channa's credibility when I deal with Mr Allam's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">However, it is appropriate that I make some general observations at this point in my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">Mr Channa was cross-examined closely as to payments he received from the Aristocrat companies and about financial dealings he had with Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">Mr Channa claimed that Mr Allam owed him a substantial sum of money, and the thrust of the cross-examination was that Mr Channa sought to secure a financial benefit for himself by providing false evidence to the Aristocrat companies, as well as to extract revenge against Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">I am satisfied that the respondents were on sufficient notice of the payments by the Aristocrat companies to Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">Moreover, I am satisfied that the payments were not so large as to irrevocably taint his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">He was brought to Australia to give evidence because of the respondents' objections to video link.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">Some payment to compensate him for the dislocation and involvement was not objectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">Nevertheless, in my opinion, Mr Channa saw the payments as, to some extent, placing him in the Aristocrat companies' debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">The consequence of this was that, in my view, he did not wish to say anything which might be seen as adverse to the Aristocrat companies' case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">To what extent he was motivated by revenge against Mr Allam is impossible to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">But plainly, there was no love lost between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">At one point during Mr Channa's evidence, Mr Allam called out from the well of the Court words in Arabic which amounted to a threat against Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Two things seem to me to be important aspects of Mr Channa's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">First, some of it was consistent with other evidence in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">An example of this may be found in the email conversations to which I have referred above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">The email referred to at [279] contains an offer by Mr Andrews to make compliance plates with false numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">Mr Allam was the "technical guy" for the Joint Venture and it is therefore likely that he would have carried out that work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">Other emails, such as those at [284] and [312], suggest that Mr Allam burned Aristocrat games onto blank EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">The second aspect is that there was a degree of exaggeration in Mr Channa's evidence on some important matters of detail, as well as a reluctance to make concessions which he thought might be against the Aristocrat companies' interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">The most notable example of this is seen in a comparison of Mr Channa's transcript of an interview given to the Aristocrat companies' then solicitor, Mr Arnold, prior to seeking the Anton Piller orders, and his evidence before me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">In the transcript of his original interview, Mr Channa gave evidence of planting compliance plates at the Botany workshop as follows: You said you buried some compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">
 
 ... 
 
 ... but I didn't actually put it into the ground I just put it over the ceiling ... Sorry, the hole in the ceiling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">This is in Bankstown, right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">How if I went there how would I find it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">
 ...
 Ok there is a light there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">You can push up the tiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">How do you know which tile it is?</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">
 ... 
 Oh because it has black marks from my fingers because I ... it also has a hole in the corner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">But what I did before I left I just scattered around a few blank plates because as evidence because I didn't know what would happen when I leave so I just wanted them to be there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">There can be no doubt that the transcript of the interview is accurate as Mr Arnold subsequently attended on the Anton Piller raid of the Botany workshop and was able to go straight to a tile in the roof of the office and locate compliance plates which had been hidden in the roof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">Yet, in cross-examination, Mr Channa flatly denied that he had said these words in the interview and denied that he had planted the compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">Also, in his evidence in chief at the trial, Mr Channa said that he had "dug in the backyard" and buried compliance plates before taking them out the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">He repeated that evidence in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">Yet in his interview with Mr Arnold he said he did not actually put the compliance plates into the ground, he just put them "over the ceiling".</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">Another troubling aspect of Mr Channa's evidence was in his account of the interview before the Anton Piller application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">Mr Arnold said that Mr Channa had told him that he hoped the Aristocrat companies would assist him by giving him some of the money he had lost in his dealings with Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">But when this was put to Mr Channa, he denied having had the conversation with Mr Arnold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">There were other inconsistencies in Mr Channa's evidence including his evidence as to the amount owing to him by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">This also adversely affects the reliability of his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">THE SEIZED MATERIALS In this section I will deal with materials seized during the Anton Piller raids which are said to give rise to an inference of counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">I will exclude from this section a consideration of email correspondence and invoices, which are dealt with in separate sections of the judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">Thus, this section is confined to a consideration of seized gaming machine components and software which are said to be indicative of copying of Aristocrat copyright materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">Of particular importance are EPROM labels, game software, artwork and compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">The evidence of what was seized at Florey, Mascot and Botany was admitted against the Global and Impact respondents but, subsequently, I admitted it provisionally against all respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">I took the same course in relation to the material seized at the premises of the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">That is to say, it was admitted initially only against the Tonita respondents but later, I admitted it provisionally against all respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">The question of whether the materials seized at each set of premises is admissible against all respondents depends upon two factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">The first is the date on which the Global/Impact Joint Venture commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">The second is whether it is relevant to the Aristocrat companies' claim that the Tonita respondents were jointly liable for any copyright infringements committed by the Global/Impact respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">It seems to me that the appropriate way to approach the seized material is to consider it separately, by reference to the premises at which the material was seized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">
 9.1 The Florey and Mascot Premises 
 The electronic materials seized at the Florey and Mascot Premises of the Global respondents were imaged and placed onto CD-ROMs which were identified in the evidence of Mr Michael Cooley, a solicitor employed by the solicitors for the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">The CD-ROMs were provided by Mr Cooley to Mr Marc Mayo, a studio manager employed by Aristocrat and to Mr Dieter Polaczek, who is the manager of Aristocrat's Compliance Verification Laboratory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">
 9.1.1 Artwork at Florey and Mascot 
 Mr Mayo's evidence was that the CD-ROM contained a copy of 478 computer files and that the names of the files were either based on an Aristocrat game name, eg "Dolphin Treasure.jpg", an abbreviation of such a name, or contained the word "Aristo", which seems to be an abbreviation of the name "Aristocrat".</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">Mr Mayo observed that the images of the files found on the Global respondents' computers were identical to Aristocrat artwork, although for the most part those images were of lower resolution than that of the original Aristocrat artwork, and therefore not suitable for reproduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">Nevertheless, Mr Mayo's evidence in chief was that there were 19 files that were of sufficiently high resolution to produce hard copy artwork that would be: 
 
 of an acceptable quality level although not to Aristocrat quality standards, depending on the markets in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">
 
 The force of this evidence was somewhat diminished in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">First, Mr Mayo conceded that sophisticated software was needed to enhance the resolution of the artwork, and there was no suggestion of the presence of the software on the files examined by Mr Mayo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">Second, while it was suggested that the resolution of the files could have been enhanced by using a program known as Photoshop, no such software was found on the Global computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Third, at least one of the images was conceded not to be absolutely identical to Aristocrat's artwork in the following passage of cross-examination: 
 
 Q: So that if one was trying to use the seized file on the left to create the panel on the right, one couldn't do it, could one?</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">A: No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">
 
 Fourth, none of the artwork files on the Global computers were Spanish language artwork, although the only counterfeit artwork sighted by a witness for the Aristocrat companies was Spanish language artwork: see discussion of Spanish language artwork in the context of the Play King transaction at section 6.5 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">Fifth, Mr Mayo conceded that if a person wanted to create a copy of the artwork, he or she would simply take the physical item to a printer and have it copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">He agreed that this would be an infinitely better way to obtain a good resolution copy of the artwork, which would be far superior to that which could be obtained from the files on the Global computers, which in any event was in a different file format to that used by Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">Mr Andrews' explanation for the presence of the artwork on his computers was that he scanned the images from Aristocrat brochures and that he used them on his website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">He said that from time to time he forwarded some of the images to prospective clients in response to enquiries for details of the games installed on the machines that were available for purchase from Global.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">In cross-examination, he said that he scanned the images before 2005 and had forwarded them to customers for information purposes in the period up to 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s722">Mr Mayo agreed that the resolution of the images on Mr Andrews' computer was consistent with them having been produced by a scanner for use on the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">It seems to me that, considered in isolation, the concessions made by Mr Mayo support the explanation given by Mr Andrews for the existence of the scanned images on his computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">However, this evidence is only one part of a large maze of evidentiary material put forward by the Aristocrat companies and I will return to it once I have considered the other material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">On any view, the copying of Aristocrat artwork for the purpose of using it on the Global respondents' website was, of itself, an infringement of copyright under s 36(1) of the Copyright Act , at least when the artwork was displayed on the website and when images were forwarded to prospective customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Those infringements were not of the magnitude or seriousness of the claims of counterfeiting, but they give rise to a claim for damages under 
 s 115(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">
 9.1.2 Game sheets at Florey/Mascot 
 Mr Mayo's evidence in chief was that the materials seized from Global's Florey and Mascot Premises included 148 images of game sheets that could be used to produce hard copy artwork that would be of "an acceptable quality level although not to Aristocrat quality standards, depending on the markets in question".</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">In cross-examination, Mr Mayo conceded that the artwork involved in game sheets could not be used to replicate artwork to fit on an Aristocrat panel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">This is yet another part of the evidentiary maze to be considered in light of the evidence as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">
 9.1.3 EPROMs and EPROM labels at Florey and Mascot 
 Mr Polaczek's evidence was that a motherboard containing EPROMs was seized at the Mascot Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">Photographs of the motherboard show that the EPROM labels described the games as "Treasure".</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">Mr Polaczek said in his evidence in chief that the labels on the game EPROMs contained on the motherboard were not genuine Aristocrat labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">He identified a number of features of the labels which indicated to him that the labels were not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">These included the absence of copyright information and the absence of standard label information, as described in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">Mr Polaczek also said that the labels on the "Treasure" EPROMs appeared to be much newer than the other EPROMs within the motherboard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">He said that this indicated to him that they were likely to have been installed more recently than the other EPROMs and that they were therefore likely to be non-genuine Aristocrat EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">The proposition that the EPROM labels were not genuine was not the subject of direct attack in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">Some attack was made on Mr Polaczek's experience in relation to label finishes but I accept his evidence on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">Mr Andrews' evidence was that the gaming machine with the motherboard identified by Mr Polaczek came from South Australia and was in storage at Global's Mascot Premises awaiting delivery to Botany for refurbishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">A further answer to this part of the case was that, in Global's submission, the evidence of the Aristocrat companies' computer expert, Mr McKemmish, established that the labels on the Global computer had been printed only once.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">I do not think this accurately encapsulates Mr McKemmish's evidence which was that the printing date shown on Mr Andrews' computer was the last date on which the relevant instance of the file had been printed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">As with each piece of evidence in this case, it will be necessary to return to it once I have considered the totality of the material presented by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">Whilst I accept that the EPROM labels identified by Mr Polaczek were not genuine Aristocrat labels, I am not satisfied that this evidence, viewed in isolation, establishes that the EPROMs were not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">It seems to me that this question turns on whether there was other evidence to support that inference, in particular whether there was evidence that EPROMs had been copied and/or whether there was software at the premises that was used in the process of burning counterfeit EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">The Aristocrat companies pointed to other evidence of the existence of a large number of EPROM labels at Global's premises and on Mr Andrews' computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">However, the Aristocrat companies conceded that the EPROM labels identified as counterfeit on the motherboard seized from the Mascot Premises were different from those on Mr Andrews' computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s747">I am therefore not prepared to find that those labels on the motherboard constituted false EPROM labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s748">
 9.1.4 Game Software at Florey and Mascot 
 Mr Polaczek's evidence establishes that there were 40 files which contained software that corresponded to Aristocrat game software amongst the files seized from the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s749">However, these files included only three Aristocrat games: "Pengin Pays", "Queen of the Nile" and "Dolphin Treasure".</sentence>
<sentence id="s750">Mr Andrews accepted that these games were stored on the computers, but said that he had forgotten about the existence of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s751">He said that he believed that the files were sent to him as an attachment to an email dated 9 November 2001 requesting confirmation of specific versions of those games which were to be supplied by the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s752">The email was in evidence and it supports Mr Andrews' explanation for why the games were sent to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s753">Mr Andrews went on to say that he did not make any other use of the files exhibited to Mr Polaczek's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s754">I do not consider that the Aristocrat companies have established that Mr Andrews' explanation is false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s755">The Aristocrat companies made a strong attack on Mr Andrews' credit, but I have been unable to find any evidence which establishes that the Global respondents made use of the game software identified by Mr Polaczek.</sentence>
<sentence id="s756">Indeed, in my view, the evidence supports Mr Andrews' claim that he did not use it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s757">First, in respect of one of the games, "Penguin Pays", Mr Polaczek was unable to successfully cause the software to run on a gaming machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s758">Whilst he recognised symbols that correspond to Aristocrat's game "Penguin Pays", he tested the seized software for that game and was unable to make it work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s759">Second, Mr McKemmish filed an expert report in reply to, inter alia , the evidence of Mr Andrews, but he did not take issue with Mr Andrews' assertion that the files had not been used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s760">Mr McKemmish's evidence appears at section 8 of his report in reply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s761">That section of the report is headed "Comments in respect of matters raised in the affidavit of Mr Riad Allam ... and Mr Anthony Andrews ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s762">Notably, Mr McKemmish took issue with Mr Allam's claim that he did not operate certain relevant software but the report contains no such evidence in relation to Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s763">I am entitled to infer that Mr McKemmish's evidence would not have assisted the Aristocrat companies on the issue of whether the Global respondents used the game software for the three Aristocrat games found on Mr Andrews' computers: Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418-419.</sentence>
<sentence id="s764">Finally, I do not consider that the evidence of the existence of an external hard disk drive on the Florey computer gives rise to an inference of copying, as was submitted by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s765">I accept Mr Ogborne's submission that the evidence of the USB disk does not suggest that it was being transported from place to place for the purpose of being used in a counterfeiting operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s766">
 9.2 The Botany Premises 
 
 9.2.1 EPROMs at Botany 
 Mr Polaczek's evidence in chief was that he examined a number of EPROMs that were seized from the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s767">He gave evidence that three polystyrene foam boards were seized from the Botany Premises, attached to which were 355 EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s768">Photographs of these foam boards were in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s769">Mr Polaczek further indicated that another 56 EPROMs were also seized from the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s770">Those EPROMs were located in plastic tubes, with labels attached that corresponded to various Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s771">A photograph of a sample of these EPROMs was also in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s772">Mr Polaczek gave evidence that the EPROM labels attached to the seized EPROMs were not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s773">He pointed to the type of typeface on the labels, the colour and dimensions of the labels, the fact that some were handwritten, and the lack of standard label information or copyright information that appears on genuine Aristocrat EPROM labels as indicia that these labels were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s774">As well as the physical EPROMs that were examined, Mr Polaczek was given a 
CD-ROM which contained copies of software that were taken from a sample of the EPROMs seized at the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s775">Mr Polaczek conducted a series of tests on the software to determine whether the seized software was Aristocrat software, namely: Of the 81 files tested by Mr Polaczek, his evidence was that he obtained a correct CRC match for 67 files, indicating a high probability that the software on those seized EPROMs was the same as corresponding Aristocrat software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s776">In addition, a further eight files contained only a very small number of variations with the corresponding Aristocrat software, however the significance of a small discrepancy was not explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s777">The Aristocrat companies relied on the presence of the seized EPROMs as evidence of the copying of Aristocrat game software, and also as evidence of a larger counterfeiting operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s778">However, whether Aristocrat sought to rely on the fact that a large number of EPROMs was found at the Botany Premises as evidence in itself of copyright infringement was never stated plainly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s779">The proposition that the possession of a large number of EPROMs containing Aristocrat software could in itself be viewed as an indication that the software was counterfeit was never put to Mr Cragen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s780">Instead, Aristocrat relied on the fact that the EPROMs seized from the Botany Premises were found "lying around in open buckets and boxes", contrary to the terms of Mr Allam's licence which they say required EPROMs to be kept "under lock and key".</sentence>
<sentence id="s781">From the casual manner in which EPROMs were treated at the Botany Premises, the Aristocrat companies sought to draw an inference that the EPROMs or the software on them must have been obtained illegitimately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s782">Against the allegation that the seized EPROMs were counterfeit, the Impact respondents made three main submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s783">First, Mr Cragen did not deny that a large number of EPROMs were kept at Impact's premises in Botany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s784">However, he said that the seized EPROMs were EPROMs that had been stripped from second-hand machines obtained from Behong with the intention of matching them with artwork and re-using them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s785">Second, the Impact respondents submitted that all that was established by Mr Polaczek's testing was that the software on the EPROMs was Aristocrat software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s786">They argued that the same results would have been established if genuine Aristocrat software was tested in the same way in which Mr Polaczek had tested the software from the seized EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s787">Third, Mr Ogborne pointed to the fact that the majority of the seized EPROMs were found on polystyrene foam boards at the Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s788">It was said that Mr Cragen had placed EPROMs on the foam boards for the purpose of assisting Mr Andrews with the legal proceeding that was first brought against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s789">Mr Ogborne said that, in order to demonstrate that genuine EPROMs in Mr Cragen's and Mr Allam's possession had different coloured EPROM labels, Mr Cragen and Mr Allam had placed a range of EPROMs onto the foam boards and taken photographs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s790">These actions were said to indicate, first, that the Impact and Tonita respondents were not seeking to hide anything, and second, that the EPROMs found on the boards were not considered to be "live" or "active" EPROMs that were being used in business, as EPROMs would be damaged by static charge by placing them on material such as polystyrene foam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s791">
 9.2.2 EPROM label files at Botany 
 Mr Polaczek also examined a PDF document which was seized from a computer at the Botany Premises during the execution of the search orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s792">Mr Polaczek said that the PDF document contained imitations of EPROM labels for a number of Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s793">The labels included information such as Aristocrat game names, program numbers, standard label information and copyright information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s794">The Aristocrat companies relied upon Mr Polaczek's evidence of imitation EPROM labels to infer that the copying of Aristocrat software onto EPROMs was commonplace amongst the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s795">It was said that the conclusion that I should draw from the presence of imitation EPROM labels on the Impact respondents' computer was that the respondents affixed imitation labels onto counterfeit EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s796">Similar files were found on computers at the Tonita respondents' premises, which I will discuss in more detail later on.</sentence>
<sentence id="s797">In essence, Mr Allam's explanation for those files was that he occasionally produced EPROM labels where labels were missing from EPROMs that he had in his possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s798">He said that it had become very common to see EPROMs on logic boards within Aristocrat gaming machines that were missing labels or that had labels that were about to fall off because the glue had dried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s799">On those occasions, it was necessary for him to replace EPROM labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s800">This evidence was corroborated by Mr David Fisher, a gaming machine technician and long-time acquaintance of Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s801">Mr Fisher said that in his experience as a field technician, it was quite common for EPROMs in Aristocrat Mark VI machines to be missing labels or to have the labels fall off while working with the logic board.</sentence>
<sentence id="s802">Mr Cragen denied knowledge of the PDF file containing the imitation EPROM labels that was found on the computer at his premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s803">The Impact respondents submit that as Mr Allam had access to the computer from which the file had been seized, a logical explanation was that Mr Allam used the computer to produce labels that were missing from EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s804">I am inclined to accept this explanation for the presence of EPROM labels on the computer at Botany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s805">Moreover, the print out of the PDF file that was in evidence reveals that the file contained only one page of eight labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s806">Even if Mr Allam's and Mr Cragen's explanations for the labels were to be rejected, the presence of these labels alone cannot constitute evidence of the widespread copyright infringement for which the Aristocrat companies contend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s807">Rather, as with the evidence found on the raids at the Florey and Mascot Premises, the evidence must be considered in light of the totality of the material presented by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s808">
 9.2.3 Compliance plates at Botany 
 The evidence of Mr Brett Parsons, the manager of Aristocrat's Mechanical Platform Development, establishes that a number of compliance plates were seized from the Botany Premises in the course of executing the search orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s809">On the basis of his knowledge and experience with Aristocrat compliance plates, Mr Parsons was asked to determine whether the seized compliance plates were genuine compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s810">Mr Parsons' evidence was that a number of the compliance plates seized from the Botany Premises were not genuine Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s811">He identified 22 compliance plates that were said to be counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s812">His reasons for concluding that those plates were not genuine were that the plates had one or several of a number of features, including: Compliance plates were also seized from the Bankstown Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s813">There is overlap in the arguments relating to the genuineness of the compliance plates found at the Botany and Bankstown Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s814">These will be discussed in detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s815">
 9.3 The Bankstown Premises 
 
 9.3.1 Compliance plates at Bankstown 
 Mr Parsons identified 67 Aristocrat compliance plates which were said to not be genuine and which were seized during the raids on the Bankstown Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s816">As with the compliance plates seized from the Botany Premises, Mr Parsons concluded that the Bankstown compliance plates were not genuine because they had one or more of the following features: plates were screen-printed with a glossy finish; thick Aristocrat logo lettering; no holes for riveting; engraving that did not comply with the specification; and blue tinge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s817">
 9.3.2 EPROMs at Bankstown 
 Mr Polaczek gave evidence about a large number of Aristocrat EPROMs that were seized at the Bankstown Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s818">Of the seized EPROMs, 710 EPROMs had a label attached that referred to the game "Golden Pyramids".</sentence>
<sentence id="s819">Mr Polaczek's evidence was that many of the Golden Pyramids EPROMs were in plastic tubes containing the set of EPROMs required for installation in an individual gaming machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s820">Based on a number of factors, Mr Polaczek concluded that the seized Golden Pyramids EPROMs were not genuine Aristocrat EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s821">Mr Polaczek said that a key factor that led him to believe that the Golden Pyramid EPROMs were not genuine was that it is very unusual to possess a large number of EPROMs for the same game.</sentence>
<sentence id="s822">This is because genuine Aristocrat EPROMs are either installed, and remain, with a gaming machine when it is released into the market, or are provided with corresponding artwork as part of a conversion kit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s823">Mr Polaczek said that there was no reason of which he was aware why hundreds of EPROMs for a single game would be available in the marketplace separate from the gaming machines for which they were supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s824">Mr Polaczek also identified 677 Golden Pyramid EPROMs and many other seized EPROMs with different games that had labels that he said were not genuine Aristocrat labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s825">Based on this conclusion, Mr Polaczek was of the opinion that the seized EPROMs were not genuine Aristocrat EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s826">In response to Mr Polaczek's conclusion that the EPROMs were not genuine, Mr Allam said that the EPROMs were obtained from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s827">He said that where the EPROMs were contained in plastic tubes, they were obtained like that from Behong, and where the EPROMs were loose, they were also obtained from Behong in that fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s828">Mr Allam said that he had obtained a large number of EPROMs from Behong, which were in all kinds of conditions, new and second-hand, some of which had labels and some of which did not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s829">Mr Allam denied having created any labels for those EPROMs, and said that all of the EPROMs seized from the Bankstown Premises were in the state in which he obtained them from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s830">
 9.4 Compliance plates at the Botany and Bankstown Premises 
 The Aristocrat companies rely on Mr Parsons' evidence that the compliance plates seized from the Botany and Bankstown Premises were imitations on two levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s831">First, they say that copyright subsists in Aristocrat compliance plates as original artistic works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s832">Subsistence of copyright is not disputed by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s833">The Aristocrat companies therefore claim that by taking possession of counterfeit compliance plates for the purpose of distributing them, the respondents have infringed Aristocrat's copyright in the compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s834">Second, the Aristocrat companies point to the possession of counterfeit compliance plates by the respondents as evidence of their involvement in a large-scale counterfeiting operation in order to facilitate their supply of Aristocrat gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s835">The respondents challenged Mr Parsons' findings on several bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s836">First, there was some attack on Mr Parsons' qualifications and expertise to reach the conclusions that he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s837">Mr Parsons admitted in cross-examination that his involvement with compliance plates was limited to the stages in which the design specification is prepared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s838">He therefore did not see issues or faults that arose in the manufacturing process, unless they were deemed to be issues that needed to be addressed by his department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s839">Mr Parsons also said that he was not familiar with the characteristics of genuine Aristocrat compliance plates that were manufactured overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s840">Mr Parsons also admitted in cross-examination that the characteristics of Aristocrat compliance plates that were produced before his time at Aristocrat were outside his expertise or range of knowledge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s841">Second, the Global and Impact respondents sought to challenge Mr Parsons' findings by reference to Aristocrat's scrapping procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s842">In essence, they said that the evidence established that there were some instances when compliance plates were produced by Aristocrat which did not match their specification, for example because the printing was unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s843">On these occasions, Aristocrat had a process of removing the compliance plates from production and distribution, and sending them to Behong to be destroyed or scrapped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s844">The respondents submit that Aristocrat did not have in place a system which guaranteed the destruction of those compliance plates, and the evidence established that relevant procedures were not always followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s845">The respondents therefore questioned the basis on which Mr Parsons found that compliance plates that did not match Aristocrat's specification were necessarily counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s846">Third, the respondents challenge Mr Parsons' finding that the presence of hand-engraving on compliance plates was an indicia of counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s847">The respondents submit that it is commonplace for genuine Aristocrat gaming machines to come with hand-engraved compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s848">Mr Allam and Mr Fisher gave evidence to this effect, indicating that in their dealings over the past eight or more years with Aristocrat gaming machines, they had both observed Aristocrat compliance plates that are engraved by hand attached to genuine gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s849">Indeed the Aristocrat companies conceded that there was some hand engraving done by Aristocrat for a period of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s850">The Aristocrat companies led reply evidence to the effect that Aristocrat uses hand engraving on compliance plates only on limited occasions, for example if the computer controlled engraving machine breaks down or on a small number of times over the weekend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s851">It was said that only a small team of employees are permitted by the Aristocrat companies to work the hand engraver, in order to meet Aristocrat's quality standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s852">Mr Sachin Reddy, an employee of Aristocrat who works in the section responsible for compliance plate engraving, gave evidence that he was the primary person responsible for operating the hand engraver, and the seized compliance plates that contained hand engraving did not match the style of hand engraving produced by his section at Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s853">The respondents also allege that Mr Channa planted some of the compliance plates seized from the Bankstown Premises for the purpose of incriminating the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s854">This attack on Mr Channa's credibility arose in part from an interview that Mr Channa had with Aristocrat in January 2007, the transcript of which was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s855">The respondents relied upon the following passage, which is set out in part at [370] above: 
 
 Q You said you buried some compliance plates
 A ... but I didn't actually put it into the ground I just put it over the ceiling ... 
 
 Sorry, the hole in the ceiling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s856">This is Bankstown, right?</sentence>
<sentence id="s857">How, if I went there how would I find it?</sentence>
<sentence id="s858">
 
 A Ok there is a light there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s859">You can push them up the tiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s860">Q How do you know which tile it is?</sentence>
<sentence id="s861">
 
 Oh because it has black marks from my fingers because I ... it also has a hole in the corner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s862">But what I did before I left I just scattered around a few blank plates because as evidence because I didn't know what would happen when I leave so I just wanted them to be there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s863">And also in Bankstown we put some of those blank plates on top of the cupboard and I also put 2 or 3 of those blanks [sic] plates behind the cupboard so if you move the cupboard you will see them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s864">In cross-examination, Mr Channa denied having said this in the interview, and denied having planted any compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s865">The Global and Impact respondents also say that those compliance plates seized from Bankstown that were not planted by Mr Channa were legitimately procured from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s866">
 9.5 The Georges Hall Premises 
 
 9.5.1 EPROM Labels at Georges Hall 
 Mr Polaczek gave evidence that loose EPROM labels (labels that were not attached to EPROMs) were found at the raid at the Georges Hall Premises in a container with a blue lid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s867">Mr Polaczek said that the labels were a mixture of genuine and non-genuine Aristocrat labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s868">His reasons for concluding that the labels were not genuine EPROM labels was that they were printed onto either sheets of labels or paper sheets which would have required the label to be cut out with scissors or some other implement, whereas genuine Aristocrat EPROM labels are never printed onto paper sheets of that type.</sentence>
<sentence id="s869">Mr Polaczek's evidence also established that the typeface on the labels was not the same as that which appears on genuine Aristocrat labels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s870">In addition, Mr Polaczek said that Aristocrat does not supply adhesive labels separately to EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s871">Mr Polaczek also gave evidence that six packets of blank, self-adhesive labels, of similar dimensions to EPROM labels, were seized from the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s872">This was relied upon by the Aristocrat companies as evidence of the copying of EPROM labels by the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s873">Mr Polaczek also examined a PDF document which was seized from a computer at the Georges Hall Premises, containing imitations of EPROM labels for a number of Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s874">Mr Polaczek concluded that the labels were not genuine Aristocrat labels for a number of reasons, including that the labels contained incorrect program numbers and game names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s875">As referred to above, the Tonita respondents dispute that the discovery of EPROM labels at the Georges Hall Premises is evidence of counterfeiting of gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s876">They say that the EPROM labels that Mr Allam created were for the purpose of replacing missing labels and do not evidence a broader counterfeiting operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s877">
 9.5.2 Blank EPROMs at Georges Hall 
 Mr Polaczek's evidence indicated that certain documents were seized from a computer and in hard copy at the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s878">Amongst those documents was an invoice in the name of Tonita Enterprise and a document marked "Escrow-Order Form" which refers to Tonita Enterprise and another company named Hong King Inventory Ltd. Those documents appeared to relate to the purchase of certain components including 500 parts described as "M27V322-100F1" and another 500 parts described as "M27C1001-10F".</sentence>
<sentence id="s879">Mr Polaczek's evidence was that from his knowledge of Aristocrat EPROMs, the descriptions "M27V322-100F1" and "M27C1001-10F" refer to a type of EPROM which can be used to store Aristocrat software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s880">In addition, a box titled "New Tubes" with a number of tubes containing EPROMs was seized from the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s881">Mr Polaczek gave evidence that there were no labels on any of the EPROMs contained within the tubes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s882">Some tubes contained new, unused EPROMs, while others contained used EPROMs, and some contained a mixture of new and used EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s883">In total, there were 7 tubes of new EPROMs, 5 tubes of used EPROMs, and 4 tubes of a mixture of new and used EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s884">The Aristocrat companies submit that blank EPROMs, like blank DVDs in film piracy cases or blank CDs or tapes in music piracy cases, are suggestive of copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s885">In response to the Aristocrat companies' allegation of counterfeiting, Mr Allam said that many of the materials that he obtained from Behong were new and unused EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s886">He says that all of the EPROMs that were seized from the Georges Hall Premises were obtained from Behong in the condition in which they were found at the time of the raids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s887">
 9.5.3 Compliance Plates at Georges Hall 
 Mr Parsons examined a PDF document containing images which were found on a computer at the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s888">His evidence was that the PDF document contained two images which resembled compliance plate artwork for Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s889">In particular, the first image contained the words "Aristocrat", "Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Limited" and "Mk 6 series II".</sentence>
<sentence id="s890">The second image contained a close approximation of the Aristocrat logo (although it was not accurate), the words "Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Limited" and "Mk 5 series II".</sentence>
<sentence id="s891">Both images contained representations of panels for engraving details of the manufacture date, machine type and serial number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s892">An invoice which referred to "70x90 LAB Plate" was also seized from the Georges Hall Premises and examined by Mr Parsons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s893">Mr Parsons' evidence was that the invoice appeared to relate to the purchase by Impact Gaming of 150 compliance plates from a company named Azortech.</sentence>
<sentence id="s894">Mr Parsons' evidence also established that six compliance plates were seized from the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s895">His evidence was that those compliance plates were not genuine Aristocrat compliance plates because of two features of the plates: first, because they appeared to have been screen printed, with a glossy instead of a matt finish; and second, because there were no holes to allow for riveting on to machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s896">Mr Allam gave an explanation for the presence of those compliance plates at his home in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s897">He said that he believed that the seized compliance plates had been placed in his car by Mr Channa at the end of 2006, and that Mr Allam had removed those items together with everything else in his car and placed them in his house before going away in January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s898">He said that prior to the search, he was not aware of the presence of the seized compliance plates in his house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s899">Mr Allam also gave evidence that Mr Channa had approached him in around August 2006 at the Botany Premises and showed him a bundle of blank Aristocrat compliance plates that he had procured from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s900">Mr Allam said that he was "concerned about the existence and appearance of such blank compliance plates", and had a conversation with Mr Channa as follows: 
 
 [Mr Allam]: These plates should not be used by anyone except Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s901">I do not want these anywhere they must be destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s902">Mr Channa: Should I through [sic] them in the bin or take them back to Behong
 [Mr Allam]: No, these plates must be destroyed as they should not be in anyone's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s903">Do not put any of these plates in the truck, or anywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s904">You must destroy the plates now because they are illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s905">
 
 Six blank compliance plates were also seized from the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s906">These compliance plates contained no engraved information in the "manufacture date", "machine type" or "serial number" panels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s907">Mr Allam said that the blank compliance plates that were found at the Georges Hall Premises came from installation kits that accompanied the South American machines that formed part of the Uruguay transaction, and were therefore legitimately obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s908">The respondents submitted that blank Aristocrat compliance plates came into the market from the machines that formed part of the Uruguay/Nuevestar transaction: see [152]ff above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s909">
 9.5.4 Aristocrat game software at Georges Hall 
 Mr Polaczek also examined a CD-ROM containing 167 files which were seized from a hard drive found at the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s910">As with the software found on EPROMs at the Botany Premises, Mr Polaczek conducted a number of tests on the files found at the Georges Hall Premises, including identifying the embedded program number, conducting a CRC check, and transferring the files onto EPROMs and loading them onto gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s911">However although Mr Polaczek's evidence sets out in length the steps that he took in conducting tests on the files seized at Georges Hall, the Aristocrat companies did not read those paragraphs of his affidavit that set out the results of those tests, nor did they tender the exhibits to Mr Polaczek's affidavit in which he had summarised the results in table form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s912">Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn about the presence of those files on the Tonita respondents' computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s913">
 9.5.5 Computers at Georges Hall 
 Three imaged copies of hard drives were seized from the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s914">The first was an imaged copy of a loose computer hard disk drive, or the "Loose HDD".</sentence>
<sentence id="s915">The two other imaged copies were extracted from desktop computers at the Georges Hall Premises, known as "Georges Hall Desktop 1" and "Georges Hall Desktop 2".</sentence>
<sentence id="s916">The imaged copies were examined by two computer forensic specialists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s917">Mr Nigel Carson is a computer forensic specialist who was retained by the Tonita respondents as an expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s918">He was given a copy of the CCC-14 CD-ROM (see section 10 below) and imaged copies of the Loose HDD and the Georges Hall Desktop 2 and prepared a report on the contents of those items for this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s919">Ultimately, the Tonita respondents did not rely on Mr Carson's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s920">The Aristocrat companies tendered Mr Carson's report and rely upon some of its content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s921">Mr McKemmish is also a computer forensic specialist who examined the Loose HDD and the two Georges Hall Desktop computers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s922">Mr McKemmish was originally engaged by the Aristocrat companies as the independent computer expert at the Anton Piller raids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s923">In the course of the hearing, the Global and Impact respondents challenged the admissibility of certain parts of the evidence of Mr McKemmish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s924">This challenge was heard on the voir dire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s925">
 9.5.5.1 THE VOIR DIRE 
 In June 2006, Mr McKemmish was engaged by Aristocrat's former solicitors as an independent expert in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s926">As part of his duties as independent computer expert, Mr McKemmish undertook various tasks pursuant to several court orders, including: Mr McKemmish also made certain confidentiality undertakings to the Court in regards to the material obtained or sighted in his role as independent computer expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s927">In November 2007, Mr McKemmish was asked by the current solicitors for the Aristocrat companies to extract electronic files from a number of EPROM chips seized from the respondents' premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s928">At the Aristocrat companies' request, Mr McKemmish also performed a review of documents and original data found on computers at the respondents' premises and made certain observations on the basis of those documents and data, contained in an affidavit sworn 21 December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s929">The Aristocrat companies also tendered an expert report prepared by Mr McKemmish in which he details the forensic analysis that was carried out by him on the computers found at the Georges Hall Premises, as well as the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s930">
 9.5.5.1.1 SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 On the voir dire, the Global and Impact respondents submitted that Mr McKemmish's role as an independent computer expert appointed for the purposes of assisting in the supervision and carrying out of the Anton Piller orders was inconsistent with him then becoming an expert witness for the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s931">They argued that parts of his evidence should therefore be excluded on two grounds: either as, first, an abuse of process, or second, under s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) as there was a real danger of unfair prejudice to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s932">Underlying both grounds was the argument that once Mr McKemmish had seen certain confidential material seized during the Anton Piller raids, his evidence as an expert witness was "infected" as he would be unable to keep the confidential material from his mind in preparing his expert's report and giving evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s933">Citing Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 149 ; (2005) 190 FLR 242 , Mr Ogborne argued that even if Mr McKemmish had not actually used the confidential material in forming his opinions, the prejudice to the respondents would be too great to allow the material to be admitted as Mr McKemmish had had access to the material and may therefore have used it as a factual basis in an improper way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s934">Mr Ogborne also argued that a person who assumed the role of independent computer expert was required to maintain his or her independent position until the end of the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s935">Mr Ogborne drew an analogy between the roles of the independent computer expert and the independent solicitor in the execution of Anton Piller orders, and emphasised the importance of there being an independent and neutral court-appointed officer placed in charge of seized computer files.</sentence>
<sentence id="s936">On this basis, he argued, it would be inappropriate for a person charged of this neutral role to take on a new role as a witness for one party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s937">
 9.5.5.1.2 SUBMISSIONS OF THE ARISTOCRAT COMPANIES 
 In response, Mr Cobden raised five main points.</sentence>
<sentence id="s938">First, Mr Cobden submitted that the respondents had failed to identify those parts of Mr McKemmish's expert report which were said to be tainted by reason of his previous role as independent computer expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s939">In particular, Mr Cobden emphasised that the computers analysed in Mr McKemmish's report and evidence were all computers found at the Georges Hall (Tonita) Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s940">On this basis, he argued, it was up to Mr Ogborne to identify which parts of Mr McKemmish's evidence had involved him looking at the confidential Impact and Global material and therefore tainted his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s941">In regards to the abuse of process argument, Mr Cobden had two submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s942">First, he submitted that the argument must be rejected due to the delay by the respondents in raising their objection to the evidence of Mr McKemmish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s943">Although the Global and Impact respondents had made some reference to their objection in a letter of December 2006, he argued that the point had not been raised substantively until the hearing in October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s944">Second, Mr Cobden argued that the respondents had not clearly articulated the allegation of abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s945">In particular, they had not set out clearly by whom the abuse of process had allegedly been committed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s946">This was important, he submitted, because there had been no allegation of abuse of process by the Aristocrat companies' solicitors, and there was no authority to which he could refer the Court in which it had been said that a witness could commit an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s947">Mr Cobden's fourth and fifth points related to the respondents' argument under s 135 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s948">In his fourth submission, Mr Cobden drew the Court's attention to the test of unfair prejudice under s 135 , as defined by Papakosmas v the Queen [1999] HCA 37 ; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325, which envisaged a danger that the fact finder may use the evidence on an improper, perhaps emotional, basis; that is on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s949">Mr Cobden argued that the respondents had failed to clearly articulate the basis upon which s 135 had been invoked, and in any case, the evidence objected to did not meet the test set out in Papakosmas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s950">Finally, Mr Cobden rejected the analogy drawn by the respondents between the role of the independent computer expert and that of the independent solicitor in the carrying out of Anton Piller orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s951">He argued that the independent computer expert is not an officer of the Court and is therefore not under the same obligations as the independent solicitor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s952">He also referred to several Federal Court practice directions and practice notes in which the role of the independent solicitor is significantly more regulated than that of the independent computer expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s953">
 9.5.5.1.3 ADMISSIBILITY OF MR MCKEMMISH'S EVIDENCE 
 The view that I came to after hearing the submissions of the parties was that, whilst it is undesirable for a person who has occupied the role of an independent expert for the purpose of an Anton Piller order to then give evidence as an expert witness, I did not consider that the submissions that had been put before me demonstrated that it was an abuse of process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s954">Moreover, the undesirability of Mr McKemmish giving evidence could have been pointed to at any time after 20 December 2007 but was not, either in correspondence between the parties or in directions hearings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s955">Having carefully considered the contents of the affidavits and reports which were proposed to be read and tendered, in particular the initial report of Mr McKemmish, and having also looked closely at the evidence tendered on the voir dire, I was not satisfied that it was unfairly prejudicial to the Impact and Global respondents to admit the evidence of Mr McKemmish, subject to any proper objection that may be taken to individual paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s956">I was not satisfied that the material to which references were made was unfairly prejudicial to the respondents within s 135(a) of the Evidence Act or misleading or confusing within s 135(b) , so as to enliven the exercise or possible exercise of the discretion under that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s957">On this basis, the application by the respondents was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s958">
 9.5.5.2 THE LOOSE HDD 
 In his report, Mr McKemmish set out the following relevant features of the Loose HDD that was seized at the Georges Hall Premises: Mr Carson also examined a version of Windows that was once installed on the Loose HDD but had since been deleted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s959">He said that there was evidence of file activity as early as 19 August 2003, under other user profiles which are no longer present, including "roro" and "nana", who are members of Mr Allam's family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s960">Mr McKemmish also made a number of observations relating to what he described as "DATAMAN &amp; EPROM related activity" on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s961">The Loose HDD contained Dataman software, the program that is used to burn EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s962">Mr McKemmish noted that his examination of the files located on the Loose HDD, its Windows registry and the associated Windows Event logs revealed evidence of the operation of Dataman software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s963">After carrying out an examination of the unused data areas of the Loose HDD, Mr McKemmish recovered certain file path information which he then analysed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s964">After scanning the unused data areas, he identified a number of references to the Dataman directory containing file paths that included the word "Aristocrat" and the name of some Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s965">Examples of the file paths identified were: From his analysis of the Loose HDD, Mr McKemmish concluded that the Loose HDD had been used to burn and/or read binary data to and from EPROM chips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s966">Mr Carson's report also addressed the contents of the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s967">He said that overall, the Loose HDD contained around 40,000 files and 5 Gigabytes of data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s968">Many of those files were documents and pictures and relate to university assignments and family snapshots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s969">Mr Carson also said that the Loose HDD contained a number of what appeared to be game binaries that had been created in various folders, including under the "Riad" profile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s970">In addition, the Dataman folders identified by Mr McKemmish contained files indicating the use of the application in relation to the game binaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s971">The inference that was sought to be drawn from the files on the Loose HDD and the activity related to the Dataman software was that the Tonita respondents had utilised the Dataman program in order to copy Aristocrat software on to EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s972">Also in evidence were screen shots taken from the data on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s973">In particular, one screen shot showed a folder called "540games" which contained a series of files with names that resembled the names of Aristocrat games, such as "blakrinou20", "enchantedu20", "g canariesu20" and "kgbirdu20".</sentence>
<sentence id="s974">The Loose HDD also contained 11 game sheet files that were found in a file under the description "Riad/MyDocuments/AristocratCatalogue".</sentence>
<sentence id="s975">Mr Mayo's evidence in chief was that these 11 images of game sheets could be used to produce hard copy artwork that would be of "an acceptable quality level although not to Aristocrat quality standards, depending on the markets in question".</sentence>
<sentence id="s976">Mr Allam admitted that he had scanned several images from an Aristocrat catalogue which were consistent with those found on the Loose HDD in order to allow him to email a picture of games that he was supplying as a description of stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s977">Mr Mayo's evidence in chief was consistent with Mr Allam's concession that a brochure had been scanned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s978">However, Mr Green, counsel for the Tonita respondents, submitted in his closing submissions that Mr Mayo's evidence in cross-examination acknowledged that none of the images found on the Loose HDD could have been used to create artwork to fit onto a machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s979">I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s980">The proposition was never put to Mr Mayo and the only concessions that Mr Mayo made in cross-examination relate to the material seized at the Global and Impact premises, as outlined in [385]ff above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s981">Therefore, the presence of these images on the Loose HDD must be considered in line with the other material found on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s982">The Loose HDD also contained a large number of files that appeared to belong to the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s983">Mr Allam identified a document on the Loose HDD containing a table with the names of Aristocrat games as a document which he had prepared when packing gaming machines for export.</sentence>
<sentence id="s984">He also identified another document found on the Loose HDD containing images which he had scanned from an Aristocrat catalogue and an invoice from Tonita Enterprise to Global Gaming dated 22 October 2004, as well as other files relating to the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s985">Mr Carson's report also indicated that there was strong evidence that the CCC-14 CD-ROM had been viewed on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s986">I will return to the material found on CCC-14 at a later stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s987">Mr Allam's evidence regarding the Loose HDD was that prior to the execution of the search orders at his home, he was not aware that he had the device in his house or his car at any time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s988">He did not recall at any time having used the Loose HDD, and could not explain why the Loose HDD contained a large number of files that appeared to belong to either himself or his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s989">Mr Allam suggested in cross-examination that someone else had put the Loose HDD in his car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s990">He then said that in January 2007 when he was going on a holiday, he emptied a large amount of material from his car to clear some space.</sentence>
<sentence id="s991">Mr Allam said that it was possible at that time that he could have taken the Loose HDD out of his car unknowingly, and placed it in his house along with the other material emptied from his car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s992">In the course of cross-examination, Mr Allam went on to suggest that Mr Channa had planted the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s993">In the course of cross-examination, Mr Cobden drew to Mr Allam's attention the fact that there were documents on the Loose HDD which appeared to belong to him, his family and Tonita, including university pharmacy exams and essays for his children's pharmaceutical studies, Tonita invoices, and other documents that had been prepared by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s994">Mr Allam could not explain why these files were on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s995">He suggested that the person who had planted the Loose HDD in his home must have also planted documents on the hard drive in order to incriminate Mr Allam, by linking the hard drive to him and his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s996">In closing submissions, the Aristocrat companies submitted that certain information about the Loose HDD that was uncovered by the computer experts made it unlikely that the material on the Loose HDD could have been created by anyone other than Mr Allam and his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s997">They pointed to the former user profiles that included names of members of Mr Allam's family, as well as the personal files that were stored on the Loose HDD including family photos and university assignments that corresponded to the pharmaceutical courses studied by Mr Allam's children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s998">In Mr Cobden's submission, had the Loose HDD been planted by Mr Channa to incriminate Mr Allam, as was suggested by Mr Allam in his evidence, the operation would have required considerable computer expertise and prior planning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s999">Because of a combination of factors that were identified by Mr Carson and Mr McKemmish, Mr Channa would have had to have sufficient knowledge to install a previous version of Windows onto the Loose HDD which included the user profiles "roro" and "nana"; and would have required access to over 40,000 files to load onto the Loose HDD, many of which belonged to Mr Allam, his family or Tonita, such as the photos and assignments mentioned above, or the invoices and files that Mr Allam admitted having created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1000">The evidence also indicated that there was file activity on the Loose HDD as far back as 2004, although Mr Channa only started working for Mr Allam in 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1001">Therefore in planting the Loose HDD, Mr Channa would have had to have the computer expertise to be able to change the dates on the Loose HDD to simulate use over two years earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1002">There was also debate as to whether Mr Channa would have in fact had access to Mr Allam's garage in order to plant the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1003">The Tonita respondents say that Mr Channa had access to Mr Allam's house and garage, and had the "motive and means" to plant the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1004">However, Mr Channa's evidence was that he had never gone to Mr Allam's house or garage alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1005">I accept the Aristocrat companies' submissions that Mr Channa was unlikely to have the necessary computer expertise to arrange the data in the way in which it was found on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1006">To draw the inference suggested by the Tonita respondents that Mr Channa deliberately manufactured the evidence found on the Loose HDD and then planted the device in Mr Allam's home would require me to accept a most unlikely combination of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1007">Indeed, the combination of circumstances that would be required to make good the submission of the Tonita respondents is so extraordinary that I regard the submissions as untenable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1008">
 9.5.5.3 GEORGES HALL DESKTOP 1 
 Mr McKemmish examined the Georges Hall Desktop 1 and gave evidence that the computer contained link files (or shortcuts) which indicated that a person using the computer had accessed files with the names "dream+pompei.doc", "inDIAN DREAMING edited.doc" and "geisha ce.doc".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1009">The link file information also revealed that those files were located within a directory called "LABEL" which is resident on an external removable storage device.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1010">The external removable storage device was not seized from any of the premises during the Anton Piller raids and the files referred to above were therefore not able to be extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1011">It follows that little more is known about those files than their names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1012">This information was not relied upon in any detail in the Aristocrat companies' closing submissions and therefore little, if any, weight can be given to it.</sentence>

 9.5.5.4 GEORGES HALL DESKTOP 2 
 The Georges Hall Desktop 2 was Mr Allam's computer which was located in the garage of the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1014">The computer's registered name was "TONITA-4D3B76GS", the registered owner was "riad allam" and the registered organisation was "tonita enterprise pty ltd".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1015">The Windows registry records recorded a user account named "riad".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1016">Under the heading "DATAMAN &amp; EPROM related activity", Mr McKemmish made a number of observations about the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1017">Mr McKemmish identified Dataman software on the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer and indicated in his report that a number of binary files appeared to have been read and their contents written to an EPROM, including files with the names "G:\geisha jcl 0007311 602\u72" and "G:\ Indian jack car 10007611 628 6\u72".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1018">"Geisha" and "Indian jack" are names of Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1019">Mr McKemmish concluded in his report that the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer had been used to write binary file data to EPROM chips in the period between August 2006 and January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1020">In addition to the Dataman and EPROM related activity, files were found on the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer with names that resembled names of Aristocrat games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1021">Mr McKemmish's evidence indicates that the files including "geisha label.doc" and "geisha label2.doc" were accessed by a person using the Georges Hall Desktop 2, and there was file or folder activity associated with the following entities (which may have been either a file or folder): "Gamblin Jack", "Calypso king", "reel rockin", "Olympic Games", "Aristocrat", "were the gold86.zip", "Queen of the Nile.zip", "Queen of the Nile Special Edition" and "King of the Nile".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1022">Mr McKemmish also identified a number of directories that were accessed on the computer, including "geisha jc10007311 602", "Indian jack car 10007611 628", "Gamblin Jack\20197211\", "Queen_of_nile_JC_hypl 4 Eproms" and "Spring_carn_500c_jacpotc 4 Eproms", and a number of folders with names including "Top Banana", "Indian dreaming", "were the gold", "golden Incas", "black rhino" and "King of the nile".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1023">Mr McKemmish's evidence does not establish the content of these files, and is therefore of little weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1024">What is of significance is Mr McKemmish's conclusion that the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer had been used to write binary file data to EPROM chips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1025">This finding is contrary to Mr Allam's claims that he had not used any Dataman programming device or any other EPROM programmer since leaving his previous employment in 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1026">However Mr Allam also gave evidence that the Georges Hall Desktop 2 computer was accessible by all of the workers at the Botany factory, including Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1027">The Tonita respondents also pointed to several technical issues that they identified in Mr McKemmish's evidence which they say renders his findings unsafe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1028">Mr Green submitted that the last modification date of one of the binary files examined by Mr McKemmish was after the date of the forensic examination, and as no other dates were identified, it would be unsafe for the Court to draw any inference as to the use by any person of a Dataman device on the Georges Hall Desktop 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1029">Mr Green submitted that the Court should infer that the errors identified by Mr McKemmish in the running of the system indicate the system never worked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1030">CCC-14 The exhibit numbered CCC-14 was a CD-ROM that was provided to the Aristocrat companies by Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1031">Mr Channa's evidence was that an unidentified man had visited the Botany Premises and gave the CD to Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1032">Mr Channa said he had taken the CD from Mr Allam's car, where Mr Allam had left it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1033">Marked on the CD was the word "RIAD".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1034">The Aristocrat companies submitted that the content of CCC-14 is significant to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1035">Mr Carson examined CCC-14 and made findings about its content in his expert report, which was ultimately tendered by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1036">In particular, Mr Carson's report stated that "[t]he content on the CD appears to comprise binary game files and several documents that appear to be labels and invoices for 'Tonita Enterprise'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1037">Although it was not referred to in the Aristocrat companies' written closing submissions or closing address, Mr Polaczek's second affidavit indicates that he examined CCC-14 for the purpose of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1038">As with the EPROMs seized at the Botany Premises and the software found at the Georges Hall Premises, Mr Polaczek ran a number of tests on the game files found on CCC-14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1039">On the basis of those tests, Mr Polaczek concluded that CCC-14 contained files which included Aristocrat game software, including software which related to Aristocrat's Dolphin Treasure, Queen of the Nile, Indian Dreaming, Boot Scootin', Chicken, Orchid Mist, Wild Thing and Wild Ways games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1040">The Aristocrat companies emphasised the presence of the game files on CCC-14 as evidence of copyright infringement by the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1041">In cross-examination, Mr Allam accepted that CCC-14 contained Aristocrat game software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1042">However, the Tonita respondents submitted that it had been planted by Mr Channa and had never been used or accessed by Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1043">The Tonita respondents sought to attack Mr Channa's credit on the basis that he was a "paid disgruntled witness" who should not be believed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1044">Mr Carson's report also indicated that there was strong evidence that CCC-14 had been viewed on the Loose HDD which was found at the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1045">This was because link files on the Loose HDD indicated that the CD had been inserted into the drive on the computer to which the Loose HDD was attached and the files on the CD had been opened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1046">The Tonita respondents accept that CCC-14 was used in conjunction with the Loose HDD, however, as outlined in [511]ff above, they submit that the Loose HDD was also planted by Mr Channa and its contents fabricated so as to incriminate Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1047">In cross-examination, Mr Allam denied that he had created CCC-14 by copying its contents from the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1048">The Tonita respondents seek to infer that Mr Channa planted the Loose HDD and used it to prepare CCC-14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1049">They say that he had the motive and means to achieve this, and that he incorporated suspicious material onto the CD and the Loose HDD which he thought would incriminate Mr Allam and would be valuable to the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1050">THE DATA MATCHING EXERCISE 
 11.1 Overview 
 In opening its case against the respondents, the Aristocrat companies relied upon an analysis of a large number of serial numbers recorded on invoices seized in the Anton Piller raids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1051">The Aristocrat companies explained in their opening that they explored the serial numbers and identified some 3,500 which "prima facie, were attended by very real questions".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1052">This aspect of the Aristocrat companies' claim was pleaded with extensive particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1053">The gravamen of the claim is stated in [35] of the Amended Consolidated Statement of Claim but the enormity of the allegation is only revealed by reference to the particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1054">The particulars include "additional transactions involving infringements identified in Annexure A and Annexure B".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1055">Those annexures consist of tables in the form of spreadsheets which purport to contain details of commercial invoices and packing lists that record shipments of counterfeit Aristocrat gaming machines identified by serial number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1056">The serial numbers of the machines alleged to be counterfeit were colour-coded in the tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1057">They were explained in opening submissions and in [67A] of the Particulars as follows: These allegations were sought to be proved by the evidence of Ms Gardner, an employee of the solicitors for the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1058">It is apparent that the voluminous particulars were drawn from Ms Gardner's affidavit evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1059">Ms Gardner is (or was at the relevant time) a paralegal with a degree in Design Computing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1060">She conducted an exercise which involved comparing serial numbers and game name data extracted from the respondents' invoices with: In conducting this exercise, Ms Gardner wrote a computer program which performed a comparison of the data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1061">Two aspects of the comparison exercise involved comparisons with information from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1062">These were the serial numbers coded orange and yellow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1063">However, no officer of the OLGR was called to prove that data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1064">Instead, it was put into evidence through an employee of Aristocrat, Mr Brown, the Market Development Manager, Server-Based Gaming.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1065">The respondents sought to meet this evidence by producing a large schedule of material said to have been drawn from relevant invoices issued by Global and Impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1066">The schedule was put into evidence by Mr Andrews in an exhibit marked GGS4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1067">It is true, as was submitted on behalf of the Aristocrat companies, that some of the explanations given by Mr Andrews were revealed under cross-examination to be unacceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1068">This reflects upon Mr Andrews' credit but it does not make good the propositions for which the Aristocrat companies contend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1069">Disbelief of a witness on his or her credit does not amount to positive evidence of the opposite of what is disbelieved: Gauci v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 87; J. D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Aust ed) at [17,600].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1070">The data matching exercise must be considered on the basis of the quality of the evidence adduced by the Aristocrat companies, as the foundation upon which the exercise was conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1071">The question of the quality or sufficiency of the evidence raises two separate sub-issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1072">The first is the evidence pertaining to the OLGR records which formed the basis for the production of the "orange" and "yellow" serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1073">The second is the evidence which was said to have supported the matching exercise in respect of the "fake" serial numbers that were coded red in Ms Gardner's tabulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1074">I will deal separately with each of those evidentiary questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1075">
 11.2 The OLGR Matching Exercise 
 As I have said above, the "orange" or "yellow" serial numbers were identified by a comparison of the serial numbers listed on the respondents' invoices with data from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1076">Plainly, the validity of the results of the matching exercise in respect of these serial numbers depends upon whether Ms Gardner's program used unimpeachable data from the OLGR records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1077">However, I am not satisfied that Mr Brown's evidence established the provenance of the OLGR data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1078">There are two principal reasons for this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1079">First, the spreadsheets which were said to have been provided by the OLGR to Aristocrat covered the period from August 2000 to February 2007, but Mr Brown was not the person within Aristocrat who was responsible for reviewing that information for almost the entirety of that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1080">Mr Brown accepted in cross-examination that prior to June 2006, he was not the person in Aristocrat who had the responsibility for receiving the relevant spreadsheets from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1081">It follows that Mr Brown was not the person who held the relevant responsibility in respect of all but one of the 18 OLGR data files which were used by Ms Gardner in her matching exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1082">Mr Brown effectively conceded this in cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1083">This was of particular significance in the evidentiary underpinnings upon which the matching exercise depended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1084">In particular, it left Mr Brown in the invidious position of being quite unable to explain the substantial number of modifications which were made on the OLGR spreadsheets by other Aristocrat employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1085">Second, Mr Brown did not say in his evidence that the spreadsheets were the documents that were actually received from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1086">Rather, Mr Brown conducted a review which was shown in cross-examination to have been a somewhat cursory exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1087">It is true that Mr Brown said in chief that, based on his review, the files were "the same files that were provided by the OLGR to Aristocrat".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1088">But in cross-examination he conceded that the review process consisted of opening up each of the spreadsheets, looking at them and confirming in his own mind "that they were consistent with the form of the spreadsheets which the OLGR had sent to Aristocrat".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1089">Needless to say, what was required was not evidence of apparent consistency of the form of the spreadsheets, but proof of the actual OLGR data, together with an explanation for any modification made by the relevant Aristocrat employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1090">The significance of this lacuna was revealed in the cross-examination of Ms Gardner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1091">I accept the analysis of the Global/Impact respondents that the workbook which Ms Gardner used in her matching exercise contained data in respect of many thousands of gaming machines that were not recorded in Mr Brown's OLGR worksheets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1092">Ms Gardner conceded in cross-examination that if the worksheets which she relied upon to carry out the matching exercise were not contained in the OLGR records, "all of the orange and yellow results could be false results".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1093">It follows, in my opinion, that the matching exercise which Ms Gardner carried out against the "OLGR data" was flawed because the Aristocrat companies failed to prove the essential premise upon which the exercise depended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1094">Accordingly, the evidence given by Ms Gardner and Mr Brown does not provide any basis for drawing an inference that the machines which were coded "orange" or "yellow" were machines which infringed the Aristocrat companies' copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1095">Notably, in closing submissions the Aristocrat companies did not rely upon Ms Gardner's evidence, but sought to make good their claim upon the basis of the evidence given by Mr Brown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1096">However, for the reasons set out above, Mr Brown's evidence provides an insufficient evidentiary foundation for the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1097">
 11.3 The "fake" invoice exercise 
 The data matching exercise which produced the allegedly fake serial numbers, colour-coded red, was carried out by a process of interrogating the Aristocrat companies' databases with a list of serial numbers taken from Global/Impact invoices seized in the Anton Piller raids.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1098">The databases are known as Manfact and PeopleSoft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1099">These systems recorded the unique serial numbers that were attached to each individual gaming machine to enable it to be identified or tracked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1100">The Manfact system was in operation until 2001 or 2002 when it was replaced by PeopleSoft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1101">The process that was undertaken was, no doubt, a detailed and painstaking exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1102">It commenced with the preparation of a spreadsheet created by Mr Michael Cooley, a solicitor employed by Gilbert + Tobin, and another lawyer from that firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1103">In order to prepare the spreadsheet, they separated, selected and printed the seized invoices and entered them in electronic folders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1104">Mr Cooley created two separate spreadsheets, one for Manfact, the other for PeopleSoft.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1105">He provided the Manfact spreadsheet to Mr Kevin Batch, a database administrator employed by Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1106">Mr Cooley provided the PeopleSoft spreadsheet to Ms Rebecca Estepa, a data analyst employed by Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1107">The Manfact spreadsheet contained approximately 2,500 serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1108">The PeopleSoft spreadsheets contained approximately 1,000 serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1109">Mr Batch interrogated the Manfact system to determine whether the serial numbers contained on the spreadsheet appeared on the records contained in the Manfact database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1110">Ms Estepa performed the same exercise for the PeopleSoft spreadsheet on the PeopleSoft database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1111">Mr Batch and Mrs Estepa then produced spreadsheets of those serial numbers which did not appear on the Manfact and PeopleSoft databases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1112">Mr Cooley then caused, no doubt with some assistance, the unmatched serial numbers located by Mr Batch and Ms Estepa to be copied into a worksheet from which a further spreadsheet was created and provided to Ms Gardner for entry into her workbook Plainly, the potential for human error in carrying out the various steps involved in the total exercise was great.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1113">The tedium is obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1114">It is an atmosphere in which human error thrives, as was exposed in cross-examination of Mr Batch and Ms Estepa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1115">Ultimately, there are two reasons why I give little or no weight to the results of the data matching exercise which produced the "red" or "fake" invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1116">The first is the errors to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1117">These resulted, at least in some instances, from the literal and uncritical approach which was adopted in the matching exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1118">Thus, for example, the number "1" was misread as the letter "I" and incorrectly transcribed so that the incorrect prefix on serial numbers shown as DVI were assumed to be invoices which did not match the Aristocrat companies' databases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1119">Other errors included a number shown as ending with a "?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1120">" instead of a "1" and the addition of a space between numbers which should have been inserted as consecutive numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1121">The Global/Impact respondents submitted that the computer matching exercise was cynically designed to produce as many false matches as possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1122">I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1123">There was no proper basis for such a bold assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1124">It is an example of the highly charged atmosphere in which the case was fought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1125">A submission that the Aristocrat companies had deliberately over-reached in their claims was itself an example of over-reaching on the part of the Global/Impact respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1126">Nevertheless, I accept the proposition that the exercise was tainted by human error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1127">That proposition is, as I have said, clear enough from the nature of the exercise and the mind-numbing steps involved in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1128">Doubtless, the accuracy of the tasks was not assisted by the involvement of lawyers in the process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1129">It is hardly an exercise for which a law degree was an essential prerequisite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1130">Second, the Manfact and PeopleSoft databases did not necessarily record serial numbers for those machines that were destined for foreign markets, or apparently for markets outside of NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1131">This was the effect of the concessions made in cross-examination by Mr Neil Hogg, the General Manager, Business Process Development, of Aristocrat, who was the person with overall responsibility for maintenance of the databases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1132">Mr Hogg indicated that the regulatory requirements only obliged the Aristocrat companies to record the serial numbers of those gaming machines that were destined for NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1133">His evidence was that in practice, most serial numbers were recorded regardless of the destination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1134">However he conceded that there may have been instances when Aristocrat machines were shipped, for example, to the United States and the serial numbers were not recorded on the system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1135">It follows that the matching exercise which produced "red" serial numbers cannot be accepted as proof of the assertion that the serial numbers were fake in respect of those gaming machines obtained by the Global/Impact markets from regions outside NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1136">Although this does not dispose of all of the "red" serial numbers, I consider that the exercise that was carried out with respect to the "red" serial numbers cannot be relied upon for the first reason explained above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1137">That is, the exercise carried out by the Aristocrat companies has plainly resulted in numerous errors which call into question the reliability of the results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1138">For present purposes, it is convenient to refer to one example of a transaction undertaken by Global which was claimed by Aristocrat to involve fake serial numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1139">This is transaction number 22 in the Aristocrat companies' list of infringing transactions, which was recorded on invoice number 531 as a sale to New Star Internacional SRL, Argentina, dated 20 June 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1140">Mr Andrews' evidence was that the machines which were the subject of this transaction were obtained by Global from the MGM Grand Casino in Darwin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1141">This explanation was given by Mr Andrews in his schedule which became Exhibit GGS4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1142">Mr Andrews said that the machines the subject of the transaction were shipped to Goldstar Gaming, located in St Peters, NSW, and then to the customer, "without coming into the direct possession of GGS".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1143">Although the explanations given in Exhibit GGS4 must be treated with caution, it seems to me that the documentary evidence supports Mr Andrews' explanation in relation to this shipment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1144">The documents included an email from Mr Ian Dowling of MGM Grand Casino to Mr Andrews dated 31 March 2003 which stated that MGM Grand Darwin had 65 gaming machines for which it had no further use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1145">Machine and game details were attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1146">These included a large number of the machines that were comprised in transaction number 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1147">I reject the submission of the Aristocrat companies that the documentary evidence bears no relationship to the machines referred to in Mr Dowling's email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1148">It is true that the list which was apparently attached to Mr Dowling's email includes machines that were not the subject of transaction number 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1149">But an examination of the list shows that the 33 machines identified by the Aristocrat companies in their closing submissions as contained within the transaction were all included in Mr Dowling's list.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1150">The documents referred to in GGS4 also included a Forwarding Instruction from JAS Forwarding Worldwide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1151">The document listed Goldstar Gaming's address in St Peters NSW as the pick up address, and New Star Internacional SRL as the consignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1152">On this basis of this evidence, as with the Play King transaction, I am satisfied that the machines in question were never in the possession of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1153">THE BURDEN OF PROOF The Tonita respondents submitted that the Aristocrat companies have failed to prove their claims in accordance with the standard of proof required by s 140 of the Evidence Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1154">Section 140(1) provides that in a civil proceeding, the Court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1155">Section 140(2) sets out a non-exhaustive list of the matters that the Court is to take into account in deciding whether it is satisfied that the case has been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1156">These are, relevantly: (a) the nature of the cause of action, (b) the nature of the subject matter and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1157">The proper approach to the construction and application of s 140 has been considered in a number of authorities of the Full Court of the Federal Court and by the Court of Appeal of NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1158">The following propositions are to be gleaned from those authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1159">First, the standard of proof which is required in a civil case is the balance of probabilities, but the Court should not determine whether it is so satisfied until the final stage of the reasoning process, taking into account the matters referred to in s 140(2): Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 ; (2008) 167 FCR 537 at [110] and [139]; Palmer v Dolman [2005] NSWCA 361 at [40] - [41] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1160">Second, although there is some difference in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate to describe the standard of proof under s 140 as the Briginshaw standard, the cases all recognise that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved: Qantas v Gama at [110] and [139]; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at [30] - [36] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1161">The authorities which were analysed by the Full Courts in arriving at the conclusion stated in the second proposition included, in particular, the decisions of the High Court in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66 ; (1992) 110 ALR 449 and Rejfek v McElroy [1965] HCA 46 ; (1965) 112 CLR 517.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1162">Third, the Court of Appeal of NSW has accepted that the balance of probabilities test stated in s 140 requires the Court to reach a level of actual persuasion: Nguyen v Cosmopolitan Homes [2008] NSWCA 246 at [55] ; Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuiness [2000] NSWCA 29 ; (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at [136] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1163">However, the learned editor of Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (8 th ed, 2009) observes at [1.4.100] that: 
 
 It is difficult to see how the proposition that "actual persuasion" is required can stand under [s 140 of] the Act [...].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1164">
 
 Fourth, the position stated by the Full Court of the Federal Court exposes a difference of views on the question of whether the trier of fact must feel "an actual persuasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1165">" Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ accepted that the Court must be so persuaded in Communications and Allied Services Union v ACCC at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1166">But that observation was based upon the statement of Dixon J in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; [1938] 60 CLR 336 at 361-362.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1167">In Qantas v Gama at [123] and [139], Branson J (with whom French and Jacobson JJ expressed general agreement) considered that the Briginshaw test has been replaced by the provisions of s 140 , and should be avoided due to its tendency to mislead.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1168">Fifth, where an allegation is to be proved from circumstantial evidence, it is sufficient if the circumstances raise a more probable inference in favour of the allegation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1169">Where the allegation is a serious one, the inquiry is to take account of the requirements of s 140(2)(c) , and what was said by the High Court in Neat Holdings about the need for caution in making such a finding: Palmer v Dolman at [39], [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1170">Sixth, it is sufficient if the circumstances give rise to a reasonable and definite inference; but if they produce conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a matter of conjecture, the allegation is not proved: Palmer v Dolman at [35], [36], [41]; Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd (1951) 217 ALR 1 at 5; Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19 ; (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358 and other High Court authorities cited in Palmer v Dolman at [36]; see also The Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 6 ; (2006) 227 CLR 278 at [34] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1171">Here, the causes of action are copyright infringement, trade mark infringement and damages for misleading and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1172">There is also a claim for conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1173">Although it was submitted by the respondents that the claims were analogous to a claim of conspiracy, that allegation does not form part of the causes of action pressed by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1174">Nevertheless, the subject matter of the proceeding may be seen as a claim of copyright piracy in which all of the respondents were knowingly involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1175">The matters which are alleged are of some gravity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1176">These factors must be taken into account under s 140(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1177">The allegations are sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence, together with some direct evidence, in particular that of Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1178">To the extent that the claims are based upon circumstantial evidence, they will not be made out unless I am satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities, taking due account of what was said in Neat Holdings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1179">AUTHORISATION/JOINT VENTURE: LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 13.1 Background 
 The Aristocrat companies claim that the respondents are liable for copyright infringement, either as joint tortfeasors or on the ground that one or other of them has authorised the copyright infringement carried out by the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1180">The legal principles applicable to each of these separate heads of liability have been considered in some detail by the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1181">I do not consider that there is any real dispute between the parties as to those principles, but I will refer to them briefly below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1182">The Statement of Claim also pleads that one or other of the Global, Impact or Tonita respondents induced, directed or procured the other parties to infringe the copyright of the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1183">This may raise for consideration the question of the liability of directors or other "officers" for corporate wrongdoing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1184">That is a question as to which there are competing lines of authority to which I will refer briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1185">
 13.2 Authorisation 
 Section 36(1) of the Copyright Act provides that the copyright in a work is infringed where a person, without the licence of the owner, does or "authorises" the doing of an act comprised in the copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1186">Section 36(1A) contains a non-exhaustive list of mandatory considerations that the Court must take into account in determining whether a person has authorised an infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1187">They are: In Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 , Kenny J and Branson J each endorsed a wide approach to the concept of "authorisation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1188">French J agreed with the reasons given by each of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1189">In Cooper at [136], Kenny J observed that s 101(1A) of the Copyright Act (which corresponds to the current s 36(1A)) is premised on the concept of "authorisation" developed by the High Court in University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1975) 133 CLR 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1190">Moorehouse is authority for the proposition that "authorisation" means "sanction, approve, countenance"; express or formal permission is not required: per Gibbs J at 12-13; per Jacobs J at 20-21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1191">Gibbs J said at 13: 
 
 ... a person who has under his control the means by which an infringement of copyright may be committed --- such as a photocopying machine --- and who makes it available to other persons, knowing, or having reason to suspect, that it is likely to be used for the purpose of committing an infringement, and omitting to take reasonable steps to limit its use to legitimate purposes, would authorize any infringement that resulted from its use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1192">
 
 Kenny J also referred in Cooper to the observations of Gummow J in WEA International Inc v Hanimex Corporation Limited (1987) 17 FCR 274 at 285-286.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1193">Gummow J there pointed to the broad concept of "authorisation" accepted by the High Court in Moorhouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1194">Branson J's approach to the proper construction of s 101(1A) at [34]ff was to similar effect to that of Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1195">Both Branson J, at [38], and Kenny J, at [145], referred to the decision of a Full Court in Australasian Performing Right Association Limited v Jain (1990) 26 FCR 53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1196">There, Sheppard, Foster and Hill JJ held at 61 that a "studied and deliberate course of action" in which a respondent had decided to ignore the applicant's rights and to allow a situation to develop which he must have known would be likely to result in an infringement, amounted to an authorisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1197">Jain was an authority on the question of the degree of control that was required to give rise to an authorisation prior to the enactment of s 36(1A) and s 101(1A).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1198">But as Kenny J observed at [140] and [146], that case emphasises the breadth of the concept of authorisation and that a failure to take reasonable steps to prevent an infringing act is a relevant consideration to a finding of authorisation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1199">The degree of control, the nature of the relationship between the parties and the question of "reasonable steps" are now enshrined in s 36(1A)(a), (b) and (c), which I am required to take into account in determining whether the claims of "authorisation" are made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1200">
 13.3 Joint tortfeasors 
 As Gummow J explained in WEA International at 283, infringement of copyright statutes are considered tortious, so as to make applicable the common law principles of liability of joint tortfeasors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1201">It is not sufficient to establish a claim of joint liability that two or more persons assisted or concurred in or contributed to a tortious act; what is required is that there be "some common design": WEA at 283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1202">In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Cooper [2005] FCA 972 ; (2005) 150 FCR 1 at [135] , Tamberlin J pointed out that it follows from the remarks of Gummow J in WEA International that: 
 
 ... there must be something in the nature of concerted action or agreed common action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1203">It is not necessary that there must be an explicitly mapped out plan with the primary offenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1204">Tacit agreement between the parties is sufficient ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s1205">.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1206">
 
 Tamberlin J referred to Australian and English authority which support the abovementioned statement of principle including the decision of the High Court in Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Limited [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 and the seminal English case, The Koursk [1924] P 140.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1207">Siopis J cited the relevant passage from the decision of Tamberlin J with apparent approval in Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v The Mod Shop Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 463 ; (2008) 165 FCR 149 at [133] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1208">
 13.4 Liability of officers 
 In WEA International at 283, Gummow J pointed out that where the infringer is a corporation, questions often arise as to the degree of involvement on the part of directors necessary for them to be rendered personally liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1209">He observed that this question is not answered by the principles which govern "authorisation" and joint tortfeasance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1210">Rather, recourse is to be had to the authorities which explain the circumstances in which a director or officer will be personally liable for the torts of the corporation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1211">It is those authorities which prompted Kenny J to say in Cooper at [160] that the law concerning the liability of directors and officers for corporate wrongdoing is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1212">Three separate tests have been stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1213">The first is the " Performing Right Society test", namely whether the director "directed or procured" the company's infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1214">The second is the " Mentmore test", that is whether the director or officer "makes the tortious act his own" by deliberate, wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement: see the discussion of Finkelstein J in Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [123] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1215">The third test was formulated by Finkelstein J in Root Quality at [146].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1216">The test is that the director's conduct is such that: 
 
 ... he was so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act that it is just that he should be rendered liable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1217">
 
 Kenny J said in Cooper at [161] that she agreed with the test stated by Finkelstein J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1218">So did Wilcox J in Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 220 ALR 1 at [434] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1219">He went on to add a qualification, that the person need not be a director of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1220">As Kenny J said in Cooper at [161], no Full Court has settled which of the tests is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1221">However, I do not need to consider the question because, in my view, it is essential to recognise that the debate in the authorities as to the test to be applied to the liability of directors or officers for the wrongs of the corporation is a different question from that which applies to the question of liability for "authorisation" or joint tortfeasance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1222">This was what Gummow J pointed out in WEA International at 283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1223">CREDIT OF WITNESSES 
 14.1 The Aristocrat companies' witnesses 
 Subject to the observations I have made about Mr Channa, it seemed to me that the witnesses called by the Aristocrat companies were, generally speaking, truthful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1224">They made concessions where appropriate and, apart from specific matters to which I have referred in the course of these reasons, I accept their evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1225">The respondents suggested that Mr Juan Pablo Irarrazaval, the General Business Manager of Latin America for ATI, was not a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1226">Mr Irarrazaval's evidence dealt principally with the market for gaming machines, including second hand machines, in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1227">It will be necessary to return to his evidence when dealing with the question of quantum, but I should observe here that he seemed to be a witness of truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1228">Mr Ogborne submitted that he was an advocate for the Aristocrat companies, and there was some force in that submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1229">However, when considering his evidence as a whole, I do not think that his "advocacy" was so great as to impair the credibility of his detailed evidence of the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1230">I was in no doubt that Mr Irarrazaval is highly intelligent, experienced and capable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1231">He seemed to me to have a sound knowledge of the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1232">
 14.2 The respondents' witnesses 
 
 14.2.1 Mr Andrews 
 I was not impressed with Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1233">His evidence seemed to me to be lacking in candour and answers had to be extracted from him with some difficulty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1234">In his affidavit evidence, Mr Andrews denied that any EPROM or artwork was ever copied by or on behalf of the Global or Impact respondents or otherwise and installed into a gaming machine in the course of supplying machines to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1235">He went further in his oral evidence when asked whether he or anyone on behalf of the Global/Impact Joint Venture had suggested to anyone that they make copies of Aristocrat artwork in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1236">Mr Andrews' answer to that question was "[n]ot to my knowledge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1237">He was then asked whether he had supplied artwork to anybody in South America, having in mind the possibility that they may make copies of the artwork in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1238">His answer was "not necessarily, no".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1239">I thought this answer was quite evasive and his later answers showed it to be untrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1240">Mr Andrews was also asked whether he had sent artwork to South America with the suggestion that they copy gaming chips to match the artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1241">His answer was "[n]ot to my knowledge".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1242">These answers were in the teeth of the suggestions made quite expressly by Mr Andrews in the undated email which I have set out at [272].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1243">But when taken to the email in cross-examination, Mr Andrews sought to avoid the implications that flowed from his own suggestion by saying: 
 
 ... everybody did it in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1244">[They're] serial counterfeiters over there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1245">
 
 There were other examples of prevarication by Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1246">One was his refusal to accept that the email which I have set out at [279] was an offer to have compliance plates made up with fake serial numbers placed on them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1247">The email went to the lengths of asking whether the serial numbers on the gaming machines could be "random that we think up or can they be running numbers".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1248">Mr Andrews said in cross-examination that if Mr Mendelson requested a set serial number that was not available from the Global/Impact stock at Botany, Mr Andrews would not have supplied the compliance plates, however this answer is not consistent with what was said in the email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1249">A further example was the answers he gave when cross-examined about the options for supplying artwork to South America as set out in the email at [270].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1250">The following exchange is revealing: 
 
 Q: And a second choice is to create a copy of the artwork by some digital means but not by screen-printing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1251">A: That's possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1252">Q: And the quality would not be as good as screen-printing?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1253">A: I don't know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1254">Q: Do you know whether it would be hard to tell the difference between digital artwork of Aristocrat artwork and screen printed artwork of Aristocrat artwork?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1255">A: I don't really know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1256">
 
 Mr Andrews' statement that he did not know whether it would be hard to tell the difference between digital artwork and screen printed artwork is totally at odds with the unequivocal view he expressed in parenthesis in his email.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1257">Indeed, the answers given by Mr Andrews to questions he was asked about the emails which I have set out at [275], [284], [292], [296], [306], [308], [310] and [319] contain further examples of his untruthfulness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1258">Moreover, I reject his denial that the use of the Yahoo email address referred to in the email at [314] was adopted to avoid detection of sensitive information, in particular information that was suggestive of copyright infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1259">The new email address was adopted less than three weeks after an Anton Piller raid on Mr Parry, a business colleague of Mr Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1260">I think it is highly unlikely that Mr Andrews would not have known of the raid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1261">I thought his answers when pressed about the connection with the raid and the "sensitive subjects" were evasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1262">Finally, I should refer to Mr Andrews' evidence regarding the documents he put forward to try to explain the "fake" serial numbers referred to by Ms Gardner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1263">I have no doubt that the exercise of answering Ms Gardner's evidence was a time consuming and tedious one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1264">An element of frustration on Mr Andrews' part in dealing with the documents would be hard to quibble with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1265">But in my view Mr Andrews gave answers which were not credible when seeking to answer some of the data in the matching exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1266">The most notable was his evidence at pages 1207 to 1209 of the transcript in which he was asked about the identification of invoice number 1155 which was contained in Exhibit GGS2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1267">According to Mr Andrews, invoice number 1155, which was also referred to on pages 311 to 312 of Exhibit GGS4, was the final invoice for a shipment of gaming machines to South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1268">But an examination of what was said to be the original invoice, appearing at page 247 of Exhibit GGS2, showed the consignee as Cathay Entretenimientos S.A.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1269">of Lima, Peru, whereas a DHL Forwarding Instruction from Global bearing the same number, at Exhibit GGS1 page 846, showed the consignee as Assembling Accessories S.A. of Uruguay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1270">Mr Andrews' attempt to explain the discrepancy as "a transfer of ownership on the water" was not credible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1271">
 14.2.2 Mr Cragen 
 Mr Cragen's evidence was at odds with contemporaneous documents in a number of material aspects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1272">In particular, his efforts to explain away and distance himself from emails which suggested knowledge of, or participation in, copyright infringement were quite unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1273">This can be seen in the following examples.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1274">The first is his attempt to explain the email from Mr Andrews to Mr Mendelson set out at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1275">When he was asked whether the statement in the email "do you want them all made up in the same year" was a reference to compliance plates that Mr Mendelson wanted Mr Andrews to make up, Mr Cragen replied that it was not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1276">The following exchange then took place: 
 
 Q: That is a reference, is it not, to some compliance plates that Mr Mendelson, wanted Mr Andrews to make up for him?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1277">A: No, in actual fact, as I recall that situation, Mr Mendelson had been to Uruguay and he had indicated that he could probably dispose of the whole of that Uruguay shipment to Russia, if it could be completed, and he wanted two sample machines made up and think that the correspondence that Mr Andrews is referring to there, we were going to possibly send a couple of compliance plates over from Sydney, or use the numbers that were on the compliance plates that we had left over [that] had been removed from stripped machines, but it never happed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1278">He wanted two machines for fitting cash code bill acceptors for Russia, but the whole Russian market fell apart.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1279">
 
 It was then put to Mr Cragen that his explanation was false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1280">Mr Cragen gave a series of quite unconvincing answers including: 
 
 Q: You know perfectly well it is not a reference to two, it is a reference to a series of compliance plates that Mr Mendelson wants made up using fake Aristocrat numbers?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1281">A: I don't believe so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1282">Q: And being counterfeit compliance plates?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1283">A: I beg your pardon?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1284">Q: And being counterfeit compliance plates and that you knew that this was a request to create Aristocrat compliance plates with a series of numbers using the XAW5 dot, dot, dot series?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1285">A: If that was what it was it didn't happen, but it wasn't.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1286">Q: I want to suggest to you that answer is quite false, Mr Cragen?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1287">A: I beg your pardon?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1288">Q: I want to suggest to you that answer is quite false?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1289">A: No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1290">
 
 The second example is Mr Cragen's attempt to explain the email set out at [306].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1291">This was an email from Mr Andrews to Mr Trajkovski about the failure to return original artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1292">Mr Cobden put to Mr Cragen that the intention at the time was to send the original artwork to South America for the purpose of having it copied and then returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1293">Mr Cragen said initially that he did not know; he then said he did not believe that was the intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1294">Next he tried to explain the difficulty away by saying "but [Mr Trajkovski] kept them" and "didn't pay for them".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1295">Eventually Mr Cragen conceded that his intention and understanding of the plan was that Mr Trajkovski would borrow the artwork and return it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1296">He went so far as conceding that Mr Trajkovski may have had the intention to copy the artwork, but Mr Cragen refused to concede that he knew the plan to be for Mr Trajkovski to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1297">Third, it was put to Mr Cragen that he knew that games were copied onto CDs by people associated with the Joint Venture in Australia and taken to South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1298">Mr Cragen said he did not know, but he conceded that he had seen correspondence dated 2005 to 2006 to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1299">Mr Cobden then put to Mr Cragen that he did not, at the time, raise any protest to the copying of games, to which Mr Cragen answered: 
 
 It's my evidence that it didn't happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1300">
 
 Fourth, Mr Cragen sought to deny the obvious implication of the email from Mr Nuevo set out at [312].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1301">When Mr Cragen was asked about the meaning of the email, the following exchange took place: 
 
 Q: ... What this email means, does it not, is that Mr Nuevo wanted the software sent to him so that he could duplicate it on to blank chips?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1302">A: I believe Mr Nuevo wanted an EPROM, which I suppose he was sent, I don't know, and he wanted some blank chips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1303">What he wanted to do with the blank chips, I don t know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1304">
 
 The evidence to which I have referred above reflects badly on Mr Cragen's credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1305">I do not accept him as a reliable witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1306">
 14.2.3 Mr Allam 
 Mr Allam's evidence in chief was contained in his affidavit sworn on 30 July 2008, as supplemented by some short oral evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1307">The affidavit occupied 76 pages and contained 433 paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1308">It was written in plain English and was, for the most part, clearly expressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1309">The affidavit was, clearly enough, Mr Allam's evidence in answer to the large and somewhat complex case brought against him by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1310">I would have assumed, when reading it, that the affidavit was intended to give a full account of all of the critical aspects of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1311">In the witness box, under cross-examination, Mr Allam presented as an excitable witness, prone to dramatic outbursts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1312">Mr Green submitted that the form of Mr Cobden's cross-examination was designed to insult and inflame Mr Allam and that it was framed in a way that was apt to mislead a non-English speaker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1313">I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1314">There was nothing unfair in the cross-examination nor were Mr Cobden's questions in any way improper having regard to Mr Allam's language, background or skills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1315">Mr Allam immigrated to Australia from Lebanon in 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1316">He has a university degree in electronics from the University of Technology in Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1317">He holds a technician's licence from the OLGR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1318">He has worked for very large electronics corporations in Beirut, Damascus and Sydney, and has conducted his own business in Sydney since about 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1319">Although Mr Allam speaks English with an accent and with some measure of idiomatic expression, he appeared to me to be quite fluent and to have no difficulty in giving his evidence in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1320">I do not consider that he was disadvantaged by linguistic difficulties in understanding Mr Cobden's questions or in giving his evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1321">Rather, the explanation for Mr Allam's emotional state in the witness box seems to me to have come about from his own attitude to the litigation, not from any provocation on the part of the cross-examiner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1322">This was revealed before Mr Allam entered the witness box when, in the course of Mr Channa's evidence, Mr Allam called out a threat in Arabic: 
 
 By Almighty God, I will ruin your house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1323">
 
 When considering Mr Allam's credit, there are a number of aspects of his evidence in chief which need to be recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1324">They are: I will deal with each of these below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1325">
 14.2.3.1 COMPLIANCE PLATES AT BANKSTOWN AND GEORGES HALL 
 Mr Parsons gave evidence that 12 compliance plates seized at Georges Hall and 67 seized at Bankstown were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1326">Photographs of the plates were contained in Exhibit BHP-2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1327">He identified the features of the compliance plates which indicated that they were not genuine Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1328">Mr Parsons' evidence and a sample photograph of the compliance plates seized from Georges Hall shows that six of the compliance plates were blank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1329">That is to say, the manufacture date, the serial number and the machine type are blank but the Aristocrat logo and other standard information appear on the compliance plate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1330">Mr Parsons said that the compliance plate was not genuine because it appears, inter alia , to have been screen printed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1331">The indicia of counterfeiting to which Mr Parsons pointed on the compliance plates seized at Bankstown included the appearance of screen printing and engraving of the compliance plates with lettering that did not comply with Aristocrat specifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1332">Mr Parsons also identified seven compliance plates at Botany which he said were counterfeit because they had a number of features including hand engraving.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1333">Mr Allam said that he had "only ever seen 2 of those seized compliance plates", referring to compliance plates which were similar to those shown in Mr Parsons' photographs on pages 4, 5 and 6 of Exhibit BHP-2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1334">Those pages contained photographs of compliance plates seized at Botany, Georges Hall and Bankstown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1335">As to the compliance plates seized at his home at Georges Hall, Mr Allam said he believed that they were placed in his car by Mr Channa at the end of 2006 and that he removed them from his car and placed them in his house before going away on holidays in January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1336">Mr Allam went on to say that prior to their seizure from his home on 1 February 2007, he was not aware that there were compliance plates of any sort at his home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1337">Mr Allam's answer to the seizure of the remaining compliance plates, which included blank compliance plates seized at Botany, Georges Hall and Bankstown, was that he had told Mr Channa to destroy them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1338">Mr Allam set out the conversation he claimed to have had with Mr Channa about that topic: 
 
 I had a discussion with Mr Channa about these blank compliance plates during which we said words to the following effect: 
 

 
 
 Mr Channa: Riad look what I got from Behong [he showed to me a bundle of blank Aristocrat compliance plates]
 Me: These plates should not be used by anyone except Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1339">I do not want these anywhere they must be destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1340">Mr Channa: Should I through [sic] them in the bin or take them back to Behong
 Me: No, these plates must be destroyed as they should not be in anyone's property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1341">Do not put any of these plates in the truck, or anywhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1342">You must destroy the plates now because they are illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1343">Mr Channa: Who would know?</sentence>
<sentence id="s1344">Me: You don't know who knows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1345">You know about the trouble Tony has with Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1346">We cannot take any risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1347">This plate cannot be used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1348">You must get rid of it now but don't put it in my bin or in my car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1349">
 
 According to Mr Allam, Mr Channa then left with the compliance plates and "we did not discuss the issue again".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1350">However, Mr Allam went on to say that in October or November 2006 he saw his workers with compliance plates that were "similar or identical" to those which Mr Channa had shown him and which he had asked Mr Channa to destroy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1351">Mr Allam then said: 
 
 Upon discovering the use of the Aristocrat MK6 series style plates, which I had already asked Mr Channa to destroy or dispose of, I had a conversation with one of my workers, either Mladen or Pete to the effect of the following: 
 

 
 
 Me: We cannot use this plate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1352">Where did you get this from
 Mladen or Pete: Chris gave them to me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1353">Me: We cannot use these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1354">You must collect all of these plates you have and from the boys and throw them out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1355">We cannot use it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1356">
 
 He went on to say that he observed Mladen or Pete collect "a small number" of the compliance plates and that he did not see them again until after the Anton Piller raid on the Botany workshop on 1 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1357">Notwithstanding the instructions he claimed to have given to Mr Channa and to his employees to destroy or throw out the compliance plates, Mr Allam claimed that the compliance plates which were seized at the Bankstown warehouse and at the Botany workshop were "planted" by Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1358">Mr Cobden cross-examined Mr Allam on the conversations which I have set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1359">He put it to Mr Allam that the conversations were fabricated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1360">I am satisfied that they were fabricated for the purpose of falsely denying the serious claims made against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1361">This finding is based not merely upon my observations of Mr Allam in the witness box, but upon the inherent improbabilities of the conversation takings place, as was revealed in the cross-examination appearing at transcript pages 1567 to 1578.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1362">First, it seems to me to be unlikely in the extreme that if Mr Channa presented Mr Allam with a set of illegal compliance plates, Mr Allam would have entrusted the task of destroying them to Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1363">Mr Channa was an employee who was inexperienced in the gaming industry, whose duties Mr Allam described as driving trucks and sorting materials at the Bankstown warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1364">Yet according to Mr Allam, he left it to Mr Channa to destroy the plates (without any supervision or follow-up), notwithstanding the fact that Mr Allam was concerned that proceedings had already been commenced by the Aristocrat companies against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1365">Second, I do not think it is likely that Mr Allam would have instructed Mr Channa not to "put it in my bin or in my car".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1366">This is because the situation about which Mr Allam professed to be concerned was the presence on his premises of illegal compliance plates which would constitute incriminating evidence in the event that Mr Allam was subject to an Anton Piller order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1367">He said he wanted those plates to be destroyed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1368">If that were said, it was a very plain instruction which was inconsistent with any suggestion of putting the plates in a bin or in Mr Allam's car.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1369">Even if Mr Allam instructed Mr Channa to destroy the plates (which I do not accept), an instruction not to put them in Mr Allam's car was, at very least, an embellishment which was unlikely to have been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1370">It bore no natural connection with the situation confronting Mr Allam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1371">In my opinion, the instruction not to put the compliance plates in Mr Allam's car was concocted with a view to lending support for the suggestion that, contrary to his express instructions, Mr Channa planted the evidence in the manner stated in [325] of Mr Allam's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1372">Third, in the course of cross-examination on the conversations, Mr Allam added details which painted an entirely different picture of the events than those depicted in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1373">In particular, he said he told Mladen or Pete not to use the compliance plates they had been given by Mr Channa, but to use the blank compliance plates which had been obtained from the Uruguay transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1374">Moreover, he said Mladen or Pete engraved those compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1375">Not only was there no reference in Mr Allam's affidavit to engraving the Uruguay plates, in his oral evidence, he disclosed for the first time that he had a hand engraver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1376">He went on to assert that he had never engraved any other compliance plates, other than those acquired in relation to the Uruguay transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1377">The fact that Mr Allam had an engraver, and the assertion that he had used it only in the limited circumstances stated in cross-examination, were highly material to answering the evidence of Mr Parsons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1378">Yet he made no reference to it in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1379">What emerged in cross-examination points to the falsity of Mr Allam's account of the conversation with Mladen or Pete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1380">It also points to the existence of a piece of equipment which was capable of producing the counterfeit compliance plates found on the Anton Piller raids and suggests that Mr Allam's evidence that he had only ever engraved the Uruguay plates was also false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1381">Fourth, the instruction which Mr Allam said he gave to Mladen or Pete to "throw out" the blank compliance plates would have been, on his evidence, the second occasion on which his express instructions were ignored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1382">The first instruction was purportedly given to Mr Channa and the second to Mladen or Pete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1383">The proposition that very important instructions to destroy materials were ignored twice, thereby enabling incriminating material to remain in existence, and indeed be deliberately planted in Mr Allam's car and on his premises, is one that I cannot accept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1384">Nor can I accept one of the basic premises which is said to underlie the conversation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1385">According to Mr Allam, Mr Channa told him that he got the blank compliance plates from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1386">Yet Mr Channa vehemently denied that he had ever visited Behong without Mr Allam or to collect materials by himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1387">I accept Mr Channa's evidence on this topic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1388">
 14.2.3.2 FALSE DENIALS OF USE OF CCC-14 AND THE LOOSE HDD 
 I set out at sections 9.5.5.2 and 10 the evidence relating to the Loose HDD and 
CCC-14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1389">It is plain from the evidence of Mr McKemmish and Mr Carson that the Loose HDD had been used to burn or read binary data and that CCC-14 had been viewed on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1390">Notwithstanding this, Mr Allam maintained that he had never used or accessed CCC-14 and that it had been planted by Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1391">He made the same claim with respect to the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1392">I have already stated that I cannot accept Mr Allam's evidence that Mr Channa manufactured false evidence and placed it on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1393">The same finding applies to CCC-14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1394">In my opinion, Mr Allam's denials of the evidence against him on CCC-14 and the Loose HDD were false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1395">His assertions that the evidence was manufactured and planted upon him are so unlikely to be true that I regard his evidence as entirely without credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1396">Indeed, when considered together with his fabricated evidence of the conversations about the compliance plates, I am satisfied that Mr Allam was an untruthful witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1397">PRELIMINARY FINDINGS ON COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 
 15.1 Subject matter of claims 
 At the conclusion of oral argument, Mr Cobden withdrew a claim that had been relied upon by the Aristocrat companies throughout the hearing for copyright infringement in EPROM labels, both as literary works and artistic works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1398">In doing so, Mr Cobden observed that the withdrawal of that aspect of the case was not a concession with respect to the significance of "imitation" EPROM labels in determining whether EPROMs had been copied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1399">However, the withdrawal of the claim for copyright infringement in relation to the labels confined the copyright case to one of direct or indirect infringement in relation to imitation game software, imitation artwork and imitation compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1400">
 15.2 What flows from the credit findings 
 It is, of course, for the Aristocrat companies to prove their case on the balance of probabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1401">But the claims are based largely on circumstantial evidence and my assessment of the credit of the principal witnesses for the respondents enables me to make a number of preliminary factual findings, against which the 54 transactions in issue will fall for determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1402">Stripped down to their bare essentials, it is possible to identify five essential propositions which I will explain in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1403">First, the Tonita respondents burned Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs using the Dataman software to carry out this exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1404">Second, the Tonita respondents manufactured fake Aristocrat compliance plates, some of which were found at Botany, Bankstown and Georges Hall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1405">Third, Mr Andrews was aware that Mr Allam was burning Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1406">So too was Mr Cragen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1407">Fourth, Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware that Mr Allam was manufacturing false compliance plates for export to foreign markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1408">Fifth, Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen sent, or were aware that the Global/Impact Joint Venture had sent, digital artwork to South America for the purpose of having it copied there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1409">They also sent original artwork, or were aware that original artwork had been sent, to South America for copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1410">I will deal with each of these propositions below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1411">
 15.2.1 The Tonita respondents burned Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs 
 As I said earlier, it is plain that the Loose HDD was used to burn primary data onto EPROM chips and that CCC-14 was viewed on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1412">In making that finding, I accept the evidence of Mr McKemmish and Mr Carson: see [500] and [509].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1413">The Loose HDD was seized on the raid at Mr Allam's premises and CCC-14 was provided to the Aristocrat companies by Mr Channa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1414">There can be no question that both of these items of evidence were the property of the Tonita respondents and that the Loose HDD was used by them to burn Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1415">The inference to be drawn from the relevant email correspondence referred to above is that the Tonita respondents sent the pirated Aristocrat software to South America for use in the South American market: see [275], [276], [284], [286], [295], [296], [312], [316].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1416">A large number of EPROMs were seized at the Tonita respondents' Bankstown Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1417">In light of Mr Polaczek's evidence, which I accept, and having regard also to Mr Allam's false denials of the source of the Loose HDD and CCC-14, I find that the EPROMs seized at the Bankstown Premises were counterfeit: see [443] --- [445].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1418">I reject Mr Allam's denial that the EPROMs that were seized from the Bankstown Premises were obtained from Behong: see [446].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1419">I accept Mr Polaczek's evidence that the blank EPROMs seized at Georges Hall were capable of being used to store Aristocrat software: see [465].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1420">I also accept the submission of the Aristocrat companies that the blank EPROMs were suggestive of copying: see [466].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1421">I reject the submission of the Tonita respondents that the materials were obtained from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1422">The position here is quite different from that which existed in CBS Songs Ltd v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] UKHL 15 ; [1988] AC 1013.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1423">There, the House of Lords held that the sale of a high speed twin-tape recorder capable of reproducing music cassettes onto blank tapes was not an authorisation of copyright infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1424">The reason for the House of Lords' decision appears to be the absence of control over the actions of the purchasers and the possibility of legitimate use rather than the inevitability of infringement: see 1053-1055; see also CBS Inc v Ames Records &amp; Tapes Ltd [1982] Ch 91 at 106 (per Whitford J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1425">This is to be contrasted with the facts of the present case as is well illustrated by the email set out at [312].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1426">Mr Allam was requested to provide game software and blank chips.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1427">I reject his denial that he knew the purpose to be the copying of the game software onto the chips in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1428">It is true that Mr Allam had no real ability to control what took place in South America, but there was no possibility that the blank EPROMs were to be used for a legitimate purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1429">It was inevitable that the EPROMs were to be used for the purpose of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1430">Moreover, there was other evidence which was indicative of unauthorised copying by the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1431">This was the existence of the Dataman software on the Loose HDD.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1432">Mr McKemmish's evidence that the Dataman software was operated on the Loose HDD gives rise to a very strong inference that the Tonita respondents used it to burn Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs: see [498].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1433">When this evidence is taken into account, it makes more credible the evidence of Mr Channa that he saw Mr Allam burning EPROMs from an EPROM burning device: see [348].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1434">
 15.2.2 The Tonita respondents manufactured fake Aristocrat compliance plates 
 In my opinion, the evidence establishes that Mr Allam manufactured counterfeit compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1435">This is to be inferred in particular from the seizure of blank compliance plates at Botany, Georges Hall and Bankstown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1436">Even if I were to disregard Mr Channa's evidence as to the compliance plates seized at Botany, there is no escape from the inferences which arise from the seizures at Bankstown and Georges Hall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1437">The clearest example of the presence of counterfeit Aristocrat compliance plates at the premises of the Tonita respondents is the 67 compliance plates that were seized at Bankstown and the twelve compliance plates that were seized at Georges Hall: see [441], [470] and [473].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1438">I accept Mr Parson's evidence that those compliance plates were not genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1439">As I said earlier, I reject Mr Allam's evidence that Mr Channa planted the compliance plates and that the only compliance plates that Mr Allam engraved were for the Uruguay transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1440">The inescapable inference from this and from Mr Allam's belated revelation that he had a hand engraver is that he engraved, or authorised the engraving of, at very least the six counterfeit compliance plates seized at Georges Hall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1441">But in my view, the inferences to be drawn are not limited to the compliance plates seized at the Georges Hall Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1442">Once it is accepted that Mr Allam (or the Tonita respondents) had the necessary engraving equipment, it is my view that a strong inference arises that the counterfeit compliance plates seized at Bankstown and, indeed, at Botany, were produced with the authority of the Tonita respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1443">This is supported by the evidence contained in the emails and the inferences to be drawn from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1444">The clearest example is the email from Mr Andrews to Mr Mendelson and Mr Cragen set out at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1445">In that email Mr Andrews said he could organise the "manufacturers plates" for Mr Mendelson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1446">It is plain that this was an offer to manufacture counterfeit compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1447">In my view, the inference from this statement is that Mr Andrews was offering to have Mr Allam manufacture the plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1448">Mr Andrews was not a technician.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1449">Mr Allam was, as Mr Andrews described him elsewhere, his "technical guy".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1450">Also, there was other evidence from which it is to be inferred that Mr Andrews was to make up a set of compliance plates, albeit for machines manufactured by a different gaming machine manufacturer: see [289].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1451">The emails at [279] and [289] were initially admitted only against the Global/Impact respondents but I subsequently admitted them provisionally against all the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1452">In my view, the emails were probative evidence against the Tonita respondents when considered in the light of the counterfeit compliance plates seized from the Bankstown, Georges Hall and Botany Premises and from the revelation that Mr Allam had a hand engraver.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1453">Also, there was evidence adduced by the Aristocrat companies that the seized compliance plates did not match the style of hand engraving sometimes used by Aristocrat on its gaming machines: see [455].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1454">All of this evidence makes more credible the testimony of Mr Channa that he saw Mr Allam or his employees, printing the blank compliance plates at the Botany Premises: see [353].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1455">
 15.2.3 Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware that Mr Allam was burning Aristocrat game software 
 It is clear, in my view, from the email correspondence that Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware of the fact that Mr Allam was burning Aristocrat game software onto blank EPROMs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1456">I reject their explanations of the emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1457">The relevant emails are those set out at [275], [284], [286], [295], [296], [312] and [316].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1458">
 15.2.4 Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware that Mr Allam was manufacturing counterfeit compliance plates 
 In my opinion, Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware that Mr Allam was manufacturing counterfeit compliance plates for export to foreign markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1459">That is precisely what Mr Andrews told Mr Mendelson that he could organise in the email set out at [279].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1460">The email was copied to Mr Cragen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1461">Whilst I am prepared to accept Mr Cragen's denial that Mr Mendelson asked him to make up fake Aristocrat compliance plates, I reject his explanation of the email: see [281].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1462">In my opinion, the email was sufficiently clear on its face to reveal what Mr Andrews had in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1463">Mr Cragen's suggestion that the email referred to the use of leftover compliance plates from sample or stripped machines is not consistent with Mr Andrews' statements, in particular "can they be random that we think up".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1464">
 15.2.5 Sending artwork to be copied 
 Even before the advent of the Global/Impact Joint Venture, Mr Andrews engaged in discussion about the supply of digital artwork panels: see the email at [270].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1465">I reject his denial that the "second choice" referred to in that email was a reference to the copying of Aristocrat artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1466">It is not clear whether the undated email at [272] pre-dated the Global/Impact Joint Venture, but Mr Andrews made the unequivocal statement that he could send a set of artwork to South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1467">He went on to say that Mr Nevada could then "just copy the game chips" and make some new artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1468">In my view, it is plain from this, and from his answers in cross-examination that he knew that the artwork would be copied in South America: see [273].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1469">Other emails sent after the establishment of the Global/Impact Joint Venture show that both Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen were aware that Aristocrat artwork was sent by them to South America for the purpose of copying.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1470">This can be seen in the email set out at [306] from Mr Andrews in which he asked Mr Trajkovski what had happened to the original artwork "we sent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1471">I reject the denials given in evidence by Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen that the implication from the email was that the artwork had been sent to Mr Trajkovski to be copied and returned: see [307].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1472">Other emails which reveal the knowledge of Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen are set out at [310] and [319].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1473">I reject their denials that they were aware that the artwork was sent to South America to be copied: see [311] and [320].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1474">FINDINGS IN RELATION TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND AUTHORISATION OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT It is clear from the extensive email correspondence which was the subject of Exhibit A1 that the Global/Impact Joint Venture commenced at a date earlier than that for which the Global/Impact respondents contended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1475">The email chain dated 12 and 15 November 2004 referred to in [279] shows that the Joint Venture was in operation at the time of those emails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1476">I would infer from the email at [279] that the Global/Impact Joint Venture had commenced some time prior to the discussion evidenced in the email to Mr Mendelson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1477">Whilst the commencement date cannot be identified with precision, I will infer that it commenced at least six weeks before the date of those emails, that is to say on 1 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1478">It follows from the finding that the Joint Venture commenced in October 2004 that the parties to the Joint Venture authorised any copyright infringements committed by the Joint Venture in the carrying out of its activities from that date forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1479">It is plain that the matters to be taken into account under s 36(1A) are satisfied in the present case because Mr Andrews and Mr Cragen each had power to prevent the other from doing the acts concerned and the nature of the Joint Venture was such that it contemplated the very acts which are alleged to have taken place in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1480">In addition, neither Mr Andrews nor Mr Cragen took any reasonable steps to prevent the infringements which I find to have been committed in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1481">It seems to me that this is a case where there was a studied and deliberate course of action in which each of the Global and Impact respondents had decided to ignore the rights of the Aristocrat companies with knowledge that there was likely to be an infringement of copyright: see APRA v Jain at 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1482">Moreover, the email correspondence to which I have referred at some length makes it plain that the Global and Impact respondents sanctioned, approved or countenanced the infringements of copyright carried out by the Tonita respondents: see [284]ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1483">Indeed, whilst there was no joint venture between the Tonita respondents and the other respondents to the proceedings, there was, in my view, something in the nature of concerted action or agreed common action; it was not necessary for the Aristocrat companies to prove an express plan mapped out by the primary offenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1484">The evidence more than sufficiently establishes "tacit agreement" between the parties: see Universal Music v Cooper at [135].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1485">THE CONVERSION CLAIM 
 17.1 Background 
 The conversion claim turns solely upon the terms of the contract between the Aristocrat companies and Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1486">Before dealing with the relevant provisions, it is necessary to say something about the background which was described in the evidence of Mr R. C. Harrison, the Australian Integration Centre Manager for Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1487">Mr Harrison's evidence indicated that, as part of the Aristocrat companies' normal business procedures, the Aristocrat companies identify gaming machines and component parts which are unusable or obsolete inventory and which require disposal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1488">The reasons why the Aristocrat companies identify machines or component parts as requiring disposal include: Mr Harrison also indicated that the Aristocrat companies have in place certain procedures which are intended to ensure that their inventory of machines or component parts that are to be scrapped are not reintroduced into the gaming machine market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1489">Some of the Aristocrat internal scrapping procedure instructions were in evidence, but it is not clear whether they were in force at the time when the contract with Behong was current.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1490">For example, a "work instruction" at Exhibit RCH1, page 1, which had the "effective date" of "TBA", contained no instructions for scrapping.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1491">Also, the Scrapping Procedure document at page 1 of confidential Exhibit RCH2 was dated December 2006, but the contract with Behong terminated on 30 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1492">The effect of Mr Harrison's evidence, which I accept, is that the Aristocrat companies had in place from at least 2002 procedures which included placing machines and parts intended for scrapping in a secure area at the Rosebery plant, where they were monitored by security systems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1493">The machines and parts were then collected by the Aristocrat companies' contracted scrap collector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1494">Behong was appointed as the Aristocrat companies' scrap collector under a contract which commenced on 1 July 2005 and ended on 30 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1495">
 17.2 Dealings between Behong and the Tonita respondents 
 The Tonita respondents commenced their purchase of used gaming machines or parts from Behong in around February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1496">The first purchases were made on Mr Allam's behalf by Mr Fisher: see [167]ff above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1497">The purchase comprised between 300 and 350 gaming machine monitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1498">Mr Fisher made a number of other purchases on Mr Allam's behalf between February 2006 and April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1499">Mr Allam first met the principal of Behong, Mr Jacky Hong, in around May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1500">In the period from May 2006 to November 2006, Mr Allam purchased a large quantity of machines and components from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1501">The purchases included conversion kits and artwork panels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1502">He was accompanied on some of his visits by Mr Channa, who drove the truck in which the materials were transported from Behong's scrap yard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1503">Mr Allam agreed that in his experience in the gaming machine industry he had not previously been able to acquire such a large quantity of Aristocrat spare parts for his business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1504">Mr Fisher was "amazed" to see such a large quantity of materials, particularly whole gaming machines, available for sale in a scrap yard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1505">Between February 2006 and December 2006, Mr Fisher saw large quantities of stock acquired from Behong at Impact's Botany Premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1506">I accept the submission of the Aristocrat companies that it is to be inferred from the course of dealing I have described and from Mr Fisher's observations at the Botany Premises, that the items purchased by the Tonita respondents from Behong were embodied in Aristocrat gaming machines that were refurbished by the Tonita respondents for the Global/Impact Joint Venture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1507">Mr Fisher accepted that he knew from his earliest contact with Mr Hong that it was important that the Aristocrat companies not find out "what he was doing".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1508">Mr Fisher claimed to have no recollection of whether he told Mr Allam of this fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1509">However, I think it is more probable than not that he would have communicated such an important piece of information to his principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1510">
 17.3 The Behong Agreement 
 The Behong Agreement was signed by the parties in August 2005 but it took effect on 1 July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1511">Recital B of the Agreement stated that Behong had agreed to provide scrap metal containment, removal, disposal and purchasing services in respect of "the Property" to Aristocrat on the terms set out in the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1512">The "Property" was described as property located at the Aristocrat companies' business premises at Dunning Avenue, Rosebery, NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1513">Part 1 of the Agreement was headed "Services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1514">Clause 1.1 set out the services which Behong agreed to provide as follows: 
 
 The Contractor must provide the Services in respect of the Property set out in Schedule 1 (Services) ("the Services") to Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1515">
 
 Parts 2 and 3 of the Agreement set out the standard of care and services to be provided by Behong and the obligations imposed on Behong in the performance of the Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1516">Clause 3.5 provides: 
 
 Cleaning and Removal of Waste 
 

 
 
 3.5.1 The Contractor must keep its workplace neat and tidy including removing its rubbish and waste from the Property as required by Aristocrat.</sentence>

 3.5.2 The Contractor must: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) comply with all relevant legislation when disposing of rubbish and waste and must on request from Aristocrat provide a certificate evidencing such compliance; and
 (b) only use such rubbish and waste for scrap reclamation and must not be sold for reuse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1518">
 
 
 The Services were defined by Schedule 1 which was as follows: 
 
 The Contractor must provide metal containment, removal, disposal and purchasing services of scrap metal at property located at 85-113 Dunning Avenue, Rosebery, New South Wales, Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1519">
 
 The scope of the Services in respect of the "Second Hand Machines Approved for Authorised Disposal" was further spelled out in a "Note" to the Agreement as follows: 
 
 The Scrap Process / Viewing of destruction / and Destruction Certificates, will be put in place in order to meet all of Aristocrats [sic] requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1520">
 
 The prices payable by Behong to the Aristocrat companies for the materials are confidential.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1521">It is sufficient to say that a specified price per tonne was payable by Behong to the Aristocrat companies for "Second Hand &amp; Obsolete Machines".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1522">The practice which was adopted by the parties, apparently in pursuance of the Agreement, was for Behong to deliver to the Aristocrat companies certificates of destruction of the materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1523">A large number of the certificates were in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1524">They contained a declaration by Behong that: 
 
 ... all the material collected from Aristocrat's warehouse on [date], has been damaged and or destroyed, and no part thereof has been retained for re-sale or re-use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1525">
 

 17.4 Conversion 
 The claim in conversion, as ultimately argued by Senior Counsel for the Aristocrat companies, rested solely upon the terms of Recital B, cl 1.1 and the scope of the Services set out in the Schedule, when read with the Note set out above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1526">Mr Cobden also sought to derive some support from the terms of the certificate of destruction, which he submitted were further terms of the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1527">Reliance upon cl 3.5.2, which formed the original basis upon which the argument was presented, was abandoned in closing submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1528">The effect of Mr Cobden's closing argument was that Behong held possession of the materials collected from the Aristocrat companies, which remained the property of the Aristocrat companies until the materials were destroyed by scrapping them in accordance with the Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1529">He also submitted, though perhaps faintly, that Behong was a bailee of the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1530">It was not, in his submission, a purchaser of the goods, but a service provider under a contract for the provision of services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1531">It is a fundamental principle of the law of torts that to maintain an action for conversion, the plaintiff must have either actual possession of the goods or the immediate right to possession at the time of the conversion: Penfolds Wines Proprietary Limited v Elliott [1946] HCA 46 ; (1946) 74 CLR 204 at 226-227; Associated Midland Corporation Ltd v Bank of New South Wales [1983] 1 NSWLR 533 at 549; F.A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1532">Trindade, P. Cane &amp; M. Lunney, The Law of Torts in Australia (4 th ed, 2007) at 209-210.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1533">The essence of the tort of conversion is the commission of an intentional act by the defendant which constitutes a dealing with goods, without lawful justification, in a manner repugnant to the plaintiff's possession or immediate right to possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1534">In my view, it is plain that under the terms of the Behong Agreement, the Aristocrat companies had no right to possession of the goods and, accordingly, the failure on the part of Behong to destroy the goods did not amount to a wrong to the Aristocrat companies' possessory rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1535">Whether or not the Agreement was a contract for the sale of goods or a contract for the provision of services, the effect of it was that upon the collection of the materials from the Aristocrat companies' premises, the Aristocrat companies parted with possession as well as any right to recall possession from Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1536">Behong was a purchaser of the materials who was contractually bound to dispose of the materials or to scrap them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1537">Failure to scrap the materials, or to pay the stipulated purchase price, amounted to a breach of contract, but there was nothing in the terms of the Agreement which permitted the Aristocrat companies to reclaim possession in the event of breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1538">Indeed, the entire commercial purpose of the Agreement was for Behong to take possession of the materials and destroy them, an act which would otherwise have been inconsistent with the Aristocrat companies' property in the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1539">The Agreement therefore lawfully authorised and required Behong to do what would have otherwise amounted to a conversion of the Aristocrat companies' property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1540">The delivery by Behong of false certificates of destruction amounted, at very least, to a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1541">It may also have given rise to serious claims by the Aristocrat companies against Behong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1542">But it was not a denial of any right of possession on the part of the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1543">I do not consider that anything turns upon whether the Agreement amounted to a contract for services or a contract for the sale of goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1544">The short answer to the Aristocrat companies' claim in conversion is, as I have said, that the failure to destroy the materials did not constitute a wrong to the Aristocrat companies' right of possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1545">In any event, it seems to me that the Agreement was a contract for services which included an agreement for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1546">This is because cl 1.1 and Schedule 1 required Behong to provide services which included scrapping and "purchasing services".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1547">When those terms are read with Schedule 2 and the "Note", Behong was bound to purchase the materials from time to time specified by the Aristocrat companies at the price stated in the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1548">The claim for conversion does not rest upon the rules relating to the passing of property under the Sale of Goods Act 1923 (NSW), but it may be noted that the property passed to Behong when the goods were appropriated to the contract, that is, upon collection from the Aristocrat companies' premises, or alternatively, when they were weighed and measured: see Sale of Goods Act s 23 , rules 3 and 5 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1549">The suggestion that Behong was a bailee cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1550">It is true, as the discussion by the learned author of Palmer, Bailment (2 nd ed, 1991) reveals, that the concept of bailment is difficult to define: see Palmer at 3 ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1551">Moreover, as Turner J observed in Motor Mart Limited v Webb [1958] NZLR 773 at 784-785, it would be a mistake to conclude that the transaction of bailment is not capable of adaptation to modern commercial circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1552">Indeed, his Honour said: 
 
 I decline to assume that, under the pressures and stresses of modern legal necessity, some new mutation may not burst into flower, of a quality to startle the author of the Institutes were he privileged to behold it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1553">
 
 Nevertheless, the Behong Agreement cannot be such a mutation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1554">This is evident from the nature of the obligations entailed by the relationship of bailment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1555">One of the obligations of a bailee is to redeliver the goods to the bailor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1556">The nature of the duty varies according to the circumstances in which and the purpose for which the goods are delivered to the bailee: Morris v C. W. Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 QB 716 at 731.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1557">The authorities go so far as to establish that a bailment does not necessarily impose upon a bailee the obligation of redelivering the identical object that was bailed: Motor Mart v Webb at 781; Harding v Commissioner of Inland Revenue [1977] 1 NZLR 337 at 340.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1558">But here, not only was there no obligation to return the goods, whether in their original or scrapped form, Behong's obligation was to scrap or destroy the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1559">The certificates of destruction, though not terms of the Behong Agreement, indicate that what was contemplated was that Behong would certify that it had scrapped the materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1560">The scrap was not to be redelivered to the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1561">In Morris v C. W. Martin , Diplock LJ at 732, and Salmon LJ at 738 observed that one of the common law duties imposed upon a bailee is not to intentionally convert the goods to his or her own use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1562">Yet this is precisely what the Behong Agreement required Behong to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1563">It may be true that Behong was contractually bound not to resell the materials in their unscrapped form, but that does not undermine the proposition that the fundamental commercial purpose of the Behong Agreement, as exemplified in the terms to which I have referred, was for Behong to collect and scrap or destroy the materials.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1564">Nothing could be further from the concept of bailment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1565">The evidence of the dealings between Behong and Messrs Fisher and Allam indicate knowledge on the part of the Tonita respondents that their purchases of the unscrapped materials may have amounted to a breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1566">However, that is irrelevant to the claim for conversion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1567">No claim of inducement of breach of contract was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1568">THE 54 TRANSACTIONS 
 18.1 Introduction 
 The Aristocrat companies sought to establish their claim for damages under the Copyright Act by reference to 54 transactions in which some or all of the respondents were said to have exported counterfeit gaming machines to South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1569">The 54 transactions involved dealings with 618 gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1570">With the exception of two transactions (transactions 12 and 38), no gaming machines involved in the transactions were inspected by the Aristocrat companies for counterfeit parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1571">The result of this was that the Aristocrat companies did not identify which components of the gaming machines in the impugned transactions were alleged to infringe copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1572">Instead, the case was built upon discrepancies in the serial numbers affixed to the gaming machines sold by the respondents, as identified in their business records and invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1573">A large number of the transactions relied upon the data matching exercise set out in section 11 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1574">The respondents, and in particular the Global/Impact respondents, sought to meet the case against them on a number of levels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1575">First, they made general submissions in answer to the impugned transactions, including their attack on the OLGR data and the data matching exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1576">Second, the respondents made specific submissions about particular transactions, including submissions in regard to the documents relied upon by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1577">Mr Cobden helpfully attempted to reduce the burden of dealing with each of the 54 impugned transactions by producing a table grouping the transactions in separate categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1578">The result of this exercise was to produce five categories of transactions which were relied upon by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1579">The table is as follows: 
 
 Code 
 
 
 
 [Transaction number] 
 
 
 
 DN 
 
 
 
 13, 20, 28, 29, 32, 36, 41, 42, 46, 51 
 
 
 
 GC 
 
 
 
 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 42, 49, 50, 54 
 
 
 
 II 
 
 
 
 12, 38 
 
 
 
 MC 
 
 
 
 3 , 4, 7, 16, 17, 18, 34, 35, 36, 42, 45, 47, 48, 52 
 
 
 
 NG 
 
 
 
 17, 22, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 52, 53 
 
 
 
 
 DN: Duplicate Numbers
 GC: Game Changes
 II: Infringing Indicia
 MC: Machines at Clubs
 NG: Non-Genuine Numbers 
 
 I will explain briefly the basis upon which these categories have been selected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1580">I will also deal with them en globo before returning to particular transactions numbers within some of the impugned categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1581">Ultimately, only a very small number of the categories of transactions relied upon by Mr Cobden have been proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1582">Principally, this is because a large number of the claims depend upon acceptance of the data matching exercise which I referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1583">My rejection of the evidentiary basis for the data matching exercise results in the rejection of all of the transactions falling into the "GC" and "NG" categories, as well as a number of other transactions falling into the "MC" category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1584">It is necessary to explain briefly the abbreviations used in Mr Cobden's schedule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1585">"DN" or "Duplicate Numbers" describes those transactions where the Global/Impact respondents issued invoices for machines, the serial numbers of which were a duplicate of serial numbers on machines which had already been shipped by them in earlier transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1586">"GC" or "Game Changes" refers to transactions where the games in the machines the subject of the transaction were not consistent with the OLGR's record of the game on the machine with that serial number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1587">This information was arrived at by comparing the OLGR data (which was said to record the current game on every machine in NSW) with the games recorded on the Global/Impact respondents' invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1588">The Aristocrat companies alleged that in these transactions, the games were changed by Global or Impact to a game that was found on the respondents' computers or on other infringing material (such as counterfeit EPROMs) found at their premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1589">"II" or "Infringing Indicia" refers to transactions where inspections of the machines in South America by Mr Coster or Mr Irarrazaval resulted in them identifying certain infringing components of the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1590">"MC" or "Machines at Clubs" referred to machines which were currently in clubs in NSW but which had been listed as being shipped overseas in the Global/Impact respondents' invoices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1591">The Aristocrat companies identified the gaming machines in this category by two methods: first, by reference to the OLGR data which was said to record the current location of each machine; and second, by a visual inspection by Ms Lynne Oldfield, a Games IP Administrator employed by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1592">"NG" or "Non-Genuine Numbers" referred to transactions which were coded red in Ms Gardner's matching exercise: see [563]ff above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1593">That is to say, this category refers to those transactions where the evidence is said to show that the serial numbers were not genuine serial numbers created by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1594">I have come to the view that the Aristocrat companies have proved infringements in relation to a small number of transactions in the DN category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1595">I will explain this in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1596">As I have already said, Aristocrat fails in relation to all of the transactions in relation to the GC and NG categories, because they rely entirely upon the flawed data matching exercise set out in section 11 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1597">There are only two transactions listed in the II category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1598">I have come to the view that the Aristocrat companies have failed to establish infringement of those transactions for reasons which I will set out in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1599">Many of the transactions in the MC category rely solely upon the data matching exercise and it follows that the Aristocrat companies cannot succeed on those transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1600">However there are machines within four of the transactions in the MC category, namely transactions 34, 36, 48 and 54, where there was corroborative evidence from Ms Oldfield which is, in my view, sufficient to establish infringement in relation to those transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1601">I will deal with that in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1602">
 18.2 Machines at Clubs (MC) 
 The clearest instance of proven infringements is to be found in the MC category and I will therefore deal with it first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1603">The relevant transactions which do not rely solely upon OLGR data are transactions 34, 36, 48 and 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1604">Transaction 34 is the first of the impugned transactions alleged to have taken place after the date on which I have found the Global/Impact Joint Venture to have commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1605">It is also the first transaction alleged against all three groups of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1606">The transaction is documented in an invoice on the letterhead of Global dated 5 October 2004, invoice number 1045.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1607">The invoice was for a total of 84 Aristocrat gaming machines to Mr Luis Miguel Naveda Cruzado of Lima, Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1608">The Aristocrat companies claimed that nine of the machines listed on the invoice contained infringing components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1609">Those machines bore the following serial numbers: 
 
 "XAW600752", "XAW602324", "XAW603563", "XAW603570", "XAW603572", "XAW603575", "XAW603980", "XAW605055", and "XAW605058".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1610">
 
 OLGR data relied upon by the Aristocrat companies indicated that on 1 December 2004, machines bearing those serial numbers were located in hotels and clubs throughout NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1611">On 23 October 2007, Ms Oldfield attended several clubs and hotels in NSW for the purpose of confirming the evidence sourced from the OLGR data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1612">Of the machines indicated above, Ms Oldfield confirmed that five of the machines were operating in hotels and clubs in NSW by carrying out a visual inspection of the serial numbers of the gaming machines in the hotels and clubs that she attended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1613">These were the machines bearing the serial number "XAW603570", "XAW603572", and "XAW603575", which were operating at the Guildford Bowling and Recreation Club, NSW; the machine bearing the serial number "XAW603980", operating at the Miranda Hotel; and the machine with the serial number "XAW605058", operating at the Rockdale RSL Club.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1614">In my opinion, this evidence establishes that the five machines identified by Ms Oldfield were operating in NSW after the date on which machines bearing those serial numbers were purportedly sold to Snr Cruzado in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1615">I infer from this that those five gaming machines contained infringing components of Aristocrat gaming machines, and in particular, false Aristocrat compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1616">However, aside from the compliance plates (and the inference which I draw as to Aristocrat software: see [897], it is not possible to identify which particular components of the machines were in fact counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1617">This has consequences for the claim in damages, which I will refer to in more detail below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1618">It is unnecessary to set out all of the detail of transactions 36, 48 and 54, the other transactions within which machines were said to have serial numbers matching those on machines identified by Ms Oldfield in NSW (although transaction 54 was not listed in this category in Mr Cobden's table above).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1619">Transaction number 36 was the subject of an invoice issued by Global dated 4 January 2005 to Cathay Entretenimientos SAC of Lima, Peru, invoice number 1153.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1620">Transaction number 48 was covered by an invoice issued by Impact on 12 July 2005 to Princess Entertainment of Belize, invoice number 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1621">Transaction 54 was recorded on a Global invoice dated 20 February 2005 to Reel Games of Florida, USA, invoice number 1201.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1622">It is sufficient to say that Ms Oldfield identified two machines within transaction 36, five machines within transaction 48 and four machines within transaction 54 operating at clubs in NSW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1623">I draw the same inference in relation to those machines in transactions 36, 48 and 54 as I did for the machines inspected by Ms Oldfield within transaction 34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1624">Once again, it is not possible to identify which particular infringing components were located within the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1625">
 18.3 Duplicate Numbers (DN) 
 As I have said above, I am of the view that the Aristocrat companies have proved infringements in relation to a small number of transactions in the DN category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1626">In this category, it will be necessary to examine each of the transactions in turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1627">Turning first to transactions 36 and 42, these transactions appear to have been miscategorised by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1628">The machines in those transactions fall either within the category MC (Machines in Clubs), NG (Non-Genuine Numbers) or GC (Game Changes).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1629">All of those categories rely upon the integrity of the data matching exercise, and as I have already said, the Aristocrat companies cannot succeed in relation to those categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1630">I therefore reject findings of counterfeiting in relation to transactions 36 and 42 (other than the machines in transaction 36 identified by Ms Oldfield).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1631">The next transaction that falls within the DN category that I will consider is transaction number 32.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1632">Transaction number 32 is alleged against the Global and Impact respondents, however as it is dated 6 May 2004, it is before the date on which I have found that the Joint Venture commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1633">I will therefore only admit this transaction against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1634">In this transaction, the Global respondents deny the allegation of counterfeiting as they say that the gaming machines never came into their possession.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1635">This is the same defence that was used in relation to the Play King transaction: see above at section 6.4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1636">Transaction number 32 is recorded on Global invoice number 893 and is addressed to "El Muro SA" of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1637">It contains the following serial numbers which are also recorded on Global's invoice number 936: 
 
 "0051994", "0051954", "0051980", "0052093", "0052146", "0052175", "0052310", "0052528", "0052561", "0052584", "0052686", "0052690", and "0052743".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1638">
 
 The Global respondents refer to several documents to make good their claim that their practice was to ship games from independent suppliers directly to the customer, without ever taking possession of the machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1639">In particular, they refer to a document known as the "Bondtren Purchase Order".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1640">The Bondtren Purchase Order is a document dated 15 May 2004 for the purchase of 130 Aristocrat Mark V gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1641">The supplier is recorded as "Bytecraft Systems Pty Ltd".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1642">Relevantly, in the "Ship To" box, "Bondtren" is listed as the receiver and Mr Cragen's Killarney Heights address is recorded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1643">As with the Play King transaction, I cannot accept that the machines the subject of transaction number 32 ever entered into the possession of the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1644">The Bondtren Purchase Order supports Mr Andrews' evidence that the relevant machines were shipped directly to Global's supplier, and there is no evidence that the machines were ever forwarded to the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1645">In this case, the supplier happens to be Mr Cragen and his company Bondtren, however as the transaction took place before the Joint Venture commenced, this does not alter my conclusion in relation to this transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1646">The Global respondents also say that invoice number 936, on which the serial numbers are duplicated, was not a final invoice and should be discounted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1647">They point to a second invoice numbered 936 on which the relevant serial numbers are not recorded, which they say was the final invoice for this transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1648">This explanation is also given in relation to all but one of the remaining transactions in the DN category, transactions 13, 20, 28, 29, 41 and 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1649">I do not propose to set out those transactions in great detail, however I will say the following.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1650">Transactions 13, 20, 28, 29, 41 and 46 are all set out on Global invoices that are titled "Proforma invoice", "Commercial Invoice" or "Commercial Invoice &amp; Packing List".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1651">All of the invoices are addressed to different customers in different countries, including Peru, Cyprus and Mexico.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1652">In answer to the claim that those invoices included serial numbers which duplicated the serial numbers on machines that had already been shipped, the Global respondents say that the Aristocrat companies relied upon invoices that had been superseded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1653">They say that the invoices listed above were interim invoices relating to transactions which did not proceed, and which do not represent the machines that were ultimately shipped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1654">Exhibited to Mr Andrews' affidavit was a lengthy document of over 500 pages which sought to provide an explanation in relation to each invoice which came under criticism by the Aristocrat companies, including by providing references to the final invoices which superseded the "interim" invoices listed above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1655">For several reasons that I will set out, I do not accept Mr Andrews' explanation of the presence of duplicate serial numbers on the invoices referred to in [860].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1656">First, in relation to several of the transactions, the date on the invoice which Mr Andrews described as the "final" invoice was earlier than the date on the "interim" invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1657">For example, in transaction number 13, the invoice the subject of the transaction, Global proforma invoice number 363 addressed to Altagracia S R L, was dated 17 July 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1658">This was said by Mr Andrews to be an interim invoice which was replaced by a proforma invoice addressed to Play King.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1659">However, not only was the number of the final invoice earlier in sequence than the interim invoice (the interim invoice being proforma invoice number 360), the final invoice was also dated 14 July 2002, three days earlier than the interim invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1660">Discrepancies in the date also occurred in transaction 41, where the final invoice was dated 4 November 2003 and the interim invoice was dated one and a half years later, 7 April 2005; and transaction 46, where the interim invoice was dated 14 June 2005 and the final invoice was dated 6 June 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1661">Second, in transaction 46, recorded on invoice number 5, the document said to be the "final" invoice was not only earlier in date than the final invoice, but also did not resemble an invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1662">Whilst all of the other final invoices were recorded on documents titled "Proforma Invoice" or "Commercial Invoice", the document said to be the "final" invoice in this transaction was titled "Packing List --- Original".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1663">Unlike an invoice, it did not contain details of price or tax payable, but instead contained an "equipment description" under the heading "Shipment from Sydney to Callao Peru".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1664">I therefore do not accept that this document was in fact a final invoice which superseded invoice number 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1665">Third, the customers on the invoices said to be "final" bore no resemblance to the customers recorded on the "interim" invoice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1666">The invoices in transactions 20, 28 and 41 were addressed to Alexis Opthalmic of Cyprus, Faberio S de R.L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1667">de C.V. of Mexico and Privada Labastida of Mexico.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1668">In each case, the Global respondents say that these transactions did not proceed, and the relevant final invoice is invoice 770, addressed to Servicios Internacionales of Mexico.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1669">It is possible that these transactions were superseded by a later transaction, recorded on invoice number 770, which ultimately shipped the gaming machines that were intended to be shipped in transactions 20, 28 and 41.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1670">However, my findings as to Mr Andrews' credit affect the weight that I give to his explanations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1671">In particular, in the absence of any corroborating evidence, such as emails or other records indicating that the "interim" transactions were in fact cancelled, I find it difficult to accept his explanation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1672">The more probable explanation, in line with the business communications of the respondents recorded above and in particular the email set out at [279], is that Mr Andrews selected serial numbers to go on compliance plates that he knew would pass an inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1673">It is for this reason that various serial numbers were duplicated on one or more invoice issued by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1674">I therefore accept the Aristocrat companies' submission that these transactions (transactions 13, 20, 28, 29, 41 and 46) contained infringing components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1675">However, as with the MC or Machines in Clubs category, it is not possible to conclude on the evidence which components were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1676">The final transaction included in the DN category was transaction number 51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1677">This transaction, recorded on invoice 050830, duplicated serial numbers recorded on invoice 050505.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1678">In response to this transaction, the respondents submit that some of the gaming machines on this invoice may have been substituted at the last minute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1679">As with Mr Andrews' explanation regarding duplication above, I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1680">In the light of the business communications recorded in the emails extracted in these reasons and my findings above, in my view, the more plausible explanation for this duplication of serial numbers is that Mr Andrews created or obtained fake compliance plates which included false or invented numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1681">
 18.4 Infringing Indicia (II) 
 There are two transactions listed in the "Infringing Indicia" or "II" category in Mr Cobden's table, transactions 12 and 38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1682">Transaction number 12 is the Play King transaction, which I have dealt with in section 6 above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1683">For the reasons stated above, I do not accept the Aristocrat companies' submissions in regard to the Play King transaction as it has not been established that the machines ever entered into the possession of the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1684">Transaction number 38 is recorded on Global invoice number 1156 and dated 4 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1685">It is addressed to Cathay Entretenimientos S.A.C.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1686">of Lima, Peru and is for the sale of 81 "Video Gaming Machines".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1687">Two machines listed on the invoice have serial numbers "DY0352V" and "AV17325V".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1688">The Aristocrat companies relied upon several documents entitled "Certificado de Fabricacion", which were issued in South America following upon a raid at Cathay Entretenimientos conducted by Mr Coster.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1689">The raid was carried out in April 2006 and the certificates were issued in August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1690">The effect of the certificates were that the relevant Aristocrat company notified the Peruvian government of the sale of a new genuine Aristocrat game or a game kit to a customer in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1691">The substance of Mr Coster's evidence was that the certificates were issued because the raid identified a large number of counterfeit gaming machines in operation at various locations in Peru.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1692">As a result of the identification of counterfeit machines, the purchasers agreed to purchase genuine Aristocrat games or gaming kits from the local Aristocrat distributor to replace the counterfeit components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1693">Two of these games identified as counterfeit by Mr Coster were Dolphin Treasure, which were found on the machines bearing the serial numbers referred to in [874] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1694">Whilst at first sight this may suggest that the games had emanated from the Global/Impact respondents who supplied those machines, it seems to me that I cannot make that finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1695">This is because, as Mr Coster conceded in cross-examination, most of the machines identified by him had Spanish artwork and games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1696">He also conceded that there was a big problem in Peru where casino operators changed genuine games and artwork installed in gaming machines in Peru to Spanish artwork and games.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1697">It seems to me to follow that I cannot be satisfied that the two identified machines were shipped by the Global/Impact respondents to Peru with the counterfeit games or artwork identified by Mr Coster in the raid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1698">
 18.5 Conclusion in relation to the 54 transactions 
 I am satisfied that 11 of the 54 impugned transactions comprised gaming machines which contained infringing components of the Aristocrat companies' gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1699">Four of these transactions fell into the "MC" category, namely transactions 34, 36, 48 and 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1700">Seven of the transactions fell into the "DN" category, namely transactions 13, 20, 28, 29, 41, 46 and 51.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1701">However, as I have said a number of times, it is not possible to conclude on the evidence precisely which components in the machines were counterfeit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1702">DAMAGES 
 19.1 Damages under s 115(2) 
 The principles applicable to the assessment of damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act were set out by Black CJ and Jacobson J in Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v DAP Services (Kempsey) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 40 ; (2007) 157 FCR 564 at [23] ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1703">It is unnecessary to repeat what was said in that case, save for two relevant observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1704">First, in DAP Services , the Aristocrat companies claimed damages only upon one basis, namely, the value of lost sales calculated by reference to the report of a chartered accountant who attempted to calculate the loss of profits for each lost sale: see DAP Services at [30].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1705">However, the claim for compensatory damages failed in DAP Services because the evidence did not establish that each sale by the respondents was at the expense of a new Aristocrat machine: see DAP Services at [31].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1706">Second, it was suggested in DAP Services at [34]ff that there may have been other bases upon which damages could have been assessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1707">These included the possibility of finding that Aristocrat had lost some proportion of the sales made by the infringing respondents: see Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Stirling [2001] FCA 1852 at [8] per Emmett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1708">However, these alternatives were not open in DAP Services because there was no evidence to support the assessment of damages on those bases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1709">In the present case, the Aristocrat companies contend that the appropriate measure of compensatory damages is the loss of profit that would have been made from the sale of second-hand or refurbished Aristocrat gaming machines by the Aristocrat companies, or the loss of profits on the sale of conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1710">The evidence in support of that assessment was contained in the affidavits of Mr Irarrazaval and Mr Graham Ward, the Group Financial Controller of Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1711">Mr Irarrazaval's evidence dealt in some detail with the market for the sale of Aristocrat new and refurbished gaming machines to countries in South America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1712">Evidence was given as to the volume of second-hand or refurbished gaming machines supplied by the Aristocrat companies to companies in South America during 2002 to 2007, and the prices at which Aristocrat second-hand or refurbished gaming machines were supplied in the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1713">Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence in relation to the market in a number of South American countries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1714">In relation to Peru, Mr Irarrazaval said that notwithstanding the significant size of the gaming machine market, and the large number of Aristocrat gaming machines installed and operating across the various venues in Peru, the relevant member of the Aristocrat group of companies had difficulties selling Aristocrat gaming machines to customers between 2002 and 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1715">Mr Irarrazaval attributed that difficulty to the high number of counterfeit gaming machines being sold in Peru at prices significantly below the prices at which the Aristocrat companies were able to offer genuine refurbished gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1716">Mr Irarrazaval gave evidence as to the prices that were obtained by the respondents for sales in South America covering the period from 2002 to 2004 in respect of gaming machines recorded on "seized invoice spreadsheets".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1717">Whilst it is true that the Aristocrat companies have not established that all of those gaming machines were counterfeit, it is relevant to record that, as Mr Irarrazaval says, the amount obtained for those machines was around $US1000 to $US1500 per machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1718">He observed that this is lower than the price at which the Aristocrat companies sold their refurbished gaming machines into South America at that time, which was put at between $US3500 and $US4500 per unit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1719">Mr Ogborne submitted that Mr Irarrazaval's evidence established that the Aristocrat companies were operating in a different price band of the market to Global and Impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1720">He also submitted that Mr Irarrazaval's evidence was to the effect that the Aristocrat companies could not and did not compete with the cheap end suppliers like Global and Impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1721">Mr Ogborne also sought to attack one part of Mr Irarrazaval's evidence in which he identified a number of Global/Impact customers to which sales may have been made by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1722">Mr Ogborne went on to submit that in these circumstances, the Aristocrat companies have failed to prove that they had lost any infringing sales made by the Global or Impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1723">I reject Mr Ogborne's submissions which, in my view, are contrary to the proper and fair reading of the whole of Mr Irarrazaval's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1724">It is true that the Aristocrat companies had difficulty in competing with "cheap end suppliers", but this was because, as Mr Irarrazaval said, the counterfeiters were selling at much lower prices than the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1725">It seems to me that the overall effect of the evidence was that the Aristocrat companies have made sales of second-hand or refurbished machines in South America, albeit at prices higher than those obtained by the Global/Impact respondents, and they have also sold conversion kits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1726">Indeed, there was evidence in Mr Coster's certificate of the sale of two conversion kits to replace counterfeit components in Aristocrat gaming machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1727">Whilst it is true that those two counterfeit gaming machines are not shown to have been supplied by the respondents, Mr Coster's evidence indicates that there are at least some buyers who will purchase genuine conversion kits at the higher price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1728">In view of Mr Irarrazaval's evidence, I am entitled to infer that the Aristocrat companies would have sold at least a proportion of the machines that are the subject of the 11 infringing transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1729">In the present case I find that the Aristocrat companies would have been able to sell 50 percent of those machines in the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1730">It is then necessary to consider the quantum of the lost profit on each of those sales.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1731">I accept Mr Ward's evidence that the lost profit was approximately $US1545 per machine, or approximately $US1770 per conversion kit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1732">The steps in the reasoning process by which Mr Ward arrived at these figures contain some inconsistencies, but I have come to the view that I should accept his conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1733">The Global/Impact respondents submitted that Mr Ward's evidence was based on intra-company pricing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1734">Whilst there seems to be some force in that submission, I think that on a fair reading of both Mr Irarrazaval and Mr Ward, I am nevertheless entitled to accept the figures that Mr Ward puts forward in support of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1735">However a difficulty arises because, as I said earlier, it is impossible to tell precisely which infringing components were contained in the machines that were the subject of the 11 infringing transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1736">Nevertheless, it seems to me to be more likely than not that the infringing components included counterfeit Aristocrat game software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1737">There would have been little point in having fake serial numbers for gaming machines containing genuine Aristocrat software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1738">Accordingly, I am entitled to proceed upon the basis that 50 percent of the gaming machines sold in the infringing transactions represented lost sales to Aristocrat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1739">There were 16 machines in the four infringing transactions in the "MC" category that were identified by Ms Oldfield, and 56 machines in the seven infringing "DN" transactions, totalling 72 infringing machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1740">However, 16 of these machines were supplied outside of the South American market, namely four to the USA and 12 to Cyprus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1741">There was no evidence as to the markets for second-hand gaming machines in those countries and accordingly, the Aristocrat companies have failed to prove that those sales were made at the expense of the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1742">It follows that the total number of infringing machines sold in South America was 56.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1743">Proceeding upon the basis that the Aristocrat companies would have been able to sell 50 percent of those machines, they are entitled to recover damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act for 28 machines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1744">Applying Mr Ward's analysis, and averaging the figures so as to allow for the different profits attributable to the sale of gaming machines or conversion kits, I will adopt a figure of $US1600 per machine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1745">The Aristocrat companies are therefore entitled to damages under s 115(2) for $US44,800, converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the day before judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1746">On the basis of the exchange rate quoted in The Australian Financial Review on 14 December 2009, namely the average of the buy/sell rate which was 1.09085, the Aristocrat companies are entitled to damages under s 115(2) for $AU48,870.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1747">
 19.2 Allocation of s 115(2) damages 
 As I have said on several occasions, I find that the Global/Impact Joint Venture did not commence until 1 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1748">It follows that any infringing transactions prior to transaction number 34 can be supported only against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1749">Any of the transactions numbered 34 to 54 which were proved to be infringing transactions can be maintained against the Global/Impact respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1750">They can also, in my view, be maintained against Mr Allam because it is plain on the evidence that Mr Allam authorised each of the infringing transactions in the sense that he sanctioned, approved or countenanced them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1751">He was the person who was supplying the technical know-how to the Global/Impact Joint Venture and his involvement in that way must have made it clear to him that he was at the very least approving the sale of infringing components to the South American market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1752">As I have said earlier, Tonita was incorporated on 14 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1753">All of the 54 transactions alleged against the respondents took place before that date; the latest in date (transaction number 54) was dated 20 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1754">On this basis, none of the 54 transactions can be maintained against Tonita.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1755">There were 16 machines that were the subjects of transactions 13, 28 and 29 that have been proved against the Global respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1756">Compensatory damages for transaction number 20 have not been proved because those machines were supplied to Cyprus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1757">It follows that the Global respondents are liable for $US12,800 or $AU13,963 and that Global, Impact, Mr Andrews, Mr Cragen and Mr Allam, jointly and severally, are liable for the balance, $US32,000 or $AU34,907.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1758">
 19.3 Additional damages under s 115(4) 
 Where it is established that a defendant has infringed copyright, the Court may, in assessing damages, award additional damages if it is satisfied that it is proper to do so, having regard to the flagrancy of the infringement, and the other matters referred to in s 115(4)(b) of the Copyright Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s1759">The principles upon which additional damages are awarded were discussed in DAP Services at [40]ff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1760">It is not necessary to set out the principles in any detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1761">It is sufficient to say that the objectives include deterrence, and that an element of penalty is an accepted factor in the remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1762">Also, the assessment of the amount to be rewarded is a somewhat imprecise exercise and the Court is to have regard, amongst other things, to the flagrancy of the infringement and the need to mark the Court's disapproval of the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1763">In the present case, as in DAP Services, the actions of the respondents demonstrate a cynical and flagrant exploitation of the Aristocrat companies' copyright.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1764">Although the number of infringing transactions was ultimately proved to be far less than the number claimed by the Aristocrat companies, it is plain that the respondents were engaged in a commercial exercise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1765">Their actions were plainly flagrant and undertaken for commercial gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1766">The Aristocrat companies claimed that the true nature of the respondents' business was a large scale counterfeiting operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1767">They failed to make this good.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1768">But the statements made in the emails when considered with much of the materials seized on the Anton Piller raids show the willingness of the respondents to engage in counterfeiting when it suits their commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1769">There is no need for any proportionality between the amount of compensatory damages under s 115(2) and the amount of additional damages under s 115(4): DAP Services at [45].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1770">I am also entitled to take into account the conduct of the respondents after the acts constituting the infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1771">Accordingly, I am entitled to include in my calculation of additional damages the attitude of the respondents to this litigation, in which they vehemently denied any involvement in counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1772">For the reasons mentioned above, additional damages cannot be maintained against Tonita as it has not been established that Tonita was involved in any of the 54 impugned transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1773">The amount of additional damages awarded in DAP Services was $200,000 against Vidtech and Mr Parry: see DAP Services at [53] and [116].</sentence>
<sentence id="s1774">Here, the activities were on a scale which seems to me to be larger than that which existed in DAP Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1775">In addition, there are three groups of respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1776">I have come to the view that I ought to award an amount of $450,000 for additional damages under s 115(4) against the Global respondents, the Impact respondents and Mr Allam, jointly and severally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1777">Although Mr Allam was an independent contractor, he was intimately involved in the venture and there is no basis for awarding a lesser sum of additional damages against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1778">
 19.4 Trade marks and other causes of action 
 Damages were also sought for infringement of trade marks, breach of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and passing off.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1779">However, these claims were pressed only to the extent that damages awarded for copyright infringement were inadequate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1780">In view of the orders I propose to make for damages under s 115(2) and (4) of the Copyright Act , I do not need to address the other claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1781">Damages for copyright infringement for dealings in blank EPROMs are sufficiently covered by awarding nominal damages (to the extent necessary) and are otherwise covered by the award of additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1782">MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS The respondents submitted that the Aristocrat companies' internal documentary records were shown to be haphazard and unreliable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1783">There was some force in this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1784">But the conclusion which the respondents sought to draw from that cannot be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1785">The conclusion which the respondents suggested was that I could not be confident that the Aristocrat companies had failed to grant a licence to the respondents to deal in the used gaming machine components in South America or other overseas markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1786">That submission is without substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1787">No suggestion was ever made by any of the respondents' witnesses that such a licence had been granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1788">Nor is there any substance in the submission that the respondents had an implied licence to exploit the copyright in those components.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1789">The position here is quite different from that which occurred in the well established authorities that have considered the question of implied licence to use copyright materials; see Beck v Montana Constructions Pty Ltd (1963) 5 FLR 298 ; Concrete Pty Limited v Parramatta Design &amp; Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1790">Another submission pressed strongly by the respondents was the need for the Aristocrat companies to prove their claims to the requisite standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1791">I am satisfied that the Aristocrat companies have proved their claims in respect of the 11 transactions set out above in accordance with the principles stated in section 12 of my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1792">If it is necessary for me to reach a level of actual persuasion in relation to those claims (see [597]), I have reached that state of satisfaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1793">So too I am satisfied that additional damages ought to be ordered under s 115(4) in a substantial sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1794">The respondents also submitted that in the absence of the production of the counterfeit gaming machines, I could not be satisfied as to the substantiality of the components which were comprised in the copyright infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1795">I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1796">Whilst I cannot be certain as to the actual infringing components, I consider it is more likely than not that they consisted of fake Aristocrat game software and fake compliance plates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1797">That is sufficient to meet any test of substantiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1798">Whilst I have not been able to conduct a visual comparison of the infringing compliance plates with the Aristocrat companies' originals, the evidence is sufficient for me to infer that the test stated by the High Court in S.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1799">Hart &amp; Co Proprietary Limited v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 472, 478 and 479 is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1800">The Tonita respondents had prior access to the copyright works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1801">From the material before me going to infringement of compliance plates, in particular the evidence of Mr Parsons, I infer the elements of resemblance, actual use and causal connection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1802">The onus then passed to the Tonita respondents to rebut the inference of copying but they failed to discharge that onus: Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd [2000] UKHL 58 ; [2001] All ER 700 at 708-9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1803">Moreover, I am entitled to take into account the unauthorised use made by the respondents of the Aristocrat companies' artwork.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1804">Even if there was no infringing artwork in the 11 proved transactions, it is clear that on other occasions, artwork was supplied to South American customers to facilitate counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1805">That is a matter which is relevant to additional damages under s 115(4).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1806">Mr Ogborne made much of the fact that photos were taken by Mr Channa at the Botany warehouse yet they disclosed no evidence of counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1807">That is a matter which goes against the Aristocrat companies' claim that the respondents' real business was one of counterfeiting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1808">But is does not answer the claim in relation to 11 proved transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1809">Nor is it an answer to the claim for additional damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1810">The respondents also stressed the need to confine the Aristocrat companies' claim to the pleaded case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1811">I am satisfied that the proved transactions were within the pleaded claims or sufficiently within the case conducted by the Aristocrat companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1812">I accept that the Aristocrat companies unleashed a "snowstorm" of paper, some of it insufficiently distilled to meet the requirements of modern commercial litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1813">But ultimately the claims were sufficiently clear to enable the respondents to address them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1814">Nor did I consider it was appropriate to exercise my discretion under s 136 to limit the evidence as was sought by the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1815">I was satisfied that evidence which was admitted provisionally was admissible against all the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1816">The case of joint liability was made good for the reasons referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1817">Finally, I reject the Tonita respondents' submission that only nine of the transactions were pressed against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1818">If that were correct, then some of the transactions which I have found to be made out would not be able to be maintained against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1819">However, Mr Cobden made it plain that all transactions from number 34 onwards were pressed against all of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1820">This is sufficient to dispose of the Tonita respondents' submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1821">ORDERS The orders that I will make are as follows: The first and second respondents pay the applicants damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act in the amount of $US12,800, converted to $AU13,963.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1822">The first, second, third, fifth and sixth respondents pay the applicants, jointly and severally, damages under s 115(2) of the Copyright Act in the amount of $US32,000, converted to $AU34,907.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1823">The first, second, third, fifth and sixth respondents pay the applicants, jointly and severally, additional damages under s 115(4) of the Copyright Act in the amount of $AU450,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1824">I will hear the parties as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1825">I certify that the preceding nine hundred and thirty-six (936) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.</sentence>
