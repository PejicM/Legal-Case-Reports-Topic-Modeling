 1 The applicant, Swanline Pty Ltd, applies, pursuant to O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), for a separate determination prior to all other questions arising in this proceeding of certain issues in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 In the substantive proceeding, Swanline claims it is the assignee of all of the rights of a company (Falkirk Nominees Pty Ltd (ACN 008 796 272)) under a policy of insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The company made a claim against the respondents under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The respondents deny any liability to Swanline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The separate questions which Swanline seeks to be resolved in advance of other issues at trial concern:- &#8226; whether an exclusion clause in the policy applies; and &#8226; in the event that the exclusion clause does not apply, whether other conduct of the insured company excuses the respondents from liability under the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">

 The competing contentions 
 
 4 Swanline contends that if either of the proposed separate questions is determined adversely to it, the proceeding will be dismissed without the need for other issues to be raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Alternatively, it submits that if it succeeds on the issues raised by the separate questions, that development will contribute to the settlement of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">5 Swanline submits that the issues which it seeks to be determined separately do not give rise to significant contested factual issues and that none of the evidence relevant to the issues sought to be determined separately will be relevant to any remaining issues in the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 The respondents oppose the application to split the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">They say that a determination of the proposed questions may leave other significant issues unresolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They also refer to Swanline's proposal to amend its statement of claim, thereby raising further substantial issues which will require resolution later.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondents also dispute that the prospects of settlement would be enhanced by Swanline succeeding on the separate questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They say that substantive defences would remain available to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They contend that there is no obvious cost or time saving in splitting the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">7 Importantly, the respondents submit that Swanline has not identified the facts which are relevant to the determination of the separate questions, or whether they are capable of being assumed, agreed, or proved at the preliminary stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">
 Consideration 
 
 8 In Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97, Black CJ and Moore J said at [15]: 
 
 'The formulation of separate or preliminary questions is authorised by O 29, r 2 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">But it is a procedure that should be adopted with caution and can be fraught with difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">' 


 
 9 In Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union and Another v G &amp; K O'Connor [2000] FCA 1760 ; (2000) 104 FCR 80 (' O'Connor '), the Full Court of this Court said at [70]: 
 
 'It is sometimes useful to determine, by way of a preliminary question, an issue between parties that, if resolved in a particular way, may terminate the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">However, if this is to be done, it is essential the question be firmly grounded on specified facts; whether found by the court, agreed between the parties or alleged in a pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Without that, the answer to the question may not only be academic but can have the effect of confusing or misleading the parties, rather than enlightening them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">' 


 
 10 The Full Court in O'Connor then noted that in the case before it no facts were specified and it was inappropriate to determine the separate question determined at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">11 Further, in Rainsford v Victoria and Another [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279 (' Rainsford '), the Full Court of this Court said at [35]: 
 
 'Whilst the use of the separate questions procedure can, in some circumstances, avoid delay and lessen the expense in resolving a proceeding, the cases show that there can also be significant difficulties in adopting the procedure, "especially where no findings of fact have been made and the questions are capable of different interpretations": see Anderson v Wilson [2000] FCA 394 ; (2000) 97 FCR 453 at [28] per Black CJ and Sackville J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">' 


 
 12 Importantly, in Rainsford , the Full Court said at [36]: 
 
 'In order for a court exercising federal jurisdiction to utilise the separate questions procedure, either the parties must agree upon the relevant facts or the court must determine the facts before seeking to decide the question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">' (Emphasis applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">) 


 
 13 In the current proceeding, Swanline and the respondents have not agreed on the relevant facts necessary to be found to determine the proposed separate questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Further, Swanline has not placed before the Court in any affidavit the facts which it proposes the Court rely on to answer the proposed separate questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">14 Swanline submits that the respondents' defence clearly identifies the material facts relevant to the determination of each separate question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">However, that is not the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The relevant parts of the defence merely raise the issues which Swanline wishes to have the Court determine separately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It is no answer to say that the respondents carry the onus of proving the matters pleaded in their defence that bear on the separate questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Court is still in the position where the test referred to in Rainsford at [36] is not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">15 In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that Swanline has discharged its onus of satisfying the Court that it is 'just and convenient' for the trial to be split in the manner sought; see Reading Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society and Another (1999) 217 ALR 495 at [9]-[10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Apart from the difficulty caused by the absence of a factual foundation for the resolution to the proposed separate questions, there are other issues that will need to be addressed if Swanline succeeds on the separate questions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Any potential saving of time and cost may be minimal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">16 In any event, if I am overcautious in refusing the motion for determination of the proposed separate questions, such caution is justified by the fact that the pleadings in the proceeding are not finalised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Swanline has foreshadowed further amendments to its statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Until the pleadings are complete, it is difficult to assess the true utility of seeking to split the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">However, as things currently stand, in the absence of a firm factual foundation for the resolution of the proposed separate issues, I consider that Swanline's application pursuant to O 29 r 2 should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">


 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
