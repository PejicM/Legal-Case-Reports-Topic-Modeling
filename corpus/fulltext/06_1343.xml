 THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 
 
 10 Section 65C(1)(a) of the Act provides as follows: 
 
 '65C(1) a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, supply goods that are intended to be used, or are of a kind likely to be used, by a consumer if the goods are of a kind: 
 
 
 (a) in respect of which there is prescribed consumer product safety standard and which do not comply with that standard; 
 
 
 .........." 
 
 11 Section 75AZC(1) relevantly provides: 
 
 "(1) A corporation, must not in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services, or in connection with the promotion by any means of the supply or use of goods or services, do any of the following: 
 
 
 (a) falsely represent that goods are of a particular standard, quality, value, grade, composition, style or model, or have a particular history or particular previous use; 
 
 
 ... 
 (f) make a false or misleading representation about the existence, exclusion or effect of any condition, warranty, guarantee, right or remedy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 
 Penalty: 10,000 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">' 
 
 12 Section 75AZS of the Act relevantly provides: 
 
 '(1) If: 
 
 
 (a) a corporation, in trade or commerce, supplies goods; and 
 (b) the goods are intended to be used, or are of a kind likely to be used, by a consumer; and 
 (c) the goods are of a kind: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) in respect of which there is a consumer product safety standard prescribed by regulations made for the purposes of section 65C and which do not comply with that standard; or 
 (ii) ... 
 (iii) ... 
 
 
 
 the corporation is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 10,000 penalty units.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 ...' 
 
 13 By Section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) a penalty unit is defined to mean $110.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As a result the maximum penalty which may be imposed on a corporation for each of the offences with which the defendant stands charged is $1,100,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">14 In determining appropriate penalties for offences under the Act , the Court is bound by s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to impose a sentence "that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" In undertaking this task the Court is required, by s 16A(2) to take into account a range of matters to the extent that they are relevant and known to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Section 16C requires the Court to have regard to the financial circumstances of a defendant before imposing a fine but the Court can impose a fine even if the defendant's financial position cannot be ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">15 A consideration, which is not specifically referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act but which has assumed considerable importance in the case law which has developed in relation to Part V of the Act , has been general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The absence of specific reference to general deterrence has not been interpreted as meaning that it is not a relevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The contrary is true: R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 at 430.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In many cases decided under the Act , this Court has placed considerable emphasis on general deterrence as being an important factor to be brought to account where penalties or sentences are imposed for contraventions of Part V. This approach finds support in the expressed object of the Act 'to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection' (see s 2) and the significant monetary penalties, provided for in the Act , for contravention of consumer protection provisions such as those presently under consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It has become accepted that the imposition of substantial penalties for breaches of provisions which are designed to protect consumers, will serve to alert members of the business community to the provisions of the Act and the serious consequences which may flow from their contravention: see eg Pugh v Clark Rubber Limited (1993) ATPR 41-258 at 41, 473; Miller v Cunningham's Warehouse Sales Pty Ltd (1994) ATPR 41-321 at 42, 269; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1175 at [24] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This principle has been applied even where defendant companies have gone into liquidation and there is no realistic prospect of a substantial monetary penalty ever being paid: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Vales Wine Company Pty Ltd (1976) ATPR 41-528 at 42, 776; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 376 at [23] - [25] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">16 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1175 at [10] - [12] Weinberg J noted certain observations of French J in Gardam v Splendid Enterprises Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-779 at 48, 502 to 48, 503 which he found to be a helpful statement of the principles which governed the determination of penalties to be fixed for breaches of the consumer protection provisions of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">His Honour held that these principles remained relevant notwithstanding the introduction of s 16A of the Crimes Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The relevant observations of French J in Gardam are: 
 
 'The appropriate level of penalty to be fixed will vary according to the circumstances of each case and the class of relevant considerations is not closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 Nevertheless it appears to be well established that the following matters are relevant to the punishment to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 
 
 
 1 The objectives of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 2 The importance of any untrue statements made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 3 The degree of wilfulness or carelessness involved in making such a statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 4 The extent to which the statements in question depart from the truth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 5 The degree of their dissemination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 6 The result in prejudice to consumers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 7 Whether any and if so what efforts have been made to correct the statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">
 8 The need to impose deterrent penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 
 
 
 
 The sections of the Act which provide for the declaration of consumer product safety standards and their enforcement are plainly of the highest importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 ... 
 
 In the present case the offences were not committed wilfully or with any intention to deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Their commission was the product of carelessness and lacks management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 As Smithers J said in Geoffrey John Eva v Mazda Motors (Sales) Pty Ltd .... 
 
 "....contraventions due to carelessness are not permissible and must be punished.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Of course such contraventions are not in the same order as culpability as those involving an intention to deceive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">"'

 False Representation as to Rights and Remedies 
 
 
 
 
 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">When an ACCC officer attended the warehouse on 14 July 2005, she observed a sign that appeared to limit the availability of refunds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The sign was fixed to the window of an office located inside the warehouse.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">
 
 
 
 
 
 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">On 23 August 2005, the ACCC officer attended the warehouse again and observed that the following words appeared on the said sign: 
 
 
 
 STOCK CLEARANCE 
 
 NO REFUNDS 
 
 EXCHANGE ONLY 
 
 
 
 
 44.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The defendant, in displaying the sign, made a representation to all persons who purchased goods from the defendant: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that such persons had no right, under any circumstances, to recover from the defendant a refund of the whole or any part of the price paid by such persons for the goods, and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that the only remedy or right to relief available to such persons, under any circumstances, with respect to goods purchased by them which goods they wished to return to the defendant, was to exchange the said goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The said representation was a false representation as to the existence or exclusion of rights or remedies that were available to purchasers of goods from the defendant, including rights or remedies that were available pursuant to the common law, and pursuant to State and Commonwealth legislation, including S.75A of the Act , such as those described below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) Sub-section 75A(1) of the Act provides, inter alia, that where a corporation supplies goods to a consumer in the course of a business, and there is a breach of a condition that is, by virtue of a provision of Division 2 of the Act , implied in the contract for the supply of the goods, that consumer is, subject to section 75A , entitled to rescind the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) Sub-section 75A(3) of the Act provides, inter alia, that where a contract for the supply of goods by a corporation to a consumer has been rescinded in accordance with the section 75A , the consumer may recover from the corporation, as a debt, the amount or value of any consideration paid or provided by him or her for the goods.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 46.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">At all material times, sub-sections 75A(1) and 75A(3) of the Act gave a purchaser of goods from the defendant the right to rescind a contract for the sale of those goods in certain circumstances, and the right to obtain a refund of the purchase price for those goods from the defendant.</sentence>

 &#8226; That the defendant would undertake an immediate voluntary recall of the baby walkers and cots, and

 CONVICTIONS 
 
 18 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the basis of the Statement of Agreed Facts and the unchallenged affidavit evidence relied on by the prosecutor, that the defendant is guilty of each of the offences of which it stands charged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">I therefore convict the defendant on each charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">
 APPLICATION OF THE RELEVANT SENTENCING PRINCIPLES 
 
 19 It will be necessary to examine separately the circumstances surrounding the commission of each offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">There are, however, some matters that are common to all or most of them which can be noted at the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">These are: 
 
 &#8226; No relevant prior conduct is alleged against the defendant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">&#8226; The offences did not result from a deliberate attempt on the part of the officers of the defendant to flout the Act and relevant standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Rather, the offences arose from lax management and inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">&#8226; When the prosecutor became aware of the contraventions relating to the baby walkers and the cots, it requested the defendant to withdraw the items from sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The defendant agreed to do this and to issue recall notices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">It placed a product recall notice in its warehouse and in a newspaper but not on its website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">&#8226; No injuries were suffered as a result of the contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">&#8226; The defendant indicated its intention to plead guilty to the charges at the earliest available opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The prosecutor accepts that this was indicative of remorse, and acceptance of responsibility and a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">&#8226; The contraventions involving the baby walkers and the cots placed at risk the lives and physical welfare of very young children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 20 The defendant's accounts for the financial year 2005-6 were in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">They disclosed accumulated losses of $53,022.45.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The prosecutor had sought more up-to-date information shortly before the hearing but the defendant had not provided it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Mr Boris Seroshtan had sworn in July that the financial pressure under which the company was then labouring had led to him and his fellow director considering cessation of operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">I infer that this subsequently occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">The likelihood then is that the company does not have assets which may be applied to meet any financial penalty which the Court may be minded to impose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">
 The Baby Walker Offences (VID 385 and VID 388 of 2006) 
 
 21 These offences arise under s 75AZS(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">The product safety standards applying to baby walkers were developed in the light of experience of the use of such walkers in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Young children using walkers had been injured, sometimes seriously, and died as a result of accidents which occurred whilst they were using the walkers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On occasions, injury occurred when children in the walkers fell down stairs or manoeuvred them so that they came in contact with hot surfaces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The various warnings which form part of the standard were directed to alerting those supervising the children to the type of risk which experience had shown was associated with use of such walkers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The warnings were intended to lessen the risk of harm befalling vulnerable young children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The failure to provide the cautionary notices meant that parents and carers were deprived of essential warnings and advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The walkers also failed the stability tests prescribed in the relevant standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This meant that they were more likely to capsize when being used by a child who had yet to learn to walk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">For these reasons these offences are, in my view, extremely serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">The walkers were on the market for some six months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Forty seven were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Following the issuing of the recall notices 36 of them were returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">The whereabouts of the 11 remaining walkers is unknown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">
 The Cot Advertisement (VID 386 of 2006) 
 
 22 This offence arises under s 75AZC(1)(a) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">A prospective purchaser of the cot advertised by the defendant on its website was led to believe that each such cot met Australian Standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">This was untrue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Tests carried out on one of the type advertised by the defendant showed that the cot failed to comply with the relevant Australian safety standard in 15 respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The safety standard was specifically directed to reducing 'the likelihood of death or injuries to children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">' Again, the conduct of the defendant, in contravening the Act by misrepresenting that the standards were met, placed vulnerable children at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Twenty two of the cots were sold.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Fourteen of these were returned after publication of the recall notices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">There was no evidence as to whether or not any of the purchasers of these cots had read and been influenced by the statement about compliance with Australian standards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">
 The No Refunds Signage (VID 387 of 2006) 
 
 23 This offence arises under s 75AZC(1)(k) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The notice displayed in the defendant's warehouse advised customers that 
 
 'Stock Clearance 
 No refunds 
 Exchange only' 

Purchasers were thereby advised that, should they buy a faulty product, the only remedy available to them was a subsequent exchange.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">The option of return of the product and the obtaining of a refund was, so they were told, not available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">There would be no point in applying for a refund; any such request would be denied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Contrary to the terms of the notice a wider range of remedies was available to purchasers of defective products.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Those remedies were provided by the Act (see eg s 75A) and complementary State legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">There was no evidence as to the number of customers (if any) who had observed the notice or had been misled by it to act to their detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">PENALTIES 
 
 24 Of the offences charged the most serious are those relating to the baby walkers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The two charges are linked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The prosecutor's investigation of the conduct of the defendant in marketing the baby walkers was commenced following a complaint from a member of the public who had purchased a walker from the defendant through the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The prosecutor then arranged for similar walkers to be purchased from the defendant and caused them to be subjected to analysis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">As already noted, this analysis revealed that the walkers did not comply with standards prescribed pursuant to s 65C of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">Proceeding VID 385 of 2006 relates to the 'controlled' supply of the walkers to an officer employed by the prosecutor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Proceeding VID 388 of 2006 relates to the supply of the walker to the member of the public who complained to the prosecutor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Any supply of the walkers would constitute a breach of s 75AZS(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Forty seven such sales were admitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Charges have only been laid in respect to the sales to the prosecutor and the complainant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Of the two sales the one to the complainant is the one in respect of which the defendant bears the greater degree of culpability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It was to be used by her daughter and would have been had the complainant not been alert to the deficiencies in the product and the absence of labelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The walkers purchased by the investigator were not destined for use by any child.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">In considering the quantum of the penalties for these two offices (and, indeed, all the penalties to be imposed) I am required also to give effect to the totality principle in order to avoid a crushing aggregate penalty and to ensure, so far as is possible, that the aggregate penalty reflects the totality of the criminality involved: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1750 at [141] --- [143].</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Having regard to all the circumstances I consider that the appropriate penalty in proceeding VID 388 should be $450,000 and in proceeding VID 385, $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">25 The offence relating to the statement that the cots complied with Australian standards when they did not is also serious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">No fewer than 15 departures from the prescribed standard were identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">I consider that a penalty of $350,000 is warranted in proceeding VID 386.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">26 The final offence concerned the notice which advised customers that refunds were not available for products sold by defendant during a stock clearance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">In my view an appropriate penalty in proceeding VID 387 is $10,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">
