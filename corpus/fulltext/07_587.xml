<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The plaintiff, Mr Bove, is involved in a long running dispute with Mr Charlton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Each is a director of, and the holder of shares in, Golden River Footwear Pty Ltd. Mrs Charlton is the company secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Until 28 June 2005 Golden River Footwear was the trustee of the Scarpa Australia Unit Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Mr Bove and Fumina Pty Ltd, a company controlled by Mr and Mrs Charlton, hold, in equal proportions, all the units in the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Approximately two years ago Golden River Footwear was removed as trustee of the trust on the application of Mr Bove.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Mr McVeigh was appointed as trustee in its place and a vesting order was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">2 This application comes about because Mr Bove contends that Mr and Mrs Charlton acted in breach of the duties they owed Golden River Footwear under ss 180 and 181 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), their fiduciary duty of good faith (to avoid conflicts of interest and not to profit from their position) and their common law duties to act with reasonable skill, care and diligence in the performance of their duties of office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Further Mr Bove alleges that by reason of the alleged breaches the trust assets were depleted and, in some cases, found their way into the hands of Kiss &amp; Tell Australia Pty Ltd, a company controlled by the Charltons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Mr Bove requested Mr McVeigh to bring an action against Mr and Mrs Charlton and their company for damages and to recover the allegedly misappropriated trust assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr McVeigh refused to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Instead he made an application in the Supreme Court of Victoria for "directions pursuant to O 54 of the Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2005 as to the respective entitlements of the trustee and the defendants [Fumina Pty Ltd and Mr Bove] to the property of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">" That application has not yet been listed for hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 In these circumstances Mr Bove asks for leave to bring the action in the name of Golden River Footwear against the Charltons and their company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is proposed that Mr McVeigh be joined for conformity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The action will seek to recover damages, equitable compensation and an account of profits from the Charltons for breaches of duty, and damages for conversion and passing off and the recovery of trust assets from their company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">5 Section 237 of the Corporations Act sets out what Mr Bove must establish to obtain leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In summary he must show that it is probable the company will not itself bring the proceeding, that he is acting in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the company that he be granted leave, that there is a serious question to be tried and, finally, that Mr Bove has given the company notice of his intention to apply for leave to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 It is conceded that each requirement has been satisfied other than the requirement that the proceeding is in the best interests of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">As regards this requirement the rebuttable presumption in s 237(3) that granting leave is not in the best interests of the company does not arise as the Charltons, being directors of the company, have a material personal interest in the decision not to bring the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 Ms Turner who appeared for the prospective defendants (other than Mr McVeigh) made two points in opposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">First she said that the company's interests would not in any way be served by the action because Golden River Footwear was a trustee company and could not in any way stand to benefit from the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I accept that if Golden River Footwear were to succeed in the action it would not gain any financial advantage for itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Indeed, it is likely that if it were to succeed the court would order that the damages and any property the company might recover be made over to Mr McVeigh as trustee and in whom the trust assets have vested.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">8 Still, that the action will not financially benefit Golden River Footwear does not lead to the conclusion that the action is not for its benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Golden River Footwear is obliged to take action to protect the beneficiaries' interest in the trust property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">A failure to take action will be a breach of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Surely it is in the company's interest, and hence for its benefit, to cure any breach of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">9 Ms Turner's second point is any action should be by Mr McVeigh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">There are I think two answers to this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">First Mr McVeigh has been trustee for almost two years and has not taken any steps to bring the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I do not say this by way of criticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It seems that Mr McVeigh is investigating whether any action should be commenced and that is one reason he has sought directions from the Supreme Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, this matter has dragged on for much too long and, in my opinion, it is in everyone's interest that the matter be brought to a head.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The second point is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">While Mr McVeigh may be able to sue for breach of trust he has no standing to sue for breaches of ss 180 and 181 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">That is a suit that can only be maintained by the company to whom the duties are owed, Golden River Footwear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">10 Accordingly I will grant the leave sought but on condition that Mr Bove give an undertaking that he will be responsible for the costs incurred by Golden River Footwear and any costs that it might be ordered to pay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The costs of this application will be costs in the cause of the action to be commenced by Golden River Footwear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein .</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Associate:
