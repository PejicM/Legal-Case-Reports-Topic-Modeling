 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The appellant, a citizen of Sri Lanka, entered Australia on 7 July 1996 holding a student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">That visa was cancelled when the appellant did not commence the course in which he was enrolled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Subsequently, he was granted a Sri Lankan temporary visa (subclass 435) valid until 31 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He applied for a further Sri Lankan temporary visa but this application was rejected on 4 August 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 On 30 July 1998, the appellant applied for a Change in Circumstances (Residence) (Class AG) visa, subclass 806, on the basis that he was a 'special need relative' of the nominator, his uncle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">'Special need relative' was then defined in Regulation 1.03 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (the "Regulations").</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The criteria for the grant of the visa included a requirement that appellant satisfy the definition of 'special need relative' both at the time of the application and at the time of the decision: cll 806.213 and 806.221 of Sch 2 to the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The definition of 'special need relative' at the relevant time was as follows:
 
 "... 'special need relative' in relation to an Australian citizen usually resident in Australia ... means a relative who is willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance to the citizen or resident if: 
 
 
 (a) the citizen ... has a permanent or long-term need for assistance because of death, disability, prolonged illness or other serious circumstances affecting the citizen ... personally, or a member of his or her family unit; and 
 (b) the assistance cannot reasonably be obtained from: 
 
 
 (i) any other relative of the citizen ... being a relative who is an Australian citizen ... or 
 (ii) welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia" 

4 The appellant claimed he was a special need relative of his uncle because his uncle had emotional and psychological needs that required his assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant's uncle, an Australian citizen, was born on 28 December 1949.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He arrived in Australia in 1974 and became an Australian citizen in 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">At the time of the application, the nominator lived in Bundoora with his wife and three children (aged between 15 and 23).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The nominator worked full time as a laboratory technician for a chemical company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The appellant lived in Brunswick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 In support of his application, the appellant submitted a report dated 30 July 1998 by a psychologist, Mr Edwin Kleynhans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Mr Kleynhans applied the Beck's Depression and Burns Anxiety Inventories to the appellant and the nominator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The nominator scored within the "None or Minimal" range for depression and within the "Minimal or No Anxiety" range for anxiety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">However, Mr Kleynhans suggested that the nominator's depression and anxiety could increase substantially if the appellant were to return to Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 A delegate of the first respondent refused the application on 24 January 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The appellant sought review of that decision before the Migration Review Tribunal (the "MRT").</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">A further report by Mr Kleynhans, dated 19 August 2002, was provided to the MRT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That report stated that the nominator's levels of depression and anxiety had increased significantly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Mr Kleynhans found that this was caused by a decline in the nominator's health and by his concern about the appellant being returned to Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The appellant also informed the MRT that he had moved closer to his uncle and now lived in a house on the same street.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">7 On 24 June 2003, the MRT affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The MRT noted that the appellant and his uncle had seen a psychologist for one hour on the day before the visa application was filed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The nominator had not previously sought professional treatment for depression, stress or anxiety and the psychologist did not recommend further specialised treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The MRT was not satisfied that, at the time of application, the nominator suffered from a prolonged illness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 The MRT also concluded that that the nominator did not require assistance because of "other serious circumstances" at the time of application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Citing Hussein v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1621 (" Hussein "), the MRT stated that it was "not satisfied that the nominator's concerns for the safety of the visa applicant manifest a need for assistance due to circumstances serious enough to reach the threshold set by 'death, prolonged illness or disability'".</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The MRT noted that the nominator worked on a full time basis and that Mr Kleynhan's August 2002 report stated that the nominator's stress level had not been a major concern in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">9 Next, the MRT considered whether the assistance provided by the appellant was "substantial" within the meaning of regulation 1.03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The applicant claimed that he assisted his uncle by providing him with company, assurances and moral support, as well as helping with household chores.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The MRT concluded that this assistance was not "substantial" in the relevant sense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Finally, the MRT considered whether circumstances had changed sufficiently at the time of decision to alter any of these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The MRT determined that the appellant was not a special need relative of his uncle at the time of decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">10 On 16 July 2003, the appellant filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia, pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1908 (Cth), for review of the MRT's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The proceeding was transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Before a Federal Magistrate, the appellant argued that the MRT had misapplied the definitions of "prolonged illness", "other serious circumstances" and "substantial and continuing assistance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In a decision delivered on 12 November 2004, his Honour dismissed the application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">This is an appeal from that judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">SUBMISSIONS 
 
11 The parties agreed that, although the "special needs relative" regulation was omitted from the Regulations on 1 December 1998, the MRT was to have determined the application as the law stood at the time of application on 30 July 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The appellant's Notice of Appeal raised a number of grounds, not all of which were pursued at the hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">12 In written submissions, the appellant contended that the MRT erred in law in regard to its finding that the nominator's depression did not amount to "other serious circumstances" within the meaning of regulation 1.03.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Citing Wu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1817 ; (2000) 105 FCR 39 (" Wu ") per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ, the appellant argued that the MRT mistakenly applied Hussein when it held that the words "death, disability or prolonged illness" constrain the meaning of "other serious circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The appellant argued today that the MRT therefore failed to consider whether depression other than that defined as clinical or medical depression could amount to "other serious circumstance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">13 Also in his written submissions, the appellant conceded that:
 
 "The MRT made a finding of fact that the appellant's assistance was not substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Clearly, this finding was open to the MRT on the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The MRT made no finding that the assistance provided by the appellant was continuing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">" 


Counsel for the appellant acknowledged at the hearing that this concession was in fact a difficulty for the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">14 The first respondent noted the significance of this concession that it was open to the MRT to find that the appellant did not provide "substantial" assistance to the nominator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The first respondent argued that, in light of this acknowledgment, the appeal must be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">This is because, in the first respondent's submission, it is a necessary condition of being a special need relative that the relative be willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The first respondent claimed that, if the MRT validly found that the appellant did not satisfy this requirement, then, regardless of any other errors it may have made, it validly found that the appellant was not a special need relative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">15 The first respondent also disputed that the MRT misapplied the definition of "serious circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">" The first respondent argued that Wu did not support the view that "serious circumstances" should be understood independently of the nearby terms "death, disability or prolonged illness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Thus, in first respondent's submission, there was no error in the MRT's application of Hussein .</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">16 Furthermore, in written submissions, citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Cohen [2001] HCA 10 ; (2001) 177 ALR 473 (" Cohen ") per McHugh J, the first respondent claimed that as "serious circumstances" is used in its ordinary, non-technical sense, its meaning is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Accordingly, the first respondent submitted that, even if the MRT did apply erroneous precedent concerning the meaning of "serious circumstances", this was not jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">CONSIDERATION 
 
17 To be a special need relative, a visa applicant must be willing and able to provide substantial and continuing assistance: see, e.g., Chow v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 88 at [22] per Moore, Emmett and Bennett JJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The language of regulation 1.03 makes this clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">18 Because of the appellant's concession that it was open to the MRT to find that the assistance he provided to the nominator was not substantial, the appellant has also effectively conceded that it was open to the MRT to find that he did not satisfy a necessary requirement of the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The appeal must be dismissed if only for this reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">19 If it were necessary to do so, I would also reject the appellant's argument that the MRT misapplied the definition of "serious circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Contrary to the appellant's submission, Wu is consistent with the view that the terms "death, disability or prolonged illness" are relevant to the meaning of "other serious circumstances".</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In fact, in Wu at [41], the Full Court held that a circumstance "is sufficiently serious [if], in relation to a citizen, it would require assistance of the same sort that would be required if the citizen was suffering from a disability or prolonged illness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Thus, the Wu Court, like the MRT in this case, considered the meaning of "serious circumstances" in light of the nearby terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">It was clearly open to the MRT to decide that no "other serious circumstances" were present at the time of application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Even if Hussein no longer correctly states the law in all respects, the Tribunal's reliance on this decision did not lead it into relevant error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">20 As no error has been shown in the MRT's decision, I need not consider the significance of Cohen and whether or not any error of interpretation would have been a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">21 I would order that the appeal be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Associate:
