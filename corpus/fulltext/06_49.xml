<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 8 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In that judgment the Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review concerning a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") of 23 November 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The first appellant ("the appellant") had sought a protection visa (an application relating to both her and her son) on the basis that she had been a journalist in her country of nationality, Mongolia, and that she had investigated and gathered together material concerning corruption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant claimed that she was at risk of harm were she to return to Mongolia because of, amongst other reasons, the revelation by her of that corruption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 Ultimately, the Tribunal did not accept the appellant's account of what she had done and the position she had been in before she left Mongolia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In particular, the Tribunal made a finding of fact (as it was entitled to) rejecting that the appellant collected information about corruption in the Health Ministry as she had claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">However, the Tribunal went on to indicate that even if the appellant in these proceedings had, on a limited basis, identified corruption in her published articles, that fact was not likely to give rise to persecution against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 In the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate three grounds were argued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The first concerned the approach taken by the Tribunal to state protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The second concerned the way the Tribunal dealt with, potentially, the membership of the appellant to a particular social group; and an apparently related ground concerning the definition of a particular social group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The notice of appeal filed in these proceedings identified one ground, namely that the Magistrate erred in law in holding that the Tribunal did not err in failing to consider whether she had a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of her political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is not entirely clear whether that ground is intended to involve a repetition of the grounds advanced before the Magistrate or some additional ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 I have read the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It is not apparent that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error, nor is it apparent that the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The appellant's failure before the Tribunal arose primarily because of the non-acceptance by the Tribunal of her account of her experiences in Mongolia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">These were matters of fact which were the province of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I propose to order that the appeal be dismissed and that the appellant pay the first respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Associate:
