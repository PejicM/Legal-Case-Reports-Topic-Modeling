<sentence id="s0">
 The Appellant arrived in Australia on 27 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">He is a citizen of Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">He applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a Protection (Class XA) visa on 10 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">That application was rejected by a delegate of the Minister on 30 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">An application was then made on 24 July 2008 to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 1 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">An application was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 25 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That Court dismissed the application on 9 December 2008: SZMUF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1731.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Appellant now appeals to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He appeared before the Court this morning unrepresented, although he did have the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">His Notice of Appeal was filed on 23 December 2008 and his Grounds of Appeal assert three alleged errors committed by the Refugee Review Tribunal, namely: 
(i) a failure " to exercise its duty under the Migration Act not to put any weight to the documents which I submitted before the Tribunal to support my claim ";
 
(ii) a contention that the Tribunal " underestimated my inability of politics and my involvement with the BNP ... "; and 
 
(iii) a failure " to realise the genuine fear which I would face in my home country if the current regime of law and order in Bangladesh would collapse and/or the old regime under which I claimed persecution and political violence rife was reinstated ... ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Written submissions filed by the Appellant with this Court on 18 February 2009 have substantially repeated these arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Again this proceeding exposes a yet further instance in which an Appellant does not identify any error as made by the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The jurisdiction of this Court is relevantly to entertain an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate; no jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court to again review the decision as made by the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">And, yet again, the Notice of Appeal fails to comply with Order 52, r 13(2) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Each of the purported " Grounds of Appeal ", however, was an argument advanced for resolution before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is thus possible to construe the " Grounds of Appeal " as being a contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in rejecting the same arguments as are now sought to be advanced on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">So construed, the Appeal is to be dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The fundamental difficulty confronting the now Appellant in both his application as filed with the Federal Magistrates Court --- and this Court on appeal --- is the adverse finding as to credibility made by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It ultimately concluded in part as follows: 
 [52] The Tribunal is of the view that the Applicant's whole case is overwhelmingly damaged by bad faith, forgery, a lack of credibility and a failure to provide consistent and plausible details that a person in his claimed position would easily have been able to provide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

 THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN TO DOCUMENTS 
 Before the Tribunal the now Appellant produced a number of documents, including posters; a letter in support of his contention that he occupied a position within the BNP, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party; and a letter from the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal had difficulties in accepting the genuineness of the documents presented --- the posters on inspection exposed a difference in the size of the font and the police document appeared to have material cut out and other portions inserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal concluded: 
 [50] The Tribunal does not accept that the Applicant has ever worked for the BNP or for any political party in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Tribunal gives weight here to the Applicant's inability to describe and consistently distinguish the roles of "Press Secretary" and "General Secretary".</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The letter intended to support the Applicant's claims about having been a "Press Secretary" is undermined by the Applicant's inability to identify consistently the position held by the author who, he said, was his direct superior.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The Tribunal gives the letter no weight and, in view of the obvious forgery of the purported police letter, goes so far as to form the view that this letter too is a fake.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">

 
 [51] Because the Tribunal finds that the purported police document is a fake, and because there are significant problems with the purported BNP letter leading the Tribunal also to give that document no weight, the Tribunal gives no weight to the posters submitted by the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Applicant's credibility is so damaged both by his oral evidence and by the poor contrivance of the purported police document, in particular, that the Tribunal gives no weight to either of the two posters, irrespective of the font size under his image in each.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">

 As concluded by the Federal Magistrate, these were all findings of fact open to be made by the Tribunal upon the evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It was unclear from the written submissions as filed by the Appellant whether his concern was more directed to: the weight given by the Tribunal to particular pieces of evidence; or 
whether he was also concerned as to: 
 the procedure followed by the Tribunal in the course of making its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The written submissions unquestionably made a criticism as to the absence of weight given by the Tribunal to some evidence; those written submissions, however, also contended that if the Tribunal had any doubt as to the authenticity of documents, it could have made further enquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In his brief oral submissions this morning, the Appellant (via his interpreter) maintained that the Tribunal should have made those further enquiries in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However the argument be advanced, it is to be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The weight to be given to the evidence before it is a matter for the Tribunal: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 , 197 CLR 510.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Gummow and Hayne JJ there observed: 
 [197] ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In the end, the criticisms made by the applicant of the Tribunal's reasoning are criticisms of the factual findings it made and are criticisms that fasten upon the weight that the Tribunal attributed to various pieces of information that it had available for consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">But what weight the Tribunal gave to those various pieces of information was for it to say.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">

 
Similarly, in Chand v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (unreported, FCA, NG 257 of 1997, 7 November 1997) von Doussa, Moore and Sackville JJ observed:
 
 The RRT is required to evaluate all the evidence put before it by an applicant for refugee status.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Where there is conflicting evidence from different sources, questions of credit of witnesses may have to be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The RRT is also entitled to attribute greater weight to one piece of evidence as against another, and to act on its opinion that one version of the facts is more probable than another ... 

 
" A finding on credibility " it has been said, " is the function of the primary decision-maker par excellence ": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67] , [2000] HCA 1 ; 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Reference may also be made to SZKRR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 145 at [7] per Bennett J; SZJMH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 270 at [27] per Lander J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Each of the findings made by the Tribunal in the present proceeding was a finding of fact open to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The findings as made by the Tribunal were based upon probative material and the reasons it advanced in support of its conclusions do not expose any departure from the duty of the Tribunal to act " judicially " and in accordance with law: WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 at [19] to [24], [2004] FCAFC 74 ; 80 ALD 568 at 573 to 574 per Lee and Moore JJ; SZLGP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1198 per Gordon J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Nor did the Tribunal err in the manner in which it went about making its findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It may be accepted that circumstances may arise where the Tribunal may be exposed to a duty to make further enquiries: eg., Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 at [77] to [79], [2007] FCA 1318 ; 164 FCR 151 at 178 to 179 per Kenny J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">But no such duty arose in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Tribunal in the present proceeding inspected the documents placed before it by the now Appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Its inspection of those documents occasioned it to have reservations as to the authenticity of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal's reasons thus record as follows its observations in respect to the document ostensibly emanating from the police and the manner in which the Tribunal resolved those reservations: 
 [42] The Tribunal drew the Applicant's attention to the fact that the photocopy clearly displayed an area where the original typed text "Accuses" gave way to an area obscured by a cut-out piece of white paper over which four names including his own were handwritten in pen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The Tribunal showed the Applicant that the interpolations by pen made a deep enough impression in the paper for them to be discernible through the paper both to the eye and to touch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Tribunal noted that the blank space created by the obscuring white cut-out ended just above the typed text stating the offence and a space provided within that typed text for the date of the offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Tribunal showed the Applicant where the blank cut-out obscured part of the date, and put to the Applicant that all these features indicated that the part of the document linking him to the police and to the purported offence and charge appeared very clearly to be falsified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">

 
In respect to the posters, the Tribunal similarly recorded the procedural course it pursued in respect to these documents and its conclusions as follows:
 
 [44] The Tribunal looked at the posters the Applicant brought to the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Both of these purported to be notices calling people to come and hear BNP officials speak on issues of the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Both included photographs of a number of purported BNP officials including the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal put to the Applicant that the font appearing under his photograph in each of the two posters was not consistent with the font under the photographs of the others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Tribunal put to the Applicant that [if] it found that it could not rely on the other two documents as being genuine reliable documents it would have good reason to give no weight to these posters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The Applicant insisted the posters were genuine and said they had lain in his office a long time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The Tribunal then asked the Applicant why the font under his image was slightly larger than the font under the other pictures, and he said that because the poster was for use in his own area, his name was given prominence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Tribunal considered this, but was not impressed on sight as to any conscious effort to highlight the Applicant's name, the difference in font was so marginal as to look more like the product of oversight than a deliberate intention to highlight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">

 
No challenge could be made as to the fairness of the procedure pursued by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It brought to the now Appellant's attention its concerns and did indeed make further enquiries of him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">He was given an opportunity by the Tribunal to respond to those concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">He was given a further opportunity this morning to make any further submissions he saw fit as to the genuineness of the documents in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">He confirmed that the Tribunal had made enquiries of him and that there was nothing further he wished to add, other than his submission that further enquiries should have been made overseas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">A denial of procedural fairness may arise where the Tribunal does not alert an applicant to the prospect that documents may be found to have been fabricated: eg., Meadows v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 90 FCR 370.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In applying this decision, a Full Court has concluded that there had been a denial of procedural fairness in circumstances where a claimant had not been given an opportunity to address a question as to whether documents were genuine: WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 , 131 FCR 511.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Lee, Hill and Carr JJ there observed: 
 [53] In the present case and in Meadows the question whether the letters were genuine did not directly depend upon the evidence of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">However, it can be said that a finding that the letters were forgeries could turn upon the credit of the appellant in so far as the finding is that the letters have been concocted by the appellant to advance his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">But if this is the case fairness would require that before a finding of forgery is made the person so accused be given the opportunity of answering it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">A finding of forgery, just like a finding of fraud is not one that should lightly be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Both involve serious allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Forgery, indeed, is a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">

 
 [54] Where the finding of fact made does not turn upon the credibility of the appellant and where there is nothing on the face of the documents themselves to alert the decision maker that they are forgeries it is likewise inherently unfair that the decision maker conclude that they are not genuine without affording the person affected by that conclusion the opportunity of dealing with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">

 
 [55] Nothing in our mind turns here upon the fact that the oral hearing had been concluded before the letters were procured and forwarded to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Tribunal could easily have relisted the matter and have arranged for the appellant to be apprised of its doubts as to the authenticity of the letters and be given the opportunity to comment upon those doubts and call, if possible, evidence to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">

 
A general indication to the claimant by the Tribunal that it was having difficulties accepting the claimant as a credible witness, it was there said, was not sufficient to afford the claimant an opportunity to address the genuineness of the documents in issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">But where reservations as to the authenticity of one document have been brought to the attention of a claimant, there may be no necessity to separately warn a claimant as to reservations being experienced in respect to corroborating material: Applicant S214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 , 90 ALD 632.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Tribunal had there found a newspaper article to be a fabrication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Corroborating evidence was from the claimant's sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The corroborating evidence was in the form of a statutory declaration; the question was whether its contents were correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There was there held to be no necessity for the Tribunal to go back and warn the claimant that the Tribunal would find the sister's evidence also to be fabricated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In rejecting the contention, Edmonds J concluded: 
 [33] At the end of [the] day, the applicant complained that the Tribunal did not warn him that it would find that the corroborating evidence of his sister had been fabricated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The simple answer to that contention is that it was not obliged to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The applicant had the critical issue, viz., the authenticity of the newspaper article, drawn to his attention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He proffered further evidence on this point, including the sister's statutory declaration, which was rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">There was no requirement for the Tribunal, acting in an inquisitorial capacity, to go back to the applicant warning him that this was one of the reasons why it would ultimately reject the newspaper article.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">

 
 [34] There was some suggestion the Tribunal was obliged to call the sister as a witness before it could make the findings that it did, but that suggestion must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">While it is the case that it is the Tribunal which "obtains" or "acquires" evidence ... this says nothing about whether the Tribunal was obliged to call the applicant's sister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It was for the applicant to place such material as was necessary to persuade the Tribunal of his claims before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The Tribunal was under no obligation to verify or investigate the applicant's claims, including by calling his sister as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The Tribunal has no duty to investigate, nor any duty to consider utilising such permissive statutory powers as it had which might enable it to investigate ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Even if the applicant had made a request under s 426 that the sister be called (which he did not) the Tribunal would not have been obliged to do more than have regard to the applicant's wishes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The Tribunal did not commit jurisdictional error by failing to call the applicant's sister as a witness, or by making the findings it did, having not called the sister as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">(Citations omitted) 

 
An opportunity to be heard thus does not involve informing a claimant as to the prospect of adverse findings being made in respect to each particular aspect of the case sought to be advanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">An assessment as to credibility may in turn lead to adverse conclusions being made as to the genuineness of documents: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 at [34] per French J (as His Honour then was).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Wherever the line may be drawn in individual cases, a party must be sufficiently put on notice of those matters which place him in a position where he can meaningfully avail himself of an opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">But procedural fairness does not require " a running commentary upon an applicant's prospects of success, so that there is a forewarning of all possible reasons for failure ": Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 at [31] , [2001] HCA 22 ; 206 CLR 57 at 69 per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In the present proceeding, and as explained by the Tribunal, there were indications on the face of the documents themselves to question their authenticity, and the now Appellant was put on notice by the Tribunal as to its concerns and given an opportunity to address those concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It was clearly open in such circumstances for the Tribunal to make the findings that it did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The now Appellant could have been left in no uncertainty as to the basis of the Tribunal's concerns about the genuineness of the documents he sought to rely upon and in no uncertainty as to the concerns being expressed about his credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There was no " duty " imposed on the Tribunal to make further unspecified enquiries in Bangladesh.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">UNDERESTIMATED INABILITY IN POLITICS 
 The Tribunal rejected the now Appellant's claim that he occupied a position within the BNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The Tribunal set forth the various accounts being advanced as to the positions of " General Secretary " and " Press Secretary " and the responsibilities of each position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It concluded: 
 [49] On the vague, confused and contradictory evidence in this matter, the Tribunal does not accept the Applicant's implied claim about being a member of the BNP or even of its Youth Wing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">

 The Federal Magistrate was correct in his conclusion that the finding as made by the Tribunal was a finding of fact open to it on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">A GENUINE FEAR 
 The " Particulars " provided in support of the final Ground of Appeal asserts that the " Tribunal failed to consider the reality of the chance of persecution for me because of my political opinion ... ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Given the rejection by the Tribunal of the now Appellant's claimed involvement in the BNP, the Federal Magistrate was also correct in his conclusion that no error had been exposed in the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">CONCLUSIONS 
 No error has been exposed in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Each of the findings sought to be impugned by the now Appellant was a finding of fact open to be made by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The Appeal must be dismissed and there is no reason why the Respondent Minister is not entitled to his costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">ORDERS 
 The Orders of the Court are: The Appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">The Appellant is to pay the costs of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.</sentence>
