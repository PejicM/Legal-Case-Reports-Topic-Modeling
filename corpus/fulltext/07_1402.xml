 Introduction 
 
1 Gino Lenzo, an accountant, appeals against the disallowance by the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) of his objection to amended assessments disallowing deductions which he claimed in relation to his investment in a sandalwood plantation project near Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The years of income for which the deductions were claimed were 1998, 1999 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Commissioner concedes some of the deductions but maintains that other deductions including certain prepaid fees, loan interest and a loan insurance fee should be disallowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The Commissioner does not dispute that the sandalwood project is a serious commercial venture nor that the agreements and liabilities entered into by Mr Lenzo were all genuine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He contends, however, that the investment structure and payment arrangements involved with the plantation project had as their dominant purpose the gaining of a tax benefit which he properly cancelled under Pt IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the ITAA 1936).</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 For the reasons that follow I do not consider that Pt IVA applies to the claimed deductions and will allow Mr Lenzo's appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The relevant amended assessments will be set aside and the Commissioner directed to further amend the assessments to give effect to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Factual background --- the taxpayer considers investing in a sandalwood plantation 
 
4 Gino Lenzo has been a certified practising accountant for about 24 years and a sole practitioner for the last ten years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Prior to that he was employed as an accountant at Ernst &amp; Young for a period of 14 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He commenced his employment with that firm, then known as Ernst &amp; Whinney, as a new graduate from the University of Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 Early in 1997 Mr Lenzo became aware of trials, being conducted by the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM), of the growing of commercial quantities of Indian sandalwood for export.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The trials were conducted in the Ord River irrigation area near Kununurra (the Ord).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Lenzo was told of the trials by Mr Arthur Baker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">6 Mr Baker was promoting a managed investment scheme under which investors would become growers in a commercial Indian sandalwood operation at Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The proposed scheme was called the "Kununurra Tropical Forestry Project" also known as the "AllRange Project".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In 1997 Mr Lenzo travelled to Kununurra with Mr Baker, at Mr Baker's expense, to inspect the proposed plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">He was impressed with the commercial potential for Indian sandalwood in Kununurra, the infrastructure, the nursery setup to cater for future plantations and the research which had been undertaken by CALM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Nevertheless, he said he did not "feel comfortable" with the management team behind the AllRange Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">His family has a long history in farming and agriculture and he was aware of the importance of having experienced and knowledgeable people undertaking farming operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">He decided not to invest in Mr Baker's project but was still "enthused" about the potential of Indian sandalwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 In 1998 Mr Lenzo was provided with a brochure by an organisation called Australian Tropical Forestry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The brochure offered a number of services for potential investors in commercial sandalwood plantations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He considered the merits of commencing his own operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">While of the view that it would have made a good return, he regarded the initial outlay required as prohibitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He decided to do some more research into the Indian sandalwood industry and to read some books from his local library discussing the general nature of the product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 Early in 1998 Mr Lenzo heard of another managed investment scheme involving the growing of Indian sandalwood in Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It was called the Ord River Sandalwood Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Mr Baker was involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Mr Lenzo received and considered an assessment report conducted by AssetWare Pty Ltd. Again he was not comfortable with the management team behind the project and declined to invest in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 Later that year Mr Lenzo became aware that a friend and former work associate, Mr Frank Wilson of the law firm Wilson &amp; Atkinson, was becoming involved in the commercial cultivation of Indian sandalwood in Kununurra by way of a managed investment scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Mr Lenzo was provided with a prospectus for the project which was dated 31 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He received the prospectus at the end of May 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He read it and considered the commercial returns shown in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It contained tables setting out forecasts and annual internal rates of return depending upon whether the investor chose to prepay annual lease and management fees and borrowed for the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr Lenzo considered the assumptions underpinning the forecast returns and based on his knowledge of Indian Sandalwood, and discussions with people experienced in the relevant market, formed the view that they were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As appears from the evidence of expert witnesses called in these proceedings this was a well based view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The project was being promoted by East Kimberley Sandalwood Company Ltd (EKS).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Messrs Wilson and Atkinson were both directors of EKS. By way of follow-up he received a letter from EKS dated 22 June 1998 stating that many other managed investment schemes preferred to disclose an annual rate of return on investment rather than an internal rate of return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In order to allow a proper basis for comparison with other projects EKS provided a projected annual rate of return on investment from its project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">10 It may be noted at this point that EKS changed its name to Tropical Forestry Services Ltd (TFS) in February 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It became a wholly owned subsidiary of TFS Corporation Ltd. Mr Wilson is a director of TFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Factual background - the prospectus of 31 March 1998 
 
11 The prospectus for the project was dated 31 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It provided a diagrammatic overview of the organisational arrangements for the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The substance of that diagram is reproduced at the end of these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">12 The prospectus identified four classes of expenditure for each leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">A table set out estimated amounts payable including amounts payable to EKS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The table was as follows: 
 Item Amount payable to Manager or associate parties Amount payable to non-associated parties Total % Rent

Note: - forecast based on an estimate of 200 hectares (1200 leased areas)
* All land in the area contemplated for the plantation is cleared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">These activities relate to preparation of cleared land immediately prior to plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">13 Under the heading "Subsequent costs" the prospectus said that to meet ongoing costs and expenses from 1 July 1999 growers must pay an annual contribution to the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The contribution would be adjusted each year to allow for inflation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">A statement from the manager would be received in May of each year, commencing May 1999, advising of the annual contribution required for the following financial year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The contribution would comprise:
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">an annual maintenance fee for the following financial year; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">rent for the following financial year; and 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">(if you elect to insure your interests in the plantation), your proportion of the insurance premium payable for the following financial year, together with the administration fee of 10% of the premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

The trustee would pay the annual maintenance fee and rent to the manager and the insurance premium (if applicable) to the insurer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The estimated amount of the total annual contribution until the end of the project for each leased area was $22,456 comprising $2,212 for rent and $20,244 for maintenance fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">14 Under the heading "Pre-payment of annual contributions" growers were told they could elect to pre-pay all annual contributions due after the initial period to the trustee on or before 1 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The amount payable by growers who chose to do so would be $8,333 comprising: 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">$871 in respect of rent; and 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">$7,462 in respect of maintenance fees
 

Growers choosing that option would still be responsible for insurance premiums where applicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">15 Reference was then made to a loan facility available from Arwon Finance Pty Ltd (Arwon), a related company of EKS. Messrs Wilson and Atkinson were directors and shareholders of Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Loan funds would be made available to "approved applicants for application moneys and annual contributions in respect of leased areas".</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The loans were to be made on a "full recourse basis" and secured against the grower's interests in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Interest was to be paid at normal commercial rates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Growers borrowing from Arwon could enter into an indemnity agreement with another related entity, Intersure Services Pty Ltd (Intersure), pay it an annual fee and receive an indemnity for any liability arising under the loan agreement to the extent that the distribution of the proceeds from the harvest was insufficient to repay monies borrowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Messrs Wilson and Atkinson were directors and shareholders of Intersure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The prospectus went on: 
 
 However the agreement does not abrogate any obligation on the part of the Growers under the loan agreement, and Growers must comply with the terms of the loan agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">

Under the heading "Taxation benefits" the following appeared: 
 
 Messrs Ernst &amp; Young has advised in its taxation report on page 24 that, subject to the qualifications contained in that report, you should be able to claim a taxation deduction for: 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">the application money of $10,158 for each leased area; 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">(in addition) your annual contributions each year; and 
 
 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">interest on funds borrowed, and the annual indemnity fee (if applicable).</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">
 
 
 Based on this advice, the Manager is of the view that it is reasonable to expect that these deductions will be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">You should, however, obtain your own taxation advice appropriate to your individual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">

16 Tables 1 and 2 set out financial forecasts with and without loans respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Specific assumptions about the number of sandalwood trees per hectare, survival and production rates, production periods, selling prices, marketing costs and land degradation and harvest supervision fund levels were coupled with general assumptions about inflation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In the case of the financial forecast with loans additional assumptions about interest costs were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Both tables assumed 463 sandalwood trees planted per hectare and a survival rate of 90%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Before tax the "Internal Rate of Return" (IRR) pursuant to the financial forecast with loans in Table 1 was 16.91%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The before tax IRR without loans was 11.81%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">There was no positive net cash inflow for growers under either table before year 15, ie 2012/13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">17 A further table showed a financial forecast without loans and with management fees and land rent paid in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Similar assumptions were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It showed a before tax IRR of 13.62%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Sensitivity analyses and assumption risks followed the tables.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There was then a section about the farming of sandalwood and the proposed planting configurations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">18 The taxation opinion from Ernst &amp; Young referred to above was dated 5 March 1998 and was incorporated in the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It identified as deductible outgoings: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Rental fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Management fees or other expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Yearly premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The assumptions upon which these outgoings were said to be deductible included the proviso that a grower was carrying on a business by his or her involvement in the project and that, by entering into a finance arrangement, the grower intended the investment to run the full course until harvest and sale of the produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">19 A report from Mr Roger Underwood, principal consultant with a company called Fortech was included in the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">It gave information about the sandalwood industry and the establishment of plantations under the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Mr Underwood set out the plantation establishment and management regime including quality control for sandalwood seed, nursery operations, host species to be planted with the sandalwood, site preparation, proposed planting rate and survival/replacement strategy, the planting of the sandalwood and short and mid term hosts, fertilisation, irrigation, weed control, pruning and pest control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">He stated that a survival rate of 90% at age one (416 trees) would be deemed acceptable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">To achieve that it might be necessary to replant some sandalwood during the first planting season.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Risks associated with the project including fire, pests, storm, monsoon failure, grazing and immature technology were referred to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">20 A report by Mr Anantha Padmanabha dated 30 November 1997 was also included.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Mr Padmanabha described himself as "currently working as the Senior Scientist guiding a number of research projects on Sandalwood at the Institute of Wood Science and Technology, Bangalore, India.".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">He holds a Masters Degree in Botany.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In his report he said that sandalwood production in India was not keeping up with demand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">There was increasing awareness of the need to grow more sandalwood supporting eco-friendly commercial production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Countries outside India purchasing sandalwood included countries of the Middle East, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">Mr Padmanabha stated in his letter that he had no financial interest in the project and considered himself to be independent of EKS. 
 
21 The prospectus also contained a summary of the agreements which a grower would enter into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The taxpayer decides to invest in the project 
 
22 Mr Lenzo undertook inquiries into the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">He described the inquiries as a "due diligence process".</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">He had discussions with the management about the risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">There were those usually associated with any agricultural business and any start up business such as fire, climate change, future market changes and future government policy shifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The long term nature of the project also carried a risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">He formed the impression that everybody involved with the project was making an effort to ensure that it was operated, according to its plans, in order to take advantage of the buoyant Indian sandalwood market predicted for the future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He was aware that EKS had long term plans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Its project was not going to be a one off, but part of a yearly strategy to develop a big plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">As a certified practising accountant, he was aware of the taxation implications of investing in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">He intended to make a profit from his involvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">In his opinion the expenditure incurred in gaining or producing the projected and intended assessable income would be deductible against his income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">23 Mr Lenzo had "pretty much" decided to invest in the project in mid June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">At the time he had a substantial exposure to equities and property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He said: 
 
 My main objective was to ensure that my investments would provide me the best possible solutions for accumulating wealth to assist me in retirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">


He delayed signing the application forms until 30 June 1998 as he was undecided whether to invest in the project or to make an additional contribution to his self-managed superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Although both options were fully tax deductible on their face, he chose the project as it showed strong returns and was an asset class to which he had no exposure in his then current asset portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">24 It was suggested to Mr Lenzo in cross-examination that the superannuation contributions were never a real option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">He had not contributed a sum anywhere near $20,000 to his super fund for many years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">In 1997 he had only paid about $1,750.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">He said, however, that he had $20,000 available in 1998 to pay into his fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">It was put to him that to get a tax deduction equivalent to that he could expect from the plantation investment he would have had to make a contribution to his superannuation fund in excess of $20,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He knew that there were limits on the amount which he could contribute to his superannuation fund consistently with obtaining a deduction for the contribution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He agreed that in 1998 the limit for a man of his age would have been about $25,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">25 Each of the lots on offer in the EKS plantation comprised one sixth of a hectare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">The application fee for each was $10,158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Mr Lenzo chose a prepaid option as it yielded a superior internal rate of return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He also opted to take up the offer of loan finance from Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">He signed and completed a power of attorney which appointed EKS as his attorney to execute various documents and agreements on his behalf and do all things necessary to ensure his interest in the lots were created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Under that power of attorney Sandalwood Marketing Co Pty Ltd (SMC) was appointed to assist in the marketing of produce derived on harvest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The directors of EKS and SMC were the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">He said: 
 
 As I was a sole practitioner operating a busy accounting practice, I did not have the time to operate and take control of the day to day activities of my two lots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Whilst my family had an established history in farming and agriculture, I did not have the requisite expertise to operate an Indian Sandalwood plantation and decided to appoint EKS Ltd to manage my two lots and my Indian Sandalwood business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">This was in my opinion the best commercial option for me as I was of the view that having someone with the credentials and expertise to operate my business would in turn lead to a more efficiently operated business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">This could then lead to greater returns and harvest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">

It is apparent from an examination of the project that there was no practical means by which Mr Lenzo could have separately managed, on his own account, the two lots which he had leased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">In answer to a question from the Court, he agreed that even if he had had the relevant expertise and time, there was no way he would have managed his own land areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">26 Mr Lenzo also decided to subscribe for shares in SMC which he said gave him the potential for an added return in the future should SMC become a profitable "supply" company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">He executed all the relevant documentation on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">The taxpayer's payment and involvement in the investment 
 
27 On 14 July 1998 Mr Lenzo was informed by a letter from EKS that his application had been accepted on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">He was told that he had been allocated identifiable areas of land, namely Lots C104 and C105 on the property at King Location 254, Kununurra in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">The letter attached a copy of a map which identified his two lots in the area of the plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">He was told he was entitled to claim a deduction of $20,850 in his 1998 income tax return in accordance with a schedule which was attached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">28 As noted, Mr Lenzo chose to fund his participation in the project with a loan from Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Its office address was the same as that of his solicitors, Wilson &amp; Atkinson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The loan was for an amount of $36,982.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">There was a First Principal Sum of $20,316 which was advanced on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">This covered maintenance/management and rent fees for the initial year of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">A Second Principal Sum of $16,660 was to be advanced on 1 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">That covered maintenance/management and rent fees for the remainder of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">29 Mr Lenzo repaid $7,506 of the First Principal Sum on 31 October 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">The remainder was not due for repayment until harvest or 30 June 2014 whichever occurred earlier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The loan was a full recourse loan and the liability to repay it remained irrespective of harvest proceeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Mr Lenzo also took out an indemnity policy with Intersure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">30 Mr Lenzo received verbal assurances when he signed the application on 30 June 1998 that Intersure had the capacity to meet its obligations under the Indemnity Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Those assurances were given to him by Mr Wilson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">He made no independent inquiries about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">He had had some prior involvement with Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">He knew that it provided short term finance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">One of his clients had used its services some years before and the arrangement had worked well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">He did not turn his mind to the likelihood that Arwon was offering similar loans to other growers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He was aware from the prospectus that he would enjoy the best return if he took out a loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">He calculated at the time he entered into the investment that he would be claiming, on an annual basis, a deduction for interest he would not have to pay until 15 years from the commencement of his contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">He responded that any obligation incurred was deductible at the time it was incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">31 Mr Lenzo never actually visited the plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He had seen a nursery in the area when he visited the Allrange project in 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">32 Before the Second Principal Sum was advanced to Mr Lenzo he was advised by Arwon that it had been researching the lending market place and evaluating possible alternatives for its clients to refinance their loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He said: 
 
 Arwon were successful in their negotiations with the ANZ Bank to refinance the loans, including mine, on what was in my view, attractive principal and interest terms and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">

He considered the option.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">He was of the view that it was not attractive for him to refinance both the First Principal Sum and Second Principal Sum with the ANZ Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">However he came to the "considered" view that he would apply for a loan from the ANZ Bank to pay for the latter which covered his maintenance/management and rent fees for the remainder of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">On 25 June 1999 he applied for and was successful in obtaining a loan from the ANZ Bank in the amount of $16,666 to pay for maintenance/management and rent fees for the remainder of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Arwon never advanced a Second Principal Sum to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">That was done by the ANZ Bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Mr Lenzo was asked why he chose to refinance with the ANZ Bank rather than holding Arwon to its loan agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">He said he had "no real reason".</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">He "went with one of them and decided to leave the other one the way it was".</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">It was put to him that the ANZ loan was less advantageous to him from a commercial point of view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The term of the Arwon loan was 15 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The ANZ Bank loan was for 10 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The interest rate charged by the ANZ Bank was 10.05%, and that payable on the Arwon loan was 9.9%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">Mr Lenzo said that at the time he was happy with his decision and knew he could repay the loan fairly quickly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The extra 1% interest on the $16,000 chargeable by the ANZ Bank was not exactly "sheep stations".</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">It was the case however, as Mr Lenzo accepted, that the indemnity signed with Intersure only governed the Arwon loan and not the ANZ Bank loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">33 The reason for the recommended change to ANZ Bank loan financing did not emerge from the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">It may be that the scheme required additional external funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">It may be that there was a concern that Arwon's involvement made the project more vulnerable to attack under Pt IVA of the ITAA 1936.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">These are speculations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Given the objective character of the test used to determine the dominant purpose of entry into a scheme under Pt IVA , the reasons for recommending the change would not seem to be material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The Commissioner criticised Mr Lenzo's evidence about his reasons for changing to the ANZ Bank, which it must be said were fairly vague.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">However his subjective reasons or purposes are immaterial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">34 Mr Lenzo made repayments on the principal and interest of the loan from the ANZ Bank and the entire loan was repaid on 21 September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">He exhibited bank statements to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Following the final repayment of the loan the only outstanding liability he had with respect to his investment in the project was the balance of the Arwon advance of the First Principal Sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">Taking into account the first drawdown, his initial payment and interest accrued on the loan, the closing balance of the loan at 2 July 2000 was $12,810.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">This amount was to be repaid on harvest or 30 June 2014, whichever occurred first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">35 To this point Mr Lenzo has not received any income from the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">No income was forecast until harvest in 2014.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">Given his election to prepay for maintenance/management and rent fees for the remainder of the project, his only ongoing obligations were the annual indemnity premiums and annual plantation insurance which have been attended to every year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">EKS has been paying the annual plantation insurance from the time the plantation was planted until 23 December 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">He was only obliged to make plantation insurance payments from after this date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">He exhibited to his affidavit a number of letters and tax invoices which he has paid in relation to the indemnity premium.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">36 Since the commencement of the project Mr Lenzo has received regular updates, newsletters and financial reports from EKS, which changed its name to Tropical Forestry Services Ltd (TFS) in 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">He was advised early in 2000 that the survival rate of the trees was poor but that EKS would be replanting sufficient trees on another location to make good the deficiency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">He said in his affidavit evidence that the project is functioning better than projected in the prospectus and that his initial assessment of the Indian sandalwood industry was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">He expects that returns which are higher than those forecast in the prospectus should be derived by him on harvest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">He referred to various letters that he had received from EKS and TFS covering the period from 1998 through to November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">These included annual financial reports for the project and newsletters and updates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">37 One of the reports indicated that a very severe wet season had resulted in the loss of about 50% of the sandalwood trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">Few of the host trees were affected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">A restocking program in 2000 was only partially successful and the company planted an additional area of 25 ha on land it owned at Packsaddle Road, Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Mr Lenzo accepted that there was no obligation on the company to replant on additional land.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">38 In closing submissions counsel for Mr Lenzo set out the actual cash outlays he made (which are of course to be distinguished from the liabilities he incurred and in connection with his investment).</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The cash payments were as follows: 
 
 Year of Income Cash Outlay 
 
 1998 $534 on 30 June 1998 as indemnity fees 


 
1999 (i) $7,506 on 12 October 1998 towards the First Principal Sum;
 
 (ii) $648 on 121 October 1998 for shares in SMC;
 
 (iii) $16,666 on 25 June 1999 in full repayment of Second Principal Sum;
 
 (iv) $1,066 on 29 June 1999 as payment for indemnity fees
 
 The total for the 1999 year was $25,886.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">2000 (i) $1,586.84 as payment of interest on ANZ Bank loan;
 
 (ii) $1,066 on 20 June 2000 as payment for indemnity fees;
 
 This totalled $2,652.84 for the 2000 year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">39 Mr Lenzo has complied with all the terms and obligations under all the agreements that he entered into for the project and by the end of 2000 had paid out cash amounts totalling $29,072.84 for his participation in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">This exceeded the cash payments required under the prospectus and compared to the $29,938 in tax deductions claimed under the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">He said that his prevailing purpose for investing in the project was to provide for a future income distribution which would assist him to generate wealth for retirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The harvest of his sandalwood lots would occur in 2013 when he reaches the age of 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">He said the project for him was a superannuation investment strategy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Having regard to the liabilities incurred, he invested $36,982 in it in June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">If he hadn't done so he would have invested the same amount into his self-managed superannuation fund at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">40 I accept Mr Lenzo's evidence as to the process by which he decided to enter into the project, the payments he made and the opinions he formed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">In so doing, I accept that his subjective motives and purposes are not material in determining, under s 177D(b) of the ITAA 1936, whether it could be concluded that a dominant purpose of his entry into the project was to secure a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The documentation relevant to the investment 
 
41 Mr Lenzo's entry into the project was effected by an application form which he signed and dated 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The application was expressed to be for two leased areas in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Section 2(a) of the form provided, inter alia: 
 
 The total application moneys in respect of leased areas enclosed with this application (at Aus$10,158 for each leased area applied for) is: 
 
 (a) Aus$20,316.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">

Under s 2(b) the number of shares in the marketing company for which he applied was two and the total application moneys in respect of each share was stated to be Aus$326.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">42 Also executed at the same time was a document entitled "Applicant's Power of Attorney".</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">By cl 2 of that document, Mr Lenzo appointed EKS and its duly authorised attorneys as his attorney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">By cl 3 he granted the attorney power to execute a lease and management agreement on his behalf, and any variation or amendment thereof "... and to execute any other document the Attorney reasonably considers necessary or desirable to effect and complete the Applicant's application, and the issue of leased areas to the Applicant pursuant to that application".</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">He authorised the attorney to arrange the stamping of the lease and management agreement and the lodgement of any caveat under the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">43 A lease and management agreement dated 30 June 1998 was in evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">It was made between EKS, Professional Funds Management Pty Ltd as Trustee of the investor's funds (PFM), SMC and each of the investors named in a schedule to the deed referred to in the deed as a "grower".</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The document was executed by PFM, SMC and EKS as manager and "as attorney and agent on behalf of each relevant grower".</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">44 In its recitals the lease and management agreement stated that EKS as manager was, or was entitled to become, the owner or head lessee of the plantation land and had agreed to sublet to each relevant grower one or more separate leased areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">These separate leased areas were set out in Item 11 of the Schedule, each comprising one part of the plantation for the purpose of conducting a commercial forestry project on it on the basis that the relevant grower would pay rent and on further terms and conditions set out in the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The agreement recited that the grower wished to appoint the manager as manager of the grower's commercial forestry project to be conducted on the relevant leased area and in that capacity to establish and maintain the project and to harvest its produce.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">It also recited that the relevant grower wished to appoint a marketing company, SMC, as marketer of the produce of the project and that SMC wished to accept that appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The trustee, PFM, had agreed to protect the rights and interests of the relevant grower under the deed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">45 Clause 4 of the agreement provided for the payment of rent in respect of each relevant leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The amount was $158, for the initial period which was 13 months from the commencement date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">That date was 30 June 1998 (see cl 1.9).</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">For each financial year after the initial period the rent was $158 per relevant leased area multiplied by an inflation adjustment factor on a date when the manager gave notice of the annual contribution payable for the relevant financial year (cl 3.2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">46 Under cl 8 the manager was to establish, maintain, supervise and manage on a day to day basis on behalf of the grower, in accordance with good commercial practice all commercial forestry activities to be carried on by the grower on the leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">This included the planting and raising of Santalum Album (Indian sandalwood) seedlings or trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">47 By cl 23.10 the grower could elect to pay annual contributions by prepaying the aggregate of rent and maintenance fees, after year one, to the trustee on or before 1 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The aggregate rent was $871 per relevant leased area and maintenance fees of $7,462 per relevant leased area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">If such an election were made then receipt by the Trustee of the amount referred to would be a complete discharge to the grower in respect of its obligations to pay rent and management fees during the term of the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">48 Mr Lenzo also entered into a Loan Deed dated 30 June 1998 with Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">By cl 2.1 of that deed, read with the schedule to the deed, Arwon agreed to advance to him a First Principal Sum of $20,316 on 30 June 1998 and a Second Principal Sum of $16,666 on 1 July 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The First Principal Sum was to be repayable in two instalments, one of $6,094 on 30 September 1998 and the other of $14,222, on the date on which Mr Lenzo was first entitled to receive the whole or part of his net proceeds from the harvest and, alternatively, no later than 30 June 2014.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">The latter formula also applied to the repayment date of the Second Principal Sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The deed specified an interest rate of 9% or the rate of interest charged by BankWest to its customers on overdraft accounts of less than $100,000 from time to time less 5% per annum, whichever was the higher rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">49 Mr Lenzo executed an indemnity agreement with Intersure on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">Its effect was to provide an indemnity against any shortfall between the amount borrowed from Arwon and the proceeds of the harvest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">It still required Mr Lenzo to repay the sum of $7,506, being the first instalment of the First Principal Sum due on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">He was also required to pay interest on the Second Principal Sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The fees for this indemnity were an initial annual sum of $267.67 per relevant leased lot to be paid in advance on or before the commencement date and thereafter an annual sum of 2 x $533.34, ie $1,066.68.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">Factual background --- the Commissioner's treatment of the taxpayer's claimed deductions for his plantation investment 
 
50 In each of his income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000 Mr Lenzo claimed a loss from business in respect of his participation in what was known as the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1 and is now referred to as Tropical Forestry Services No 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">For the year ended 30 June 1998 he claimed a loss of $20,850 comprising: 
(a) maintenance fees of $20,000; 
(b) rent of $315; 
(c) indemnity fees of $535.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">For the year ended 30 June 1999 he claimed a loss of $3,884 comprising: 
(a) maintenance fees of $1,666
(b) interest and bank fees of $1,152
(c) indemnity fees of $1,066.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">The interest and bank fees were underclaimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">The amount of interest paid for the year ended 30 June 1999 on the Arwon loan was $1,345.38.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">For the year ended 30 June 2000 he claimed a loss of $5,203 comprising: 
(a) maintenance fees of $1,666
(b) interest and bank fees of $3,461
(c) indemnity fees in the amount of $1,066.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The interest and bank fees were overclaimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The amount of interest paid for the year ended 30 June 2000 was $2,739.74.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">However the amount asserted as deductible in the objection notice was $2,471 which appears to have been less than the actual interest paid which totalled $2,739.74, $1,152.90 of which was attributable to Arwon and $1,586.84 attributable to the ANZ Bank loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">51 On 8 August 2001 a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation made determinations pursuant to s 177F of Pt IVA of the ITAA 1936.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">He determined, under para 177F(1)(b) that the amounts of $20,850, $3,884 and $5,203 each being "a tax benefit that is referrable to a deduction being allowable to Gino Lenzo" for the respective years of income ended 30 June 1998, 30 June 1999 and 30 June 2000, should not be allowable to him in relation to that year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Notices of amended assessment issued on 7 September 2001 giving effect to that determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">Under-statement penalties and interest were imposed; $4,044.60 for the year ended 1998, $509.75 for the year ended 30 June 1999 and $267.65 for the year ended 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">52 Mr Lenzo lodged objections against the assessments on 14 September 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">On 8 March 2005 a First Assistant Commissioner of Taxation advised that his objections had been considered and disallowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Reasons for Decision were attached to the letter of advice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The notice of appeal against the Commissioner's disallowance of Mr Lenzo's objections was filed in this Court on 3 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The commercial merits of the plantation 
 
53 Evidence was put before the Court relevant to the viability and commercial merits of the plantation project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">I received that evidence subject to relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">In my opinion, it is relevant to the objective purpose of investment in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The Commissioner has accepted that the sandalwood plantation is a serious commercial project, so to that extent the evidence does not go to a matter in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">However it does underpin the expert opinion evidence offered as to projected returns from the plantation and the appropriateness of the fees charged for entry into the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">In the end the substance of the evidence was not controverted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">54 Mr Underwood, who had prepared the forestry report for inclusion in the prospectus, was the first of the three witnesses to give evidence about the operation of the plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">At the request of the directors of Intersure he undertook an inspection of the plantations in October 1999 and produced a report on 1 November 1999 based on that inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">He undertook a similar inspection on 25 April 2000 and prepared another report on 28 April 2000 based on that inspection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">He has not provided another report for EKS or its related entities since April 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">He has, however, seen the plantations since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">His inspection in October 1999 took place about six months after site preparation and two months after the planting of the seedlings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">He was of the opinion that at the planning stage the project provided all the necessary elements for success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">The prospectus demonstrated that the best information about growing Indian sandalwood at the Ord had been gathered and was to be applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">He was generally of the opinion that the plantations were professionally managed thereafter although he was concerned about the standard of seedlings planted and the lateness of some of the planting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">55 Subsequent visits to the plantations at various times over the years confirmed Mr Underwood's concerns about seedling quality and lateness of planting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">He said that they are today generally understocked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">Fortunately, Indian sandalwood today is far more valuable than it was at the time of the commencement of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">56 Mr Underwood inspected the plantations in October 2005 and despite the poor stocking of Indian sandalwood trees was of the opinion that they were being well managed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">He still holds the opinion that he held in 1999 that the project will be a commercial success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">He also observed that the techniques used in Indian sandalwood establishment and plantation maintenance have evolved since 1998 as a result of further research and experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">The current operation of the project and subsequent projects are more sophisticated and more efficient than they were in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">57 Mr Underwood gave opinion evidence relating to the level of fees charged to the investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">In 2001 the Commissioner had asked him to inspect the plantation the subject of the Kununurra tropical forestry project also known as the AllRange Project and to provide a report on its progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">That project, which had been earlier considered and rejected by Mr Lenzo, also involved the growing of sandalwood in the Ord.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Mr Underwood had formed the opinion that the fees charged to the investors in that project for the purchase of sandalwood seedlings and host seedlings were excessive and gave evidence to that effect in Federal Court proceedings, Puzey v Commissioner of Taxation [2002] FCA 1615 ; (2002) 51 ATR 616.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">In relation to the EKS project however, he was not of the same opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">He said that investors in that project were charged fees totalling $60,000 per hectare for services performed by EKS as manager of the project as outlined in the lease and management agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The services involved: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Planting and raising Santalum Album seedlings or trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">Planting on the invested areas as soon as practicable after execution of the relevant lease and management agreement sufficient Santalum Album seedlings or trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Planting on the investors' areas such other trees as might reasonably be necessary or required to enable or encourage growth of, or protect, the Santalum Album seedlings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Cultivating, tending, culling, pruning, fertilising, spraying, irrigating and otherwise caring for the trees as and when required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Collecting seeds and propagation material from the investors' areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">Keeping in good repair access roads to the investors' areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">Using all reasonable measures by fumigating and poisoning for extermination and keeping the investors' areas free from vermin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">At all times maintaining in good repair and condition fire breaks and irrigation channels in and about the investors' areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Maintaining the investors' areas according to good forestry practices; and 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Paying all costs and expenses of establishing and maintaining the plantation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">


Based on his experience and knowledge of other similar Indian sandalwood projects issued by EKS and an organisation he referred to as ITC, Mr Underwood considered that the fees charged to investors were similar across all projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The project managers of the 2006 ITC sandalwood project charged investors a fee of $3,520 per 0.04 ha for establishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">This equated to $88,000 per hectare.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">On that comparison, he regarded the fees charged to investors in the project currently under consideration as not excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">58 Mr Underwood was cross-examined in relation to his report in the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">He agreed that as of March 1998 there had not been any international sales of Indian sandalwood grown in Australia of which he knew.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">He was also cross-examined about the adequacy of the provision for replanting and infilling where planted trees had died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">He said in his experience most forestry projects nearly always involved an expectation that there would be some need for replanting in the second year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">He did not himself inquire as to whether there was such a provision in relation to the EKS project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">He just naturally assumed that it would happen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">He agreed that the EKS project had suffered early mortality among seedlings in the first wet season immediately after planting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">As to the risks which he perceived associated with sandalwood plantations he said: 
 
 The tricky aspect with growing Indian sandalwood is that it requires hosts that cut in at different times of the rotation and until you've grown a plantation through to maturity and done everything, you're still basing your experience on the research plots rather than on actual plantations and I've made that clear in every report I've written, that this is a risk that investors need to know about.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">

He explained the concept of the host in the course of cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The sandalwood is a parasitic or semi-parasitic tree which attaches its roots to the roots of other trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">When a sandalwood plantation is grown from seedlings through to maturity it is necessary to establish a range of different host species during the 15 year period of the growth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The host trees are planted in amongst the sandalwood, adjacent to the sandalwood trees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Progressively the sandalwood kills the trees of the host species and sucks them dry so that other host species trees are needed to replace them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">59 I accept Mr Underwood's evidence that the set up and management of the EKS plantation project indicated that it was properly conceived and generally properly managed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The question whether fees charged to investors were "excessive" involves normative judgments the basis of which needs to be made clear in order to establish their relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">In a case such as the present, if the level of entry fees paid is able to be characterised, on objective criteria, as inflated beyond what is relevant to the interests and services being acquired, and the costs, direct and indirect, of providing them, then that fact, in combination with others, may support the conclusion that a dominant purpose for entering the scheme was to acquire a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">In this case Mr Underwood's opinion about the fees was based upon the range of services provided and in that sense was properly based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Using a criterion of somewhat lesser reliability it invoked comparisons with other Indian sandalwood projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">I accept overall that Mr Underwood did have a proper basis for his opinion that the fees charged were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">Such opinions however are necessarily more qualitative than quantitative in character.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">60 Evidence was also called from Mr Anantha Padmanabha who, along with Mr Underwood, had prepared a report which was included in the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">He has over 43 years experience in forestry in India predominantly dealing with sandalwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">There was no challenge to his qualifications or expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">61 Mr Padmanabha said the sale price of sandalwood in India over the period from 1990 to 2006 has increased from US$4,000 per ton to US$77,000 per ton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">That represented an average increase of 23% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">In his opinion the increasing price trend will continue due to the rapid reduction in the supply of Indian sandalwood caused by dwindling production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Demand for the wood is increasing in the domestic market of India and in international markets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">The gap between supply and demand is also dramatically increasing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">62 Mr Padmanabha referred to the projected 2014 price in the prospectus which was A$60,000 per ton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">The annual percentage price increase for sandalwood over the past 15 years has averaged 23%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">This exceeds the forecast 6% inflationary figure used in the prospectus projections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">He anticipated that the final price to be achieved by investors in the project on harvest in 2013, based on continuing demand and the current price, may be at least double the prospectus forecast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">In cross-examination he said that harvesting and sale of sandalwood is controlled by State governments in India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">He agreed that it is a valuable export for that country but said that domestic demand is absorbing about 60% to 70% of production.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">Sandalwood in India is obtained from natural forests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">There are no plantations because private landowners fear the "rigorous rules framed by the Forest Department".</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">They are not willing to raise sandalwood and then just give it to the government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">It appears from his evidence that sandalwood marketing in India is effectively controlled by State governments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">63 Mr Padmanabha's evidence can be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">As with the evidence of Mr Underwood, it largely went to the commercial viability of the plantation and its genuiness as a commercial operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">Having regard to the express acceptance by the Commissioner in the course of Mr Padmanabha's examination that the genuine commercial nature of the plantation project was not in issue, it is not necessary to say anything other than that the concession is supported by his evidence as well as that of Mr Underwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">64 I also accept what Mr Padmanabha has had to say about the prospects of high returns from the plantation having regard to trends in the price of sandalwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Given the trends which he identified and which existed at the time that the prospectus was issued, there was considerable cause for optimism about the future of Indian sandalwood as a commercial export product notwithstanding that the project itself had risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">65 Evidence as to the soundness of the investment and the fee levels was called from Mr Martin Sammon, again subject to objection as to relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Mr Sammon is a chartered accountant who has been involved in the management and appraisal of regional agribusinesses for 25 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">He specialises in business strategy and business planning and has been intimately involved with the formation of a number of viticultural investment projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">From 2001 to 2005 he managed the establishment and development of Lonsdale Securities Ltd's (Lonsec) Alternative Research division.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">In that time he was engaged in the review of agricultural investments in the Managed Investment Scheme sector.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">Since 2005 he has worked with Thompson Partners to launch an institutional agribusiness fund, known as the Australian Rural Investment Fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">It is a joint venture aimed at attracting wholesale funds into regional agriculture, processing and infrastructure investment opportunities which meet predefined investment criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">He was also a member of the Victorian Government Rural Land Stewardship Critical Reference Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Mr Sammon is currently engaged as a consultant by the holding company for the TFS Group which, under its former name EKS, promoted the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">66 Mr Sammon was asked by Mr Lenzo's solicitors to provide an opinion, for the purpose of these proceedings, on the investment offered under the EKS Project No 1 prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">He said that the project did not need to rely upon the tax benefits in order to provide a sufficient financial return to qualify as an investment grade product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">He carried out his analysis of the project as an investment on a before tax basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">He reviewed the prospectus and applied factors he would normally consider in assessing an agribusiness project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">During his employment with Lonsec he had reviewed a number of subsequent TFS Indian sandalwood projects similar to that proposed in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">He produced reports on those projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">Through the process of reviewing those reports he had become familiar with the management of TFS, the Indian sandalwood market and Western Australian government research on growing Indian sandalwood in Kununurra which preceded the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">67 In 1984 the Western Australian State Government had established experimental plantations of Indian sandalwood in Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">These demonstrated that Indian sandalwood could be successfully grown in the Ord River Irrigation Area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The most suitable host species and soil type had been identified and the process for the propagation of seedlings from seed stock had been successfully established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">There was sufficient evidence in 1998 to be satisfied that Indian sandalwood could be grown as a commercial forestry crop in the Ord.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">However, the plantation was a pioneering project as no large scale commercial Indian sandalwood plantations had been established in the Ord prior to 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">Mr Sammon accepted that it is often the case that large scale operations in agriculture disclose problems not evident in smaller scale trial projects or not capable of efficient resolution in large scale operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The risks of agricultural failure were therefore much higher for this project when compared to more established large scale forestry operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">68 Mr Sammon considered the initial directors and managers of the project to be appropriately experienced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">However he identified, as a major weakness in its early stages, the use of independent contractors located in Kununurra who had had no previous experience with Indian sandalwood and were not adequately trained foresters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">He said that since that time EKS had corrected the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">69 Mr Sammon gave evidence about the market for Indian sandalwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">He described its outlook as "very bright today due to the dwindling supply and the growing demand from the two power house economies of the world in India and China where Indian sandalwood has been prized for its aromatic oil for centuries".</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">Based on the prospectus forecasts, the project showed strong financial returns on a before tax and before finance basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">The forecast returns were very strong compared to other established forestry projects at the time which were projecting before tax and before finance returns of 6-8% per annum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">In Mr Sammon's opinion the assumptions underlying the forecasts were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">The forecast end price for the year 2013 as set out in the prospectus was US$43,132 per ton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">At the most recent auction of Indian sandalwood held in Salem, India in March 2006, the average price obtained was US$75,260 per ton.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Sammon could not be confident that Kununurra Indian sandalwood would command the same price as Indian grown timber which usually has a higher oil content.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">However, even if the price obtained by Indian grown timber were to be discounted by 50%, which in his view was an excessive discount, the price projection in the prospectus was not only reasonable but understated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">70 The assumed survival rate of 90% was optimistic and a long term survival rate of 60% would have been more realistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">As to the forecast heartwood yield per tree, that was underpinned by State government research and Mr Underwood's report and was a reasonable assumption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">71 Mr Sammon was of the opinion that the fees charged were reasonable give the balanced management required in successfully establishing an irrigated Indian sandalwood plantation in a remote location of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">Although EKS had a significant profit margin on the actual costs of establishing and maintaining the plantation, the forecast financial return to the investors was, in his opinion, still reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">72 Despite the experimental nature of the project in 1998, Mr Sammon considered that the compelling market outlook for Indian sandalwood at that time and the strong financial returns projected made it a project that was suitable as an "Investment Grade" project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">The higher risks associated with it were commensurate with the higher returns expected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">He described the project as suitable for an investor who was prepared to assume the higher risks in pursuance of the much higher returns that were possible from it compared to the lower returns expected from more traditional forestry projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">73 It was put to Mr Sammon in cross-examination that out of the initial payment shown on Table 1 in the prospectus, $10,158 of it was not said to meet the initial costs that the manager had to meet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">He said in response that he had not had an opportunity to form a detailed assessment of those costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">He didn't have enough information to make a statement of excessive charging but in the context of subsequent TFS projects the fees were reasonable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">He said that the Table only showed "direct costs".</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">He was asked in re-examination what indirect costs he had in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">He said that, in answering that question one would need to know how the total operating costs of the promoter were allocated to the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">He said the promoter had to fund the creation of the underlying farm asset and the project itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">Under the structure of managed investment schemes, those costs get confusing accounting treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">This seems to give an inflated view of the paper profits that are being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">The tables in the prospectus did not show the cost of land to the promoter or the cost of holding that land or any contingencies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">74 I accept Mr Sammon's evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">In one respect it goes to the proposition, which is not in dispute, that the project was a genuine commercial project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">However the significant issue which he and the other expert witnesses canvassed was whether the "upfront" payments were higher than reasonable for commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">The answer to that question would be relevant to whether the way in which the payments were structured could be said to have a dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">Expert evidence in relation to suitability of the investment 
 
75 Mr Lenzo called evidence from Paul Begley, Director, Alliance Investment and Retirement Services Pty Ltd (AIRS).</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">AIRS is the holder of an Australian Financial Services licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Mr Begley said he is authorised, by that licence, to give advice in relation to listed securities, managed investments, master trusts, superannuation investments, property syndicates and income investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">AIRS specialises in servicing customers with $1 million or more in investment capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">He has himself been a grower of Indian sandalwood with TFS since June 2000 and a shareholder since that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">Mr Lenzo's solicitors had asked him to give evidence on the suitability of the investment in the EKS project number 1 based on the content of its prospectus focussing in particular on projected returns and taking into account the financial circumstances and goals of Mr Lenzo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">His evidence was objected to by counsel for the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">The objection was on the basis that his opinion about the suitability of the investment was not a matter to which the provisions of Pt IVA were directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">The evidence was again received subject to relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">76 Mr Begley had been provided with an AIRS financial information questionnaire completed by Mr Lenzo and a worksheet detailing Mr Lenzo's financial position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">He also had a copy of the prospectus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">He set out his academic and other qualifications and experience in his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">These were not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">He stated his familiarity with pooled managed investment schemes which he described as providing an opportunity to invest in assets and industries that would otherwise be out of the reach of most investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The pooling of funds provided economies of scale to investors enabling them to acquire interests in assets otherwise beyond their means, access management expertise and reduced management costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">77 Mr Begley said he had reviewed Mr Lenzo's financial position as it was in June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">This was based on information provided in the AIRS financial information questionnaire which Mr Lenzo had completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">His opinion was shortly stated: 
 
 The applicant's investment in the Project was a higher risk investment, however projections indicated attractive financial returns on a pretax basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Depending on the option chosen by the investor the projected returns ranged on a pretax and prefinance basis from 11.81% per annum for the annual fee option and 13.82% per annum for the prepaid option calculated on an internal rate of return basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">Given the applicant's high after tax income giving rise to excess cash flow at the time, his strong asset position which consisted mainly of property, equities and alternative investments, his age, his relatively high tolerance for risk in investing and his relatively low exposure to forestry as an asset class, in my opinion, the Project was a suitable (although relatively small) investment for the applicant to make at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">

78 Mr Begley's affidavit did not refer to the projected internal rate of return of 16.91% shown in Table 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">He was asked why he didn't consider the rate of return based on the loan financed option which Mr Lenzo had chosen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">He said that his objective was just to take a conservative approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">He said it was important in considering investment returns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Considering the returns without "gearing" he was able to compare them with the returns of a balance portfolio which over the medium to longer term he would expect to yield 4% to 6% ahead of inflation, that is to say about 7% to 9%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">So he compared the 11.8% and the 13.82% returns shown in the non loan options for assessing suitability of the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">79 Mr Begley was aware that the project involved innovative technology.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">He was also aware that there was no history of the commercial production of Indian sandalwood in Australia and, in particular, in the Kununurra region.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">He was aware, however, that there had been some prior plantations in Kununurra.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">80 I accept that Mr Begley's evidence was a reasonable assessment of the investment and that it is relevant to some of the factors to be considered under s 177D(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Submissions as to the relevance of his evidence and that of Messrs Sammon and Padmanabha were made in closing by counsel for Mr Lenzo and I refer to those briefly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Admissibility of the expert evidence 
 
81 Counsel for Mr Lenzo made written closing submissions about the admissibility of the evidence of Messrs Sammon, Begley and Padmanabha.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">He relied upon the decision of the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211.</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The Court there upheld the Commissioner's application of Pt IVA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">Both Hill and Carr JJ referred to the significance of poor projected financial returns from the particular scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">82 The case concerned an investment in a tea tree oil farming project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">The Court held, having regard to the eight matters listed in s 177D(b) of the ITAA 1936, that the taxpayers had entered into and carried out the investment scheme for the purposes of obtaining a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">The Court had regard to the commercial uncertainty of the scheme in concluding that its tax purposes predominated over its commercial purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">83 In considering the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out for the purposes of s 177D(b)(i), Hill J observed that the commercial investment in tea trees was attendant with risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">Without the tax benefits which the prospectus predicted "the commercial returns were far from encouraging" (at [75]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">Carr J, in considering the "form and substance of the scheme" for the purpose of s 177D(b)(ii) referred to "what can only be described as miniscule projected returns over a long period of time from a venture which on all the evidence involved significant risk so described in the Prospectus" (at [216]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">84 At first instance in Calder v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 59 ATR 655, Nicholson J relied upon expert evidence of the poor projected returns (when properly calculated before tax and before finance) as a significant factor attracting the application of Pt IVA: 
 
 However as to factor (2) Mr Langridge's evidence was that the Project relied upon the tax deductibility and effect of the initial payments and the gearing up provided by the loan to show any rate of return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">In those circumstances it cannot be objectively found that the dominant purpose of the applicant's entry into the scheme was to enable the applicant to make a commercial investment: the tax benefit was the key to the commerciality of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">

85 Counsel for Mr Lenzo submitted that the evidence of Messrs Sammon and Begley confirmed that the internal rate of return forecast was 13.82% per annum before tax and before finance where the applicant pre-pays the maintenance and rent fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">Their unchallenged evidence was that the projected returns from the project were commensurate with the risks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">Mr Sammon's unchallenged evidence was that the project was an "Investment Grade" investment without any reliance being placed on tax benefits and that the project showed strong financial returns on a before tax and before finance basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">86 Counsel also pointed to Mr Padmanabha's evidence of an increase in demand for Indian sandalwood and the increase in average price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">He also submitted evidence that the EKS project was suitable to Mr Lenzo's particular financial circumstances and that it did not rely on tax benefits and financing to show an acceptable return was relevant to whether Mr Lenzo could be regarded as having had a dominant tax purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">Such evidence, it was submitted, was an objective fact to which regard must be had in considering whether Mr Lenzo had a dominant tax purpose and, in particular, in considering the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out, the form and substance of the scheme and the change in the financial position of Mr Lenzo that had resulted, would result, or might reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">87 The evidence of Messrs Sammon, Padmanabha and Begley was objected to on grounds of relevance only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In my opinion the evidence was relevant and therefore admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">Prior private ruling 
 
88 Counsel for Mr Lenzo also tendered in evidence an affidavit of Alan Neil Atchison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Counsel for the Commissioner objected to it on the grounds of relevance but did not object to it being read subject to relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">There was no cross-examination of Mr Atchison.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">89 Mr Atchison is a chartered accountant who was the company secretary of EKS from January to October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">He was also company secretary of Arwon and SMC from December 2000 until October 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">He was company secretary of Intersure from June 1998 until November 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">He said that he decided to become an investor in the project in the financial year ended 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">In 2000 he became aware of an investor in the project who did not have the financial capacity to meet its ongoing commitments to EKS under the lease and management agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">That grower had agreed with EKS to find a replacement to assume its obligations under the lease and management agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">Mr Atchison gave consideration to the grower's commitments and taking up a sublease agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">Under that agreement he would have had to assume the original grower's obligation to pay rental and the initial plantation, preparation and establishment fees together with the ongoing rental and plantation maintenance fees in relation to the proposed areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">90 Because of publicity surrounding disallowance of deductions by the Australian Taxation Office in other tax effective investment schemes, Mr Atchison made application, through Wilson &amp; Atkinson for a "Private Binding Ruling".</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">That application was made on 22 March 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">On 16 May 2000 he received a letter from the Commissioner dated 10 May 2000 which enclosed the Private Binding Ruling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The ruling as he described it was favourable to him and allowed him to claim deductions for potential expenses incurred in the project in the amount of: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">$10,158 per leased area plus any interest incurred for his initial expenditure for the year of income ended 30 June 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">$1,560 per leased area plus any interest incurred for his expenditure for the year of income ended 30 June 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Alternatively, if he chose to prepay the lease and management fees an amount of $833 per leased area plus any interest that he incurred for his expenditure for the year of income ended 30 June 2001; and 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">$1,560 per leased area plus any interest that he incurred for his expenditure in the year of income ended 30 June 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Alternatively, if he chose to prepay the lease and management fees, an amount of $833 per leased area plus any interest that he incurred for his expenditure for the year of income ended 30 June 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">


These were the deductions that Mr Atchison would have been able to claim had he chosen to further invest in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">He also understood that the Commissioner was of the view that Pt IVA did not apply to disallow his allowable deductions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">Despite the favourable Private Binding Ruling however, he decided not to invest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">He exhibited a copy of the ruling to his affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">91 The ruling was expressed to be a "Private Ruling" for the purposes of Pt IVAA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">Pt IVAA was repealed with effect from 1 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">However a private ruling in force immediately before that date, had effect on and after that day as if it were a private ruling made under Div 359 in Sch 1 to the Tax Administration Act as amended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">92 The ruling covered the years of income ending 30 June 2000, 2001 and 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">It described the arrangement the subject of the ruling by reference, inter alia, to the prospectus dated 31 March 1998, the lease and management agreement, the plantation contracting agreement and deed of variation thereof, the plantation sub-contracting agreement, the unexecuted deed of sublease, a secondary sales notice for prescribed interests, the trust deed, and the loan agreement offered by Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">It noted that the loan options involved full recourse loans.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">The following features were present: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">TFS to be put in funds by the financier to the full extent of the loan relating to the rulee's investment in the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">None of the rulee's subscription monies will be placed on deposit with the financier or in substance be returned to the financier or any associate of the financier.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">


The various rulings in relation to deductibility under various heads and the application of Pt IVA as summarised by Mr Atchison in his affidavit, were then set out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">93 At the time that the affidavit was read, counsel for the Commissioner said that the substance of his objection was not the significant "technical" point that the Private Binding Ruling was given to Mr Atchison and not to Mr Lenzo, but that the arrangement with which the ruling was concerned was not the arrangement before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">A point of distinction which counsel described as critical was that the ruling proceeded on the premise that the finance agreement would not include a feature whereby entities associated with the project other than Arwon were involved in the provision of finance for the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">In the present case, as appears below, EKS entered into an agreement with Arwon to lend Arwon $8.4 million which it could on-lend to investors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">Another point of distinction was said to be that the ruling proceeded on the basis that the finance agreement would not include indemnity agreements in relation to the loan designed to limit the borrower's risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">In the present case there was an indemnity agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">The third point of distinction was that the ruling was premised on the proposition that the arrangement did not involve repayments of interest not being made regularly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">In the present case the interest was not payable until the end of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">94 Counsel for Mr Lenzo did not dispute that there were differences in the financing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">Rather, he relied upon a statement in the ruling that there were no features of the scheme such as the total lease and management fees of $10,158 per leased area, being excessive and uncommercial or financed by non-recourse or limited recourse loans that might suggest the scheme was predominantly designed to produce a tax deduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">He submitted that the evidence was relevant to show that the view taken by the Commissioner was that the fee being charged for the project was not excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">That is to say, it was accepted as being commercial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">The only difference between Mr Atchison and Mr Lenzo was the financing arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">95 In my opinion however the private ruling in relation to Mr Atchison was an administrative determination reflecting an administrative opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">That opinion is not evidence of any matter relevant to the issues which I have to decide.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">I disregard that evidence as irrelevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">On the same basis I would exclude evidence adduced from Thomas Nash Cullity, the Chief Executive Officer of TFS relating to Product Rulings that TFS has been granted for its projects, not including the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">The project in issue in this case, when initially marketed preceded the implementation of the product ruling system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">Inter-company financing arrangements --- the round-robin 
 
96 Mr Lenzo's evidence and the documents which he executed provided part but not the whole of the picture of the plantation arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">Relevant to the financing of the project was an Offer to Loan made by Arwon to EKS and dated 23 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">By that document, Arwon offered to borrow from EKS $8,481,930.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">The mode of acceptance was prescribed as "the advance of Loan on or before 30 June 1998".</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">The consideration payable by Arwon to EKS was interest and repayment of the loan on the terms set out in a schedule to the offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">The schedule provided as follows: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">Repayment of Principal (Clause 4.1)
 
 
 
 In the amounts and on the dates that principal repayments are made by the growers in the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1 to the Offeror or as otherwise mutually agreed between the Offeree and the Offeror from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">Payment of Interest (Clause 4.1)
 
 Interest shall be charged and calculated on a simple interest basis at the rate paid by growers in the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1 to the Offeror less a margin of 1.5% per annum in favour of the Offeror.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">Interest payments shall be made on the dates that interest payments are made by the growers in the East Kimberley Sandalwood Project No 1 to the Offeror or as otherwise mutually agreed between the Offeree and the Offeror from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">
 

97 The "Loan" was effected by what counsel for the Commissioner described as a round- robin transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">EKS drew a cheque in favour of Arwon dated 30 June 1998 in the sum of $8,481,930.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">Arwon endorsed the cheque over to the trustee, PFM, which then endorsed it back to EKS. All of this happened on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">The EKS statement of account at St George Bank shows a debit and a credit in that amount on the same day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">The statement of account for Arwon with the same bank on the same day shows a credit and debit of that amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">The Arwon balance sheet as at 30 June 1998 showed the sum of $8,481,930 as a "receivable" under the heading "Non-current assets".</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">It showed the same amount as a "Non-current liability".</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">The balance sheet also showed that as at 30 June 1997 Arwon's total net assets were $13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">The net position on 30 June 1998 was $1,446.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">The company's paid up capital was $2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">98 Counsel for the Commissioner contended that without the loan from EKS, Arwon did not have the capacity to lend $8.4 million to the growers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">Plantation contracting arrangements 
 
99 By an agreement dated 30 June 1998 EKS as manager engaged Sandalwood Contracting Pty Ltd (Sandalwood Contracting) to "carry out the duties or obligations to be performed or observed by the Manager under the lease and management agreements".</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">Fees for the work were set out in a schedule to the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">They were: 
 
 Year 1 (1998/9) $53,000.00 per hectare by 31 July 1999
 Year 2 (1999/00) $8,000.00 per hectare by 31 July 2000 
 
 Year 3 to 15 (200/12) $8,000.00 plus CPI by 31 July 2001 and thereafter on the anniversary of this date until 1 July 2012
 

Counsel for the Commissioner accepted that this document had no direct bearing on the Pt IVA question as it related to Mr Lenzo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">100 A related agreement was a "Plantation Sub-Contracting Agreement" between Sandalwood Contracting and Plantation Management Services Pty Ltd (Plantation Management Services) dated May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">The latter company was based in Kununurra and evidently not related to EKS or its associated companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">By the sub-contracting agreement, Plantation Management Services was appointed to carry out "certain duties and obligations of the Contractor under the Plantation Contracting Agreement ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">These duties included preparation of the land for planting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">101 Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that it could be inferred from the sub-contracting agreement that actual work on the plantation was to commence in or around May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">Mr Lenzo's commitment, on 30 June 1998, to $20,000 worth of expenditure was said, on that basis, to be referable to a desire to obtain a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">A corollary of that submission was that there was no evidence to show that entering into the project on 30 June 1998 was necessary to achieve its commercial objectives.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">102 Counsel for Mr Lenzo pointed out that the lease and management agreement imposed a wider range of obligations on EKS than were imposed on the sub-contractor under the sub-contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">The wider duties included the propagation of the sandalwood seedlings and host species.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">Under the prospectus the planting was to be done upon the commencement of the dry season in May/June 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">That was after the seedlings had been propagated and the land was dry enough to permit its preparation and planting of the seedlings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">The sub-contractor's commencement date of 1 May 1999 was consistent with the prospectus and the provision of plantation establishment services within 13 months of 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">As a matter of fact, because of weather and other agricultural factors, planting did not finish until August 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">I note also that Mr Underwood said, and it was not disputed, that his inspection of the plantation in October 1999 took place about six months after site preparation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">On that basis site preparation would have commenced in about April or May 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">103 In my opinion there is little comfort to be derived for the Commissioner from the timing of the commencement of planting under the sub-contracting agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">I would give it little weight in support of the inference that a dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit is to be inferred from the investment structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">Issues for determination 
 
104 It was not in dispute that the EKS project is a genuine commercial operation and that Mr Lenzo at all material times was carrying on a business under s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (the ITAA 1997).</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">The Commissioner accepted that Mr Lenzo incurred and would have been entitled to allowable deductions under s 8-1 of the ITAA 1997 of:
(1) $20,852 for the 1998 income year being: 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">$20,000 for management and maintenance fees
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">$316 for land rental; and 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">$536 for an indemnity fee
(2) $3,884 for the 1999 year being:

<sentence id="s584">$1,666 for management, maintenance and land rental fees
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">$1,152 for interest; and

<sentence id="s586">$1,066 for indemnity fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">(3) $5,203 for the 2000 year being:

<sentence id="s588">$1,666 for management, maintenance and land rental fees
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">$2,471 for interest; and 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">$1,066 for indemnity fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">As stated by the Commissioner in his submissions, the issues before the Court are whether, by reason of Pt IVA of the 1936 Act, the following deductions are not allowable to the applicant: 
(1) For the year ended 30 June 1998: $20,850 comprising: 
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">maintenance fees of $20,000
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">rent in the amount of $315
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">indemnity fees in the amount of $535
(2) For the year ended 30 June 1999:
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">interest in the amount of $1,152 incurred on the borrowing of $20,316
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">indemnity fees in the amount of $1,066
(3) For the year ended 30 June 2000:
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">interest incurred on the loan of $20,316
 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">indemnity fees in the amount of $1,066
Also in issue is whether the Commissioner erred in assessing the applicant's penalty taxes in each of those years of $4,044.60, $509.75 and $267.65 respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">105 The Commissioner concedes that the deduction of $1,666 claimed in respect of the outgoings for maintenance fees and rent on or about 23 June 1999 and the interest incurred and paid to the ANZ Bank are allowable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">Statutory framework 
 
106 The present proceedings arise under the provisions of Pt IVA of the 1936 Act, the relevant parts of which provide: 
 
 177F(1) Where a tax benefit has been obtained, or would but for this section be obtained, by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which this Part applies, the Commissioner may --- 
 
 ...
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of a tax benefit that is referable to a deduction or a part of a deduction being allowable to the taxpayer in relation to a year of income --- determine that the whole or a part of the deduction or of the part of the deduction, as the case may be, shall not be allowable to the taxpayer in relation to that year of income; or
 
 ...
 
 
 
 and, where the Commissioner makes such a determination, he shall take such action as he considers necessary to give effect to that determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">

107 Section 177A, the interpretation provision of Pt IVA, sets out a number of relevant definitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">They include the following: 
 
 "scheme" means: 
 
 
 
 (a) any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether express or implied and whether or not enforceable, or intended to be enforceable, by legal proceedings; and 
 
 (b) any scheme, plan, proposal, action, course of action or course of conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">
 

108 The definition of "scheme" should be read together with the provisions of s 177A(4) and (5) which respectively provide: 
 
 (4) A reference in this Part to the carrying out of a scheme by a person shall be read as including a reference to the carrying out of a scheme by a person together with another person or other persons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s604">(5) A reference in this Part to a scheme or a part of a scheme being entered into or carried out by a person for a particular purpose shall be read as including a reference to the scheme or the part of the scheme being entered into or carried out by the person for 2 or more purposes of which that particular purpose is the dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">

109 The circumstances in which a taxpayer is said to have obtained a tax benefit in connection with a scheme are set out in s 177C, which relevantly provides: 
 
 (1) Subject to this section, a reference in this Part to the obtaining by a taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as a reference to: 
 
 ...
 
 
 
 (b) a deduction being allowable to the taxpayer in relation to a year of income where the whole or a part of that deduction would not have been allowable, or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable, to the taxpayer in relation to that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out; or
 
 ...
 
 
 
 and, for the purposes of this Part, the amount of the tax benefit shall be taken to be:
 
 ... 
 
 
 (d) in a case to which paragraph (b) applies --- the amount of the whole of the deduction or of the part of the deduction, as the case may be, referred to in that paragraph ...
 
 

110 Section 177D is the core provision which identifies schemes to which Pt IVA applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">That section provides: 
 
 This Part applies to any scheme that has been or is entered into after 27 May 1981, and to any scheme that has been or is carried out or commenced to be carried out after that date (other than a scheme that was entered into on or before that date), whether the scheme has been or is entered into or carried out in Australia or outside Australia or partly in Australia and partly outside Australia, where --- 
 
 
 
 (a) a taxpayer (in this section referred to as the "relevant taxpayer" ) has obtained, or would but for section 177F obtain, a tax benefit in connection with the scheme; and 
 
 (b) having regard to --- 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out; 
 (ii) the form and substance of the scheme; 
 (iii) the time at which the scheme was entered into and the length of the period during which the scheme was carried out; 
 (iv) the result in relation to the operation of this Act that, but for this Part, would be achieved by the scheme; 
 (v) any change in the financial position of the relevant taxpayer that has resulted, will result, or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme;
 (vi) any change in the financial position of any person who has, or has had, any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) with the relevant taxpayer, being a change that has resulted, will result or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme; 
 (vii) any other consequence for the relevant taxpayer, or for any person referred to in subparagraph (vi), of the scheme having been entered into or carried out; and 
 (viii) the nature of any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) between the relevant taxpayer and any person referred to in subparagraph (vi),
 
 
 
 
 
 it would be concluded that the person, or one of the persons, who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme did so for the purpose of enabling the relevant taxpayer to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme or of enabling the relevant taxpayer and another taxpayer or other taxpayers each to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme (whether or not that person who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme is the relevant taxpayer or is the other taxpayer or one of the other taxpayers).</sentence>
<sentence id="s607">
 

 Whether Pt IVA applied to the claimed deductions 
 
111 The focus of the submissions advanced by the Commissioner was on what his counsel described as "the investment structure that Mr Lenzo entered into on 30 June 1998".</sentence>
<sentence id="s608">The elements of that structure which he emphasised were those reflected in the agreements to which Mr Lenzo made on that day, the Loan Offer document between Arwon and EKS and the round-robin transaction which gave effect to that loan arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s609">Counsel also pointed to the fact that the scheme as entered into in 1998 was not implemented precisely in 1999 and 2000 because it had contemplated that prepayment in June 1999 would be done through Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s610">112 The Commissioner contended that there was in existence, relevant to the 1998 year of income, a scheme within the meaning of s 177A(1) of the ITAA 1936.</sentence>
<sentence id="s611">That scheme comprised: 
 
 
 (a) The Prospectus and the making and implementation of the Application Form, the Lease and Management Agreement, the Loan Deed, the Offer to Loan between the Lender and the Manager, the Indemnity Agreement and the Trust Deed and the acts carried out and the course of action undertaken pursuant to that form and those agreements, including the round robin involving the Manager and the Lender on 30 June 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s612">
 


Alternative schemes, designated (b) and (c) followed the formulation of the primary scheme but dropped the reference to the prospectus in the case of scheme (b) and additionally the reference to the trust deed in scheme (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s613">The scheme as formulated by the Commissioner continued in the 1999 and 2000 years of income so far as it was relevant to the advance of the First Principal Sum, the interest payable on it under the Loan Deed and the fees payable under the Indemnity Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s614">The variation in the loan arrangements in 1999 and 2000 with the borrowing from the ANZ Bank instead of Arwon explains why the Commissioner does not now contend that the deductions claimed on interest paid on those borrowings should be disallowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s615">It is the ongoing interest on the loan from Arwon and the ongoing indemnity fees for 1999 and 2000 that represent continuing elements of the original scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s616">The Commissioner's position, in effect, was that the tax benefits derived from those deductions represented tax benefits obtained "in connection with" the scheme which he identified for the purposes of s 117F.</sentence>
<sentence id="s617">113 The Commissioner's formulation of the relevant alternative schemes in his closing submissions differed slightly from the formulation in his formal Response to Mr Lenzo's Statement of Grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s618">That earlier formulation was accepted by Mr Lenzo in his closing submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s619">The principal difference between the two formulations was the inclusion of the Offer to Loan between Arwon and EKS as an element of the more recent version.</sentence>
<sentence id="s620">An express reference, in the earlier version, to Mr Lenzo's election to prepay aggregate annual rent and maintenance fees was dropped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s621">The Commissioner concedes that Pt IVA does not apply to the prepayment of future maintenance and rent fees in the 1999 and 2000 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s622">114 In my opinion the alternative schemes as formulated may be accepted as schemes for the purposes of Pt IVA notwithstanding the somewhat ungrammatical inclusion of the prospectus as an element of a scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s623">115 The first question which must be asked in this case is whether, by entering into the relevant scheme, Mr Lenzo obtained a tax benefit in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s624">Section 177C explains what is meant by obtaining a tax benefit in connection with a scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s625">If it is a benefit derived from a deduction it must be a deduction that "... would not have been allowable, or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable, to the taxpayer in relation to that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out".</sentence>
<sentence id="s626">116 It was submitted for Mr Lenzo that had he not invested in the plantation project, he would have obtained a similar tax benefit by putting money into his self-managed superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s627">It was said that an investment of $36,982 in that fund in the 1998 year would have given rise to an allowable deduction of $28,420 in that year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s628">That represented the amount of his age based superannuation limits at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s629">The amount of the deduction claimed in 1998 for the EKS project was $20,852.</sentence>
<sentence id="s630">Based on what was said to be Mr Lenzo's "categorical evidence" that he would have invested the sum in his superannuation fund, it would be reasonable to expect that he would have obtained the same tax benefit had the scheme not been carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s631">117 Other objective facts said to support his evidence and make the expectation that he would have invested in superannuation sufficiently reliable to be regarded as reasonable included: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s632">The evidence that he had established his own self-managed superannuation fund prior to 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s633">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s634">Payment of non-deductible contributions to his superannuation fund prior to 1998 which exceeded his maximum deductible contribution benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s635">He gave evidence of this in his cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s636">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s637">The fact that he had funds available to make a contribution of $36,982 to his superannuation fund in the 1998 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s638">He also gave evidence of that fact in his cross-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s639">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s640">The fact that he was 41 in 1998 and would have been unable to draw on his superannuation until 14 years later at age 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s641">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s642">The duration of the project before harvest proceeds arose was also 14 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s643">

118 This submission, in my opinion, is answered as counsel for the Commissioner pointed out, by the terms of s 177C(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s644">That refers to a deduction being allowable to the taxpayer where the whole or a part that deduction would not have been allowable if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s645">The relevant deduction was for prepayment of lease and management fees and indemnity fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s646">In my opinion the superannuation counterfactual is extraneous to the alternatives which are to be considered for the purposes of s 177C(1)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s647">119 A relevant counterfactual in this case involved Mr Lenzo borrowing the money needed to finance his involvement with the scheme from some source other than Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s648">He could have borrowed from the ANZ Bank from the outset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s649">Alternatively, he could have used his own funds and obtained the same deduction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s650">The Loan Deed was an element of each of the alternative schemes defined by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s651">A loan from the ANZ Bank from the outset would have supported Mr Lenzo's investment in the plantation scheme to the same effect as the borrowing from Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s652">On that basis the deduction claimed in respect of the 1998 year would have been allowable or might reasonably be expected to have been allowable in relation to that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s653">I do not consider therefore that Mr Lenzo gained, by entering into the scheme, a tax benefit in respect of his borrowings that he could not reasonably have been expected to obtain otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s654">120 Assuming there was a tax benefit, s 177D requires attention to the question whether, having regard to the eight factors listed in para (b) "it would be concluded that" Mr Lenzo or any other person who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of it "did so for the purpose of enabling [Mr Lenzo] to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme".</sentence>
<sentence id="s655">The purposes to be considered are those attributable to "relevant persons who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of the scheme".</sentence>
<sentence id="s656">Section 177D(b) is not concerned with attributing a purpose to "the scheme": Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at [63] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s657">The test of purpose is objective and not to be answered in whole or in part by reference to actual subjective purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s658">If there is more than one purpose to be imputed, the question is whether the taxation benefit purpose was the dominant purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s659">By that is meant the "ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose": Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 416.</sentence>
<sentence id="s660">The importance of setting aside subjective purposes whether they favour the taxpayer or the Commissioner's position was emphasised in the joint judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Hart 217 CLR at [65] where, speaking of the structuring of the loan in issue in that case they said: 
 
 Of course the loan was structured in the say it was in order to achieve the most desirable taxation result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s661">But those are statements about why the respondents acted as they did or about why the lender (or its agent) structured the loan in the way it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s662">They are not statements which provide an answer to the question posed by s 177D(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s663">That provision requires the drawing of a conclusion about purpose from the eight identified objective matters; it does not require, or event permit, any inquiry into the subjective motives of the relevant taxpayers or others who entered into or carried out the scheme or any part of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s664">

121 The question posed by s 177D(b) is holistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s665">Each of the eight specified factors must be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s666">But the decisionmaker, being the Commissioner, or a judge on appeal from the Commissioner, is not required to award points for each factor like a judging panel in an ice skating competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s667">The enumerated factors identify essential elements associated with entry into and implementation of the scheme in question and are to be considered together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s668">Having regard to the submissions of both parties, I make the following observations in respect of each of the eight factors listed in s 177D(b): 
 (i) As to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s669">
 
122 The marketing of the scheme as set out in the prospectus supports the proposition that it was to be entered into as a serious commercial project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s670">On Mr Sammon's evidence it did not need to rely upon tax benefits in order to provide a sufficient financial return to qualify as an investment grade product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s671">I do not consider that the evidence indicates any over-emphasis on tax benefits to be derived from the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s672">The marketing of any commercial investment product can draw attention to its tax benefits by rendering the gaining of those benefits the dominant purpose of the product.</sentence>
<sentence id="s673">In this case, in my opinion, the tax benefits as marketed were subordinate to the reasonably based commercial returns albeit those returns, being high, carried a corresponding level of risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s674">123 A second relevant aspect of the manner in which the scheme was entered into was said by the Commissioner to be related to the timing of Mr Lenzo's execution of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s675">This falls for consideration under the factor identified in s 177D(b)(iii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s676">I consider that the fact that the scheme was entered into on 30 June 1998 and the execution of prepared proforma documents occurred on that date can be taken as indicative of a desire to obtain a tax benefit for the 1998 year of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s677">But while it goes into the balance in support of the Commissioner's contentions as to dominant purpose, it is not a factor to which, in this case, I attribute great weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s678">If there is a significant commercial benefit to be derived from an investment and an associated tax benefit, entry into the investment scheme on 30 June 1998 with a view to obtaining the tax benefit in that year is entirely consistent with a predominantly commercial purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s679">124 The round-robin upon which much emphasis was placed by the Commissioner carries with it the negative connotations traditionally associated with such apparently artificial transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s680">I accept that Mr Lenzo's lack of awareness of that transaction is immaterial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s681">However the significance of it for the assessment of a dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit for Mr Lenzo is not apparent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s682">In a sense it overlaps with the question whether a tax benefit was obtained given the alternative of external financing to individual growers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s683">It was not as though they were being offered non-recourse loans by Arwon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s684">While the round-robin is a factor which in combination with other matters might support an inference of a dominant tax purpose, it is not determinative of the existence of such a purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s685">Moreover it may be seen as an incident of the much more significant commercial purposes achievable with or without a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s686">125 The Commissioner also pointed to the small initial outlay of $535 in the 1998 year of income and the obligation to make a payment of only $7,506 on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s687">He contended that the savings of $10,112.25 from the total tax deductions claimed of $20,850 exceeded the amount of the payment required on 30 September 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s688">He went on to refer, under this heading, to the effect of the various agreements on Mr Lenzo's ability to claim tax deductions in 1999 and 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s689">He also argued that only the amount of $7,506 actually paid out of the $20,315 nominally contributed by Mr Lenzo in terms of his liabilities was ever available to the manager for the pursuit of the commercial objectives of growing, harvesting and selling the Indian sandalwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s690">He contended that the amount of the initial maintenance fees and rent payable by Mr Lenzo was not related to the pursuit of those commercial objectives but reflected a desire to enable him to achieve tax savings in excess of the amount of his initial cash outlay in relation to the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s691">At one point in the submissions the Commissioner seemed to be slipping into a subjective test of purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s692">126 It was pointed out by counsel for Mr Lenzo that the $7,506 was paid from his own cash funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s693">His 1998 assessment issued in mid-November did not result in a tax benefit to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s694">Counsel submitted that there was no evidence that the borrowed funds in 1998 were not "available" for the management of the wood lots.</sentence>
<sentence id="s695">Counsel pointed to financial statements of the EKS project manager which showed substantial funds available in the 1998 year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s696">In 1998 and 1999 the EKS project manager had sufficient funds available for the management of the allotments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s697">127 What was created by the loans was a real liability with no non-recourse exit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s698">The growers' liability was converted into cash as payments were made by the growers from time to time in reduction of it or interest paid on the loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s699">As it turned out over the first three years of the project Mr Lenzo made actual cash outlays of $29,072.84 against claimed deductions of $29,938.</sentence>
<sentence id="s700">While the high level of the initial outlay measured by liability and the smaller amount of the actual payment made by Mr Lenzo may be taken into account as indicative of a tax benefit purpose, it does not in my opinion establish that as a dominant purpose against the overall purpose of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s701">Moreover the level of fees charged up front may be related to both direct and indirect costs as Mr Underwood pointed out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s702">Some of those costs would no doubt involve a longer term recovery by the plantation manager.</sentence>
<sentence id="s703">(ii) The form and substance of the scheme 
 
128 The form and the substance of the arrangements were the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s704">There was no suggestion that any of the agreements entered into was a sham.</sentence>
<sentence id="s705">They were not complex or artificial, save for the round-robin transaction, but were similar to other arrangements in agriculture managed investment schemes which EKS carried on for commercial gain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s706">Although the Commissioner made submissions relevant to the timing of the payment of the management fees, it cannot be said that they were paid for anything other than services which EKS agreed to provide under the lease and management agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s707">Nor were the amounts paid for principal repayments and interest anything other than as described in the loan agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s708">There was also expert evidence that the project had been established, operated and managed during the life of the project in a professional, commercial and business like manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s709">The Commissioner had not suggested an alternative form in which the project could have been cast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s710">129 Although in some sense it may be said that Mr Lenzo was a "passive investor" the Commissioner nevertheless appears to have accepted that the deductions claimed would have been allowable on the basis that they were incurred in gaining income or carrying on a business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s711">In any event, given the significant commercial benefits offered by the project, I do not regard his "passivity" as indicative of a dominant tax benefit purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s712">(iii) The time at which the scheme was entered into and the length of the period during which the scheme was carried out 
 
130 As noted earlier, I accept that the entry into the scheme on 30 June 1998 may be indicative of a taxation purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s713">But the existence and use of a facility to claim such taxation benefits as are available within a particular income year does not necessarily indicate a dominant tax purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s714">Quite apart from that, the project was not merely a paper exercise concluded at the close of the financial year to generate paper liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s715">The liabilities were real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s716">They were incurred in relation to a serious commercial project with a 15 year lifetime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s717">The prospect of a commercial return would justify it without reference to any taxation benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s718">(iv) The result in relation to the operation of this act that, but for this Part would be achieved by the scheme 
 
131 It is true that but for the application of Pt IVA Mr Lenzo's deductions would be allowable under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act as business expenditures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s719">It is plain however that a mere fact that a taxpayer claims a tax benefit does not mean that Pt IVA applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s720">As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; 217 CLR 216 at [53] :
 
 The bare fact that a taxpayer pays less tax, if one form of transaction rather than another is made, does not demonstrate that Pt IVA applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s721">Simply to show that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit does not show that Pt IVA applies.</sentence>

 (v) Any change in the financial position of the relevant taxpayer that resulted, will result, or may reasonably be expected to result from the scheme 
 
132 The Commissioner simply submitted under this heading that the financial position of Mr Lenzo was improved by the tax savings which the scheme generated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s723">He received immediate tax savings which exceeded his cash outlays in respect of the scheme in the 1998 and 1999 years of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s724">In the following years of income he would receive the benefit of deductions for interest accrued but unpaid and indemnity fees which would all but offset the actual cash outlays in respect of the indemnity fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s725">His exposure to further cash outlays would turn upon the success or otherwise of the plantation and the operation of the indemnity agreement at the completion of the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s726">Counsel for Mr Lenzo submitted that this factor is to assessed at the time that the relevant transactions were entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s727">133 The change in the financial position of Mr Lenzo that must be considered under (iv) is not limited to tax benefits but also the prospect of a commercial return which he has acquired by the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s728">The evidence was clear that this was a real prospect although attended by the usual risks of any agricultural cultivation scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s729">The forecast financial returns for this project were described as "attractive on a pre-tax basis".</sentence>
<sentence id="s730">The forecast returns cannot, in my opinion, be dismissed as merely speculative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s731">There was, on the evidence, a reasonable prospect of a return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s732">
 

 (iv) Any change in the financial position of any person who has or has had, any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) with the relevant taxpayer, being a change that has resulted, will result or may reasonably be expected to result, from the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s733">
 
134 There were, in my opinion, no relevant changes in the financial position of persons other than Mr Lenzo which would have supported an inference of a dominant purpose of securing a tax benefit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s734">The project manager would benefit from the receipt of management fees and land rental fees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s735">The promoters' dominant purpose was profit from the development, management and operation of the EKS project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s736">It could not be concluded, viewed objectively, that the dominant purpose of EKS and its related companies was to obtain a tax benefit for Mr Lenzo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s737">(vii) Any other relevant consequences for the relevant taxpayer, or for any person referred to in subparagraph (vi), of the scheme having been entered into or carried out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s738">
 
135 There is no other relevant consequence under this heading in my opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s739">(viii) The nature of any connection (whether of a business, family or other nature) between the relevant taxpayer and any person referred to in subparagraph (vi).</sentence>
<sentence id="s740">
 
136 Beyond the connection established by the agreements themselves, there was no other relevant connection indicative of a tax purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s741">137 Taking all these factors together and the transaction overall, I accept that there were tax benefits to be derived from the way in which the investment structure was set up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s742">Aspects of the investment structure were indicative of a purpose of deriving a tax benefit from the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s743">I do not accept however, having regard to the factors already mentioned, the significant returns which could reasonably be expected from a moderately successful outcome to the project, independent of any tax benefits, and the ready availability of alternative financing arrangements to Mr Lenzo that it would be concluded that he or the manager or promoter entered into or carried out the scheme for the dominant purpose of enabling him to obtain a tax benefit in connection with the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s744">Conclusion 
 
138 In my opinion, for the preceding reasons, the scheme was not one to which Pt IVA applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s745">The applicant's appeal against the decision disallowing his objections succeeds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s746">
 
 I certify that the preceding one hundred and thirty-eight (138) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.</sentence>
