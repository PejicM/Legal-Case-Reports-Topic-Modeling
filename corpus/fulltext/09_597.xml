<sentence id="s0">
 Mr Van Efferen was employed in various capacities by the respondent ("CMA") and its predecessors between 2002 and 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In October 2006 his employment was terminated by CMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">His application to this Court alleges that CMA, in effecting his termination, breached a term of an Australian workplace agreement ("the AWA") and implied terms of a common law contract of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">CMA denies that any such breaches occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">THE BACKGROUND FACTS 
 Most of the relevant facts are not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In January 2006 CMA entered into a contract with John Holland under which CMA was to demolish a wharf at Port Hedland in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Demolition was to occur at the same time that another wharf was being built.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The project was known as the "Dolphin Project".</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">CMA invited Mr Van Efferen to work on the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He moved to Port Hedland in June 2006 and was initially employed as a Barge Master.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Shortly after he commenced work he entered into the AWA with CMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It will be necessary to return to the details of some of the terms of this AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Mr Van Efferen also received and signed a letter of offer dated 27 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The letter of offer was to be read in conjunction with the AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It dealt with matters such as the protection of CMA's confidential information and intellectual property and the way in which Mr Van Efferen was to perform his duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In signing the letter Mr Van Efferen acknowledged that he understood and agreed to be bound by these terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Van Efferen had arranged for one of CMA's barges to be fitted with spud poles before it left CMA's Geelong base for Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Spud poles were designed to stabilise the barge while demolition activities were in progress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In early August 2006 Mr Alphonse Michael, a CMA Manager, arrived in Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">He told Mr Van Efferen that the barge was to be refitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The spud poles were to be removed and the barge stabilised by a set of anchors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Mr Van Efferen objected to this change and made his opposition plain to Mr Michael.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">When Mr Michael insisted that the changes be made Mr Van Efferen complied with the direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">After the refit had been completed Mr Van Efferen applied to take accrued annual leave until 9 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He did so because he feared that, if he remained, further disagreement with Mr Michael would occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His leave application was approved and he left Port Hedland on 21 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He did not, as counsel for CMA suggested at trial, "walk off" the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">While Mr Van Efferen was away Mr Jim Doyle a Project Director employed by John Holland complained to Mr Shaun Clarke, CMA's General Manager of its Contracting Division, about the performance of certain CMA staff members at Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In late August John Holland advised CMA that it wanted Mr Michael removed from the work site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Early in September John Holland requested that Mr Lloyd Baxter, CMA's Marine Operations Supervisor on the Project, also leave the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Under the contract between CMA and John Holland, John Holland had the right to require that CMA remove staff whom John Holland considered to be unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The contract provided for such a direction to be given in writing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">CMA, however, was prepared to act on an oral complaint by John Holland in order to maintain cordial business relations with John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">On 21 September 2006 Mr Doyle wrote to Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He recorded that "[f]or quite some time now we have been relaying to CMA our concerns regarding the competency of its staff engaged in marine works activities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">" He referred to an incident which had occurred the previous day in which a CMA barge had collided with another barge and advised that "in the interests of safety", CMA on-site managers had been instructed "to see to it that CMA take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the CMA floating plant in particular is under the care of competent personnel at all times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">" Mr Clarke responded by letter dated 26 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In that letter Mr Clarke acknowledged that CMA staff had not performed to the required standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">He said: 
 "In relation to the general comment on competency of our marine staff we accept that there have been incidents that we would prefer had not occurred and that, in part, these have been due to the team being unfamiliar with the equipment and each other and through working under considerable pressure to achieve the program.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">" 
 Mr Clarke noted that an enquiry was under way to discover whether or not CMA was at fault in relation to the incident which had prompted Mr Doyle to write to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">He continued: 
 "... Neverthless, we accept your concern and have taken some steps to improve the management and coordination of our marine assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">You will appreciate that your exclusion of our most experienced marine manager from site has left a significant gap in our technical expertise, and finding a replacement of similar skill and experience in the current environment will prove difficult, particularly in the short term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The resultant need to rely on less experienced staff to manage day to day operations has raised the potential for oversight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

 
 In the immediate term, we will have an experienced marine supervisor on site on Tuesday 26 th .</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He is familiar with the conditions, equipment and the project and will take responsibility for the coordination of our marine movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">" 
 This "experienced marine supervisor" was Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Mr Clarke had contacted him while he was on leave and requested that he curtail that leave and return to the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Mr Van Efferen had agreed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Mr Clarke considered that Mr Van Efferen was the best qualified of CMA's employees to undertake the role of marine supervisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">As foreshadowed, Mr Van Efferen returned to the site on 26 September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">He commenced performing the duties of marine supervisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">By the time he had returned Mr Simon Pick had become CMA's Project Manager on the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Pick lacked marine experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Soon after Mr Van Efferen's return he had a number of disagreements with Mr Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The two most significant related to matters of health and safety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">They involved the same barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The first disagreement arose from a collision between a barge and a wharf which led to the barge being holed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">This had occurred because tyres which Mr Van Efferen had directed should be placed around the outside of the barge to protect it in the event of a collision had been removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The Barge Master told Mr Van Efferen that the tyres had been removed from the barge at the direction of Mr Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Mr Van Efferen rang Mr Pick and asked him who had ordered the tyres to be removed from the barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Mr Pick responded with words to the effect that Mr Van Efferen knew "fucking well" that he (Mr Pick) had ordered that the tyres be removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Mr Pick said that he had directed the removal of the tyres and accused Mr Van Efferen of "having a go" at him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The second incident occurred when a power pack that supplied power to the winches on the barge broke down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The winches were used to operate the anchors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">As a result, the anchors could not be used and the barge could not properly be stabilised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">New parts had been ordered to repair the winches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Before they arrived Mr Pick ordered the Barge Master to use the barge to perform demolition works at the wharf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Barge Master remonstrated with Mr Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">While he was doing so Mr Van Efferen arrived on the scene.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Mr Pick told Mr Van Efferen that he wanted to use the barge to perform demolition works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Mr Van Efferen asked Mr Pick what he would do about the winches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Mr Pick replied that he would bring the barge down to the wharf and secure it to a structure with rope so that it would remain stable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">Mr Van Efferen told Mr Pick that this plan would not work and that, once the demolition started the barge would start moving because the ropes would not be strong enough to hold the barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Mr Pick angrily disagreed and insisted that the barge be used as he had directed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Barge Master and Mr Van Efferen agreed to act as directed by Mr Pick despite their misgivings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Mr Van Efferen directed the Barge Master to put out a static anchor which would secure the barge in the event that the ropes broke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Within 10 minutes of them being secured the ropes did, in fact, break.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The barge started to drift out from the wharf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Had it not been for the static anchor the barge would have collided with a John Holland barge which was located nearby.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The movement of the barge caused an excavator machine on it to swing and smash into a pre-cut concrete block on piles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">As a result of these events the job was stopped for the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">During this period Mr Van Efferen attended project meetings which were conducted by John Holland managers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In the course of those "toolbox" meetings Mr Van Efferen, from time to time, raised concerns about the proposed timing of certain work which he felt did not allow CMA sufficient time to conduct its barge movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">He drew attention to what he saw as safety issues relating to the barge movements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There was no evidence that John Holland objected to Mr Van Efferen expressing these opinions or as to the manner in which he spoke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In early to mid October 2006 Mr Pick approached Mr Van Efferen in the car park at the Port Hedland site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Mr Pick said words to the effect that he did not think that it was working out well between him and Mr Van Efferen and that he would get Mr Van Efferen a ticket home.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Mr Van Efferen correctly understood this to be a statement that Mr Pick wanted him to leave the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Mr Van Efferen said that, while it was Mr Pick's right to do this, he did not understand why Mr Pick would wish to have him removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Mr Pick did not respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At no stage then or subsequently did Mr Pick give any specific details to Mr Van Efferen as to why it was he wished Mr Van Efferen to leave the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">No one else from CMA advised Mr Van Efferen of the reason why Mr Pick considered that he and Mr Van Efferen could not work together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Mr Van Efferen returned to CMA's Geelong site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Once there he was directed to perform general maintenance duties on a barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">He was contacted by Mr Clarke by telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Mr Clarke asked him what had happened at the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He told Mr Clarke that Mr Pick had no marine experience and had been giving instructions to employees to do things that, on occasion, were dangerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Mr Van Efferen told Mr Clarke that he had informed Mr Pick of this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Mr Clarke then said that he would see what he could do about it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Mr Van Efferen suggested to Mr Clarke that Mr Clarke investigate what had happened by speaking to other employees at the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Although Mr Clarke agreed to do this he never advised Mr Van Efferen that he had done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Towards the end of October 2006 Mr Michael telephoned Mr Van Efferen at Geelong and told him that he (Mr Michael) was coming to Geelong and wanted to meet him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">They met on 27 October 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Michael advised Mr Van Efferen that it was necessary for CMA to cut costs and then said that "you're the first and probably not the last".</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Mr Van Efferen understood this to mean that he had been dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This was confirmed by a letter dated 31 October 2006 from Mr Bruce Nix, the Employment Relations Manager of CMA to Mr Van Efferen in which he advised that Mr Van Efferen's employment had been terminated because of "lack of available work your specialised field of work" (sic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">THE CONTROVERSIAL EVIDENCE 
 The principal areas of dispute between the parties relate to the circumstances in which Mr Van Efferen was removed from the Dolphin Project and was subsequently declared to be redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">CMA's case was that Mr Van Efferen was removed at the insistence of John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Had he not been removed John Holland would have terminated its contract with CMA or not provided CMA with further work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Once Mr Van Efferen had been removed from the Dolphin Project and had returned to Geelong there was no other work to which he could be assigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">At the time at which he was removed from Project Dolphin CMA had pending two other tenders for marine demolition work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">By mid October CMA was aware that it had not been successful in these tenders and it could not afford to employ Mr Van Efferen on purely maintenance work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">His employment was terminated because he had become redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mr Van Efferen on the other hand, maintained that there was no justification for his removal from the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">He contended that his disputes with Mr Pick related to matters of health and safety and that Mr Pick resented his interventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Mr Pick had persuaded Mr Clarke to remove Mr Van Efferen from the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">There had been no complaint by John Holland about Mr Van Efferen's work performance or any demand by John Holland that he be removed from the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">CMA's principal witness was Mr Clarke.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Mr Clarke deposed, in his first affidavit, that "around October 2006 formal verbal complaints were made to [him] about Mr Van Efferen's conduct by [Mr Doyle], and informally by the Project Manager, Mr Simon Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">" Mr Clarke said that the complaints "were generally that Mr Van Efferen was argumentative, divisive and unco-operative and as a result the team's productivity and project performance was suffering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">" Mr Pick asked Mr Clarke to direct that Mr Van Efferen be removed from the project because Mr Van Efferen "was uncooperative and the client had requested his removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">" Mr Clarke said that he considered that it was necessary to remove Mr Van Efferen "in order to protect the business relationship with the client and to ensure the effective operation of the Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">" Mr Clarke telephoned Mr Van Efferen while Mr Van Efferen was still at Port Hedland and told him that Mr Pick and the client couldn't work with him "and therefore we can't keep you at Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">" Mr Van Efferen responded by raising examples of disagreements on marine issues with John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Mr Clarke said that whether Mr Van Efferen was right or wrong was not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">John Holland did not want him on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Following that discussion Mr Clarke spoke to Mr Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">He asked Mr Pick whether he (Mr Pick) was sure that he had not overreacted by asking that Mr Van Efferen be removed from the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">After speaking to Mr Pick Mr Clarke said that he considered that the decision to remove Mr Van Efferen was correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">In a later affidavit Mr Clarke deposed that, following Mr Van Efferen's return to the project in late September 2006, he had telephone conversations with Mr Doyle about the performance of work at Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">He attributed to Mr Doyle a complaint that CMA marine staff were causing delays on the project and that: "[y]our marine supervisor is uncooperative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">" Mr Clarke also said that Mr Pick had complained to him about Mr Van Efferen on a number of occasions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In October Mr Pick told Mr Clarke that Mr Van Efferen "argues with John Holland and he argues with me".</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Mr Pick asked Mr Clarke to remove Mr Van Efferen from the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Clarke then said: 
 "I did not agree with John Holland's request for Mr Van Efferen to leave the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">My view was that John Holland was behind schedule in their own work and were not managing their own logistics efficiently and that CMA's management of marine activities was not the sole source of the problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">However if he was not removed John Holland could have exercised its contractual right to direct CMA to remove Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">" (Emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">
 Under cross-examination Mr Clarke said, for the first time, that he had had a direct request from John Holland to remove Mr Van Efferen from the site within days of Mr Van Efferen's return to Port Hedland in late September 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The following exchanges took place between counsel for Mr Van Efferen and Mr Clarke: 
 "Do you have any explanation why it [the September request] has been omitted from your two affidavits?</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">---Well, you know, I said in the affidavits that there were complaints from the client about the competency of the staff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">I had discussions with the project manager at the time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The project manger at the time believed that Mr Van Efferen needed to be removed from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">

 
 That's your explanation for the omission?</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">---I thought it was reasonably clear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">

 
 So you are saying that in September, you stood up to John Holland and said, "No, I'm not going to remove him from the site"?---Yes, and did it subsequently, on at least one other occasion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">

 
 I see.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">You simply want to distance yourself from the fact that the source of Mr Van Efferen's removal from the site was Mr Pick's gripe of Mr Van Efferen's behaviour, don't you?</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">That's why you raised this idea of John Holland?---No, I think John Holland, in correspondence, had pointed that out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">

 
 Oh, you've got correspondence?---Yes, I think it's attached to the affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Not specifically to Mr Van Efferen, but the fact that they had complaints about the marine supervision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">They did remind us it was a serious matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">" 
 In the course of further questioning it emerged that the correspondence to which Mr Clarke was referring was Mr Doyle's letter to Mr Clarke dated 21 September 2006 and Mr Clarke's response dated 26 September 2006: see above at [6]-[9].</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">At the time at which the correspondence occurred Mr Van Efferen had not been on the Project Dolphin site for over a month.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">John Holland directed no complaint against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">Mr Clarke responded by advising John Holland that CMA would seek to remedy the acknowledged deficiencies in the performance of its staff by sending Mr Van Efferen to Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It is highly unlikely that he would have done this had Mr Doyle or some other representative of John Holland criticised Mr Van Efferen's work performance and demanded his removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It is also most unlikely that Mr Doyle would have sought the removal of Mr Van Efferen a matter of days after Mr Van Efferen had returned to Port Hedland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Even on Mr Clarke's own evidence he had only received the most general complaints from John Holland as to Mr Van Efferen's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Most of the statements about Mr Van Efferen's performance to which Mr Clarke referred in his affidavits had been conveyed to him second hand by Mr Pick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">They led Mr Clarke to believe that John Holland's dissatisfaction with Mr Van Efferen "could" lead John Holland to make a written request for Mr Van Efferen's removal and a fracturing of the relationship between CMA and John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Mr Clarke's evidence on this crucial issue was unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">The exchange which I have quoted (above at [21]) strongly suggests that Mr Clarke was straining to justify his decision to remove Mr Van Efferen from the Dolphin Project by reference to complaints and demands made by John Holland when, in fact, those entreaties were coming from Mr Pick with whom Mr Van Efferen had fallen out over incidents such as the holing of the barge and the failed attempt to secure it by the use of ineffective ropes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The evidence satisfies me that Mr Pick was the source of the complaints against Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">It was Mr Pick who suggested that Mr Van Efferen was argumentative, divisive and uncooperative to the point where CMA's productivity and performance on the project were suffering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">This is the type of comment one would expect to have been made by a CMA manager rather than a John Holland representative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">It was Mr Pick who told Mr Clarke that John Holland was dissatisfied with Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">It was Mr Pick who asked Mr Clarke to remove Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">Mr Clarke accepted Mr Pick's criticisms of Mr Van Efferen and agreed to Mr Pick's request that Mr Van Efferen be removed from the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">I am fortified in reaching this conclusion by the fact that, despite acknowledging the importance of maintaining a written record of significant complaints against CMA staff by a client, CMA was unable to produce any written record of Mr Clarke (or anyone else) receiving any complaint (formal or otherwise) from John Holland about Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Neither Mr Doyle nor Mr Pick was called to give evidence to support Mr Clarke's account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 
 Mr Van Efferen submitted that CMA breached clause 2.10 of the AWA thereby causing him loss and damage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">He contended that he is entitled to recover that loss and damage pursuant to s 721 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act").</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">CMA contended that the grievance procedure had no application in the circumstances which led to Mr Van Efferen being removed from the Dolphin Project and that it had the right, under the AWA, to require him to move back to Geelong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The AWA was entitled "CMA Corporation Limited Maintenance Supervisor Australian Workplace Agreement 2006 - 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">" By clause 1.3 it provided that the AWA was to be read in conjunction with the Letter of Offer which was signed by Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Clause 1.5 provided that the agreement had a term of 3 years from the date on which it was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The objectives of the agreement were identified in clause 1.6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">They included: A positive relationship between CMA and its employees; A positive attitude and acceptance by all of their responsibility for health, safety and welfare; 
 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Effective working relations with all clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">By clause 2.1(a) it was provided that:
 
 "... 

 
 The Employee must perform all work and follow all instructions CMA reasonably requires of them (sic), provided they are within the limits of the Employee's skills, competence, training, qualifications, classification and statutory requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">

 
 The Employee must perform work at any location as CMA shall from time to time reasonably require.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">

 
 The Employee must work in a safe manner at all times recognising that the lack of safe work practices impact on other CMA employees, sub contractor (sic), client employees and others.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">

 
 ... 

 
 The Employee must comply with the Avoidance of Disputes Grievance procedure provided for in this Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">

 
 The Employee must comply with all client and Site or Project terms and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">

 
 The Employee must comply with all CMA Policies, Procedures and Code of Conduct, as amended from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">

 
 The Employee must comply with Site or Project Policies, Procedures and Codes of Conduct as amended from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">" 
 Clause 2.1(b) provided that the agreement could be terminated by either party on the giving of prescribed periods of notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">CMA could terminate the contract by paying wages in lieu of the prescribed notice period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Provision was also made for summary dismissal for serious misconduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Separate provision was made, in clause 2.7, for CMA to contribute to a redundancy trust fund from which payment was to be made in the event of an employee becoming redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">There was, however, no specific provision in the AWA that it could be terminated in the event that the employee had become redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The grievance procedure which Mr Van Efferen complains was breached by CMA is contained in clause 2.10 of the AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">It provides: 
 "GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

 
 CMA Grievance Procedure is designed to deal with CMA's concerns about the behaviour of its employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It operates as follows: 

 
 Step 1 In the first instance, the Manager and the Employee concerned will discuss the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

 
 Step 2 If the concern continues or another concern arises, the Manager will formally counsel the Employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">

 
 Step 3 If concern about the Employee continues, a more senior manager of CMA will formally warn the Employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">

 
 Step 4 If the concern continues the Employee's employment may be terminated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">

 
 If the concern is serious enough, the procedure need not begin at step 1, but at a higher step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">

 
 At steps 2 to 4, formal counselling and warnings will be in writing and will advise the Employee of the: 

 behaviour deemed to be unsatisfactory; action to be taken to correct the situation; consequence of continuing the unsatisfactory behaviour; assistance available to the Employee to help him or her meet the required performance; and a review date for reassessing progress in the Employee's performance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 The Employee will be given the opportunity to record his or her version of the situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">At any stage the Employee may have a representative present during any discussions.</sentence>

 Nothing in this clause affects the right of CMA to summarily dismiss the Employee for conduct justifying such action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">" 
 It was followed by another clause which enabled employees to raise their concerns with CMA and prescribed a procedure for dealing with such concerns.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">It is common ground that CMA made no attempt to give effect to clause 2.10 at any stage of its dealings with Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">As is often the case with industrial agreements drafted by non-lawyers, the language of the AWA lacks the precision one would expect to find in a commercial contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The looseness of the language of clause 2.10 has made it possible for the parties to advance radically different submissions as to its proper construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Mr Van Efferen contended that clause 2.10 imposed a mandatory obligation on CMA to observe the staged process prescribed by the clause once it had developed a concern about his conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">CMA, on the other hand, submitted that the occasion to apply the prescribed procedures only arose once CMA had decided to take disciplinary action against an employee by reason of its concerns about the employee's behaviour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">Even then, CMA was disposed initially to argue that the clause imposed no mandatory obligation on CMA to apply the procedures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In dealing with the construction of awards in Kucks v CSR Limited (1996) 66 IR 182 at 184 Madgwick J observed that: 
 "It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Thus, for example, it is justifiable to read the award to give effect to its evident purposes, having regard to such context, despite mere inconsistencies or infelicities of expression which might tend to some other reading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">And meanings which avoid inconvenience or injustice may reasonably be strained for.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand.</sentence>

 This passage was quoted with approval by two members of the High Court in Amcor Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] HCA 10 ; (2005) 222 CLR 241 at 271 (Kirby J), 282-3 (Callinan J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">In Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd (1998) 80 IR 208 at 212 Northrop J expressly agreed with this statement of principles and held that it had even stronger application to certified agreements than it did to awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">In my view, these principles have application to the construction of Australian workplace agreements and, in particular, to provisions, like clause 2.10, which are expressed to apply generally to all employees of the employer (although, of course, only binding on the employer and the employee party to the particular agreement).</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Guidance as to the construction of industrial instruments may also be obtained by reference to principles which courts apply to the construction of commercial contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">Commercial contracts should, as Kirby J held in Pan Foods Company Importers &amp; Distributors Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2000] HCA 20 ; (2000) 170 ALR 579 at 584 "be construed practically, so as to give effect to their presumed commercial purposes and so as not to defeat the achievement of such purposes by an excessively narrow and artificially restricted construction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">" An interpretation which accords with business common sense will be preferred to one which does not: see Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd [1968] HCA 8 ; (1968) 118 CLR 429 at 437.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In determining whether a commercial document imposes contractual obligations regard is had to the intention of the parties: would a reasonable person conclude that the person making the alleged binding promise intend to be contractually bound by that promise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">In Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 the High Court summarised the position as follows: 
 "It is not the subjective beliefs or understanding of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe ... That, normally requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">" 
 Clause 2.10 is, as it says, designed to deal with "concerns" which CMA may, from time to time have about the behaviour of its employees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Those concerns may arise from some innocent act of the employee which leads CMA mistakenly to believe that some misconduct has occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">At the other end of the spectrum concern may be raised by blatant misconduct which occurs in the presence of a supervisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">Between these extremes fall many forms of conduct which have the potential to give rise to concern on the part of the employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">They include matters such as unapproved absences from duty, the failure to meet production targets, the performance of work in a manner which might compromise the health and safety of other employees, failure to contribute as part of a team and many more possibilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Clause 2.10 is intended to deal with all such situations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Step 1 would, for example, be of use where CMA suspected that an employee had engaged in some misconduct but was not sure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The discussion between the manager and the employee may set the manager's mind at rest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Step 1 might also be useful where an employee is thought not to be working productively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">If the issue is raised with the employee the employee may be able to offer a satisfactory explanation to CMA such as that his work is being impeded by some work-related injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">Serious misconduct such as abuse of a supervisor or actions which jeopardise the health and safety of other employees can be dealt with by immediate counselling under Step 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The subsequent steps ensure that the employee knows that he or she is on notice that any repetition will place his or her continued employment in jeopardy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Extreme misconduct may lead to summary dismissal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Clause 2.10 can be engaged even when CMA has not determined that disciplinary action against the employee is warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The prefatory words of the clause make no mention of disciplinary action and do not condition its application on a decision by CMA that disciplinary action is warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">The adoption of the term "grievance procedure" suggests that the clause was intended to have application to a wider range of "concerns" than those which have disciplinary implications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">This is made plain by a reading of the clause as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Its language confirms that it has application if CMA has a concern about an employee's behaviour and wishes to ascertain whether the employee has, in fact, done anything wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">CMA may also harbour concerns about behaviour which it is satisfied amounts to misconduct but, in respect of which, it considers it appropriate to do no more than draw the matter to the employee's attention and request or direct that the conduct not be repeated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">The word "grievance" is, of course, apt also to embrace CMA's reaction to conduct by an employee which CMA considers does or may warrant disciplinary action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">CMA argued that, even if clause 2.10 had potential application, in the circumstances of the present case CMA was under no obligation to observe its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">This was so, it was contended because the clause did not impose any contractual obligations on it unless and until it had determined to take disciplinary action against the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The terms in which industrial instruments are drafted often require a distinction to be drawn between aspirational and promissory statements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">In accordance with the objective theory of contract expounded in Toll , a provision in a document proffered by an employer, will be treated as promissory in nature if the hypothetical, reasonable, potential employee to whom the document is presented would have concluded that CMA intended to be contractually bound to follow the procedures, outlined in it if CMA developed any concerns about the behaviour of the employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Whether or not he or she would have so concluded will depend on a consideration of the terms of the clause, the surrounding circumstances known to the parties and the nature of the arrangement which is being entered into.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">In my view clause 2.10 does impose an obligation on CMA to proceed at least as far as step 1 in a case such as the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">The clause appears in a particular type of contract which is recognised and regulated by statute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is an agreement which is intended to govern the employment relationship of an employer and an employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">It provides a form of protection to an employee whose conduct has, for any reason, given the employer cause for concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">It is designed to ensure that the employee is informed of the nature of those concerns and has the opportunity to disabuse the employer or to have the opportunity (in most instances) of rectifying any shortcomings which have given rise to the employer's misgivings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Although the clause does not commence with a statement of obligation it provides that it will operate in a particular manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Then follows a series of sequential steps which set out what CMA's managers "will" do in prescribed circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">Prejudicial action will only be taken if the employee fails, when provided with the opportunity, to alleviate CMA's professed concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">A reasonable employee would rightly conclude that CMA was committing itself to implementing these protective measures if the need arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">That employee would not conclude that the benefit of clause 2.10 would be dependent on the favourable exercise of CMA's unfettered discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The making and operation of Australian workplace agreements was provided for in Division 4 of Part 8 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">Section 351(a) of the Act provided that such an agreement bound the employer party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">A reasonable person in the position of the employee who was invited to enter into such an agreement would, therefore, rightly assume that terms which said that the employer would, in prescribed circumstances, take certain action would require the employer to take such action if those circumstances arose in the course of the employer/employee relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">CMA contended that, if clause 2.10 were to be construed as imposing mandatory obligations on it whenever it had a concern about the behaviour of an employee, no matter how trivial that concern was, this would lead to absurd results: its managers would be forced to waste a large amount of their time in pointlessly working their way through the various steps whenever some minor concern arose in respect of any employee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">This sensitivity is misplaced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">The clause must be read and applied in a sensible and practical manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The type of "concerns" to which it applies will only arise when the employee exhibits some type of behaviour which causes CMA anxiety as to the impact of that behaviour on some aspect of its operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">A trivial concern about the employee occasionally arriving a minute or two late for work would not, for example, invoke clause 2.10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">Even if it did the matter could be resolved by a short discussion under step 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">No commercial absurdity arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">In the alternative, CMA argued that it was not obliged to observe clause 2.10 because it did not have a concern about Mr Van Efferen's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The relevant concern was that of John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Once CMA became aware that John Holland considered that Mr Van Efferen was unco-operative and was impeding progress on the wharf project it had merely exercised its contractual rights to require him to work elsewhere, thereby pre-empting a formal written demand by John Holland that he be removed from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">This aspect of CMA's defence must fail because, as I have already held, it was Mr Pick and Mr Clarke, both senior managers of CMA, not John Holland, who were dissatisfied with the manner in which Mr Van Efferen was performing his duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Mr Pick and/or Mr Clarke should have taken these matters up with Mr Van Efferen before he was required to leave the site and return to Geelong where there was no certainty that any ongoing work was available for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The fact that CMA had the right, under clause 2.1 of the agreement to nominate an alternative location at which Mr Van Efferen was to "perform work" did not mean it could avoid its obligations under clause 2.10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">In any event, he was not sent to the Geelong site to perform work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">He was sent there because CMA perceived it to be a convenient alternative to Port Hedland and struggled to find anything useful for him to do once he was in Geelong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">At best it was a holding operation pending CMA discovering whether or not it had been successful in obtaining work on a new project to which Mr Van Efferen might be deployed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">CAUSATION 
 Mr Van Efferen's first cause of action is founded on s 721 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Section 721(1) provided that: 
 "A party to an AWA who suffers loss or damage as a result of a breach of the AWA by the other party may recover the amount of the loss or damage in an eligible court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">" 

It is, therefore, necessary for Mr Van Efferen to show that CMA's breach of clause 2.10 was the proximate cause of the loss and damage which he seeks to recover: cf S &amp; Y Investments (No 2) Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd [1986] NTSC 61 ; (1986) 85 FLR 285 at 291-294.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">Whether the breach was a proximate cause of Mr Van Efferen's loss and damage is a question of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">CMA argued that, even if it had concerns about Mr Van Efferen's conduct and it was obliged to give effect to clause 2.10, there was no causal link between its failure to observe the requirements of clause 2.10 and the loss and damage suffered by Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">CMA submitted that the causal link between the breach and damage had been or would have been broken by a series of anticipated events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">They were: As I have already held, there is no evidence to support the contention that John Holland was dissatisfied with Mr Van Efferen's performance of his duties and no complaint was made by John Holland to CMA about Mr Van Efferen's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">There was, therefore, no reason to expect that John Holland would have required CMA to have removed him from the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">On the contrary, Mr Van Efferen's professional expertise and his attention to matters of safety would have made it likely that John Holland would have wished to retain his services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">It was, for example, Mr Pick's decision to secure a barge by ropes rather than anchors which nearly led to a collision between the CMA barge and a barge owned by John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">Mr Van Efferen had cautioned against the use of ropes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The suggestion that any counselling, conducted by CMA under clause 2.10, would have been ineffective in changing Mr Van Efferen's approach to his duties must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">The proposition assumes that there were some shortcomings on the part of Mr Van Efferen which would have attracted adverse attention by John Holland and assumes that CMA's professed concerns were warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">They were not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">Mr Van Efferen performed his duties in a professional manner which did not attract the adverse attention of John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">His dispute with Mr Michael in August 2006 about the removal of spud poles arose from his concern about the effect this change would have on the stability of the barge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">Mr Van Efferen's insistence on the maintenance of proper safety regimes stands in stark contrast with Mr Pick's willingness to take risks in order to get on with the job.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">It is highly unlikely that John Holland would have found fault with Mr Van Efferen in relation to such issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The evidence does not support CMA's contention that Mr Van Efferen would have been unlikely to respond positively to counselling had it invoked clause 2.10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">I do not consider it likely that Mr Van Efferen would have failed to heed CMA's wishes in relation to his future conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">He enjoyed the work he was doing and the material benefits which he received for doing it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">He wished to continue doing this work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">No comparable positions were available elsewhere within the CMA organisation or, apparently, elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">It is also to be borne in mind that, although Mr Van Efferen objected to certain decisions made by Mr Michael and Mr Pick and voiced his concerns about them, he nonetheless, complied with the decisions when Mr Michael and Mr Pick insisted that they be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">This is not the response of a person who is prone to ignoring the wishes of his supervisors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">After Mr Van Efferen had been removed from the project CMA did make some changes to its management structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">These changes did not, however, render the position which he formerly held redundant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">He was replaced by Mr Steven Marks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">There was a continued need for someone with marine experience to perform the duties which Mr Van Efferen had undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Mr Marks was appointed to take over the role previously performed by Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">He was designated the Marine Operations Supervisor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">He remained on the project in this role until December 2007, a few months before the project was completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">There is, then, no foundation for CMA's assertion that the marine supervisor's position became redundant shortly after Mr Van Efferen was removed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Had CMA been successful in tendering for other marine projects during the life of the Dolphin Project it is possible that it might have determined to transfer Mr Van Efferen to one of those other projects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">In the event CMA did not secure any other marine project during the life of the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">There was, as a result, no alternative project on which Mr Van Efferen might have been engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">He was, in fact, ultimately dismissed because CMA had no alternative work to offer him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">There is reason to expect that, had Mr Van Efferen not been removed from the Dolphin Project, he would have continued to perform his duties on that project at an objectively acceptable standard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">There was a need for CMA to have somebody with marine experience on the site throughout the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">CMA had few employees with such experience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">It presented Mr Van Efferen to John Holland as "an experienced marine supervisor" who would rectify problems identified by John Holland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">Mr Clarke considered that Mr Van Efferen was performing his duties satisfactorily and did not accept that complaints which Mr Pick attributed to John Holland had substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">It was not suggested to Mr Van Efferen that it was likely that he would have resigned and gone elsewhere prior to the completion of the project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">The evidence satisfies me that, had Mr Pick not urged Mr Clarke to remove Mr Van Efferen from the project and had Mr Clarke not yielded to Mr Pick's demands, Mr Van Efferen would have continued to perform the duties of marine supervisor until the project was completed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">Mr Pick clearly resented Mr Van Efferen's periodic objections to instructions given by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">He particularly objected to Mr Van Efferen querying his instructions where third parties, such as the barge master, were involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The problem was compounded when subsequent events demonstrated that Mr Van Efferen's objections were warranted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">From Mr Pick's perspective Mr Van Efferen's querying of his (Mr Pick's) instructions demonstrated that Mr Van Efferen was an uncooperative and argumentative employee whose actions undermined Mr Pick's authority as project manager on the site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">In these circumstances, Mr Pick was obliged, by clause 2.10 (step 1) to discuss his concerns with Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">He did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Had the discussion resolved the issues raised by Mr Pick that would have been an end to the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">Had Mr Van Efferen continued to question Mr Pick's decisions and had Mr Pick been concerned about this he would have been required, under step 2, formally to counsel Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">If Mr Van Efferen had, thereafter, desisted, matters would have rested there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">If not then a more senior manager, presumably Mr Clarke, would have been required, by step 3, to consider the matter and, if so minded, formally warn Mr Van Efferen that his employment would be in jeopardy if his impugned conduct continued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">At each stage in the process it would have been necessary for the CMA representative to articulate his concerns about Mr Van Efferen's conduct and to give Mr Van Efferen the opportunity of explaining why he had acted in a particular way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">Had the process continued as far as step 3 he would have been able to explain to a manager, more senior to Mr Pick, why he had objected to particular instructions given by Mr Pick and the senior manager may well have concluded that subsequent events had vindicated Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">It is clear that such a process would have taken some time and would not, inevitably, have led to the termination of Mr Van Efferen's employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The process would have taken longer than the few weeks which elapsed between Mr Van Efferen's removal from Port Hedland and the termination of his employment when he was in Geelong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">At the time at which he was directed to leave Port Hedland Mr Clarke well knew that there was no gainful employment for Mr Van Efferen in Geelong and that CMA's capacity to offer further work to him depended on it being successful in obtaining certain tenders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">When it failed to obtain those tenders it had no gainful work to offer Mr Van Efferen and it terminated his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Mr Van Efferen's AWA was expressed to be operative for a period of three years from the date on which it was lodged with the Office of the Employment Advocate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">The contract was terminable for serious misconduct which warranted summary dismissal and otherwise by the giving of prescribed periods of notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">Had CMA not breached clause 2.10 the contract would not have been terminated and Mr Van Efferen would have continued working at Port Hedland until the completion of the Dolphin project in April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">The breach of clause 2.10 was a proximate cause of Mr Van Efferen's loss of the salary and other benefits to which he was entitled as the marine supervisor for CMA on the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">DAMAGES 
 Although s 721(1) of the Act provides that a person who suffers loss or damage as a result of a breach of an AWA may recover that loss or damage in curial proceedings, the provision is silent as to the basis on which such loss and damage should be calculated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">Mr Van Efferen submits that, because AWAs are statutory contracts, damages should be calculated as they would be in respect of any breach of contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">The applicant should be placed in the same situation, as far as money may do it, as if the contract had been performed: Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 80 (Mason CJ and Dawson J), 98-9 (Brennan J), 116 (Deane J) and 148 (Gaudron J).</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">In appropriate cases damages could be calculated by reference to what the applicant was entitled to expect by way of performance by the respondent and the losses incurred when the respondent failed to comply with its contractual obligations: Amann Aviation , at 91-2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">Where an employer wrongfully terminates an employment contract which has a fixed term, thereby causing damage to an employee, damages are normally calculated on the basis that the employee would have enjoyed the benefits of the contract for the remainder of its term: see Kilburn v Enzed Precision Products Pty Ltd (1988) 4 VIR 31 at 33; Patterson v Middle Harbour Yacht Club (1996) 64 FCR 405 at 406; Martin v Tasmanian Development and Resources (1999) 89 IR 98 at 120-1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">The employee is under an obligation to mitigate his loss by seeking to obtain alternative remunerative employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">Although the AWA had a three year term, Mr Van Efferen only sought damages until CMA's work on the Dolphin Project ceased.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">Mr Van Efferen submitted that, had CMA complied with clause 2.10, he would not have been removed from the Dolphin Project and would have continued to perform his duties as marine supervisor until the project was completed on 15 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">He submitted that damages should be assessed by reference to what he would have earned during this period, less the amount which he had earned since the termination of his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">Alternatively, Mr Van Efferen contended that the same measure of damages should be awarded if a "loss of expectation" or "loss of chance" analysis of the kind deployed in Amann Aviation was applied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">CMA's argument on damages seemed to proceed on the assumption that compensatory damages were not available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">It resisted the "loss of chance" claim on the basis that Mr Van Efferen did not have a contract for a specific term and that no question of the possibility of renewal of the contract arose: see McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 168 IR 375 at 397-8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">In this context it relied on the arguments, outlined above at [52] which, it contended, supported the view that there was no causal nexus between any contravention of clause 2.10 and the damage alleged by Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">Mr Van Efferen gave evidence about his attempts to obtain alternative employment between October 2006 and April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s358">He had found it impossible to obtain maritime work but had been prepared to take whatever work he could get.</sentence>
<sentence id="s359">He was able to obtain some short term employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">His evidence was not seriously challenged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">I accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">CMA has failed to discharge the onus which fell on it to prove that Mr Van Efferen failed to mitigate his loss: see: Watts v Rake [1960] HCA 58 ; (1960) 108 CLR 158.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">There is no reason, in my opinion, why Mr Van Efferen's damages should not be assessed on the normal contractual basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">He had a contract for a three year term which did not expire until mid-2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s365">He confines his claim to the period of the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s366">The amount Mr Van Efferen would have earned during the life of the project would have been $313,007.47 in salary plus $14,284 in superannuation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s367">This is a total of $327,291.47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s368">From this figure must be deducted the amount which Mr Van Efferen earned in alternative employment during the relevant period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s369">That figure was $22,525.94.</sentence>
<sentence id="s370">His loss was, therefore, $304,765.53.</sentence>
<sentence id="s371">The calculations which lay behind these figures were explained by Mr Van Efferen and were not challenged by CMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s372">When Mr Van Efferen's contract of employment was terminated CMA paid him $12,976.98 being redundancy payments and other accrued entitlements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s373">He submitted that this sum ought not to be subtracted from the damages to which he claimed to be entitled because of the likelihood that he would have been made redundant by CMA after completion of the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s374">I accept this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s375">For the reasons already given, I consider that, but for the contravention of clause 2.10 by CMA, Mr Van Efferen was likely to have remained in his position at Port Hedland until the completion of the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s376">Given the lack of alternative employment prospects in his specialist field, I consider that there was only a remote chance that Mr Van Efferen would have terminated the contact before 15 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s377">Given the shortage of people who had the same level of experience as Mr Van Efferen I consider there was only a slight chance that CMA would have taken the initiative and terminated the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s378">I consider it appropriate to allow a discount of 10% to deal with the contingency that the contract might have validly been terminated prior to April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s379">Subject to some further matters with which I will deal later in these reasons damages of $274,288.00 should be awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s380">The award of compensatory damages for breach of contract protects the expectation interest of the innocent party: Amann Aviation at 80.</sentence>
<sentence id="s381">That expectation is that the contract would be performed according to its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s382">Mr Van Efferen sought to characterise the present case as one involving a "loss of chance" because he had lost the opportunity to obtain benefits which would have resulted from his continued employment with CMA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s383">These submissions led to what I regard as an unprofitable debate about whether damages could and should be awarded in the present case on the alternative basis of a "loss of chance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s384">In Amann Aviation , the plaintiff obtained damages against the Commonwealth for breach of a three year contract under which the plaintiff was to provide aerial coastal surveillance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s385">Damages were awarded on the conventional basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s386">Additional damages were also awarded to compensate the plaintiff for a loss of opportunity to obtain a further contract after the repudiated contract had run its term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s387">The plaintiff succeeded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s388">The court considered that there was "a strong prospect of renewal" (at 94): it would have had the benefit of three years experience and any competitor would effectively have been starting from scratch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s389">It was this latter award of damages that attracted the terms "loss of a chance" or "lost opportunity".</sentence>
<sentence id="s390">Full Courts of this Court have applied the "loss of a chance" approach to the assessment of damages for breaches of employment contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">In Tasmania Development and Resources v Martin [1999] FCA 593 ; (2000) 97 IR 66 the Full Court upheld the trial judge's decision to award damages to reflect the applicant's loss of the prospect that his contract would be renewed even though he had no legal right to renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">The applicant was employed by a statutory authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">He was employed on a three year contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">After about 18 months his employment was terminated on the grounds of redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">The trial judge found that the contract had been terminated by the statutory authority in breach of a provision which required that there be consultation between employer and employee before an employee was terminated for redundancy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">The trial judge held that, had the contract not been wrongly terminated, the employee would have enjoyed its benefits for the remainder of the three year term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">He allowed damages for that period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">He also allowed a further sum to compensate the employee for loss of the chance of obtaining a fresh contract at the end of the term of the existing contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">In Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 101 ; (2006) 233 ALR 687 it was held that damages could be assessed on a "loss of a chance" basis where a contract of employment had been repudiated before the applicant had commenced to perform duties under it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">The Full Court considered that, on the evidence, had Mr Walker been permitted to commence work under the contract, it was to be expected that he would not have left his employment voluntarily or for cause within a five year period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Damages were assessed on this basis with a 25% discount applied to take account of the possibility that the contract might have been terminated during the five year period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">More recently, in McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 168 IR 375 Buchanan J cautioned that the award of damages for "loss of a chance" could not occur, consistently with Amann Aviation , in the absence of a fixed term contract and evidence supporting the possibility that the contract might be renewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">In the present case Mr Van Efferen did not seek to suggest that his AWA was likely to be renewed by CMA once it expired.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">He did not claim any monetary loss on the ground that he had an expectation of renewal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">There is, therefore, no occasion to consider an award of damages to Mr Van Efferen for such a lost opportunity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">The lost opportunity to which he referred in his submissions appears, on analysis, to be no more than the frustration of his expectation that he would continue working, under his existing contract, at least until the completion of the Dolphin Project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">IMPLIED TERMS 
 The second cause of action pleaded by Mr Van Efferen alleged breach, by CMA, of implied terms in his contract of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">Those implied terms were that: The question of whether or not such terms may be implied in contracts of employment is one of some controversy on which the High Court has yet to make a definitive pronouncement: see Riley, J, "The Boundaries of Mutual Trust and Good Faith" (2009) 22 Australian Journal of Labour Law 73; Riley, J, "Mutual Trust and Good Faith: Can Private Contract Law Guarantee Fair Dealing in the Workplace" (2003) 16 Australian Journal of Labour Law 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">Given my findings in relation to the breach of clause 2.10 it is not necessary that I embark on a detailed examination of this alternative basis of Mr Van Efferen's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">I would, however, venture some short observations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">Mr Van Efferen submitted that the terms ought to be implied, not in the AWA to which he was a party, but in the common law contract of employment which was evidenced by his acceptance of the letter of offer dated 27 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">That letter recorded very few terms of the contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">It dealt mainly with the protection of CMA's intellectual property and its commercial secrets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">It was to be read in conjunction with the AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">In Russell Rothman J held that both terms should be implied in contracts of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">In that case they did not avail the employee because, although they had been breached, the plaintiff had suffered no damage by reason of the breaches.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">On appeal, the New South Wales Court of Appeal went no further than holding that such terms may be implied in contracts of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">Basten JA was (at [2008] NSWCA 217 ; (2008) 176 IR 82 [32]) inclined to treat the two implied terms as a single obligation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">He considered (at [33]) that there was uncertainty as to the "scope and extent of the implied duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">" Campbell JA was prepared to assume, without deciding, that an employer owed implied contractual obligations of the kind relied on by Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">Giles JA (at [1]) was also prepared to assume rather than determine that such implied terms were incorporated in contracts of employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">In this Court single judges have adopted a more guarded approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">In McDonald (at 398-400) Buchanan J reviewed the authorities relating to the mutual trust and confidence term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">He expressed disquiet about the notion that such a term could have escaped judicial notice for so long.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">More significantly he queried whether such a term could be implied consistently with the principles expounded by the High Court in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">I respectfully share his Honour's reservations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">In Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1678 ; (2005) 226 ALR 114 at 156-157 Kenny J held that, in Australia, a term of good faith "does not apply to employment contracts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">" On appeal the Full Court did not need to express a view on her Honour's finding: see Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 101 ; (2006) 233 ALR 687 at 708 [86] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">As a single judge I would follow the decisions of other single judges unless I considered them to be clearly wrong: see Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">Although Buchanan J's observations in McDonald were obiter I nonetheless consider them to be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">Kenny J's ruling in Walker forms part of the ratio of her decision in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">I do not consider either decision to be clearly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">Had it been necessary I would have followed them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">In any event, in the circumstances in the present case, it is, at best for Mr Van Efferen, doubtful that the two implied terms add anything to CMA's contractual obligations having regard to the protective procedures incorporated expressly in clause 2.10 of the AWA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">CMA was obliged to act in good faith in applying clause 2.10: cf Tasmania Development and Resources v Martin [1999] FCA 593 ; (2000) 97 IR 66 at 72.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">Had it done so no breach would have occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">CONCLUSION 
 Judgment will be entered for Mr Van Efferen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">No detailed submissions were advanced relating to the precise terms of the orders which should be made were Mr Van Efferen to be successful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">In particular no attention was directed as to the taxation implications of any order which the Court might be minded to make in Mr Van Efferen's favour: see Martin v Tasmania Development and Resources (1999) 89 IR 98 at 121-122.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">It is also necessary to consider whether any specific provision should be made in the court's order to deal with Mr Van Efferen's entitlement to interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">I will, therefore, direct that the parties file and serve minutes of orders which will give effect to these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">I certify that the preceding eighty-eight (88) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
