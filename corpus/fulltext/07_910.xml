<sentences>
<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision, made personally by the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 17 October 2006, in which she refused to grant a visa to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Minister's decision was made pursuant to s 501(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Jurisdiction to review the decision is conferred on the Court by s 476A(1)(c) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The circumstances in which the Minister came to make the decision are somewhat unusual.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They date back to September 1982 when the applicant, as a member of the Lebanese Phalange Militia entered the Sabra and Shatilla Palestinian Refugee Camp in West Beirut.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">A massacre of civilians ensued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant has, at various times, both admitted and denied that he participated in this massacre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">It is not necessary, for present purposes, to determine whether or not he killed civilians.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 In December 1993 the applicant came to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">In March 1994 he applied for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">His application was refused by a delegate of the Minister in August 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">He appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In August 1995 the Tribunal accepted that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution should he return to the Lebanon but held that he was not able to avail himself of the protection provided by the Refugee Convention by reason of the provisions in Articles 1F(a) and 1F(b) which excluded those involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity or in serious non political crimes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal's decision was based on findings that the applicant had taken part in the massacre in the refugee camps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 Over the next decade the applicant made a series of applications to the Minister, delegates of the Minister, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and this Court in order that he might be able to remain in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is not necessary to rehearse all of these applications or their outcomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 The genesis of the present application was the detention of the applicant, as an unlawful non citizen, on 22 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">A week later his migration agent lodged an application for a Child (residence) Class BT Visa on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was acknowledged that the applicant did not meet the relevant criteria and it was frankly conceded that the purpose of the application was to facilitate ministerial intervention pursuant to s 351 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">An application was also made for a Bridging Visa E. A delegate of the Minister refused the application for the Bridging Visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">This decision was then challenged in the Migration Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That Tribunal remitted the application to the department for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">While the reconsideration was pending the department issued a notice of intention to consider the refusal of his application under s 501(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The applicant was advised that:
 "In reaching a decision whether to refuse [the] visa the Minister or her delegate will also have regard to whether refusing his visa application and returning him to Lebanon would constitute a breach of Australia's international obligations under the Refugee Convention, the Convention Against Torture (CAT) or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is important that you specify in detail, any reason why you believe that Australia would be breaching its international obligations by returning [the applicant] to the Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">" 
 

This notice was given on 13 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">On 6 July 2006 the applicant's solicitors made detailed and lengthy submissions on his behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">One section of these submissions was devoted to Australia's international obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It was contended that:
 
 "Australia is subject to non refoulment obligations prohibiting the return of a person to a country where, as a necessary or foreseeable consequence of their removal or deportation from Australia, the person would face a real risk of violation of their rights under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) including the Article 6 right to life, Article 7 right to freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or the death penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Further, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment (CAT) places an absolute prohibition on refoulment on where there are "substantial grounds for believing (the person) would be in danger of being subject to torture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">" 
 
 It is submitted that there is a strong possibility that [the applicant] may well face persecution and/or torture if he is forced to return to Lebanon ... 
 
 ... 
 
 It is therefore submitted that there continues to be a "real chance" that [the applicant] will face persecution in Lebanon on the basis of his previous claims ..." 
 

(Emphasis in original).</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">This section of the written submission concluded with the observation that Australia "may breach its non refoulment obligations under the ICCR (sic) and the CAT should a decision be made to return [the applicant] to the Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">"
 
6 The applicant's written submissions were considered by officers of the department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">By letter dated 25 July 2006 addressed to the applicant's solicitors the applicant was advised:
 
 "Please find attached an assessment of Australia (sic) potential International Treaty Obligations in the case of your client ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">This assessment has been developed for consideration by the decision-maker in regard to your client (sic) application for a Bridging Visa E in connection with a dependant child application and is provided to you to facilitate any comments you wish to make in regard to the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">" 
 

The applicant was also invited to furnish any additional information which he might wish the decision-maker to consider.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">7 The attached assessment summarised the applicant's claims and then identified a series of relevant considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Those considerations were framed as questions and adjacent to each question was a box which enabled the author to answer the question either "yes", "no" or "refer to comments".</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Under the heading "Non Refoulment Obligations" questions 12, 13 and 14 read:
 
 "12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Is there any evidence that the person will be killed?</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 
 13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Is there any evidence that the person will be tortured?</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Is there any evidence that the person will face cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment?</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">" 
 

Each of the questions was answered "yes" and "refer to comments".</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The comments made in relation to these questions were:
 
 "Q12 
 Given the volatile nature of Lebanese politics, as well as the uncertainty created by recent Israeli military exercises in Lebanon, there is a risk that [the applicant] might be killed upon return to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">There is, however, no evidence to support his claims that he would be targeted by pro Syrian forces in Lebanon as a result of his past activities as a member of the Lebanese Forces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He has failed to provide evidence that he has been sufficiently high profile (sic) within the Lebanese Forces to attract that sort of attention upon return to Lebanon from forces subservient to Damascus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There is no evidence available to supports (sic) his claims that he would be targeted by Palestinians in Lebanon as a result of his participation in the Sabra and Shatilla massacres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 In general terms, while there has been harassment of members and supporters of the Lebanese Forces under previous pro Syrian governments in Lebanon, since the elections in 2005 there has been a lack of country information supporting claims of ongoing detention, torture or killing of such Lebanese citizens.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 Q13 &amp; 14 
 For the same reasons stated in response to Q12 there is no significant, current evidence that [the applicant] would face torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment if returned to Lebanon apart from country information which predates the outcome of the 2005 election.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">" 
 

8 Immediately after the comments the following passage appeared:
 
 "NON REFOULMENT OBLIGATIONS ASSESSMENT 
 
 CAT Are there substantial grounds for believing that the person will be in danger of being subjected to torture if returned to the Country of reference?</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">
 
 ICCPR Is there a real risk that the person will face a violation of their fundamental human rights under Article 6 or 7 of the ICCPR as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of return to the country of reference?</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">" 
 

Both of these questions were answered "no".</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The following comments followed:
 
 "While the violent and volatile nature of Lebanese politics since 1975 means that there will always be some risk of [the applicant] being targeted for killing or torture, the political situation in Lebanon as a result of the withdrawal of Syrian military forces and the outcome of the national elections in 2005 has substantially changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 
 The reduced incidence of political violence in Lebanese politics has significantly reduced the risk of [the applicant] facing violation of his fundamental rights under Article 6 (Right to Life) or Article 7 (Freedom of Torture and Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment) of the ICCPR if he returned to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 Similarly, there are not substantial grounds for believing that [the applicant] would face torture if returned to Lebanon given the lack of evidence in the form of Country Information that in the aftermath of the 2005 elections, members and supporters of the Lebanese Forces face torture, detention and imprisonment by the Lebanese Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 The current uncertainty in regard to the future stability of Lebanese politics giving the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and the potential for this conflict to spark a return of sectarian violence in Lebanon means that it is not possible to rule out the possibility that [the applicant] would be targeted for killing and/or torture as a result of his past, and potentially future, membership of the Lebanese Forces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">" 
 

9 The applicant's solicitors responded with a further lengthy and detailed submission in a letter dated 8 August 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The letter acknowledged receipt of the department's "preliminary assessment" and continued:
 
 "It is primarily submitted that there are substantial grounds for believing that [the applicant] faces a real risk of violation of his fundamental human rights, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... and the Convention Against Torture ..., should he be returned to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Any suggestion to the contrary in the Department's Assessment reflects a failure to appreciate the correct legal test as the factual findings made by the Department indicate that Australia's non refoulment obligations are engaged in [the applicant's] case notwithstanding a discrete, global conclusion of the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" 
 

Later in the letter attention was directed to what was meant by a "real risk" of harm within the meaning of the International Instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">It was submitted that:
 
 "International case law, including the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Soering v The United Kingdom ... has established that the obligation of non refoulment arises where there is a "real risk of exposure" to violation of the ICCPR right in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The European Court of Human Rights has identified the correct legal test to be applied in determining the obligations of State act as to be whether, 
 
 
 
 "Substantial grounds have shown for believing that the person concerned, if expelled, faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country" ... 
 
 
 
 The relevant risk is required to be "real", "foreseeable" and "personal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The meaning of "real" in this context is something more than "mere possibility of ill treatment" but need not amount to "certainty" ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In the CAT context, international bodies have found that the risk "must be assessed on grounds that go beyond mere theory or suspicion" but need not be "highly probable" ..." 
 

It was then submitted "that the Department's own preliminary assessment disclose[d] a level of recognised risk that satisfies the international law requirement that there be a risk that is greater than "mere possibility" but less than "certainty".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">" 
 
10 Following receipt of the solicitor's letter an issues paper was prepared by an officer of the department for consideration by the person who was to determine whether or not to refuse the applicant's visa application under s 501(1) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The issues paper summarised the initial assessment and the response to it by the applicant's solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In particular, it summarised the submissions relating to the proper construction of the "real risk" test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The issues paper continued:
 
 "[115] Departmental legal advice was sought on the issues raised by [the applicant's solicitors].</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">This advice indicates that [the applicant's] agents relied in their submissions on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) jurisprudence, to which Australia is not a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">It stated that whilst it is useful in interpreting similar obligations in instruments to which Australia is a party, it is "by no means determinative".</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">In addition, they did not see anything quoted by [the solicitors] from the ECHR as suggesting that the department had applied the test for refoulment incorrectly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 [116] The advice also refuted the interpretation by [the solicitors] of UNCAT's general comment Number one, and stated that there did not appear to be anything wrong in the way the department had applied the test for non refoulment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Based on this advice the department prepared a reassessment of Australia's International Treaty Obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 [117] That assessment clarifies the first by stating that there would be "remote possibility, of [the applicant] facing torture and/or death if returned to Lebanon and that it is not possible to rule out this possibility given the volatile nature of Lebanese politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The conclusion reached in the initial assessment was that there was a "possibility" of torture and/or death, there was no "real risk" of this given recent changes in Lebanon and therefore the refoulment obligation of the CAT and ICCPR are not invoked in regard to [the applicant] possible return to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">" 
 
 [118] The United Nations Human Rights Committee requires that violation of fundamental rights be a "necessary and foreseeable consequence" of an individual's removal when determining whether there is a "real risk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Department assessed that country information did not support the view that [the applicant] would face violation of his rights under Article 6 or 7 or the ICCPR as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of his removal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Nor did the Department accept that the recent political volatility in Lebanon make (sic) the risk any greater than prior to the conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">
 
 [119] The Departmental assessment also stated that [the applicant's] representatives have provided no evidence that he was anything other than a junior officer and in this context the threat of torture and or death to [the applicant] upon return to Lebanon remains "merely a possibility or remote risk"".</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 

11 On 4 October 2006 the then Minister declared that she reasonably suspected that the applicant did not pass the character test and that he had not satisfied her that he passed the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">She decided to exercise her discretion under s 501(1) of the Act to refuse his application for a Bridging Visa E and refused to grant the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">12 On 11 October 2006 the Minister published a statement of reasons for her decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Relevantly, the Minister dealt with Australia's international treaty obligations as follows:
 
 "[31] I gave particular consideration to the issue of [the applicant's] safety if he were removed to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">An International Treaties Obligation Assessment (ITOA) was undertaken in relation to [the applicant], which stated that while there was a remote possibility of the risk of torture and/or death if the applicant was to be returned, there was no real risk given the changes in Lebanon since the formation of the present elected government in July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 
 [32] I also took into account that the ITOA concluded that country information did not support the view that torture or death would be a "necessary and foreseeable consequence" of [the applicant's] removal from Australia, which is the test for risk set by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The assessment also concluded that the recent conflict in Lebanon would not make that risk any more likely than prior to the conflict.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 [33] In view of this I accept that returning [the applicant] to the Lebanon in the present circumstances would not contravene Australia's international obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">I gave this consideration moderate weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">" 
 

13 The Minister formed the view that the applicant participated in killing civilians during the 1982 massacre at the refugee camps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">She further found that he did not pass the character test because he was not of good character having regard to his past general conduct: see s 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Minister said that, in reaching her decision, she had "considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment against the character test as defined by s 501(6) of the Migration Act 1958, (2) Ministerial Direction 21 under s 499 of that Act and (3) all other evidence available to me, including evidence provided by, or on behalf of, the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">"
 THE LEGISLATION 
 
14 Section 501(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may refuse to grant a visa to a person if the person does not satisfy the Minister that he or she passes the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The character test is defined in s 501(6), it provides that a person does not pass the character test, inter alia, if the person is not of good character having regard to the person's past and present general conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">Section 499 of the Act empowers the Minister to give written directions to decision-makers about how they are to exercise discretionary powers under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Decision-makers are bound to comply with such directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Minister him or herself is not so bound when exercising powers personally: see Rocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 529 at 544 [57].</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Decisions made by a delegate of the Minister under s 501(1) are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; decisions made personally by the Minister are not: see s 500(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">THE TREATIES 
 
15 Article 4 of the CAT provides that:
 
 "No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">" 

16 Article 6 of the ICCPR provides that:
 
 "Every human being has the inherent right to life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">This right shall be protected by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">No one shall be arbitrately deprived of his life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">" 

17 Article 7 of the ICCPR provides that:
 
 "No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">" 
 THE APPLICANT'S CASE 
 
18 The applicant accepts that none of the relevant treaty obligations has been incorporated in Australian domestic law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">There is, therefore, no statutory obligation on the Minister or other decision-makers under the Act to give effect to those obligations when making decisions under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The applicant, however, argues that, because the Minister determined that she "would follow Direction No 21" and that she would take into account, as a relevant consideration, the question of whether the applicant could be returned to the Lebanon consistently with Australia's treaty obligations, she was obliged to have regard to the CAT and ICCPR, properly construed, when exercising the discretion conferred on her by s 501(1) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The applicant contends that the Minister made two errors in dealing with the treaties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">They were that:
 
 &#8226; She applied the "necessary and foreseeable" test when deciding whether a "real risk" of harm would confront the applicant in Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In doing so it is said that she erred because the test "is a separate element of the assessment of the non refoulment obligation under the ICCPR going to the nexus between the removal and the risk, as opposed to the determination of the presence of a real risk of death or mistreatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">"
 &#8226; She failed to give discrete consideration to the test posed by the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">

19 The applicant further contended that he had been denied procedural fairness in that:
 
 &#8226; Procedural fairness required that he be provided with a copy of the reassessment and given the opportunity to comment on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">He was not given a copy of the document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">&#8226; He had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would apply the constructions of the ICCPR and the CAT as they were explained in the initial assessment or that, if some other construction was to be applied, he would have had the opportunity of being heard in support of an argument that this should not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">&#8226; The failure to provide him with a copy of the reassessment and to afford him an opportunity to be heard on its contents caused practical injustice because, had the reassessment been exposed, his advisers would have been able to make submissions as to the proper constructions which the Minister should apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS 
 
20 The applicant acknowledges that the Minister would have been free to make her decision, under s 501(1) of the Act, without reference to the ICCPR, the CAT or any other international treaty which had not been incorporated in Australian domestic law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">It is, however, contended that, once the Minister determined that she would take Australia's obligations under the ICCPR and the CAT into account, she was obliged to ascertain and apply the relevant treaty obligations according to their terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">If, in making her decision, the Minister misconstrued a treaty obligation and this had a material bearing on her decision, she could be said to have failed to have regard to a relevant consideration (the obligation correctly construed) or had regard to an irrelevant consideration (the misunderstood obligation).</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">21 As counsel for the applicant readily conceded this aspect of his case confronted some significant difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The first is that his argument assumes that a decision-maker can be bound to have regard to a consideration which he or she would otherwise be free to ignore if he or she chooses to take the particular consideration into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">The argument is made all the more difficult where the decision-maker is a Minister and the relevant statutory discretion is conferred in the widest possible terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">The difficulty is compounded when the relevant consideration is identified as a treaty obligation, correctly construed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">22 The discretionary power, conferred on the Minister by s 501(1) of the Act, is unfettered in its terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">As Heydon and Crennan JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) said, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom [2006] HCA 50 ; (2006) 230 ALR 370 at 401 [128] , speaking of the similarly wide discretion conferred on the Minister by s 501(2):
 
 "Parliament has left it to the Minister to decide the matters which are relevant to whether a person who fails the character test should be permitted to remain in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Considerations relevant to the exercise of the power depend on the nature, scope and purpose of the power, understood in the context in the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">As ministerial direction No 21 makes clear, the minister considers that two of the factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion are related to the protection of the Australian community and the expectations of the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">" 

The protection and expectations of the Australian community are not, however, binding considerations when the Minister him or herself makes a decision under s 501.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The same must be true of international treaty obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">As McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at 33 [101] ;
 
 " ...In the case law a line has been drawn which limits the normative effect of what are unenacted international obligations upon discretionary decision making under powers conferred by statute and without specification of those obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The judgments in Teoh accepted the established doctrine that such obligations are not mandatory relevant considerations attracting judicial review for jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">" 
 

23 While such considerations could be elevated to the status of mandatory considerations by statute or by direction given under statutory power, this has not occurred in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">The Minister is under no such obligation to so treat them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The question then arises as to whether that position can be altered simply because the Minister chooses to take into account treaty obligations when making a decision under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">24 The applicant seeks an affirmative answer to this question relying on the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">A delegate of the Minister had determined that the respondent should be deported because he had committed various criminal offences in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">He appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">In affirming the delegate's decision the Tribunal made two brief references to a ministerial policy statement relating to criminal deportation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">French and Drummond JJ held (at 211) that the ministerial policy statements "were relevant factors which the Tribunal was bound to consider although not bound to apply so as to prejudice its independent assessment of the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">" Their Honours found that the Tribunal had failed to have regard to certain central elements in the policy in coming to its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">They said (at 208) that:
 
 "On the other hand, where the existence and content of such a policy is to be regarded as a relevant fact which the Tribunal is bound to consider, a serious misconstruction of its terms or misunderstanding of its purposes in the course of decision making may constitute a failure to take into account a relevant factor and for that reason may result in an improper exercise of the statutory power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">If a decision-maker, not bound to apply policy, purports to apply it as a proper basis the disposing of the case in hand, but misconstrues or misunderstands it so that what is applied is not the policy but something else, then there may be reviewable error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">In a limiting case a policy may be so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">In such a case misconstruction of a policy may reduce to misconstruction of the statute or misunderstanding of its purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">" 

25 This passage cannot be understood as supporting an unqualified proposition that an error in construing and applying a policy or an unincorporated treaty, which the decision-maker is not bound to apply, will amount to jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">This will only be so if the misconstruction is "serious" such that "what is applied is not the policy but something else ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Moreover their Honours' reasoning assumes that the Tribunal was bound to give consideration to the ministerial policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Whether or not that be right in respect to a ministerial policy, it is now clear that this is not the case where unincorporated international treaty obligations are concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">This was accepted by French J in Le v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 875.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">His Honour said (at [59]) that:
 
 "There is nothing in s 501 which expressly requires that the Minister have regard to the best interests of the visa holder's children as a condition of the valid exercise of the cancellation power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Nor is there anything in the language of the Act to support an implication to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In the international context, Australia is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and therefore is bound, in international law, by the obligation in legislative, executive and judicial decision-making to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration "in all cases concerning children".</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">However the existence of that obligation of international law does not, unless incorporated by the Parliament into domestic legislation, give rise to a corresponding substantive obligation which conditions the exercise of statutory powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The provisions of an international treaty to which Australia is a party may be a relevant consideration in the exercise of statutory discretions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Such considerations do not thereby become mandatory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">In the joint judgment in re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Lam ...McHugh and Gummow JJ referred to the "... established doctrine" that obligations under international treaties "... are not mandatory relevant considerations attracting judicial review for jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">" The best interests of the children do not, by virtue of Australia's commitments under the Convention, become a mandatory relevant consideration in the exercise of statutory powers and in particular the power of visa cancellation under s 501.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">It may be acknowledged that statutes are generally to be interpreted and applied, to the extent that their language allows, so as to conform and not conflict with established laws of international law ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">But this rule of construction does not extend to writing into statutes conditions, expressive of treaty obligations, which would narrow the powers that Parliament has conferred upon administrative or ministerial decision makers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">" 

26 His Honour expressly rejected a contention that the Full Court decision in Gray compelled a different conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">His Honour said (at [62], [63], [66]) that:
 
 "[62] Although the Minister, like the AAT in Gray's case, is not bound to apply the Ministerial direction this does not preclude him or her from adopting a ministerial policy to be applied in such cases providing he does not fetter his discretion in so doing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The adoption of a policy guideline would be entirely consistent with the impited legislative intent that the Minister's powers not be exercised capriciously or arbitrarily, albeit the policy might be changed from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In this case the Issues Paper told the Minister no more than that it was open to him to be guided by the factors set out in the Direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">It did not suggest that he apply the policy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">The facts provided to the Minister for consideration reflected those identified in the Direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">But although it may be inferred that the Minister decided to adopt that general approach, it does not mean that he was bound to treat the interest of Mr Le's children as a primary consideration or that he in fact did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">
 
 [63] The best interests of the children of the visa holder affected by a decision taken by the Minister under s 501 cannot be regarded as a mandatory relevant factor in the exercise of the Minister's discretion by reason of the terms of the statute, international law or the Minister's own policy directions ... 
 
 [66] Absent a requirement, conditioning the exercise of the cancellation power, that the Minister have regard to the best interests of the visa holder's children, the complaint of a constructive failure to consider their interests, even if made out, would not expose a jurisdictional error..." 

27 Australia's unenacted international treaty obligations relating to refoulment of persons within the jurisdiction are matters to which decision-makers are entitled to have regard when exercising powers under s 501 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In the absence of legislative requirement they are not, however, bound to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">If they do not bring them into account as part of the decision-making process no jurisdictional error will occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">If they choose to have regard to treaty obligations but, in some way, misunderstand the full extent or purport of the obligations, this will not constitute jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">It has been held that misconstruction of a ministerial policy, by a Minister who is free to depart from it, cannot amount to reviewable error: see Nikac v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 65 at 77-78.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Where the instrument concerned is an unincorporated international treaty which is subject to interpretation by a potentially wide range of international bodies it will be harder to make good an allegation of error much less jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">28 For these reasons I do not consider that the Minister made any jurisdictional error, even if she erred in construing and applying the ICCPR or the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">29 Although it is strictly unnecessary to do so, I should add that I do not accept the applicant's contention that the Minister necessarily erred in her construction and application of the treaty obligations to which she had regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In Kindler v Canada (Communication Number 470/1991) the United Nations Human Rights Committee said that the relevant question under Article 6 of the ICCPR was whether Canada had exposed "a person within its jurisdiction to the real risk (that is to say, a necessary and foreseeable consequence) of losing his life" contrary to the ICCPR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The Minister approached the matter in this way when she accepted the departmental assessment "that country information did not support the view that torture or death would be a "necessary and foreseeable consequence" of the [applicant's] removal from Australia which is the test for risk set by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">" The applicant's allegation of error is founded on a more recent formulation of the test by the Human Rights Committee which, it is contended, rephrases the relevant question such that the "necessary and foreseeable consequence" test should not be read as qualifying the test of "real risk".</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The two tests are set to be cumulative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">Reliance was placed on two of the Committee's decisions in 2006 which related to Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Committee's decisions included statements that:
 
 "States parties are under an obligation not to expose individuals to a real risk of being killed or subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" 
 

and that
 
 "The committee must therefore decide whether there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of [the applicant's removal] there is a real risk that the [applicant] would be subjected to treatment prohibited by articles 6 and 7 [of the ICCPR].</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">" 

Attention was directed to one of the Committee's decisions in 2004 involving Denmark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">There it held that the relevant question was whether expulsion would "expose [the applicant] to a real and foreseeable risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to article 7 [of the ICCPR]".</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Reliance was also placed on a comparison of the draft and final versions of the Committee's General Comment 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">In none of these instances was the Kindler formulation criticised or rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Nor do the formulations which are relied on lend clear support to the applicant's contentions that there are two tests to be applied cumulatively.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">In any event, even if the more recent expressions of the Committee's understanding of the relevant obligations are to be understood as reflecting a differing view from that previously expressed, it does not follow that the Minster has erred by preferring the opinion expressed in cases such as Kindler .</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">30 The applicant's second complaint relating to the Minister's treatment of Australia's treaty obligations was that she failed to deal with the test posed by the CAT at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">I am by no means persuaded that this complaint has merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The Minister's reasons do not refer expressly to either the ICCPR or the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">They do, however, refer to " Australia's international obligations .</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">" Moreover, she referred to the department's assessment in which both the ICCPR and the CAT obligations are dealt with.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Even if the Minister had failed to give separate or any consideration to the obligations imposed by the CAT, this would not have constituted a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">This is so for at least two reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The first is that, if she did not do so, she did not err because she was not bound to have regard to the CAT obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">The second is that, in any event, the applicant, in written submissions to the Minister, did not seek to suggest that there was anything other than a "real risk" test to be applied in determining whether either or both of the ICCPR and the CAT were engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">One example was the submission that: "The situation in Lebanon is far from stable and the Department cannot reach a determinative conclusion of whether there is a "real risk" that [the applicant] will face violation of his ICCPR , or CAT, rights upon any return to Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">" It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the Minister did not, in terms, deal separately with the CAT obligations once she had explained her reasons for concluding that Australia's international obligations were not engaged.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS 
 
31 It is common ground that the applicant was not provided with a copy of the reassessment or the issues paper referred to above at [10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">The Minister's reasons do not refer expressly to either document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">The applicant argues, nonetheless, that the Minister must have had regard to the reassessment and relied on it because she refers in her reasons to an International Treaties Obligation Assessment "which states that while there was a remote possibility of the risk of torture and/or death if the applicant was to be returned, there was no real risk given the changes in Lebanon since ... July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">" No such phrasing appears in the initial assessment which was provided to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">It is said that the tests which were to be applied by the Minister in determining whether Australia had non-refoulment obligations to the applicant under the two treaties were formulated differently in the initial assessment, to which the applicant had access, and the reassessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The comparison is drawn between the questions which are set out above at [8] and what is said in the passages from the reassessment which are extracted in the issues paper: see above at [10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">In particular it is suggested that the formulation of the test in para [118] of the issues paper is confusing and ignores the test posed by the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">Complaint is also made that the clarification contained in para [117] in which the department expresses the opinion that the applicant would confront only a "remote possibility" of torture or death if returned to the Lebanon, differs from the initial assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In addition, the applicant's solicitor gave evidence that, had she been provided with a copy of the reassessment, she would have made submissions, such as those made in argument in this proceeding, as to the proper construction of the ICCPR and the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">However, in cross examination, she conceded that these arguments had not occurred to her at the time that the submissions would have been made in response to the assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">They occurred to her after the Minister's decision had been made and after counsel had been briefed for the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">32 Procedural fairness required that the applicant should be advised of any "critical point on which the decision would turn": see Rocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 529 at 540 [43].</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">He was also entitled to an opportunity to advance evidence and make submissions in relation to any prejudicial material before the Minister made her decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">In Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576, in a passage subsequently quoted with approval by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 600 [32] , a Full Court of this Court said (at 590-1) that:
 
 "It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">" 
 

33 When the department issued the notice of intention to consider the refusal of his visa application the applicant was advised that one of the issues to be considered by the Minister was whether Australia would breach its international treaty obligations should it return him to the Lebanon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Given the importance of this matter he was advised to "specify in detail any reason why you believe that Australia would be breaching its international obligations by returning [you] to the Lebanon": see above at [5].</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The applicant's solicitor responded to this invitation by making submissions supporting the proposition that the treaty obligations would be breached because there was the "strong possibility" that he "may well face persecution and/or torture if he is forced to return to Lebanon ...".</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">Shortly afterwards the applicant's solicitors were provided with the department's initial assessment relating to Australia's international treaty obligations in so far as they had application to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Again the solicitors for the applicant were invited to respond on his behalf and did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The submissions dealt with the construction and application of the ICCPR and the CAT, arguing that the level of risk of harm which would be faced by the applicant in the Lebanon was such as to satisfy tests which would attract the operation of the two treaties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">The applicant's solicitor acknowledged, in evidence, that she had not expected to be afforded any further opportunity to comment on the departmental material prior to the Minister making a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Accordingly she had made a comprehensive submission on behalf of the applicant saying all that it was desired to advance on his behalf including contentions relating to the construction and application of the ICCPR and the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">34 In my opinion, the procedures adopted by the department satisfied the requirements of procedural fairness in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The invitation identified with clarity one of the crucial or relevant points on which the Minister's decision might turn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">The applicant was afforded the opportunity, on two occasions, to make detailed submissions on the construction and application of the two treaties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Conflicting assessments by the departmental officer and the applicant's solicitor as to the proper characterisation of the level of risk to be confronted, should the applicant return to the Lebanon, were placed before the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">So too were submissions relating to the correct formulation of the relevant treaty obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">They were incorporated in the issues paper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">There was no requirement that the department's issues paper should be provided to the applicant before it was considered by the Minister: see M238 of 2002 v Ruddock [2003] FCAFC 260 at [54] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Furthermore, there was no requirement that the Minister's views on these matters, after she had considered the submissions and the issues paper, should be exposed to the applicant for further comment prior to a decision being made: see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 603 [48] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">35 The applicant submits that he "had a legitimate expectation that the tests for the application of the ICCPR and the CAT would be as couched in the Assessment (or that if some deviation was proposed, he would have the opportunity of being heard as to why that would be incorrect)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">36 This submission must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">The decision was to be made by the Minister personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The applicant was specifically advised to make full submissions about the treaty obligations Australia may owe to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">No restrictions were placed on this invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">The submissions were made and included submissions as to the construction and application of the ICCPR and the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">The applicant may well have had a proper basis for alleging jurisdictional error had it been said or implied that the Minister would accept and act on the departmental officer's views.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Such an assertion would have rendered the invitation to the applicant to make detailed submissions on the issues raised in the department's documents a hollow and meaningless gesture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No expectation of the kind identified by the applicant could justifiably be regarded as "legitimate".</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The critical point is that the applicant was afforded the opportunity to tell the Minister affirmatively what he contended were Australia's treaty obligations and how they applied to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">He did so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">37 In Re Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1, the applicant claimed to have been denied procedural fairness by the Minister when he made a decision to cancel his visa under s 501(2) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The applicant had been given a notice by the Department advising him that the Minister was proposing to consider cancellation of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Various relevant matters were identified, including the best interests of any children with whom the applicant had an involvement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The applicant made detailed submissions including claims relating to the effect of his deportation on his Australian born children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">It was apparent from those submissions that the children were being cared for by a particular person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">After the submissions had been received an officer of the department sought information from the applicant such as the name, address and telephone number of the children's carers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It was said that the department wished to contact the carers in order to assess some of the applicant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Although the applicant provided the requested particulars no contact was made with the person who was caring for the children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The Minister cancelled the visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">The applicant claimed to have been denied procedural fairness because he had a legitimate expectation that the carer would be contacted and her views taken into account and that expectation was not fulfilled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">The High Court dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">Gleeson CJ said (at 13-14):
 
 "[36] The more fundamental problem facing the applicant, however, relates to the matter of unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">A statement of intention, made in the course of decision making, as to a procedural step to be taken, is said to give rise to an expectation of such a kind that the decision-maker, in fairness, must either take that step or give notice of a change in intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">Yet no attempt is made to show that the applicant held any subjective expectation in consequence of which he did, or omitted to do, anything.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">Nor is it shown that he lost an opportunity to put any information or argument to the decision-maker, or otherwise suffered any detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">
 
 [37] A common form of detriment suffered where a decision maker has failed to take a procedural step is loss of an opportunity to make representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">... A particular example of such detriment is a case where the statement of intention has been relied upon and, acting in the faith of it, a person has refrained from putting material before a decision maker.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">In a case of that particular kind, it is the existence of a subjective expectation, and reliance, that results in unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Fairness is not an abstract concept.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is essential practical.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">
 
 [38] No practical injustice has been shown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The applicant lost no opportunity to advance his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">He did not rely to his disadvantage on the statement of intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">It has not been shown that there was procedural unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">And, as I have already indicated, there is no warrant for a conclusion that there was a failure properly to take into account the interests of the applicant's children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">" 

McHugh and Gummow JJ came to a similar conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Their Honours said (at 34-35) that:
 
 "[105] But the failure to meet that expectation does not reasonably found a case of denial of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">The notion of legitimate expectation serves only to focus attention on the content of the requirement of natural justice in this particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The ends sought to be attained by the requirement of natural justice may be variously identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">But at least in a case such as this the concern is with the fairness of the procedure adopted rather than the fairness of the outcome.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">It is with the decision making process not the decision ... 
 
 [106] The applicant by the statement in the letter to him of 7 November 2000 did not acquire any vested right to oblige the Department to act as it indicated, at peril of the ultimate decision by the Minister exceeding his jurisdiction under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">It was not suggested that in reliance upon that letter the applicant had failed to put to the Department any material he otherwise would have urged upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">Nor was it suggested that, if contacted, the carers would have supplemented to any significant degree what had been put already in the letter of 17 October 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The submission that the applicant, before the making by the Minister of his decision, should have been told that the carers were not to be contacted, thus lacks any probative force for a conclusion that the procedures so miscarried as to occasion a denial of natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">

Hayne J concluded (at 38-39) that:
 
 "[122] ...it is enough to say that even if the Department's letter engendered some relevant legitimate expectation, departure from it, where it is accepted that neither the expectation nor departure from it affected the course which the appellant pursued, gives no ground for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">He was afforded a full opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">The Department's letter raised no new matter to be taken into account in making the impugned decision, and it did not divert attention in anyway from the relevance of, or weight to be given to, the effect that cancellation of the applicant's visa would have on his children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">..." 

38 The applicant's case, insofar as it is founded on claims that he had a legitimate expectation which was not fulfilled and which occasioned practical unfairness relies on the passages just quoted from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Lam .</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">39 The applicant contends that he had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would apply the tests identified in the initial submission "and that he would be heard in the event that it be proposed that relevant contents of the Assessment were amended or abandoned to his detriment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">" It is said that the practical unfairness arose because, when an allegedly different test was propounded in the reassessment and was referred to in the issues paper given to the Minister he was unaware of the change.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">He claims, that had he known of the change, "he could have made submissions urging against their adoption, and those might have found favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">"
 
40 For reasons already given I do not consider that it is possible to discern, in the department's initial assessment and the reassessment, materially different formulations of the tests to be applied in determining Australia's obligation to him under the ICCPR and the CAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">Even if some significant differences did exist it does not follow that any practical unfairness was occasioned by the procedures which were adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">It is to be noted that, in both assessments, the conclusion was reached that non-refoulment obligations did not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">It is also to be noted that there is no evidence of any subjective expectation, harboured by the applicant (or his solicitor) at relevant times of the kind now alleged much less any evidence of reliance on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">As the applicant's solicitor frankly acknowledged, in her evidence, comprehensive submissions were made on the critically relevant issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">Nothing was omitted as a result of any expectation engendered by the Department or the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">The process adopted gave rise to no practical unfairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">41 The application should be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
