3 On 25 March 2008, the respondent, Richard Alexander Roberson, who is also known as Richard James, proffered an undertaking to the ACCC, which was accepted by it on 2 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">On or about 30 May 2008, the respondent had a conversation with Sandra Irene Haywood, a Classified Sales Consultant for the 'Port Macquarie News' in which the respondent said words to the effect, 'I changed my name to James'.</sentence>

<sentence id="s6">5 By an Application filed 15 August 2008, supported by a Statement of Claim, also filed 15 August 2008, the ACCC has sought orders under s 87B(4) of the Trade Practices Act and declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) said to arise from breaches, by the respondent, of terms of the undertaking of 25 March 2008 which was accepted by the ACCC on 2 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Application took the form prescribed by Form 5 of the Federal Court Forms and specified as the time and date for hearing, 9.30 am on 1 September 2008, being a date upon which it was open to the Court to give directions for the further hearing of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">6 Under Order 4, rule 8 of the Rules, provision is made for an applicant to state a date for a directions hearing in an Application, and I am satisfied that by the words of the Application presently before the Court, 1 September 2008 was stated as the relevant date for a directions hearing in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">7 Under Order 9, rule 2(1) of the Rules, a respondent is required to enter an appearance 'before the date appointed for a directions hearing' although it is permissible for an appearance to be entered thereafter, in accordance with Order 9, rule 2(2) of the Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">8 No appearance was entered in this matter by the respondent on or before 1 September 2008, nor has any appearance been entered since that date.</sentence>

14 Detailed consideration has been given by various judges of the Court to the operation of Order 35A, rule 3(2)(c), its meaning and the circumstances in which the discretion which it confers should be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Order 35A was inserted into the Rules towards the end of 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">15 Sackville J gave consideration to rule 3 in Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom (2006) 232 ALR 525 at [8] --- [10].</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It is unnecessary to refer to the observations which fell from his Honour in that case, as later authority has established a clear line of approach which should be adopted in relation to matters arising under Order 35A, rule 3(2)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">16 On 3 November 2006, Kiefel J, then a judge of this Court, considered the rule in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.net.au Pty Ltd (ACN 075 400 529) (2006) ('Dataline.net.au') 236 ALR 665 at [45] --- [50].</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Her Honour also gave consideration to the desirability of orders being made in respect of participation in a trade practice compliance program at [96] --- [99].</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Her Honour did not consider it a proper use of the Court's power to require the physical attendance of a person for the purpose of re-education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">She pointed out that there are a number of objections to it and also pointed out that it raised questions as to supervision and enforcement (at [99]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">17 Following the judgment of Kiefel J, but before consideration of that matter on appeal, Order 35A rule 3 was further considered by Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 ; (2007) 240 ALR 120.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His Honour referred to the reasons for judgment of Keifel J in Dataline.net.au and observed that the rule conferred a power in the Court which was discretionary as to whether relief, as sought, should be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">His Honour proceeded to make declaratory orders, as sought, founded upon what he referred to as 'deemed admissions' on the relevant Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">18 An appeal from Kiefel J's judgment in Dataline.net.au came before a Full Court comprising Moore, Dowsett and Greenwood JJ, whose judgment was handed down on 7 September 2007 (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.net.au Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (2007) 161 FCR 513).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Their Honours summarised the process of reasoning of Kiefel J and, as I would understand it, expressed their approval of the approach which her Honour had advocated (see for example at [57]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">At [42] the Full Court under the heading ' Order 35A, r 3(2)(c) principles ' said
 '42 Order 35A, r 3(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules predicated upon an event of default (O 35A, r 2(2)) contemplates that judgment may be given against a respondent for relief to which the applicant appears entitled "on the statement of claim" and the Court is satisfied it has "power to grant".</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In determining the relief, O 35A permits regard to be had to the "face of the statement of claim"; no evidence need be adduced to prove the factual contentions; allegations of fact in the statement of claim are deemed admitted ([45]); and although such admissions are generally taken as made only for the purpose of the relief sought by the statement of claim, O 35A consistent with O 35 contemplates judgment for relief not necessarily claimed in the pleading but nevertheless open on the facts deemed admitted ([47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The terms of the rule suggest that recourse is not appropriate to affidavit evidence of additional facts to those alleged in the statement of claim ([48]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Although the ACCC contended that affidavit evidence of facts not customarily alleged in the statement of claim might be adduced ([48]) on a hearing as to relief and the observations of Lord Woolf MR in Phonograhic Performance Ltd v Maitra (1998) 41 IPR 225 at 230-231 suggest that as to discretionary relief evidence of relevant facts going to the exercise of the discretion should be properly before the Court, evidence which would alter the pleaded case should not be admitted ([50]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The fourth respondent accepted that further affidavit material might be accepted by the Court in relation to the relief sought ([50]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Regard ought not to be had to evidence of facts which could have been but were not pleaded concerning the conduct of the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Regard ought not to be had to evidence of a further purpose of Mr Russell in connection with Dataline's conduct of resale price maintenance to undercut prices charged by VISPs to customers so as to attract those customers to Australis ([51]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Evidence as to the present circumstances of Mr Russell is relevant and admissible in the determination of a pecuniary penalty ([51]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Mr Russell continues to work in the same type of business as that conducted by Dataline and Australis ([90]).</sentence>

19 The next case to which reference should be made is Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Storesonline International, Inc (2007) ATPR 48 ,236, a judgment of Tamberlin J, in which his Honour considered the appropriate scope of relief where there had been contraventions of terms of an undertaking given and accepted in that case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">20 The final case to which reference needs be made is Hadgkiss v Aldin (No 2) (2007) 169 IR 76; a judgment of Gilmour J which was handed down on 20 December 2007.</sentence>

 ' TRADE PRACTICES ACT 1974 UNDERTAKING TO THE AUSTRALIAN COMPETITION AND CONSUMER COMMISSION GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 87B BY RICHARD ALEXANDER ROBERSON PERSON GIVING UNDERTAKING 
 
 (1) This Undertaking is given to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( the ACCC ) by Mr Richard Alexander Roberson of 1-90 Seafront Circuit, Bonny Hills in the State of New South Wales under section 87B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ( the Act ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
 (2) Mr Richard Alexander Roberson ( Mr Roberson ) carries on a business registered in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT F00122516) known as Backpacker Employment Services and a business registered in Queensland known as Backpackers Employment Service Transport (QLD BN20015938) (collectively referred to in this Undertaking as BES ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">BES is a small business which provides employment services to unemployed persons, including those with disabilities, in regional centres in New South Wales and Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 
 (3) During the period from about May 2007 to October 2007, Mr Roberson published or caused to be published, advertisements in a variety of media, including on the internet, offering fruit picking jobs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Mr Roberson represented in the advertisements that fruit picking jobs were available for a period of between 6 to 12 months in a variety of locations from Taree in New South Wales to Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 
 
 (4) During telephone conversations with employees of employment placement agencies in the Taree area, and to some subscribers directly, Mr Roberson also represented that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) he would have between 200 and 300 fruit picking jobs available from July 2007 at Moorland Orange Juice Orchard, Moorland, NSW ( Moorland Orchard ) offering the rate of pay of$16 per hour or $30 per bin, including accommodation;

 (c) he could guarantee employment to those persons who subscribed to BES for the length of their subscription.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 
 The ACCC's enquiries 
 
 (5) The ACCC's enquiries revealed that insofar as the representations were in respect of future matters, Mr Roberson did not have reasonable grounds for making the representations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">In particular, Mr Roberson had no arrangement with Moorland Orchard whereby that business would provide employment to any fruit pickers referred to it by Mr Roberson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Further, Moorland Orchard intended to offer four or five fruit picker jobs which were to be available from September 2007 for a period of up to two weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">More generally, Mr Roberson had no reasonable grounds for representing that he would offer fruit picking jobs to subscribers for the period of their respective subscriptions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">
 
 
The ACCC's concerns 
 
 (6) The ACCC was concerned that the representations made by Mr Roberson and referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 above were likely to mislead consumers as to the availability, terms and conditions of employment opportunities he claimed to exist, particularly employment opportunities at the Moorland Orchard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The ACCC considered that by making these representations Mr Roberson engaged in conduct in contravention of sections 52, 53(c) and (d) and 53B of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">
 
 
 
 (7) In order to address the ACCC's concerns, Mr Roberson has offered to give this undertaking to the ACCC.</sentence>

<sentence id="s113">28 In paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim the ACCC charged that the respondent had not undertaken the required training as referred to in paragraph 16 of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">29 In paragraphs 20 to 23 inclusive the ACCC charged that the respondent had failed to comply with paragraphs 19 and 20 of the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">30 On the hearing of the current Motion some additional evidence has been led, but not evidence of facts which could have been but were not pleaded concerning the conduct of the respondent, nor was any evidence called which was in conflict with the matters charged in the Statement of Claim to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">31 I am satisfied that the Application and Statement of Claim were duly served upon the respondent on 18 August 2008 and that on 10 September 2008 a sealed copy of the Court's orders of 1 September 2008, that is to say, the date of the directions hearing, were served upon the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I am satisfied that the Notice of Motion filed 14 October 2008 was served upon the respondent by prepaid express post directed to him at 90 Seafront Circuit, Bonny Hills, NSW on or shortly after 15 October 2008, the date of posting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">32 Whilst the undertaking required notices to be published in the newspapers to which reference has been made, no such notices were published.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">However, a form of notice was formulated following communication between Kristy Leanne Laws, a Classifieds Supervisor and the respondent on or about 11 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">A copy of the form of notice as formulated is to be found in exhibit KL-1 to the affidavit of Ms Laws affirmed 17 October 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It would appear that the respondent failed to proceed with the publication of the notices once he was advised by Ms Laws that the cost of publication of the notice in the two papers would total $704.22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">33 After receiving some reminders from the ACCC in relation to his obligations under the undertaking, the respondent sent a document to the ACCC which is annexure MC-4 to the affidavit of Molly Choucair affirmed 3 November 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">That document provides a list of five names to whom it is said that the respondent sent letters as requested on 'Monday', which I take to have been a Monday shortly before 2 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The communication also included a statement that a refund of $100 had been made on 24 January 2008 to one Jessica Mellon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">34 It would appear that the respondent had provided a list of 'Backpackers Employment Members' in June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Ms Choucair made contact with one of the persons included on the list being a Ben Hicks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">It seems clear that the respondent did post to Mr Hicks a letter generally as required of him by the undertaking, on or about 19 May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">35 Another person whose name appeared on the list as having become a member on a date in July 2007 was listed as 'Whane Bowen'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Mr Bowen swore an affidavit indicating that he saw an advertisement in the 'Port Macquarie News' newspaper in or around June 2007 to which he responded which resulted in him subscribing $50 to become a 'member' of 'Backpackers Employment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">He says that he was sent a receipt for his six month subscription fee of $50 and further says that he had not, as of 23 October 2008, received a letter from the respondent as required by the undertaking in terms similar to that sent by the respondent to Mr Hicks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">36 The list of 'Backpackers Employment Members' provided by the respondent included only a relatively small number of names on 3 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Somewhat curiously, dates on the list jump, on one page, from 2007 back to 2006 and then forwards again to 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">37 The dates with which the ACCC is concerned is the period from 'about May 2007 to October 2007' which I would understand to mean 1 May 2007 to 31 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">It is difficult to discern the dates referable to 'members' on one of the pages of 'Backpackers Employment Members'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">The other two pages suggest that there were about 26 persons whose membership dates fall within the relevant timeframe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">38 Those 26 would appear to have contributed approximately $1300 in total to the respondent for their membership rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Some may have paid for a 12 month membership rather than six months, in which case the total may be a little more than the figure mentioned of $1300.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">39 Under Order 11 of the Rules, a pleading should contain and contain only a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which a party relies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">A pleading should be as brief as the nature of the case admits, but under Order 11, rule 9, 'A party may by his pleading raise any point of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">'
 
40 By reference to matters alleged in the Statement of Claim and the evidence going to breach, which is germane to the manner in which the Court should exercise its discretion to grant or refuse relief, I am satisfied that the respondent breached the terms of the undertaking to which reference has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Accordingly, declarations should be made as sought in the Application filed 15 August 2008 when taken with annexures A and B to the undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">41 As to the remaining orders that are sought, it seems to me that there are serious difficulties associated with those parts of the undertaking which require the respondent to put in place a complaints handling scheme referable to trade practices complaints and to undertake training in relation to the application of ss 52 , 53 (c) and (d) and 53B of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">42 Bonny Hills, where the respondent appears to reside, is located near Taree and is far removed from any centre where one might expect any trade practices courses to be given which might be of any value in ensuring that the respondent is made aware of his obligations under the sections mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">43 One might have thought that mere disclosure by the applicant to the respondent of the terms of the sections, which are quite straightforward, would do more good than requiring him to somehow or other identify a course of training that he should undertake and then attend same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">The salutary experience of his involvement in these proceedings will no doubt be more than sufficient to alert him to the need for people carrying on businesses such as his, soliciting employment for people whom he describes as 'backpackers', to comply with the requirements of the Trade Practices Act in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct and other like conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">44 In my opinion, it would be appropriate to make orders requiring the respondent to communicate with the 26 persons whose names are listed on the three page list of 'Backpackers Employment Members', to ensure that they are, effectively, invited to make an application for a refund of their respective subscriptions of $50 or $100, as the case may be.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">It will be appropriate to require the respondent to make refunds to such persons as may request a refund following notification of the availability of such a refund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">45 I do not favour the making of an order in terms of paragraph 7 in the Application which requires the transmission of letters to all persons for whom he [the respondent] has address information and who has subscribed to BES' service as contemplated by prayer for relief 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">46 If orders are to be made by the Court, they must be orders which can be enforced, and in relation to which proceedings for contempt may be brought if there is non-compliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">47 I do not favour the making of an order in terms of paragraph 8, which simply requires a reporting back to the ACCC of the action taken in respect of the 26-odd individuals mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">48 I do favour imposition of a requirement upon the respondent to proceed with the publication of notices in the 'Manning River Times' and 'Port Macquarie News' newspapers, as contemplated generally by paragraph 9 of the Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">49 I agree with the proposal for an order to be made generally in accordance with paragraph 10, which simply seeks the provision by the respondent of copies of the notices, as published, to the ACCC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">50 For the reasons I have given, I do not favour the relief sought in paragraphs 11 and 12, and would not be disposed to make orders in accordance with those paragraphs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">51 It seems to me that it would be appropriate for an order for costs to be made against the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">I will not say that he has flouted the requirements of his undertaking, in his absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">However, the limited compliance that there has been seems to have arisen as a result of follow-up action taken by the ACCC, which should have been unnecessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">52 Whether or not the failure to write to Mr Bowen resulted from the fact that the respondent did not have his address, is a matter upon which one can but speculate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">It certainly seems clear from the evidence of Mr Bowen, that at the time when a receipt was sent to him for his subscription of $50, the respondent then had Mr Bowen's address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">53 The applicant has asked that the Court adjourn the matter to allow telephone calls to be placed by the ACCC to see if it can identify addresses for the 26-odd persons, so that an order could be formulated requiring letters to be written to each of the 26 persons, informing them of their rights to obtain a refund of the relevant subscription.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">In my view, given the amount of money that is involved, it would be inappropriate to commit more time and expense to the securing of orders under s 87B(4) of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">54 I would propose that order 7 be implemented by requiring the respondent to telephone the persons identified on the numbers that are included in the 'Backpackers Employment Members' list, with an obligation being cast upon him to read to each of the persons, with whom he is able to communicate, a statement generally in accordance with the terms of the proposed letter, which is included as annexure A to the Application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">I certify that the preceding fifty-four (54) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.</sentence>
