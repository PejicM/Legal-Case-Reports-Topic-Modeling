 WILCOX J: 
 
 1 When judgment was delivered in this matter on 22 March 2006, I reserved the matter of costs: see Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v Vidtech Gaming Services Pty Limited [2006] FCA 275.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I invited submissions as to the appropriate costs order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The applicants seek a general order for costs of the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">They argue there is no reason to depart from the general rule that costs follow the event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Their clients have succeeded in establishing liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Although the applicants failed to obtain injunctive relief, they obtained awards of damages against all the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In the case of the first and second respondents for $139,200 and, in the case of the third respondent, for $99,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The respondents made an offer of settlement in the sum of $150,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This figure was inclusive of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The offer was put on the basis that $100,000 would be a reasonable estimate of the costs to date, leaving $50,000 for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">In essence, therefore, the applicants argue that, although the damages award fell well short of their claim, they beat the respondents' offer and should have the costs of doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The respondents rely on the considerable discrepancy between the applicants' claim for $6,350,145 and the damages awarded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Counsel suggest that the general costs order should be limited to 25% of the costs incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">However, I am not aware that a discrepancy of this nature has ever been regarded as a justification for diminished costs, in the absence of specific applicable provisions such as Order 62 rule 36A(1) or (2) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Of course, the situation may be different where the discrepancy flows from an applicant's failure in relation to a discrete part of his or her claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In the present case the applicants failed on a trade marks claim and they also made a trade practices claim which I did not find it necessary to determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">However, these claims did not extend the hearing or add materially to its cost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Neither did the unsuccessful claim for an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Consequently, subject to one matter, I see no principled basis for reducing the general costs order below 100%.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">5 The qualification I have in mind is that Order 62 rule 36A(1) applies to the recovery against the third respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That sub-rule provides that, where a party is awarded judgment for less than $100,000 in a money claim, 'any costs ordered to be paid, including disbursements, will be reduced by one-third of the amount otherwise allowable ... unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">I see no reason to make a contrary order in relation to the third respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Consequently, the costs recoverable against her will be limited to two-thirds of the amount of the taxed or assessed costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 There is a subsidiary issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Counsel for the respondents argue that any general costs order should exclude all costs associated with the report or evidence of Stuart Robertson of Ernst and Young, Chartered Accountants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I do not know the amount of these costs but they are probably substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">7 In my earlier reasons for judgment, I stated why I declined to accept Mr Robertson's estimate of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">My decision to do so was not an implied criticism of Mr Robertson but, rather, arose out of the fact that the matters he assumed were unsupported by evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicants ought to have known that there was no evidence to support Mr Robertson's calculations and, therefore, that his conclusions would be of no value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In the circumstances, it was unreasonable for them to incur the expense of retaining Mr Robertson and procuring his report and attendance at court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">8 Counsel for the applicants argued that the matters addressed by Mr Robertson 'were entirely apposite to the issues arising in the proceeding'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, an expert's opinion, even on a matter fairly arising out of the pleadings, is of no value unless it is grounded in facts that are either admitted or proved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It may be true, as counsel submitted, that 'the need for expert forensic accounting assistance is plain'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">However, the need for evidence, upon which such assistance might fasten, is even more plain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">9 The applicants should have a general costs order in their favour but it should exclude all costs associated with the report or evidence of Mr Robertson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Wilcox.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Associate:
