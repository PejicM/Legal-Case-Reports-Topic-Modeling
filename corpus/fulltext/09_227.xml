 INTRODUCTION 
 There are two applications before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The first in time is the applicants' application for leave nunc pro tunc to proceed against the first respondent (Opes Prime) (which is both in liquidation and has receivers and managers appointed) and also against the fourth respondent (Green Frog), a subsidiary of Opes Prime.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Green Frog is also in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Leave was sought on the basis that the applicants will not, without the leave of the Court, enforce any judgment obtained against either Opes Prime or Green Frog if leave to proceed is granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Leave was not sought by the applicants prior to commencing proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Leave on that basis is unopposed by the liquidator but the position of the receiver is more complex.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">For reasons expressed below, the leave issue will be deferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The second application is the motion of the second and third respondents (ANZ) to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry of this Court pursuant to s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">These reasons deal with the transfer motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">STATUTORY FRAMEWORK 
 Section 48 of the Act provides: 
 The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of a proceeding in the Court, direct that the proceeding or a part of the proceeding be conducted or continued at a place specified in the order, subject to such conditions (if any) as the Court or Judge imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 In addition O 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Federal Court Rules provides that the Court or a judge may: 
 1 Directions hearing --- general 

 
 (2) Without prejudice to the generality of subrule (1) or (1A) the Court may: 

...
 
(f) direct that the proceeding be transferred to a place at which there is a Registry other than the then proper place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Where the proceeding is so transferred, the Registrar at the proper place from which the proceeding is transferred shall transmit all documents in his charge relating to the proceeding to the Registrar at the proper place to which the proceeding is transferred;
 ISSUES ON THE CURRENT PLEADING 
 In Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2009] FCA 131 at [2] - [6] his Honour succinctly outlined Beconwood's claims against the respondents to those proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">An examination of the outline by his Honour of the complex claims reveals that in many respects the claims are similar to the claims brought by the applicants in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">There are some differences in this application but those differences essentially are, as I perceive it, differences arising by reason of the proper legal characterisation of the relationships and circumstances arising on the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Of course each applicant's position will differ to some extent but the extent to which there are common issues between not only the Beconwood proceedings and these proceedings but also proceedings in other States is very significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The common features substantially outweigh the differences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Beconwood proceedings were due to proceed to trial on 10 March 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It has been evident from media reports that the trial dates were vacated pending the outcome of prospective negotiations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In light of that development I invited the parties to consider whether they wished to make any further brief written submissions as to the effect of the Beconwood trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">ANZ contends that the adjournment of the Beconwood proceeding enhances its transfer argument as the gap between progress in the various cases will narrow, especially if a settlement can not be achieved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicants contend to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicants submit that the circumstances leading to the adjournment of the Beconwood proceedings, (those circumstances being a proposed scheme of arrangement to settle the various cases concerning the collapse of Opes Prime) makes it appropriate to adjourn ANZ's transfer application until the outcome of the proposed Scheme is known.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Alternatively it is argued that the adjournment justifies a 'wait and see' approach for which the applicants have advocated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In my view it may well be that a period of time to permit negotiation on complex matters may be desirable but in relation to the transfer application, there is no reason to think that such a period would not be as readily afforded in the Victoria District Registry as the Western Australia District Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">I have considered these submissions but in the end consider that the ultimate disposition of the transfer application is unaffected by the recent developments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In the absence of much more information about what may or may not ensue in consequence of the adjournment, in my view the Beconwood adjournment is more appropriately treated as a neutral factor on the transfer issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Submissions have also been received from the liquidators of Opes Prime in light of the events leading to the adjournment of Beconwood asking that the matter be stood over, save for the delivery of this decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The liquidators submit these orders should be made: 
 (a) The proceeding is listed for mention at 10.00 am on the date most convenient to the Court after 30 June 2009; 

 
 (b) All current interlocutory orders and processes be suspended until further order; 

 
 (c) The parties have liberty to apply on 72 hours notice; 

 
 (d) Costs are reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 Those submissions will be on the Court file but for reasons which will become clear, I will not rule on those submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">OTHER PROCEEDINGS 
 There are also proceedings of a similar nature to these in several courts in several States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">All of the proceedings arise from the collapse of the Opes Prime Group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">They involve characterising the legal effect of standard arrangements entered into between Opes Prime (stockbrokers) and its customers (who include the applicants) and alleged liability of ANZ arising out of those arrangements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I am informed by Mr Donaldson SC for ANZ that motions will be or have been brought in all of the proceedings to which ANZ respond, to transfer the proceedings to the Victoria District Registry of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The objective of doing so is to increase the likelihood of the proceedings being managed by one judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">In addition to Beconwood, Finkelstein J is also managing in his Honour's docket a class action Imobilari Pty Ltd v Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd. Contemporaneous directions hearings in the matters raising the same issues have been taking place in the Victoria District Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">There is also a third similar case which has been commenced before Finkelstein J, namely, CMG Equity Investments Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. In New South Wales there are two proceedings pursued by Opes Prime customers - Melewar Steel Ventures Pty Ltd v ANZ Nominees Ltd and Terpu v ANZ Nominees Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The proceedings are at a preliminary stage in Melewar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">An application to transfer the proceedings was stood over by Windeyer J so that it could be revisited if cross-vesting proved to be in the interests of justice as the case progressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There is also the matter of Solamind Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited in the Supreme Court of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I am informed that Judd J delivered an ex tempore judgment on 4 March 2009 allowing the transfer of those proceedings to the Victoria District Registry of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">I am told that there are also proceedings brought in the Supreme Court of Queensland of a similar nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">There seems a significant likelihood that most of the claims in other States will be transferred to the Victoria District Registry of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">THE PRINCIPLES 
 The appropriate principles arising in this motion are not controversial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The relevant principles presently arising, in my view are these: Factors which may be relevant for consideration include: To these points I would add, perhaps an obvious point, that a judge to whom management of a case has been allocated will be reluctant to transfer that duty to another judge unless there is good reason to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">ARGUMENT ON THE TRANSFER MOTION 
 At the hearing of the transfer motion argument in support was developed by ANZ and against it, by the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Neither the liquidator nor the receiver opposed the transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Mr Bennett, counsel for the applicants stressed those features of the pleading advanced for these applicants which are not advanced in some or any of the other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Putting aside any question of whether the case will still be run on that basis when it comes to trial, it seems to me that those individual characteristics of the pleaded case in these proceedings essentially go to conclusions of law which might be reached from the established facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It was not clear to me that the unique features of this case gave rise to any practical ramifications in terms of its management until trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">A single judge managing a series of cases which have very common features will be well placed to identify different features arising in any particular case and to make whatever provision is required to deal with the differences just as provision may be made for the common claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Mr Bennett correctly submitted that there is no suggestion that this proceeding was instituted in the Western Australia District Registry capriciously.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">A significant proportion of the applicants reside or (in the case of companies) were incorporated and have registered offices in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">An approximately equal number of applicants reside in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Mr Bennett and the instructing solicitors, Lavan Legal are based in Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">They have jointly undertaken all preliminary research and prepared all court documentation in relation to the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Nevertheless there would be nothing to preclude Mr Bennett who is experienced counsel, appearing in the Victoria District Registry as counsel at any significant hearing or appearing by video-link on general interlocutory applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">There is no reason to believe that in interlocutory applications counsel appearing by video is at any significant disadvantage, if at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Lavan Legal is a large firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The applicants, importantly, have the benefit of litigation funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It is common ground that the applicants in the Beconwood proceedings as with the applicants in this proceeding are being funded by a litigation funder, IMF (Australia) Ltd (IMF).</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Any additional costs occasioned by a transfer will not be directly born at least in the first instance by the applicants themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Mr Bennett submits that as they have not acted capriciously in their choice of Registry they should not in the absence of 'compelling reasons' be deprived of their choice of venue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In my respectful view this places the test too highly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The real question is where the case can be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them and the most efficient administration of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">It is also true that the respondents, their representatives and the external administrators of the companies in liquidation are located in Melbourne, but I accept the submission of the applicants that this should not carry great weight in balancing the relevant factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The applicants strenuously oppose consolidation of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">That opposition can be maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">I make it clear that I am not assuming one way or another that there will be any consolidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">They also contend that the logical and practical location for the trial is Perth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">However, the issue as to where the trial can most efficiently be held is not the relevant consideration in the transfer application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The proceedings are a substantial distance from trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a statement of claim and foreshadowed challenges to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">If the proceedings are transferred to the Victoria District Registry it does not necessarily follow that the trial or the entirety of the trial would be conducted there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">It is possible that part of the trial be conducted in Perth, and part of the trial be conducted in Melbourne, or elsewhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The real issue is how the proceeding can most efficiently be managed between now and trial (as well as at trial) given the substantial commonality of issues between this and other litigation presently and/or likely to be transferred to the Victoria District Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The number of and location at which there are documents is evenly balanced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Both the applicants and ANZ have adduced evidence that they have significant numbers of documents relevant to the proceedings located in each of Western Australia and Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">As the applicants observed, however, there is no reason on the evidence as to why the parties to the proceeding cannot agree on an electronic discovery protocol in accordance with Practice Note No 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The reliance by ANZ on a Victorian law provision in the Securities Lending and Borrowing Agreement (SLBA) as a basis for the proceeding being transferred to the Victoria District Registry, taken alone is not a significant factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">There is no particular reason why a Court sitting in Perth could not determine the effect of Victorian law in relation to the dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The clause is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause but its content did disclose an intention to prefer any dispute arising under the contract to be conducted in a court within the specified State: Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Anor v National Foods Milk Ltd [1998] FCA 376 and Aquila Resources Limited [2004] FCA 39 at [36] - [41].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Notwithstanding this, however, such a clause in a change of venue application does not carry significant weight where federal legislation is involved: Plantagenet Wines Pty Limited v Lion Nathan Wine Group Australia Limited [2006] FCA 247 at [61] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES 
 As observed by Carr J in Wyllie Group Pty Ltd v ANZ Securities Ltd [2000] FCA 1382 at [19] - [20] in a similar situation: 
 Given the existence of six very similar proceedings, I think that it is in the interests of justice and good case management for the same judge to oversee the interlocutory steps so that all of the matters proceed together to trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">For example, orders could be made for discovery on common issues, expert evidence and the obtaining of documents from third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Even at an interlocutory stage there could be a saving in judicial resources with one judge dealing with the interlocutory matters rather than two.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">There would certainly be a saving of that type if all of the matters were heard at the one hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">

 
 In terms of all three main factors identified by the Full Court in National Mutual Holdings the existence and current status of such very similar proceedings in the Victoria Registry weigh, in my opinion, very heavily indeed in favour of transfer from Western Australia to Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 To actually determine whether these matters can sensibly be dealt with in a coordinated way, or common issues dealt with commonly and uncommon issues dealt with in a coordinated way is best dealt with by a single judge who has significant familiarity with the relevant issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Consistency in the administration of justice and efficiency in the use of judicial resources suggest so far as possible that one judge should be responsible in determining what are substantially the same issues in these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Case management considerations suggest that one judge should manage the interlocutory aspects of the case so as to achieve the most efficient and cost effective resolution of common issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">If one judge manages the various proceedings or at least these and other proceedings in the Victoria District Registry, that may also assist in preventing or avoiding oppressive or unnecessary cross-examination of ANZ witnesses on multiple occasions, the risk of inconsistent outcomes with inconsistent findings and the prospect of diverse appeals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Significantly, a transfer may well also assist in a saving of time and costs for the applicants given the Court's familiarity with the relevant issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">These factors taken alone may not be sufficient if it would cause significant prejudice to the applicants, however, the applicants' solicitors are apparently the largest independent Western Australian law firm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">They have appeared by video-link in related Court proceedings on behalf of other Opes Prime customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">As the applicants are funded by the litigation funder IMF, the immediate costs of running interstate litigation are not directly visited on the applicants personally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">CONCLUSION ON TRANSFER 
 The predominant consideration on this motion is that the case can be continued most suitably in the Victoria District Registry, bearing in mind the interests of the parties, the ends of justice and determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">LEAVE 
 Although the liquidator was prepared to consent to the applicants' motion for leave nunc pro tunc on the conditions sought, the receiver also wished to appear on a limited basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The receiver wished to pursue by way of cross-claim, claims for debts allegedly owing by certain of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The receiver raised this point on the morning of the hearing and there was inadequate opportunity for the parties to consider their positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I heard argument and invited the parties to confer and if possible to file a consent minute in relation to the question of leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">That has not been possible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">I will not at this stage, in light of my intended disposition of the transfer application, deal with the arguments concerning that issue although I did give the parties an additional eight days to file written submissions in relation to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">As I propose to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry, the parties can take up the issue in that Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">No doubt the liquidators will also ask that there be a period of time for all parties to negotiate as their recent submissions suggest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">It is preferable that the conduct of the proceedings be supervised in their entirety in the Victoria District Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">For these reasons the following orders will be made: Pursuant to section 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the proceeding be transferred to the Victoria District Registry of the Federal Court of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The costs of this application be costs in the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The applicants' application for leave to commence proceedings against the first and fourth respondents be adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice McKerracher.</sentence>
