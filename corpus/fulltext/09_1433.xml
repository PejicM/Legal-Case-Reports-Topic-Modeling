<sentence id="s0">
 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 7 September 2009, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appellants did not appear at the hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In the circumstances, I considered it appropriate to proceed with the hearing pursuant to O 52 r 38A(1)(d) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">I noted that this is the second time that this matter has been listed for hearing in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Shortly before the matter was to come on for hearing on Monday, 16 November 2009, the Court was informed that the appellants were unable to attend the hearing that day because the first appellant (who is the principal claimant) was ill. On Saturday, 14 November 2009, the first appellant had faxed a letter to this effect, accompanied by a medical certificate stating that he was "unfit for his/her normal work" from 15 November 2009 to 18 November 2009".</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">At the appellants' request an adjournment was granted and today set as the new hearing date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In the meantime, the Court sent to the appellants a notice of the new listing of the hearing of the appeal, specifying the date, time and place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Court has received no further communication from the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">There is nothing to indicate that the appellants are unaware of today's hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">At the hearing, counsel for the first respondent relied on her written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I indicated that having read these submissions and the appellants' contentions, I would dismiss the appeal and that I would provide reasons later today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">These are my reasons for dismissing the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Before detailing these reasons, however, I note by way of background that the Tribunal found that the appellants are a married couple and citizens of Sri Lanka.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They arrived in Australia on 15 August 2008, each holding a visitor visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 11 September 2008, they lodged an application with the first respondent's Department for protection (class XA) visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Only the first appellant made substantive protection claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The second appellant's application depended on the outcome of the first appellant's application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 9 December 2008, a delegate of the first respondent refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">On 7 January 2009, the appellants applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Tribunal subsequently affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellants filed an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court, which was heard and dismissed on 7 September 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The Tribunal's decision record described the first appellant's claims, as stated in a document attached to the protection visa applications and before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">In summary the first appellant claimed: Further, the first appellant claimed before the Tribunal that: In affirming the decision under review, the Tribunal drew the following conclusions and made the following findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 (a) The Tribunal did not accept that the first appellant had a political profile such as to attract the harm that he had claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">(b) The Tribunal accepted that the first appellant engaged in various election activities including the provision of vehicles, but did not accept that he suffered the harm claimed as a consequence, nor that he would be targeted for associating with Mr Salley.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">(c) The Tribunal found that the first appellant's claimed involvement in the UNP in 2003 was not consistent with the fact that he was unaware that no general election had been held in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">As a consequence, the Tribunal did not accept that the first appellant campaigned for the UNP and Mr Salley at that point; that his house was damaged; and that he faced threats and harassment because of his high profile support for the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Nor did the Tribunal accept that the first appellant made complaints to the police as he claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">(d) The Tribunal found the claims that the first appellant would be imputed with a pro-LTTE stance and be regarded as a traitor for that reason were far-fetched and did not accept them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">(e) The Tribunal found that the extortion suffered by the first appellant was not related to his political opinion but to the fact that he was in business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">(f) The Tribunal found that the first appellant's claim to have been beaten with an iron rod around the time of the 2001 elections was an embellishment of claims and did not accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">(g) The Tribunal found, based on a lack of evidence, that the claimed forging of a power of attorney was not related to the first appellant's support of the UNP or his real or imputed political work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">(h) The Tribunal did not accept that the awarding and revoking of the lease of land was related to the first appellant's claim for refugee status as it considered the awarding of the lease and revoking of it to be a legitimate administrative decision taken on the legality of the grant and did not accept that the first appellant had arranged for the lease to be in his father's name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">(i) The Tribunal, while accepting that the first appellant was a supporter of the UNP and had participated in minor ways in a number of election campaigns, found that this involvement did not lead to a finding that the chance that he would be persecuted for his political opinion, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, was real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">(j) In relation to the claims of extortion in particular, the Tribunal found that, even if it were to accept that the first appellant would be again subjected to extortion, the evidence led the Tribunal to conclude that one or more of the Convention reasons would not constitute the essential and significant reason for such harm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">In their application before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellants raised the following matters for consideration: 
(a) Whether the Tribunal applied the wrong test in relation to State protection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">(b) Whether the Tribunal failed to discuss how the degree of State protection available in Sri Lanka could make fear of persecution at the hands of PA members/supporters an unfounded fear and whether the Tribunal failed to discuss Sri Lankan politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">(c) Whether the Tribunal took into account and placed too much weight on an irrelevant consideration, namely, the first appellant's lack of knowledge about the 2003 election and whether the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations, namely the fact that elections were held in 2000, 2001 and 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Notice of Appeal filed in this Court restated these three grounds, and the written contentions filed by the appellants in this Court were in the same terms as those filed in the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Thus, in substance, the appellants contended that the learned Federal Magistrate had erred in not finding jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">This jurisdictional error was said to arise in the three ways referred to in [6] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">These three contentions, referred to below as 'grounds', are discussed below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 Ground 1 
 The appellants argued that the Tribunal had misconstrued and misinterpreted Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the 1967 Protocol, to the extent that it is picked up by virtue of s 36(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), "in that the test is not whether the Sri Lankan government was unable or unwilling to protect the [appellant], but rather whether the [appellant] owing to a well founded fear is unable or unwilling to avail himself [of] the protection of the country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Federal Magistrate held that no question of state protection arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I agree.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal did not accept that the first appellant faced a real change of persecution for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The first respondent submitted that no error attended her Honour's approach to this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In the absence of a finding that an applicant for a protection visa has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason, there is no need to proceed to the question whether the applicant is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality (or, if without nationality, the country of his former habitual residence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">) Accordingly, this ground fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">No relevant error is disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Ground 2 
 Further, the appellants contended that the Tribunal did not discuss how the degree of state protection available in Sri Lanka could make fear of persecution at the hands of the PA members or supporters an unfounded fear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The appellants submitted that this disclosed error, because "it is well documented that politics in Sri Lanka is continuously marred by violence, particularly during election time".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal did not rely on the degree of state protection in coming to its conclusion that the first appellant did not face a real chance of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">This is correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Tribunal's findings are substantially to the effect that the first appellant did not have a significant involvement in politics in Sri Lanka, and for this reason did not face a real chance of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Further, it is plain enough from the Tribunal's reasons that it did in fact have regard to country information that described the political situation in Sri Lanka, but that the first appellant failed because of the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence and the first appellant's credibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In the circumstances, it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to enter into a discussion of state protection and Sri Lankan politics during election times as urged by the appellants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">This ground also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">No error of the kind alleged is disclosed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Ground 3
 Finally, the appellants submitted that the Tribunal addressed a wrong issue when it placed significant weight on the fact that no general election had been held in 2003, and found that this discrepancy was not consistent with the first appellant's claimed involvement with the UNP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The appellants also stated that the fact the first appellant had mistakenly said 2003 instead of 2004 should not be fatal to his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The Federal Magistrate found that this submission went to the merits of the protection visa application and that it was for the Tribunal to assess the facts before it, and to weigh the various items of evidence before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I agree with her Honour in this regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It was clearly open to the Tribunal to conclude that the first appellant's involvement in politics was minor and not relevantly significant, having regard, amongst other things, to his mistake about there being a general election in 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">This ground also fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">No jurisdictional error is therefore disclosed in the Tribunal's decision and no error is revealed in the Federal Magistrate's judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">For these reasons, I dismissed the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The appellants should pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">I indicated at the hearing that I would fix these costs, but, upon reflection, I consider that the preferable course is to order that the appellants pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal, leaving the quantum to be agreed or fixed by a taxing officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
