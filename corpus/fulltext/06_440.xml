<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 This is an application for interlocutory injunctions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The interlocutory relief falls into two broad areas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The first concerns the alleged use by the respondents of information contained in a client database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The second area concerns the respondents' use of the name 'United Insurance Advisers (National) Pty Ltd'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The application arises from the failed merger of two insurance brokerships, one conducted by the first and second applicants and the other conducted by the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The third respondent is an employee who immediately prior to the merger worked for the first applicant and who now works for the first or second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The principal of the applicant's business is Mr Arthur Kapoulitsa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The principal of the first respondent's business is the second respondent, Mr Andrew Yannopoulos, also known as Andrew Young, and I will refer to him by the latter name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 Merger discussions took place between the two businesses from September to December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The merged business commenced trading under the name United Insurance Advisers Group Pty Ltd in January of 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The merger arrangement was said by Mr Kapoulitsa to involve the incorporation of United Insurance Advisers Group Pty Ltd; the first respondent changing its name from Andrew Young &amp; Associates Pty Ltd to its current name; the second applicant procuring the third respondent, Mr Peril, to work in the business; and the relocation of the first applicant's business from Ferntree Gully to the premises of the first respondent in Richmond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The parties created a database (the 'combined database'), which they have referred to in this proceeding as the UIAG database, for the purposes of the merged business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Essentially, the combined database contained client and policy details from both businesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The first respondent contributed information from its database of approximately 2000 clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The first applicant contributed information from its database of approximately 1000 clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Commencing in January 2005, all new data relating to the conduct of the merged business, including new policies, renewals, endorsements etc was entered onto this combined database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 The merger was not a success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The reasons for its failure are not material to this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The business demerged with effect from 1 May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The applicants reverted to their original premises in Ferntree Gully.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The third respondent, Mr Peril, took up employment with the second respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6 At the time of the demerger discussions, the parties investigated the cost of dividing the combined database into its constituent parts, but they considered that the cost of doing so of some $7000 was excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Instead the two principals agreed that a duplicate of the combined database would be created and that each business would receive a copy of the combined database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The duplicate combined databases included the details and histories of both sets of clients and their transactions up to 22 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7 It also appears to have been agreed that there would be a transition period immediately after the demerger during which transactions recorded in the combined database would be finalised and administered from the Richmond premises which continued to house the respondents' business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">For this purpose the respondents would need to access client records in the combined database regardless of whether those clients came from the applicants' side of the merged business or the respondents' side.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 This administration period ran from May 2005 until approximately October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">After October 2005 there is evidence from Ms Chrisanthi Young that the combined database was no longer required to process any changes to policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Its status within the respondents' office became 'read only'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This meant it might be necessary to read information recorded there until a full year had elapsed from the date of the merger simply because of the cycle of insurance policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, a new database was established to process the first respondent's new business after 22 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">9 The applicants originally alleged that the respondents had misused confidential information in the combined database merely by cancelling the policies of certain existing clients of the applicants during the course of the post-merger administration period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This allegation was abandoned by counsel for the applicants during the course of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The allegation was, in any event, unsustainable in the face of the evidence given by Ms Raschella in her affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">She explained that policies were cancelled in the normal course during the administration period when renewal premiums had not been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES 
 
10 The principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions are well known and there is no need for any substantial restatement here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">In essence, the Court must be satisfied that there is both a serious question to be tried in a principal proceeding and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Those two questions are not considered in isolation from each other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The strength or weakness of the claim will have a bearing on what is required by way of the balance of convenience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Discretionary factors such as delay may also come into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">11 The purpose ordinarily served by an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The question essentially is whether the justice and convenience of imposing a restraint pending the hearing of the final action is required so as to prevent the practical destruction of the rights that are asserted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In this context, the adequacy of damages as a remedy also needs to be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">12 Thus far, I have referred to various introductory facts which are essentially not in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I will turn to the more crucial issues in a moment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Before doing so, it is worth repeating that on an application like this the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial, and ordinarily the Court will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It will merely inquire whether there is a serious question to be tried, and it will inquire into factual matters that bear upon the balance of convenience or discretionary considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">13 For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that a case has been made out for the grant of interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">THE COMBINED DATABASE 
 
14 I will deal firstly with the claim relating to the combined database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The applicants' essential case is that there is an implied agreement or equitable obligation not to use information in the combined database to solicit business from clients who formed part of the applicants' pre-merger client base.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The applicants' contention is not only that such an obligation exists, but that there is sufficient evidence that it has been breached at least to raise a serious question to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">15 The respondents contend that the applicants have not defined with any precision the confidential information which they seek to protect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">They contend further the combined database belongs to both the first applicant and the first respondent and that the parties envisaged that both sides would have unrestricted access to the information in the duplicate combined databases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Finally, the respondents contend that, in any event, even if an obligation can be found to exist on the facts, there is no evidence of any breach of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">16 For the purposes of this application I do not need to express a view about some of these contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">I am prepared to assume, without deciding, even at the level required for this application, that the applicants disclosed client information for the purposes of the combined database on the basis that the information would be used only for the purposes of the merged business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I am also prepared to assume, again without expressing any view about it, that an implied agreement or equitable obligation might be established to the effect that after the demerger the respondents would not use information in the combined database that derived from the applicants' pre-merger client base to solicit business from those clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">17 I can make those assumptions because it seems to me the claim fails at the next step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">There is simply no adequate evidence that any obligation of confidence or implied agreement was breached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The applicants rely on the fact that approximately 20 of its clients, who were previously serviced by the third respondent, Mr Peril, transferred their business to the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Mr Peril serviced most, if not all, of these clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The respondents have filed affidavits from Mr Peril and from these clients deposing that they were not solicited or, in their words, 'poached', by the respondents to transfer their business in this way but made their own decision to follow Mr Peril to his new employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">18 The applicants criticise Mr Peril's affidavit where it states that clients contacted him after receiving renewal notices from the first applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The applicants point out that this timing does not explain at least one client, which transferred its business to the respondents in May 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">However, in the face of the direct oral evidence that there was no active solicitation, I do not attach any significant weight to this argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Mr Peril may only have been making an assumption that the client was provoked by a renewal notice to transfer his business in the same way as others had been.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">In any event, it is quite possible that the transfer may have been the result of any number of prompts, including simply the client becoming aware that Mr Peril had moved to his new employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">There is, in short, no evidence of solicitation of clients in breach of the assumed obligation of confidence or implied agreement to which I have referred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">19 The applicants also point out that the appointment letters from various clients in favour of the respondents contain information that probably derives from the combined database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Making that assumption, I observe that the information is relevantly also the clients' information, and the clients may have instructed the respondents to draw up the appointment letters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">20 Even if I am wrong in thinking that the evidence does not rise to the level of a serious question, the case would stand at the very weakest end of the spectrum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">21 In any event, I would not grant an injunction in the circumstances of this case, having regard to my assessment of the balance of convenience and discretionary factors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Any alleged misuse of information in the combined database related to a handful of clients who followed Mr Peril.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The alleged wrongful conduct ceased by about August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The applicant complained of the conduct in late 2005 but took no action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">There is, moreover, no evidence of ongoing conduct by way of continuing misuse of information to solicit clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">These circumstances, in my view, cast further doubt on the foundations of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">They do not support the contention that there is a real threat of irreparable harm warranting the grant of injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">22 The respondents relied upon delay itself as a discretionary factor, but the respondents' counsel did not point to any prejudice occasioned by the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Its only significance may be to cast doubt on the contention that there is a serious question to be tried.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">For those reasons, the claim concerning the database information does not support the grant of interlocutory relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">THE COMPANY NAME 
 
23 I next turn to the claim based on the use of the company name United Insurance Advisers (National) Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The legal claim is founded either in passing off or in misleading conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">In my view, the evidence does not make out a case for the grant of injunctive relief that would restrain the very limited ongoing use of this name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The adoption of the name by the respondents goes back to the merger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">At the time of the merger the first applicant and the first respondent agreed that the first respondent would change its name from Andrew Young &amp; Associates Pty Ltd to United Insurance Advisers (National) Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Australian Securities and Investments Commission was so advised, and the first respondent had its licensing arrangements changed accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Effectively that means that until approximately 2006 the respondents' licence is held in the name of United Insurance Advisers (National) Pty Ltd.
 
24 There is no evidence that the first respondent has been using the disputed name other than to comply with regulatory requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">There is certainly no evidence that the name is being used actively as a trading name or promotional name for the respondents' business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">On the contrary, the evidence shows that the first respondent uses the name Andrew Young &amp; Associates as its trading name, including on its building, in its logo, on stationery and the like.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">There is no evidence that the name is used to advertise the respondents' business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">25 There is some evidence that the name was used in the post-demerger transition period between about May 2005 and October 2005 in the course of correspondence with various clients.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">This is understandable, as earlier in the year the clients were contacted using that disputed name because it was the agreed name for the merged business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was inevitable that some clients would communicate thereafter for some period of time with the respondents by reference to the disputed name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In my opinion the evidence does not establish a question, let alone a serious question, of passing off or misleading conduct contravening the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">26 In any event, where there has been for many months now no ongoing use of the name in a promotional, advertising or trading sense, it seems to me that there is no case, on the balance of convenience, for the grant of the relief sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">COSTS 
 
27 After I delivered these reasons orally, Mr Wilson, senior counsel for the respondents, applied for the costs of the interlocutory application, including reserved costs, to be paid on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">In addition, he sought an order that would dispense with the ordinary operation of O 62 r 3(3) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">This sub-rule provides that an order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceeding has been concluded, unless the Court otherwise orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">28 My attention has been drawn by counsel for both parties to well-known authorities dealing with indemnity costs, including NMFM Property v Citibank Ltd [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77, Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 and Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Court has a discretion concerning the scale of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The discretion is unfettered except that it must be exercised judicially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The cases concerning indemnity costs illustrate that much turns upon the facts of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The essential principle is that a discretion can be exercised to order costs on an indemnity basis where the actions of the unsuccessful party have been unreasonable or high-handed or where the claim in question was totally frivolous or hopeless or fundamentally flawed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">29 I have already explained why there was a clear case for the rejection of the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">In support of his application for costs, Mr Wilson drew my attention to a letter dated 22 February 2006 from the respondents' solicitors to the solicitors for the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The letter was delivered on the basis that it was without prejudice save as to costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The letter sets out the reasons why the respondents contended that the application for interlocutory relief was doomed to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In addition, it offered that if the applicants withdrew their interlocutory application before further costs were incurred and on the basis that the applicants would pay the respondents' costs of the application up to 22 February 2006 on an ordinary party-party basis, the name of the first respondent would be changed as at 14 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">30 The letter asserted that if the proposed interlocutory application proceeded and it was lost, then costs would be sought on an indemnity basis and on the basis that they be paid forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">It may be that the offer to change the name of the first respondent with effect from 14 May 2006 did not meet that part of the case brought by the applicants which was of most concern to them, which related to the client information in the combined database.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Nevertheless, it did address an important part of the interlocutory relief that the applicants were seeking, namely a restraint on the use of that name.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">31 This is a case in which there are grounds for thinking that the applicants and their advisers should have known that the interlocutory application was likely to fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">The case is very close to the line of being so fundamentally flawed that it would attract an exercise of discretion to award indemnity costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">On the other hand, I am conscious that until the respondents filed evidence, the case may have appeared much stronger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">At the hearing the applicants drew attention to what they said were discrepancies in the evidence and issues of timing that they said gave weight to their allegations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">They ought to have realised then that their case was very weak, but it would go too far to say it was totally frivolous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">In all the circumstances and despite the fact that I have hesitated about this matter, I have concluded that it is not a case in which I should order indemnity costs or taxation forthwith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">ORDERS 
 
32 Accordingly, I will make orders that the application for interlocutory relief be dismissed and the applicants pay the respondents' costs of the interlocutory application, including reserved costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.</sentence>
