<sentence id="s0">
 The applicant is a citizen of India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">She says that she suffered persecution in India both because she is Hindu and also because she was an advocate for women's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">As a young woman, she lived in a part of India dominated by Muslim people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">She was an active student leader at the University in Hubli.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She advocated liberation for women and their greater involvement in public life.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Because of this she was regarded as having western values.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">She was criticised by conservative elements, especially from the Muslim community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant said that on Independence Day, 15 August 1994, she had been invited to hoist the national flag at the Idagh Maidan at Hubli.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">There were objections from the Muslim community because a mosque was located on the same ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant claimed that she was kidnapped and kept under house arrest so the flag raising ceremony could not take place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">She also claimed that her parents were threatened and her house ransacked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">When she reported this to police she said that they abused all of her group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The applicant said that when she was being held by those who kidnapped her, she was tortured and abused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">She claimed that she was released only after she promised to leave the place within 24 hours.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">She and her family were threatened with elimination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">They moved to Bangalore the next day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The applicant claimed that she had narrowly escaped a massacre in Hindu dominated areas by Muslims supported by the police.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">She also said that with the support of her husband, whom she married in Bangalore, she began to speak publicly in support of Hindu people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">She said she spoke against those who tried to instigate hatred between Muslims and Hindus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">She was regarded by some as a person opposed to the Muslim minority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On one occasion she had made a speech in favour of better community relations following the destruction of the Babri Mosque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The applicant said that whenever a Muslim festival was held in her area she was taken into protective custody.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Other Hindu activists were taken into custody and sometimes were killed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She feared for her life and ultimately left India for Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The applicant arrived in Australia in July 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Shortly after her arrival she applied for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">This was refused by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 11 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) on 30 August 2005 for review of that refusal, however the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate on 24 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">In its reasons for decision the Tribunal did not consider her to be a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">It found that she was not connected with the controversial event of the flag raising at Idagh Maidan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">It is not necessary for present purposes to go into the factual matters that the Tribunal relied upon in reaching that finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">They included inconsistencies with the historical record and in the applicant's own evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Tribunal also found that she did not provide the correct date at which the Babri Mosque was destroyed nor explain the contradiction between her evidence about that and independent country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had come to public attention as either a student leader or an advocate for women's rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It found there was nothing to support her claims that she was adversely regarded by Muslims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Nor was there anything to support her claims that she had been kidnapped or taken into police custody to silence her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The Tribunal was not prepared to accept the applicant's other unsupported assertions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">It found that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in India based on the matters that she had put forward.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">When her judicial review application came before the learned Federal Magistrate it took the form of an application for an order to show cause why relief should not be granted against the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The learned Federal Magistrate listed the matter for hearing under r 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Courts Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It was not apparent to him then that the application disclosed an arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">An amended application was filed on 20 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The applicant did not make any submissions but relied upon her amended application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In that amended application she claimed that the Tribunal made a mistake about the question of effective State protection under the Refugees Convention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The learned Magistrate pointed out that the Tribunal did not find it necessary to decide whether effective State protection from Indian authorities would have been available to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">This was because the Tribunal had found her claims of a well-founded fear of persecution were not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The applicant claimed that procedures required by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) had not been observed in the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">However the application did not show what procedures she said had not been observed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Other general grounds were relied upon without any support.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The learned Magistrate found that there was nothing in the amended application which showed an arguable case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">He therefore dismissed the application under r 44 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the decision of the Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The proposed notice of appeal sets out a number of grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">These are expressed in very general terms and they are not particularised so as to identify any error on the part of the Magistrate or the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">There is, in my opinion, no prospect of success on the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The Tribunal's decision turned upon its view of the facts of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">There was no jurisdictional error exposed in the application to the learned Magistrate, nor was there to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The application for leave to appeal will be dismissed with costs fixed at $1,200.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
