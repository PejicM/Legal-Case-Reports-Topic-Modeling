 SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
 
1 I delivered reasons for judgment in this matter on 24 February 2006 ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd (ACN 095 154 108) (in liquidation) [2006] FCA 146) and stood the matter over until today to enable orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">My attention has been drawn to the fact that I did not explicitly deal with the form of order for compensation to be made in respect of Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited insofar as there was a claim for contingent loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Loncaric negotiated the appointment of two sub-distributors by Carlon Pty Limited by passing on to those potential sub-distributors the misrepresentations made to him by the relevant respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The consideration received from those sub-distributors has been included in the calculation of the actual loss claimed by Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Each sub-distributor has demanded compensation from Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited --- $55,000 in one case and $85,000 in another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">That led to deeds being entered into between Carlon Pty limited, on the one hand, and each of the sub-distributors, on the other.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The gist of the deed is that sub-distributors would refrain from suing and would release Carlon Pty Limited from liability on the basis that Carlon Pty Limited would include the claim from the sub-distributors in the claim made against the respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 I am satisfied that the terms of s 87 are wide enough to authorise the inclusion of orders which have the effect of indemnifying Carlon Pty Limited from claims by the sub-distributors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Burchett J made a similar order in Oraka Pty Ltd v Leda Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-558.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">That judgment was set aside on appeal but not because of any fault in the relief granted ( Leda Holdings Pty Ltd v Oraka Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-601).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Beaumont J, who dissented in the Full Court, expressly approved that order (at 40,509).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It was supported by the authorities referred to by Burchett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">(See also State of Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 261 and Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 545).</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Whether such an order should be made is for the discretion of the Court in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 In my opinion, the claims made by the sub-distributors mean that Carlon Pty Limited is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of the relevant respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It seems to me that an order based upon the quantified claims is appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Whilst there may be some debate about the legal effect of the deed between the parties, the overall intent is clear enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There is no reason to limit the liability of the respondents on that account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The order will be framed to ensure that the amount in question will be passed on to the sub-distributors if and when received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
