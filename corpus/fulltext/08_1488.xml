<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The first respondent, Oobi Baby Pty Ltd, is a company that is controlled by the second respondent, Ms Riggs, she being the company's sole shareholder and director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Oobi Baby designs and imports clothing and toys for babies and young children which it sells to retailers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, alleged that during the course of its business Oobi Baby engaged in resale price maintenance in contravention of s 48 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and that Ms Riggs was knowingly concerned in those contraventions and brought their action to obtain appropriate relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Oobi Baby and Ms Riggs conceded the contraventions occurred and that Ms Riggs performed them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">They joined with the ACCC in filing submissions as regards the appropriate orders that should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I granted the relief sought which took the form of declarations of contraventions, injunctions restraining future contraventions, the imposition of a penalty of $40,000 and publication and compliance training orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">What follows are my reasons for granting that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">2 Oobi Baby sells its products through its website.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It makes no sales directly to the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Oobi Baby has only a small part of the children's toy and clothing market.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It employs four full-time employees, including Ms Riggs and her husband, and engages one independent contractor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In the 2006/2007 financial year, Oobi Baby had a turnover of $958,541 from which it derived a net profit after tax of $128,622.90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The net profit for the 2007/2008 financial year is estimated to be $268,041.34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 Section 48 prohibits resale price maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It is a per se offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Sections 96 and 96A describe the conduct that constitutes resale price maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Relevantly for present purposes, the following conduct by a supplier when dealing with another person (the recipient) constitutes resale price maintenance: (1) making it known that the supplier will not supply goods unless the recipient agrees not to sell them at a price below the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(a)) ; (2) the supplier inducing, or attempting to induce, the recipient not to sell the goods at less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(b)) ; (3) the supplier entering into an agreement to supply goods, or offering to enter into such an agreement, which includes a term that the goods not be sold at a price less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(c)) ; (4) the supplier withholding goods where the recipient has sold, or is likely to offer for sale, the goods at a price less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(d)) ; and (5) the supplier using, in relation to goods, a statement of price likely to be understood by the recipient as the price below which the goods should not be sold (s 96(3)(f)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The infringing conduct engaged in by Oobi Baby arose out of dealings with 15 retailers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The offending conduct occurred over a period of approximately nine months between April and December 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It occurred when retailers sold the products purchased from Oobi Baby at below what Oobi Baby regarded as an appropriate price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Sometimes this happened by virtue of the mode of sale, for example by offering Oobi Baby products for sale via internet auction sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 In most cases the contravening conduct is evidenced by 24 emails sent by Oobi Baby to its retailers, comprising 19 separate acts of resale price maintenance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The emails were sent at the direction of Ms Riggs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">In broad outline the emails can be grouped into four categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Category one emails contained statements in which Oobi Baby made it known to the retailer concerned that products would not be supplied unless the retailer agreed not to sell at a price less than the recommended retail price (s 96(3)(a)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">An example reads: "Anyone who is unwilling to adhere to the RRP will in the future no longer be able to stock Oobi".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Category two emails contained statements by which Oobi Baby attempted to induce the retailer not to sell products at a price less than the recommended retail price (s 96(3)(b)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">An example of this type of email reads: "I think that absolutely everyone will be putting up their prices if they haven't already (if you see anyone who isn't drop me a line and I'll confidentially have a word with then).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">" Category three emails contained refusals by Oobi Baby to supply retailers by reason that the retailer was selling products at a price less than the recommended retail price (s 96(3)(d)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">An example reads: "Although we have asked you to adhere to the RRP (as is stated in our Terms and Conditions on our website: http://www.oobi.com.au ) you have been discounting and we feel that we are unable to monitor this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Therefore we reluctantly have to discontinue supply to your store as we cannot guarantee that you will commit to our terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">" 
 
6 One additional email was specified in category four.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Emails in each of categories one, two and three, as well as the email in category four, amounted to Oobi Baby using, in relation to products to be supplied or that may be supplied to the retailers, a statement of price likely to be understood as the price below which goods are not to be sold (s 96(3)(f)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">An example from the category four reads: "If you are a web-based reseller then there is 100% mark-up plus GST (for example $10 w/s plus GST x 100% = $22.00 RRP).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">"
 
7 In one case the contravening conduct (s 96(3)(c)) was constituted by the publishing of "Supply Terms" on Oobi Baby's website containing the following term:
 Oobi Baby&amp;Kids does not supply Ebay stores, auction sites or any discount stores, websites or similar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Stores found selling our products on Ebay or undercutting on current stock will be immediately deleted from our system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">We reserve the right to insist that you remove all items from any auction, underselling or Ebay store should we find that you are selling Oobi Baby in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">By acceptiing [sic] our orders you accept these terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">8 The despatching of the emails and the publication of the "Supply Terms" justified the making of declarations of contraventions and the grant of injunctions restraining future contraventions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 So far as the penalties were concerned many cases have examined the Court's task in considering a joint position on penalties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The applicable principles are authoritatively dealt with in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and Minister for Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; [2004] ATPR 41-993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I do not need to recite them here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The upshot of the authorities is that the Court should not depart lightly from a joint position put forward by the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount "within the permissible range" of penalties that might properly be imposed: NW Frozen Foods at 291.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">10 The parties suggested a $40,000 penalty be imposed on Oobi Baby, payable by four six monthly instalments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">No separate penalty was sought against Ms Riggs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 Ordinarily, when there have been 20 contraventions of s 48 a penalty greater than $40,000 ought to be imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">It is clear that Parliament views acts of resale price maintenance seriously, deeming them to be contraventions without proof of any adverse effect on competition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is simply assumed that a contravention will have that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In my view, however, a penalty at the lower end of the scale was justified in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">A number of factors led me to that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">It is a well settled proposition that the imposition of penalties is directed at deterrence, both specific and general.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In this case a penalty of the size proposed would have the requisite deterrent effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It represents a significant financial obligation for a small company in its fledgling years, but it is not so high as to be oppressive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Additionally, while the conduct was undertaken deliberately and systematically, it was done in ignorance of the law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">That is, Ms Riggs simply did not know what she was doing was illegal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">I had the impression she was somewhat shocked to discover that her attempt to prop up her brand was unlawful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I also took into account by way of mitigation the small scale of the conduct in the context both of Oobi Baby's business operation and its market share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Finally, there was the willingness of Ms Riggs to co-operate fully in the investigation by the ACCC at an early stage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">12 I accepted that a separate penalty should not be imposed on Ms Riggs, despite her orchestration of the conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">As sole shareholder of Oobi Baby, Ms Riggs will feel the burden of the penalty imposed against the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In the 2007/2008 financial year, Ms Riggs drew a salary of $50,000, having previously drawn $20,000 per annum since the company's inception in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Ms Riggs' husband likewise also draws a salary of $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">When the penalty is accounted for they will take less from the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In these circumstances it is a legitimate course to avoid punishing Ms Riggs twice over for what is, in effect, the same conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673 at [294] , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349 ; [2002] ATPR 41-905 at [27] - [29] , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 997 ; [2000] ATPR 41-777 at [13] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Associate:
