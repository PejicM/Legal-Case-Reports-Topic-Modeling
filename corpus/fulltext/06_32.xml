1 A point has arisen on the pleadings that can conveniently be disposed of under O 29.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It is an interesting point which, I think I am correct in saying, has not previously come before an Australian court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The issue arises in the following way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The patents in suit (which correspond with several United States patents) were granted jointly to Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the University of British Columbia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Each patentee claims title to the inventions by assignment from the US inventors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In the case of UBC, it claims title from two only of several persons claiming to be inventors namely Helen Burt and John Jackson.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant alleges, however, that neither Burt nor Jackson was one of the inventors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">So it argues that the patents must be revoked for they could only have been granted to the actual inventors or those claiming under them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">2 Assuming it can make out the facts, the resolution of the applicant's contention depends not so much on the effect of s 138(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), which permits the revocation of a patent granted to a person not entitled, but upon the proper construction of s 15 , which specifies to whom a patent may be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Section 15 provides:
 
 
 (1) Subject to this Act, a patent for an invention may only be granted to a 
 person who: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) is the inventor; or 
 (b) would, on the grant of a patent for the invention, be entitled to have the patent assigned to the person; or 
 (c) derives title to the invention from the inventor or a person mentioned in paragraph (b); or 
 (d) is the legal representative of a deceased person mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A patent may be granted to a person whether or not he or she is an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 
 

The question in issue is this: If a patent is granted to several persons, must each of them be, or claim through, an inventor?</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The answer to that question is, I think, to be gathered from the history of the section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">3 The patent system in England had its origins in the royal grants by which monopolies in trade and manufacture were conferred by the Crown in the exercise of the prerogative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">These monopolies were granted to "any man [who] by his own charge and industry, or by his own wit or invention, doth bring any new trade into the realm": Darcy v Allin (1602) Noy 173, 182.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In his Institutes , Sir Edward Coke said: "The reason wherefore such a privilege is good in law is because the inventor bringeth to and for the common wealth a new manufacture by his invention, costs and charges, and therefore it is reason, that he should have a privilege for his reward (and the encouragement of others in the like) for a convenient time": 3 Coke's Institutes 184.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The monopoly could be granted not only to the inventor but also to the person who first brought the new invention into England: The Clothworkers of Ipswich Case (1615) 1 Godb 252; Shepherd's Abridgment , Pt III, Prerog, 61; Hawkins Pleas of the Crown , vol 1, c 29, s 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">4 The first statute which regulated the grant and sole use and exercise of an invention was the now famous Statute of Monopolies, 21 Jac 1, c 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">By this statute, which was declaratory of the common law, it was provided, in the sixth section, that a patent could be granted to the "true and first inventor or inventors" of any new manufacture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The inventor was the person who made the discovery; that is, the idea for it originated in his own mind: Jones v Pearce (1831) 1 WPC 121, 124.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The inventor was also the person who first introduced the invention into the realm: Edgeberry v Stephens (1693) 2 Salk 447.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It sometimes was said that the grant to a person not the inventor but the importer of the invention should be regarded "as a sort of anomalous decision": Marsden v Saville Street Foundry and Engineering Co, Ltd (1878) 3 Ex D 203, 205 per Jessel MR. 
 
5 Until 1883 a patent could only be granted upon the application of the "true and first inventor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This was changed by the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act 1883 , 46 &amp; 47 Vict, c 57, ss 4 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">According to those sections, which appeared in subsequent enactments, any person could make application for a patent (s 4(1)) or two or more persons could make joint application for a patent (s 4(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Moreover, a patent granted to several persons was valid even if only one of them was the "true and first inventor": s 5(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Consequently, "a capitalist [could] advance money to a needy inventor and obtain an interest in the patent from the beginning": Frost, Patent Law and Practice , 3 rd ed, vol 1 (1906) 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 Shortly after the passage of the 1883 Act doubt was expressed concerning the identity of the persons to whom a patent could be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">For example, in Brice, Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (1885) it was suggested that under s 5(2) a person who brought an invention into the realm might not now be granted a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Brice wrote (at 3): "If this section were construed strictly, an importer, merely as such, plainly cannot apply for, and therefore cannot receive a grant of letters patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">" He suggested ways of getting around the problem.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Some also suggested that s 5(2) had removed the ability of several persons to obtain a grant jointly if any one of them was not the inventor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">7 These doubts were removed by the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 1885 , 48 &amp; 49 Vict, c 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 1 provided that the Act was to be construed together with the 1883 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Section 5 provided that: "Whereas doubts have arisen whether under the principal Act a patent may lawfully be granted to several persons jointly, some or one of whom only are or is the true and first inventors or inventor; be it therefore enacted and declared that it has been and is lawful under the principal Act to grant such a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">" 
 
8 Most, but not all, of the Australian colonies adopted the English patent legislation with few modifications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">The exceptions were Victoria and Western Australia where the legislation was different in significant respects.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Relevant for present purposes is the Victorian statute, the Patents Act 1889 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">That Act provided that the only person who could apply for a patent was the "actual inventor" or his assigns or legal representatives (if deceased) or a person to whom the invention had been communicated by the "actual inventor" or his representatives or assigns: s 7(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The application for the patent was required to declare that the applicant, or, if more than one, the applicants, claimed to be the "true and first inventor or inventors": s 8(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">"True and first inventor" was defined in s 3 to mean "the actual inventor of any invention" or his assigns or legal representatives, "but shall not include a person importing an invention from any other colony or country without the authority of the actual inventor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">No provision was made for the grant of a patent jointly to several persons if not all were the "actual inventor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As we shall see, this approach followed the pattern of the patents legislation in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">9 The first Commonwealth statute dealing with patents was the Patents Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That enactment contained provisions concerning applications for patents that were in part modelled on the Victorian Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In particular, ss 32 and 33 provided: 
 
 
 32 (1) Any person whether a British subject or not may make an 
 application for a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">
 
 (2) Two or more persons may make joint application for a patent 
 and a patent may be granted to them jointly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 
 
 
 (3) Any of the following persons may make application for a 
 patent -- 
 (a) The actual inventor; or 
 (b) his assignee agent attorney or nominee; or 
 (c) the actual inventor or his nominee jointly with the 
 assignee of a part interest in the invention; or 
 (d) the legal representative of a deceased actual inventor 
 or of his assignee; or 
 (e) any person to whom the invention has been 
 communicated by the actual inventor his legal 
 representative or assignee (if the actual inventor, his 
 legal representative or assignee is not resident in the 
 Commonwealth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 
 33 (1) An application for a patent shall be for one invention only, and 
 must be made in the form prescribed and must be lodged by 
 being left at or sent by post to the Patent Office in the 
 prescribed manner, and must be accompanied by either a 
 provisional specification or a complete specification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) The application must contain a declaration in the form 
 prescribed setting out the facts relied on to support the 
 application and must be signed by the applicant and attested 
 by a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">
 
 (3) Subject to this Act the application shall date from the time 
 when it is lodged in the Patent Office.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 
 

The reason for adopting these provisions instead of following the English legislation was explained during the second reading of the Bill in the Senate, where the Bill had originated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, said: 
 
 "The Bill differs from the English law, and from the law of all the Australian States, with the exception of Victoria and Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In England, and in four of the Australian States, it is held, following an old decision under the Statute of Monopolies, that a person who introduces an invention is entitled to a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">We say that that may have been a correct thing to provide at a time when the difficulty of communication between countries was very great, and when it was a matter of almost equal importance for a man to introduce the invention of another, as to discover the invention himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">We think that now that the world has grown so much smaller, because communication has been rendered so much more easy, this particular right of monopoly should be granted to the inventor, and to the inventor only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">" (Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, Senate, 15 July 1903, 2081-2082.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">) 

During the debate in the House of Representatives there was discussion about the use of the word "actual" in the expression "actual inventor" appearing in cl 28, which later became s 32(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">On this point Mr (later Mr Justice) Higgins said: 
 
 "In the statute of James concerning monopolies and patents, the words 'true and first inventor' are used, and the phrase has always been held to include those who import articles from abroad.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The object in using the word 'actual' is to get the benefit of the decisions in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">'Actual inventor' is the phase [sic] used in the Act of Congress.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">It has a definite meaning, which it would be a pity for us to attempt to qualify.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It means the person who has discovered a thing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The phrase 'true and first inventor' is held to include those who import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">'Actual' is the best word to use.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" (Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 29 September 1903, 5508-5509.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">) 

Later, when asked whether the expression "actual inventor" would include assignees, Mr Higgins said (at 5509):
 
 "In clause 28, a distinction is drawn between the actual inventor, and the assignee or his nominee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">'Actual inventor' means the person whose brains have performed the work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">" 
 

10 In one form or another ss 32 and 33 appear in all subsequent Patents Acts with no change that is significant for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">In the 1990 Act the principal difference is that the adjective "actual" has been dropped.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">This is likely to have been the result of Parliament's intention to enact legislation that is easy to read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Mr Jones, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, who had introduced the Bill into the House, said in relation to its drafting: 
 
 "The drafting style in the Bill breaks some new ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The definitions in the back are in the form of a dictionary in a schedule ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It is a splendid piece of drafting and a Bill that is notably easy to read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 ... 
 [L]anguage seems to have two simultaneous but contrary habits, and they are both evident in old Acts of Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">First, it tends to atrophy, so you find a plethora of archaic expressions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Second, and paradoxically, language seems to proliferate without cause at times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">I am delighted with the way this Bill attempts to counter the degenerative linguistic evolution of both kinds which has been characteristic of much legislative drafting in the past.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">" (Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 1 June 1989, 3481-3482.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">) 

Be that as it may, as regards the intended effect of cl 15 the Explanatory Memorandum stated (at 6) that: 
 
 "This clause lists the categories of persons to whom a patent may be granted, and provides that a patent may be granted to a person whether or not he or she is an Australian citizen.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Broadly, a patent may be granted only to the inventor of the invention concerned or to a person deriving rights from the inventor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">" 
 

11 In light of what was said by Mr Higgins during the debate on the 1903 Act, to ascertain the meaning of "inventor", as well as the intended effect of s 32, it is necessary to look at the "decisions in the United States" that Mr Higgins most likely had in mind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">They are decisions which consider the Patents clause of the US Constitution , Art I SS 8 , cl 8 (giving Congress the power to secure to "inventors" the "exclusive right to their discoveries") and, in some instances, the early US patent statutes (under which a patent could be granted to the person who "hath or have invented or discovered" (1790), or had "invented" (1793), or had "discovered or invented" (1836), a new and useful art).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">There are three decisions of the US Supreme Court that are likely candidates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The first is Gibbons v Ogden , 22 US 1 (1824).</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">This was not a patent case but it did discuss the Patents clause in the following passage from the judgment of the court (at 58-59) delivered by Chief Justice Marshall: 
 
 "The power, as granted in the constitution, is a limited power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is a clear principle, that when the means of executing any given power are specified in the grant, Congress cannot take, by implication, any other means, as being necessary and proper to carry that power into execution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">This power, then, is limited: (1) As to the persons and objects in regard to which it may be exercised: these are, 'authors and inventors, writings and discoveries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">' This enumeration excludes all right in Congress to legislate on the subject of any improvement, which is not an 'invention', either domestic or foreign.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">It excludes also all right to legislate for the benefit of any person who is not himself 'the inventor'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">(2) As to the means of executing the power, and the time during which those means may be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">They are by 'securing the exclusive right for limited times.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">'" 
 

12 The second case is Kennedy v Hazelton , 128 US 667 (1888).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">This was an action for the specific performance of an agreement to assign a patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The defendant, however, was not the true inventor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The action failed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Justice Gray delivered the opinion of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">He said (at 672): "The patent law makes it essential to the validity of a patent, that it shall be granted on the application, supported by the oath, of the original and first inventor, (or of his executor or administrator,) whether the patent is issued to him or to his assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">A patent which is not supported by the oath of the inventor, but applied for by one who is not the inventor, is unauthorized by law, and void, and, whether taken out of the name of the applicant or of any assignee of his, confers no rights as against the public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">"
 
13 The final case from the Supreme Court is Agawam Company v Jordan , 74 US 583 (1868).</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">It is a leading case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">There is a passage in the judgment of Justice Clifford which is regarded as a classic statement of the applicable principle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">It reads (at 602-603): 
 
 "No one is entitled to a patent for that which he did not invent unless he can show a legal title to the same from the inventor or by operation of law; but where a person has discovered an improved principle in a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, and employs other persons to assist him in carrying out that principle, and they, in the course of experiments arising from that employment, make valuable discoveries ancillary to the plan and preconceived design of the employer, such suggested improvements are in general to be regarded as the property of the party who discovered the original improved principle, and may be embodied in his patent as a part of his invention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 Suggestions from another, made during the progress of such experiments, in order that they may be sufficient to defeat a patent subsequently issued, must have embraced the plan of the improvement, and must have furnished such information to the person to whom the communication was made that it would have enabled an ordinary mechanic, without the exercise of any ingenuity and special skill on his part, to construct and put the improvement in successful operation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">" 
 

14 The application of these principles leads inevitably to the following rules which, I am entitled to assume, were likely known to Mr Higgins.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">First, a valid patent can only be granted to the real inventor and if there be more than one inventor it must be granted to all: Thomas v Weeks , 2 Paine 92 (1827); Barrett v Hall , 2 F Cas 914 (1818); Carter v Perry , 8 OG 518 (1875).</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">Second, in the case of a joint invention, a patent issued to only one of the inventors is void: Ex parte Barsaloux, James and Lyon , 16 OG 233 (1878); American Electrical Novelty &amp; Manufacturing Co v Newgold , 108 F 957 (1901) aff'd 113 F 877 (1902).</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Third, a patent issued in the names of joint patentees will, unless all of them are the inventors, also be void: Stewart v Tenk , 32 F 665 (1887); Hotchkiss v Greenwood , 12 F Cas 551 (1848); Welsbach Light Co v Cosmopolitan Incandescent Gaslight Co , 100 F 648 (1900).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">See also W Robinson, The Law of Patents , vol 1 (1890) 570-573.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">15 It might fairly be said, and it often was said, that this last rule had the potential to cause injustice, particularly if there was a bona fide mistake in, say, an applicant incorrectly nominating himself as the sole inventor or inadvertently including another as one of the inventors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The potential for injustice has been overcome by the Patents Act 1951 (US), 35 USC SS 256.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The section provided:
 
 Whenever a patent is issued on the application of persons as joint inventors and it appears that one of such persons was not in fact a joint inventor, and that he was included as a joint inventor by error and without any deceptive intention, the Commissioner may, on application of all the parties and assignees, with proof of the facts and such other requirements as may be imposed, issue a certificate deleting the name of the erroneously joined person from the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">
 

In its current form, the provision is to the same effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">16 Now it is clear that when Parliament enacted s 32 of the 1903 Act it intended that a patent would be granted only to the true (Parliament used the word "actual") inventor or a person claiming under him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">In particular, "capitalists" could no longer take an interest in a patent, save as assignee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Nor could a patent be granted to the "importer" of an invention unless he had the consent of the inventor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover, one necessary consequence of the adoption (with the limited exception of the importer with consent) of the US model was that a patent that was granted to one of two inventors was not granted to the "actual inventor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Nor was a patent granted to the "actual inventor" if it was granted jointly to two or more persons one of whom was not the inventor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The position must be the same under the 1990 Act for there is no material difference in language.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">This conclusion accords with the result in Davies Shephard Pty Ltd v Stack [2001] FCA 501 ; (2001) 51 IPR 513, although I have reached it by a different process of reasoning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">17 The respondents say that even if the grant be contrary to s 15, the patents in suit cannot be revoked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">They put the argument as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">First, the power to revoke is to be found in s 138(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">That sub-section provides that the court may revoke a patent on any of the following grounds: 
 
 (a) that the patentee is not entitled to the patent; 
 (b) that the invention is not a patentable invention; 
 (c) that the patentee has contravened a condition in the patent; 
 
 
 (d) that the patent was obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; 
 (e) that an amendment of the patent request or the complete specification was made or obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; 
 (f) that the specification does not comply with subsection 40(2) or (3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">
 
 

The next step is that, seeing that it is permissible to issue a patent to joint inventors, the words "the patentee is" in s 138(3)(a) must, in the case of a joint grant, be read as "the patentees are" (see also s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The conclusion that is then said to follow is that a patent can only be revoked under paragraph (a) if all "the patentees [are] not entitled to the patent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">" 
 
18 I do not agree with this construction of s 138(3)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">I accept, as I obviously must, that in the case of a joint patent it is proper to read s 138(3)(a) as covering joint patentees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Nonetheless, such a reading does not carry the respondents' argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">If one of several patentees is not entitled to the patent, then it is still correct to say (as it would be in the case where none of the patentees were entitled) that "the patentees are not entitled to the patent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">19 The respondents also contend that, having regard to the use of the present tense in s 138(3)(a), a condition precedent to a revocation order is a finding that the patentees were not entitled to the patent at the time of the application for revocation (or perhaps at the time of the hearing).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">I am far from persuaded that this construction is correct and it seems to be contrary to the views of Cooper J in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1999) 47 IPR 525, 536 and Crennan J in JMBV Enterprises Pty Ltd v Camoflag Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1474 , [130]-[131].</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">But even if this construction were correct, the way in which I would read the section is that if a person were not entitled to the patent at the time of grant then, at least in most cases, that non-entitlement would be (as here) a continuing state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">So there is really nothing in the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">20 In any event, if s 138(3)(a) were not available to the applicant, it might rely on s 138(3)(d) and contend that if its assertions of fact are proven at trial the grant was obtained by "false suggestion or misrepresentation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">As to the availability of false suggestion in the circumstances see Minter v Wells (1834) 1 WPC 127; R v Mussary (1834) 1 WPC 41; Earl of Devonshire's Case (1687) 11 Co 90.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">21 The result is that the question raised under O 29 (slightly reworded) -- "If the facts particularised under paragraph 7 of the further amended first, second and third particulars of invalidity are established by evidence, does the Court have power to revoke the first, second and third patents pursuant to s 138(3)(a) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth)?</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">" -- should be answered "Yes".</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">22 This answer leaves open for further consideration (if that consideration becomes necessary) the following questions: (1) If the ground of revocation is made out, is the making of a revocation order discretionary and, if so, should that discretion be exercised; (2) Is Angiotech able to seek a declaration under s 34(1) that it is an "eligible person" in relation to the claimed inventions so that it may then take steps to obtain a grant of the patents for itself; and (3) Is the power of rectification under s 192 available in lieu of a revocation order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">23 In the meantime, it will be necessary for the respondents to pay the costs of this application.</sentence>
