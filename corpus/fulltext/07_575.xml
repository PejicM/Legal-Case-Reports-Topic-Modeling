 Introduction 
 
 This is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') given on 6 February 2006 affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The appeal is instituted pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') and is confined to a question of law --- see [11] and [12] below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The reviewable decision before the Tribunal (see ss 63 and 64 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the SRC Act')) was the decision of an Independent Review Officer of the first respondent ('Comcare') on 1 December 2004 affirming a determination dated 25 October 2004 that, as at 1 December 2004, the applicant was not presently entitled to compensation under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act for two distinct injuries allegedly suffered during his employment with the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Those injuries were a psychological condition and a soft tissue injury to his neck.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">No appeal is brought against the Tribunal's decision affirming the reviewable decision in respect of the neck injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It is not disputed that during 1988, the applicant suffered an injury of extreme anxiety and that, on 24 February 1989, Comcare accepted liability of the applicant's psychological condition which was described as an 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There is also no dispute that, as at 1 December 2004, the psychological/psychiatric condition was a delusional/paranoid disorder and that it was a condition which made, and continues to make, the applicant unfit for work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 In the Tribunal 
 
 The first issue considered by the Tribunal was whether, as at 1 December 2004, the date of the reviewable decision, the applicant continued to suffer from an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression that continued to entitle him to compensation under s 16 of the SRC Act for medical expenses and under s 20 for incapacity benefits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">At [25] the Tribunal found that, as at 1 December 2004, the applicant did not continue to suffer from the adjustment disorder for which Comcare accepted liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">However, the Tribunal found that, as at that date, the applicant suffered from a delusional/paranoid disorder that had disabled him from continuing to work, but for which Comcare did not accept liability.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The second issue considered by the Tribunal was whether the applicant's employment in the Department of Social Security ('DSS') at Gosford from 29 August 1989 --- he had previously worked in the Australian Taxation Office ('ATO') at Sydney from 30 March 1987 and subsequently in the DSS at West Ryde prior to his transfer to Gosford --- gave rise to a psychiatric condition which was compensable under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In relation to this second issue, the Tribunal first considered whether there had in fact been a claim made for a condition after 1 December 1988 when the SRC Act replaced the Compensation Commonwealth Government Employees Act 1971 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">At [23] it concluded that, in substance, such a claim had been made under the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">At [24] the Tribunal said: 
 
 'The sum of these letters and records indicates that Comcare has consistently accepted that Mr Buhr had an ongoing claim for his mental condition although it accepted liability from time to time only for the adjustment disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Whether it worsened to the extent of a delusional disorder or paranoid personality disorder or other, the decision under review, made on 1 December 2004, properly took in the continuing claims of Mr Buhr about his psychological condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">This is so despite the lack of a formal claim having been lodged detailing a new condition after 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">I find, therefore, that the reviewable decision before the Tribunal does take in the psychological condition of Mr Buhr as at 1 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It follows that the Tribunal may properly consider Mr Buhr's condition as at 1 December 2004 and events after the introduction of [the SRC Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">' 
 
 
 The Tribunal then considered whether the claim made by the applicant for his current psychological condition was compensable under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It concluded, by reason of the exclusion in the definition of 'injury' in subs 4(1) of the SRC Act --- that it 'does not include any such disease, injury or aggravation suffered by an employee as a result of ... failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment' --- and by reason of the construction of that exclusion by a Full Court of this Court in Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; (2005) 145 FCR 29, affirming the first instance judgment of Whitlam J in Comcare v Hart (2004) 139 AAR 396, in particular at [11], [21] and [22], that it was not: [33].</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 5 September 2006 I granted the applicant leave to file a further amended notice of appeal raising four questions which are said to be questions of law on which the appeal to this Court is instituted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">These questions were framed as follows: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider and determine whether the applicant's delusional/paranoid disorder was a compensable 'injury' under s 14 of the SRC Act?</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in making a determination under s 14 of the SRC Act in respect of a new 'injury' of the applicant when the applicant had not made a claim under ss 53 and 54 of that Act to Comcare in respect of such an injury?</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in finding the applicant's claim for compensation of 10 October 1988 for an injury of extreme anxiety and for which Comcare accepted liability on 24 February 1989 gave rise to a liability for compensation under s 14 of the SRC Act?</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">
 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in determining that the progression or worsening of a disease for which liability had previously been accepted constituted a new and distinct 'injury' for the purposes of s 4(1) of the SRC Act and for which liability must be established under s 14 of that Act?</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 At the outset, counsel for Comcare submitted that none of these questions was a question of law; at best, each of the questions involved mixed questions of fact and law and this was not sufficient to support an appeal pursuant to s 44 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In this regard, counsel for Comcare referred to what was said by Branson J sitting in a Full Court of this Court in Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at [13] --- [16], with whose reasons Spender J and Nicholson J agreed, namely: 
 
 '[13] The nature of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act was considered in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 38 AAR 55 by Stone J and me particularly at [10]-[18].</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">We expressed our approval of the observation made by Gummow J in TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 19 ATR 1067 at 1069-1070 that an appeal "on a question of law" is narrower than an appeal that merely involves a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As his Honour pointed out, where an appeal lies "on a question of law" the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">That is, the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated as required by O 53, r 3(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">
 
 [14] The legislature, by creating a statutory right of appeal to a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in the narrow terms of s 44(1), disclosed an intention to limit the capacity of the Court on an appeal under s 44(1) to review factual findings of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">An appeal pursuant to s 44(1) is thus quite different from an appeal from a judicial body under s 24 of the Federal Court Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">An appeal under s 24 is an appeal by way of rehearing (see, Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 211 at [35]-[47]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The subject matter of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act is (shorn of the requirement to determine what, if any, entitlement to relief flows from the answer to the question or questions of law) of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law to the Court made under s 45 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 [15] In Birdseye Stone J and I also expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corp v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 that: 
 
 
 
 If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like "erred in law" or "was open as a matter of law" can make it into a question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 
 
 [16] A mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Stone J and I observed in Birdseye (at [18]): 
 
 
 
 In our view, O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the Tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">' 
 
 
 
 
 I think Comcare's submission on this ground is correct and that it would not be inappropriate to dismiss the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">I have no doubt that questions 2, 3 and 4 are mixed questions of fact and law; my only doubt concerns question 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Because I can foresee an argument that it is a question of law, rather than undertake a comparative assessment of the arguments for and against the correctness of that proposition, I propose to deal with all the questions on which the appeal is brought on the basis that they are questions of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">But as Gyles J recently said in Condell v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 44 at [20] : 
 
 '... that does not convert the appeal into a full appeal or permit findings of mixed fact and law to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">An appeal on a question of law can only succeed if legal error in the AAT decision is demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">' 
 
 Question 1 
 
 The first question is said to be sourced in the ground that the Tribunal should have found, on the proper application of s 25 of the AAT Act and ss 61 and 62 of the SRC Act, that its jurisdiction was limited to reviewing a decision made pursuant to ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act in respect of the cessation, as at 1 December 2004, of compensation payments for an accepted injury of the applicant of 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression and chronic soft tissue injury': Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84 and Australian Postal Corporation v Oudyn (2003) 73 ALD 659.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">In short, it should have found that it did not have jurisdiction at large to hear and determine whether an injury, other than the accepted injury, was compensable under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Where the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under s 25 of the AAT Act to make or review a determination under s 14 of the SRC Act, the parties cannot consent to the Tribunal being vested with such jurisdiction: R v Moodie; Ex parte Mithen (1977) 17 ALR 219 and Rosillo v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2003) 77 ALD 396 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It lay at the core of the applicant's submission that the determination of Maricar Failla, the first tier decision-maker, dated 25 October 2004 was confined to a decision to cease compensation payments under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act on the basis that, as at 1 December 2004, claims for such payments no longer arose from the applicant's accepted injury of adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The first tier determination of Ms Failla did not, it was submitted, relate to a decision as to whether there was any liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for a new injury of delusional/paranoid disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">It was further submitted that the determination of the Comcare Independent Review Officer, David Warwick, affirming the original decision of Ms Failla, was not a determination as to whether there was any liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for a new injury of delusional/paranoid disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">But the Tribunal, on review, the applicant submitted, adopted an approach that differed substantially from that which had been adopted by the original decision-maker and on reconsideration in that it determined whether Comcare was liable for the applicant's delusional/paranoid disorder injury under s 14 of that Act: reference was made to [6] of the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That is, it treated this as a new injury for which the applicant had made a claim under the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The applicant contended that this approach was contrary to the evidence and contrary to the principles in Lees , which have not been disturbed by the decision in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford [2006] FCAFC 87 ; (2006) 151 FCR 253 and which have been followed in Australian Postal Corporation v Mowbray &amp; Anor [2003] FCA 1258 ; (2003) 77 ALD 440, Oudyn and Duong v Australian Postal Corporation (2005) 41 AAR 288.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In summary, the applicant submitted that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to determine whether the delusional/paranoid disorder was an injury for which Comcare was liable under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">What was before the Tribunal was the review of a decision as to whether, as at 1 December 2004, the claims for ongoing payment of compensation under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act arose from the applicant's accepted injury of adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">On the other hand, Comcare submitted that the reviewable decision of 1 December 2004 considered whether liability should be found under the SRC Act for the applicant's delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">This was plainly a 'reviewable decision' within the meaning of subs 60(1) vide s 62 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Accordingly, a challenge based simply on jurisdiction is not sustainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">It also submitted that the question of whether liability should be accepted for a delusional disorder was considered at all stages of the decision-making process that began in 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In this regard, Comcare referred to a brief summary of the relevant history of the matter in support of its submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Comcare acknowledged that up to 2003 the applicant's condition had been accepted as an 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">However, as part of its administration of the matter, Comcare arranged for the applicant to be periodically medically reviewed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In September 2003 Comcare obtained a report from an independent psychiatrist, Dr Brown, who opined that the applicant was no longer suffering from an adjustment disorder, anxiety or depression that was work related, but was suffering from a constitutional 'delusional disorder'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The diagnosis of a delusional disorder was then supported by the applicant's own psychiatrist, Dr Greenway, in his reports.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, Dr Greenway related it to events that had occurred when the applicant returned to work on a return-to-work program at the Gosford DSS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">Following receipt of these reports, Comcare on 3 February 2004 gave notice of an intention to review ongoing payments in respect of the applicant's 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It was authorised to carry out such an 'own motion' review by subs 62(1) of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The letter also annexed a Statement of Reasons that, in Comcare's submission, specifically addressed whether the applicant was separately entitled to compensation for a delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The applicant then submitted a further report from his treating psychiatrist, Dr Greenway, dated 19 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The final paragraph of the letter claimed: 
 
 'Thus, Mr Buhr appears to have had little support in his attempt at returning to work at Gosford and it appears that even before he started there, it had been decided that he was not wanted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">There is no doubt that the attitude of the people at work has contributed to the exacerbation of his delusional disorder, which I do not think, will improve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 
 
 On 25 October 2004 Comcare formally determined that the applicant was not presently entitled to benefits under s 16 or s 20 for his 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The letter also incorporated the Statement of Reasons annexed to the letter of 3 February 2004, that, according to Comcare, specifically addressed liability for the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The letter also referred to Dr Greenway's report of 19 April 2004 and his view that the applicant's delusional disorder had been affected by events at the Gosford workplace.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">However, the delegate made a finding that the applicant's allegations concerning these events were either 'refuted or unfounded'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">No liability was accepted in this determination of 25 October 2004 for the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">But a denial of liability for a condition does not mean that liability for it was not considered; according to Comcare it clearly was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Comcare therefore rejected the assertion in the applicant's submissions that this decision did not consider liability for the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Further, according to Comcare, it was unnecessary for this decision to address all of the matters --- see [35] of Lees --- that were necessary to give rise to liability under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The delegate was satisfied that a relevant matter, namely whether the employee had suffered a work related 'injury', had not been established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">This was sufficient, on the reasoning of the delegate, to deny liability for the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The contention in the applicant's submission that 'the first tier decision of the process found that as at 1 December 2004 the anxiety and depression had progressed to a delusional/paranoid disorder' is, according to Comcare, wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The decision simply found that as at 1 December 2004, on the medical evidence, benefits were not payable under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act for an 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'; the decision also rejected liability for a work related delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">On 1 November 2004 the applicant's solicitors sought review of this decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicant was entitled to do this pursuant to subs 62(2) of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Further, under subs 62(3), the applicant was required to set out reasons for the request.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">This the letter did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Although, in the main, the letter pressed the anxiety condition as requiring the continuation of benefits, it also argued that Comcare was liable for the applicant's delusional disorder which had been exacerbated by his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">On 1 December 2004 Comcare reviewed the decision dated 25 October 2004 and, according to Comcare, directly considered the issue of whether liability should be found for a delusional disorder that the applicant claimed was related to his work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Thus, there was, Comcare submitted, a hierarchy of decision-making, under the SRC Act, that dealt with liability for the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Comcare further submitted that when it carried out its review under s 62 (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">in making its reviewable decision on 1 December 2004) it was authorised under subs 62(5) 'to make a decision affirming or revoking the determination or varying the determination in such manner as it thinks fit ' (emphasis added).</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The applicant was seeking ongoing compensation under ss 16 and 20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The review officer was not only entitled, but was obliged, to consider whether the original condition was persisting and/or whether some other psychiatric condition had arisen, to take its place, that may be compensable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Finally, Comcare submitted that, on any view, the Tribunal had before it a reviewable decision that presently refused the applicant compensation under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act for the condition of 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Tribunal was not simply limited to considering the case within the four corners of a diagnosis that had been accepted previously if it was no longer apt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">It was entitled to consider the evidence available to it and assess whether or not liability should be found for another mental condition that had emerged in the ongoing progress of the case: Hannaford , per Heerey J at [10] and [11].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">There is no doubt, in my view, that the first tier decision-maker, Ms Failla, in making her determinations of 25 October 2005, relied on and embraced as reasons for her decision, the 'Statement of Reasons' referred to in and accompanying her proposal letter to the applicant of 3 February 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">That statement contained the following relevant observations and findings: 
 
 '56.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Dr Brown further opined on the balance of probabilities Mr Buhr's Delusional Disorder is not related to his employment with the Commonwealth, but rather the expression of a constitutional predisposition prior to his employment with the Commonwealth and a progression of that psychological constitution's reaction to ongoing situations as he perceived them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The only connection to his Commonwealth employment is that his delusions are focused on this and he would be sensitive to any perception that he was rejected, considered inferior, was under threat or discriminated against.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In terms of fitness for employment Dr Brown was of the opinion that Mr Buhr is not psychologically fit for any employment due to his Delusional Disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 ... 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">In order for compensation to be payable under the SRC Act, it must be established that an employee:- 
 
 
 
 
 (i) suffered an injury arising out of, or in the course of, that employment: or 
 (ii) suffered an ailment or the aggravation of any such ailment that was contributed to in a material degree by the employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">
 
 
 
 
 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The weight of the evidence suggests that Mr Buhr is no longer suffering a condition that arose out of or materially contributed by his Commonwealth employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The condition Mr Buhr now suffers from is as a result of constitutionally acquired paranoid personality disorder, which has manifested into a Delusional Disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Both specialist Dr Brown and Dr Greenway are of the opinion that Mr Buhr suffers from a Delusional Disorder that has been brought about by his own perception regarding events associated with his Commonwealth employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">... 
 
 62.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">With regard to the mental condition I note that a number of allegations made regarding the cause of Mr Buhr's mental condition have been refuted or have been unfounded (refer point 15 &amp; 42) and therefore supports the fact that it is his own perception of the events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Examples of these include conspiracy within the Public Service against him, audited by the tax department as a gesture of victimisation, persecuted by denying him a transfer on medical grounds, refused training.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Including (as reported to Dr Brown and Dr Greenway) that he was threatened and that the Assistant Manager placed a needle in his arm and injected a material which would cause him to develop cancer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">
 
 63.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">...</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">I accept on the basis of the medical doctors and specialist opinion that Mr Buhr may have suffered from this condition, however the "adjustment disorder" that was caused by his Commonwealth employment has now ceased and the condition Mr Buhr now currently suffers from namely "Delusional Disorder" is as a result of a constitutional predisposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">
 
 ... 
 
 69.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">Based on the evidence above and the requirements of the SRC Act 1988 I propose to determine that Mr Buhr suffered an "adjustment disorder" and a "strained neck" as a result of his Commonwealth employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">However the conditions suffered have since ceased and the condition Mr Buhr now currently suffers from is a "delusional disorder" which is constitutional rendering him totally unfit for employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">' 
 
 
 In my view, a fair reading of the Statement of Reasons, in particular the passages extracted in [33] above, would lead one to conclude that Ms Failla, as the first tier decision-maker, did determine that Comcare had no liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for the applicant's current (at that time) injury of delusional/paranoid disorder because it was '... not related to his employment with the Commonwealth, but rather the expression of a constitutional predisposition prior to his employment by the Commonwealth and a progression of that psychological constitution's reaction to ongoing situations as he perceived them'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">I am also of the view that a fair reading of the 'Reasons, Decision and Notice of Rights' which accompanied Mr David Warwick's (the Independent Review Officer) letter to the applicant of 1 December 2004 would lead one to conclude that he had affirmed Ms Failla's determination that Comcare had no liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for the applicant's current injury of delusional/paranoid disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">This is reflected in the following passage from the 'Reasons, Decision and Notice of Rights': 
 
 'As noted in the determination of 25 October 2004, Dr Greenway's report is based on the [applicant's] account and perception of events during his employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">A number of allegations made by the [applicant] have been refuted or have been unfounded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">From the medical evidence it is clear that the [applicant] has a medical condition and that his perception of events during his employment are related to his psychological constitution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">I do not consider that the [applicant's] condition of delusional disorder is related to his employment, nor am I able to establish that the [applicant's] perceptions are based on fact and meet the reality test as required in Wiegand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">... 
 
 The fact that I must consider is whether the [applicant's] employment contributed to an exacerbation of his delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">From the evidence I am satisfied that the [applicant's] perception of the issues mentioned above have probably contributed to exacerbations of his delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">However, as mentioned in Dr Brown's report, these exacerbations would be transient exacerbations ... the effects of which would have long ceased given the [applicant] has not been subject to those stressors since he was retired in 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">I am also satisfied, based on the medical evidence that any contribution to the [applicant's] current condition relate to the [applicant's] perception regarding his rights and the management of his claim, which for the purposes of the Act are not compensable'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">
 
 
 In these circumstances, I do not consider the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to consider the applicant's psychological condition as at 1 December 2004 and events after the introduction of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In other words, its finding and conclusion at [24] of its reasons is not infected with legal error and this ground cannot be sustained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In conclusion on this ground, I would merely add that if my conclusion was wrong and the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to consider the delusional disorder and/or that no claim had been made for it (see question/ground 2 below), I agree with counsel for Comcare that there would be clear futility in remitting the case to the Tribunal for reconsideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">If the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction initially, it would not be in a better position to consider these issues on remittal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">
 Question 2 
 
 This question is said to be sourced in the ground that the Tribunal should have found that, on the proper construction of the scheme of the provisions of the SRC Act, as set out in Lees , that a pre-requisite to Comcare making a determination as to whether it had a liability for a delusional/paranoid disorder injury of the applicant was the making of a claim by the applicant, pursuant to s 54 of the SRC Act, for such an injury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The fact that a review decision concerning the applicant's eligibility for compensation payments under ss 16 and 20 of the SRC Act took into consideration the applicant's condition at the date of that decision did not give rise to a decision in respect of liability for a condition for which a claim had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">There is a certain overlap between this ground and the first ground; both go to the question of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider and determine whether the applicant's delusional/paranoid disorder was a compensable injury under s 14 of the SRC Act although the first ground was predicated on the premise, implied if not express, that a claim for such an injury had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The present ground raises the anterior issue --- whether a claim for such an injury had been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">At [23] of its reasons, the Tribunal acknowledged that the applicant had not made a formal claim after the commencement of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">But the Tribunal went on: 
 
 '... [the applicant] did respond to an enquiry by Comcare after 1 December 1988 ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">In my view Comcare treated Mr Buhr's complaint as if a formal claim had been lodged after commencement of the [SRC] Act ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">Accordingly, I consider that the continuing correspondence from Mr Buhr and Comcare's responses and medical investigation of Mr Buhr's claim should be treated as a claim and acceptance of that claim under the [SRC] Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">' 
 
 
 Comcare submits that the Tribunal's finding was open on the evidence before it and was made without legal error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Comcare refers to a brief summary of the facts as demonstrating that the Tribunal's finding was open on the evidence: 
 
 &#8226; The applicant had forwarded a number of letters to Comcare in which he asserted that he had sustained a psychiatric injury at the Gosford office of the DSS (i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">after 1 December 1988) --- letter from the applicant to Comcare dated 12 June 1990 and letter from the applicant to Comcare dated 1 June 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">&#8226; Thereafter, the applicant's treating psychiatrist continued to forward medical reports to Comcare, on the applicant's behalf, which linked his psychiatric condition to events at work at Gosford:
 - Dr Greenway report of 27 August 1990
 - Dr Greenway report of 10 February 1991
 - Dr Greenway report of 17 October 2003
 - Dr Greenway report of 18 November 2003
 - Dr Greenway report of 11 December 2003 
 
 There was, Comcare submitted, ample material before the first tier decision-maker in which the applicant claimed that events at work at Gosford had affected his psychiatric state.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Comcare conceded that there is no dispute that Lees at [29] set out what ordinarily will be required of a claim under s 54 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">In particular, that it be in writing and that it should be supported by a medical certificate: s 54(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">However, it observed that Lees did not fully set out the terms of s 54.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">In particular, it noted that subs 54(5) of the SRC Act also states: 
 
 'Strict compliance with the approved form referred to in subsection (2) is not required and substantial compliance is sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">' 
 
 
 Comcare further submitted that the Tribunal's conclusion at [23] is consistent with s 54 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">That is, notwithstanding the applicant's lack of a formal claim for a delusional disorder, the requirements of the section were, on the facts of this case, substantially complied with by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">Finally, reference was made to the rationale for ss 53 and 54 of the SRC Act, namely, to prevent prejudice to Comcare by late notification of events that could give rise to a claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Comcare has long been aware of the general nature of the applicant's complaints about his work between 31 August 1989 and 26 November 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Neither the applicant nor Comcare adduced evidence that Comcare had been prejudiced by a claim being made in the way it was.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">I agree that the Tribunal's finding at [23] was open on the evidence and that, notwithstanding the lack of a formal claim for a delusional disorder, the requirements of s 54 were, on the facts of this case, substantially complied with by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I am therefore of the view that the Tribunal's finding at [23] does not raise a basis for an appeal on a question of law under s 44 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">
 Question 3 
 
 The difficulty I have with this question is that I cannot identify in the Tribunal's reasons where it found the applicant's claim for compensation of 10 October 1988 for an injury of extreme anxiety and for which the respondent accepted liability on 24 February 1989 gave rise to liability for compensation under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">I do not read [6] of the Tribunal's reasons, in particular the sentences --- 
 
 'In relation to Mr Buhr's psychological disorder a preliminary question arose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">The first question was whether Mr Buhr suffered an injury or disease compensable pursuant to s 14 of the 1988 Act' 
 

as being a reference to the applicant's claim for compensation of 10 October 1988 and for which Comcare accepted liability on 24 February 1989.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">These sentences clearly refer to the delusional or paranoid disorder that had disabled him from continuing to work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In any event, nothing in [6] amounts to a finding of the Tribunal; the paragraph is nothing more than a statement of the issues before the Tribunal, albeit an arguably ambiguous statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">
 The closest one comes to a finding of the kind raised in question 3 is in [25] of the Tribunal's reasons, however, read carefully, what is said there is a long way short of a finding that the applicant's claim for which Comcare accepted liability gave rise to a liability for compensation under s 14 of the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">Indeed, the Tribunal made no finding, in express terms, that liability for the adjustment disorder had been accepted specifically under the SRC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There is, but only arguably, an implication of such a finding in the Tribunal's reference to Oudyn in the context that the finding that the applicant's claim for his current psychological condition is not compensable under s 14 and does not override any continuing liability for the accepted condition of adjustment disorder, but that is as far as it goes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">It is not, in my view, sufficient to sustain an error of law on the part of the Tribunal of the kind raised in question 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 Question 4 
 
 This question is said to be sourced in the ground that having found that the applicant's condition progressed from the earliest accepted 'injury' of 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression' to a delusional/paranoid disorder condition (at [25] of the Tribunal's reasons), the Tribunal should have found that the applicant's subsequent condition formed part of his compensable injury under the 1971 Act: Comcare Australia (Department of Defence) v Madia (2002) 36 AAR 69.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In making its finding that the applicant's condition had progressed, the Tribunal implicitly accepted that the underlying patho-physiological condition, which caused the accepted injury and the subsequent condition, had not changed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">On this basis it was not a new injury for which liability under s 14 of the SRC Act had to be established or accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">My difficulty with this ground is that it seems to be predicated on the proposition that what was said by the Tribunal at [25] of its reasons, in particular its use of the phrase: 'The condition had progressed ...', amounts to a finding that the 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression led, of itself, to the delusional disorder'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In the face of the evidence referred to at [15] and [16] of the Tribunal's reasons and the Tribunal's actual findings at [29] and [31] --- [33] of its reasons, I cannot accept that what the Tribunal said at [25] amounts to such a finding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">And if there is no such finding, the ground and its inherent question of law do not arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">Dealing first with evidence --- 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The psychiatrist who first diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a delusional disorder, Dr Brown, considered it was a constitutional condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">He based the diagnosis on a claim by the applicant that he had been injected in the neck by his supervisor at the Gosford DSS in 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">On the other hand, the applicant's treating psychiatrist, Dr Greenway, linked the applicant's delusional disorder to his treatment at the Gosford DSS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Dr Lambeth, called on behalf of the applicant, also considered the delusional disorder was contributed to by events at the Gosford DSS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">He did not think it was related to the applicant's employment at the ATO.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">It was also clear from the medical evidence that the diagnosis of a delusional disorder was a quite distinct ailment from that of 'an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The delusional disorder had its own DSM-IV classification and diagnostic criteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">
 
 The debate in the case was whether the delusional disorder was a purely constitutional condition or whether the events that occurred when the applicant worked at the Gosford DSS (after 1 December 1988) acted on a paranoid personality to produce, over time, the condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The debate was not whether the applicant's work prior to 1 December 1988 or his adjustment disorder suffered in 1988, without more, had subsequently brought on a delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">I agree with the submission of Comcare's counsel that, when the evidence and the factual issues before the Tribunal are understood, there is no room for the applicant's contention that the Tribunal implicitly found that the delusional disorder was due to the same 'underlying patho-physiological condition' as the adjustment disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The Tribunal made no finding to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">As I have already indicated, I also agree with his submission that the essence of the applicant's appeal on this ground is based on the use of the word 'progressed' in [25] of the Tribunal's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">However, he further submits that particular words in a decision-maker's reasons should not be read in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">If ambiguity is present, the words should be interpreted 'beneficially' to the decision-maker: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272, approving Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Finally, I agree with his submission that the word 'progressed' in [25], understood in context, does not mean the Tribunal was making a finding that the adjustment disorder had, of itself, led to the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Rather it is properly read as merely descriptive of how the applicant's delusional disorder emerged from events which occurred at the Gosford DSS that acted upon the applicant's underlying paranoia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Tribunal clearly considered whether these particular events had such an effect and concluded that they had ([33]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">This finding, in itself, is inconsistent with a suggestion that the adjustment disorder, which arose before 1 December 1988, was the same 'patho-physiological condition' as the delusional disorder.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Tribunal went on to find that liability did not arise for this condition because of the operation of Hart .</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">A challenge to reasons based on an alleged implicit finding that is inconsistent with each of the case as run before the Tribunal, the evidence adduced by both parties, and the actual findings of fact in the Tribunal's reasons, cannot sustain this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">
