<sentence id="s0">
 The Applicant is the Trustee of the bankrupt estate of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The principal asset of the First Respondent, who has been declared bankrupt, is a house at 3 Wallace Street, Delahey, in the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The Applicant applies for orders under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act") requiring the First Respondent and the Second Respondent, whom the evidence satisfies me also resides at the property, to vacate the property within 21 days so that it may be sold and the proceeds made available to the creditors of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">There are also orders sought requiring the Respondents to remove from the property vehicles, rubbish and personal chattels which have not vested in the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">An order is also sought that, in the event that this does not occur, the applicant be authorised to remove and dispose of such property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The application is supported by a number of affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">These included the primary affidavit of the Trustee, as well as a supporting affidavit from the Trustee's solicitor and affidavits of service for both the First and Second Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The application and the affidavits have, I am satisfied, been served on the two Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">When the matter was called on this morning, they did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The evidence establishes that the two Respondents reside at the property, known as 3 Wallace Street, Delahey, and have done so for some time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">When the Trustee first moved to sell the property, the Second Respondent made offers, through a solicitor, to purchase the property, but those offers did not bring a sale to fruition, largely because the Second Respondent did not provide the necessary documentation, and in addition, there was an issue as to the adequacy of the sum offered by way of a proposed purchase price.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Subsequently, there was correspondence between the Applicant and the Respondents in which the Applicant made plain its wish to have vacant possession of the property in order to sell it, as a result of the failure of the Second Respondent to carry forward her proposal to purchase the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Thereafter, nothing of substance appears to have been done by the Respondents and they remain in occupancy of the property without the leave of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Applicant relies on ss 30 and 77 (1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Section 30 provides, relevantly, that the Court may grant injunctions and other orders which it considers necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Section 77(1)(g) imposes on a bankrupt an obligation to aid, to the full extent of his power, in the administration of his estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It is plainly necessary that the Applicant be in a position to provide any purchaser of the property with vacant possession in order to facilitate a sale, and it is also necessary, in order to achieve that end, that the property be placed in such a condition that it may be attractive to a potential purchaser.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The Respondents, despite having been given the opportunity to do so, have prevaricated and have not responded to requests that they vacate the premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Accordingly, in my view, it is appropriate that the orders sought in the application should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Associate:
