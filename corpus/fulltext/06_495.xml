 Introduction 
 
 1 I have before me a Notice of Motion filed on 6 April 2006 by the Applicant in the proceeding and heard on 21 April 2006 by which the Applicant seeks a Mareva order for the preservation of assets of the Second Respondent and certain third parties until the final determination of the action or earlier order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 This is the second occasion upon which the Applicant has sought Mareva orders of the kind now sought including an order directing the Second Respondent to bring into the Commonwealth of Australia and deposit in an account in a bank headquartered within the Commonwealth, funds in an amount of US$2 million or AU$2,854,700.00 and an order requiring the Second Respondent to deliver up his current passport to the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">3 On the first occasion such relief was sought, Kiefel J on 10 March 2005 declined to make orders of the Mareva kind but did make Anton Pillar orders by which the Respondents were ordered to permit the Applicant's solicitor, Mr Peter Mills, and other nominated persons together with independent supervising solicitors to enter the premises of the Respondents and search for, inspect and remove into the custody of the nominated individuals, documents listed in Schedule A of that order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Respondents were also ordered to deliver up to the Applicant all originals and copies of the documents and classes of documents identified in Schedule A to the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">See: Lifetime Investments Ltd v Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 226.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">4 Kiefel J declined to make a Mareva order on the basis that the evidence did not establish a real risk that the Second Respondent might dispose of or deal with his assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Her Honour observed that the evidence established that the First Respondent did not have any assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Her Honour further observed that the Applicant must establish a sufficient likelihood of risk which, in the circumstances of the particular case, justified an asset preservation order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">5 The Applicant now contends that since then, circumstances have changed and material is now available arising out of the execution of the Anton Pillar orders and other material which reveals facts from which, on an interlocutory basis, a conclusion can safely be reached that the Applicant has a demonstrated claim of real strength against both Respondents, inferences of dishonest conduct and the secretion of monies on the part of the Second Respondent are plainly open and there is a real risk that either the Second Respondent or third party entities controlled by the Second Respondent will dispose of "assets (including claims and expectancies) so as to frustrate the process of the Court by depriving the plaintiff of the fruits of any judgment obtained in the action": Jackson v Stirling Industries Ltd [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612 per Deane J at 625.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">6 The Applicant says this is the class of case where an analysis of the essential character of the conduct of the Second Respondent reveals duplicity and dishonesty and in such a case, the Court will readily draw an inference of real and serious risk to the Applicant of dissipation of assets, particularly movable assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">Accordingly, it will be necessary to examine the foundation of the Applicant's claims in a little more detail than usual for interlocutory purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">7 Accordingly, the Applicant seeks orders appropriately framed to serve the purpose of preventing the Second Respondent from effecting such a deprivation: Jackson v Stirling Industries Ltd (supra) at 625.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">8 Orders are not sought against the First Respondent since, on 16 February 2006 a liquidator was appointed by the Supreme Court of Queensland to the First Respondent on the application of an unsecured creditor, Mr Roger de Saint Quentin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">By operation of s471B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), the Applicant cannot proceed with the present action against the First Respondent (which is being wound up in insolvency) or proceed with enforcement process in relation to property of the First Respondent except with leave of the Court and on such terms as the Court determines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">No application has yet been made for leave to proceed against the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Applicant says, based upon searches and enquiries reflected in the affidavit material that the First Respondent has no identifiable assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Applicant says it is presently assessing its position in relation to the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">9 On 19 April 2006, the liquidator wrote to Forbes Dowling, Lawyers, the agents for the solicitors for the Applicant advising that the liquidator would not appear at the hearing of the Notice of Motion and had no objection to the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Notwithstanding that letter, no interlocutory relief (and no leave) is sought against the First Respondent, in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">10 The immediate focus for final relief in the action and presently interlocutory relief is the conduct of the Second Respondent, the causes of action the Applicant says it has against the Second Respondent and the risk of the Applicant being deprived of an effective remedy consequent upon a trial as a result of the Second Respondent dealing with his assets and the assets of entities under his control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">11 The Second Respondent says that nothing has changed since 10 March 2005, no assets have been dissipated and any steps taken by the Second Respondent in relation to his assets or assets vested in the trustee of his family trust simply have the effect of building assets within the jurisdiction which will ultimately be amenable to any process undertaken by the Applicant for recovery of any judgment which the Applicant might obtain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Having said that, the Second Respondent does not, in terms, concede that assets vested in the trustee of the Second Respondent's family trust are amenable to execution or a tracing order in respect of the claims made by the Applicant against the Second Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Moreover, the Second Respondent says no evidence has been adduced to support the claim that US$2 million transferred by the Applicant to the First Respondent as a result of the relevant arrangements is traceable into any of the Second Respondent's personal assets or a pastoral property called Colinton Station owned by J &amp; D Wallader Pty Ltd as trustee of the Wallader Family Trust and operated by Colinton Station Pty Ltd. 
 
12 The Second Respondent has raised a significant number of objections to paragraphs of affidavits relied upon by the Applicant in support of the Notice of Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I will deal with the resolution of those objections at the conclusion of these Reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In making observations about the evidence and the history of events, I have excluded any evidence I have ruled inadmissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">13 Counsel for the Second Respondent, Mr O'Donnell QC raises four further threshold matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">First, the Applicant is an entity incorporated in the West Indies, has no assets in the jurisdiction and carries on no business within the Commonwealth of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Accordingly, the usual undertaking as to damages is, in truth, meaningless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Secondly, quantification of the loss flowing from the interlocutory orders sought will be difficult and hence the discretion should be exercised against making any order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Thirdly, in the event the Second Respondent is successful in the proceeding, he will be left in a position of seeking to recover costs and any damages pursuant to the usual undertaking, in the West Indies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Fourthly, Mr O'Donnell QC also says the Applicant has brought proceedings and seeks interlocutory relief based upon a contract and a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity both dated 30 March 2001 both of which are susceptible to stamp duty either pursuant to the Stamp Act 1894 (Qld) or the Duties Act 2001 (Qld) and the duty has not been paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">It follows, it is contended, as a result of either or both Acts that neither instrument is available for use "in law or equity or for any other purpose and must not be received in evidence in a legal proceeding, other than a criminal proceeding": s487(1) , Duties Act 2001 (Qld), s4A Stamp Act 1894 (Qld).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">14 Accordingly, Mr O'Donnell QC contends that the statutory prohibition arising out of the failure to pay stamp duty has the result that any claim by the Applicant based upon the documents or the underlying causes of action founded upon the documents, is not presently judiciable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Such a claim might be made judiciable by payment of the duty or an undertaking by the Applicant or its solicitor to pay any duty demonstrated to be payable in respect of the instruments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">15 Since the failure to pay stamp duty is said to present an absolute bar to any relief final or interlocutory founded upon either the documents or any underlying causes of action, I invited Mr O'Donnell QC to identify the basis upon which either document is an instrument susceptible to stamp duty under the relevant legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Mr O'Donnell QC was not able to do so and sought leave to make further written submissions on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">16 I gave leave to make further submissions by 4.00pm on Monday, 24 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">17 The Applicant seeks Mareva orders pending the trial of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The Interim Order 
 
18 On Monday, 24 April 2006, I made certain orders for the preservation of assets limited until 4.00pm on Friday, 28 April 2006 and re-listed the Notice of Motion for 11.15am that day to deal with the scope of possible orders until the trial of the action and to consider further directions in relation to outstanding matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">I also made directions that the Applicant provide submissions in response to the stamp duty point and in response to objections to evidence by the Second Respondent by 10.00am on Thursday, 27 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The objections to evidence had been provided to counsel for the Applicant shortly before the commencement of the hearing and could not be dealt with on the day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The Order of 28 April 2006 
 
19 Having considered all of the material, I made the Mareva orders recited in the formal order of 28 April 2006 and advised the parties that I would publish these Reasons very shortly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">It also seemed to me to be important to resolve the controversy between these parties by a trial of the proceeding as soon as possible both in order to determine the claims of the Applicant and to identify the horizon by which the Mareva orders would be discharged upon the Second Respondent being successful in the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Accordingly, I allocated provisional trial dates of 28, 29 and 30 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Should the trial proceed on those dates, the Mareva orders will be in place for approximately two months.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Directions Orders 
 
20 I also made, by consent, the following directions:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The Applicant to give discovery of its documents by 4.00pm, 19 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Second Respondent to inspect the Applicant's document by 4.00pm, 26 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Second Respondent to give discovery of its documents by 4.00pm, 26 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Applicant to inspect the Second Respondent's documents by 4.00pm, 2 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Applicant to file and serve all statements upon which it intends to rely at the trial of the action, by 4.00pm, 23 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Second Respondent to file and serve all statements upon which it intends to rely at the trial of the action, by 4.00pm, 16 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The proceeding to be listed for review at 9.30am on Tuesday, 20 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The directions hearing at 9.30am on 25 May 2006 is to be vacated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The matter is to be listed provisionally for trial on 28 June 2006, 29 June 2006 and 30 June 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Costs of this directions hearing are to be reserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">
 

21 The Applicant commenced these proceedings on 7 March 2005 and made ex parte application for a Mareva order and an Anton Pillar order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Since then, interlocutory steps have progressed in a fashion with a number of delays.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Applicant attributes those delays to the Respondents and is critical of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The Second Respondent says, in response, that the Applicant has been dilatory in the prosecution of the litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It will be necessary to refer to the sequence of events in some detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The Applicant sought to bring this further application ex parte .</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">However, having regard to the history of the events and the passage of the litigation, the matter was listed on notice to both the liquidator and the Second Respondent notwithstanding that, in the ordinary course of events, an application for a Mareva order would be considered ex parte in the face of urgency and a contention of real risk to the Applicant arising out of facts reflected in supporting affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The Affidavit Evidence of the Applicant 
 
22 The Applicant relies upon an affidavit of Mr Joseph Severin sworn 1 March 2005, an affidavit of Ms Ece Mustafa-Ay sworn 4 March 2005 and filed on 10 March 2005, an affidavit of Ms Lisa Busch sworn 2 March 2005 and filed 7 March 2005, a further affidavit of Ms Ece Mustafa Ay sworn 17 March 2006 and filed 6 April 2006 and two affidavits of Mr Peter Mills one sworn and filed on 10 March 2005 and the other sworn and filed on 15 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">23 The affidavit evidence of the Applicant is in these terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">24 The Applicant is a company incorporated on 10 January 2000 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, West Indies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The Managing Director of the Applicant is Mr Joseph Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">The Applicant Company is a personal investment vehicle of Mr Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">At some time during the course of 2001, Mr Severin had discussions with a Mr John Wilch about international financial transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Mr Wilch introduced Mr Severin to a number of people with whom Mr Severin might invest funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Mr Wilch was associated with a company called Bainton Investments Pty Ltd ("Bainton") located in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">Mr Severin was told by Mr Wilch that Bainton provided investment advisory services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">25 In March 2001, Mr Wilch told Mr Severin that Mr David Wallader was a financial adviser and investment professional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Mr Severin says that on 1 March 2001 he spoke from Grenada on the telephone to Mr Wallader who told him he was a veteran of banking transactions and was a dealer in bank debenture notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Mr Severin has never met Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Mr Wallader told Mr Severin in April 2001 that he had interests in the cattle industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Mr Severin also has interests in the cattle industry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Mr Severin says these common interests made him trusting of Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">26 Mr Severin says that he agreed to apply the Applicant's funds to an investment in bank debenture notes and transfer US$2 million to Mr Wallader for investment for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Mr Severin says he always regarded Mr Wallader as the principal in this arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">27 Mr Wallader sent Mr Severin an agreement to facilitate the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The agreement was one made between the First Respondent described as the "Opportunity Provider" and the Applicant described as "The Capital Investor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">The agreement is a two page document which records that the parties have entered into the agreement for the purpose of creating profits by a mode of investment described as "Private Placement High Yield Investment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The Opportunity Provider was to facilitate the investment of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">28 The Capital Investor agreed to provide the Opportunity Provider with US$2 million described as "The Principal Sum", under a "joint venture agreement between the Opportunity Provider and The Capital Investor ... only on the basis that the said joint venture agreement protects and guarantees the return of The Principal Sum to The Capital Investor at the end of the said joint venture agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">At this time, the Opportunity Provider agrees to return The Principal Sum in its entirety to The Capital Investor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">" 
 
29 The duration of this agreement was to be 40 weeks within a total period of 12 months from the date of the agreement or such shorter or longer period as the parties might determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The document provides by clause 7 that all profit arising from the investment is to be the "property of The Capital Investor in shares equal to an amount of net 100% per week to The Capital Investor for a term of 40 weeks from the start of trading".</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Notwithstanding clause 7, the distribution of profits, made weekly, from the capital invested was to be 82.5% to the Applicant, 5% to Mr Wallader and 12.5% to Mr John Wilch and an entity described as "Bainton Management Ltd".</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It seems for the purposes of the agreement that Bainton Management and Mr Wilch are one and the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The duty assumed under the agreement by the First Respondent was to provide the Applicant with the "contracts and expertise, advice, information and know-how to enable the purpose of the investment to be realised and [shall] provide management advice and information to The Capital Investor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">30 Mr Severin on behalf of the Applicant signed the agreement dated 30 March 2001 at Grand Anse, St Georges, Grenada and faxed it to the First Respondent care of Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Mr Wallader signed the document and on 2 April 2001 wrote to Mr Severin thanking him for the documents, confirmed the execution of the document, noted where profits from the investment were to be transmitted and said "it is expected that the contracts [investment contracts] will be drawn during the latter part of this week and the start date should be within the nominated time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">You have the details of my Company Bank Account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Once you have remitted the funds, would you kindly forward a copy of the remittance documents so I may communicate with my bank if required".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The letter bears the signature of W D Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">No objection is taken to paragraph 9 of the affidavit of Mr Severin exhibiting the letter from the First Respondent signed by Mr Wallader which exhibits a clear and precise example of Mr Wallader's signature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">31 The agreement of 30 March 2001 further provided that the Opportunity Provider agreed to provide the Applicant with a guarantee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The documents also included a Deed of Investment Guarantee and Indemnity .</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">That document was signed by Mr Severin and faxed to Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It contemplated a guarantor "unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteeing to the investor (the Applicant), the repayment of The Principal Sum (US$2 million) and Dividends AND the Guarantor as a separate and independent principal obligation indemnify and hold safe the investor against any loss or expense whatsoever and howsoever arising in connection with the investment".</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">32 The document defined the guarantor by reference to a schedule, described the guarantee as a continuing guarantee, acknowledged that the guarantor had obtained independent legal advice as to the effect of the document and recognised that the guarantee would be valid notwithstanding certain nominated events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">33 The difficulty with the document is that the schedule nominating the identity of the guarantor simply recited the name of the First Respondent which was the principal under the related agreement in any event.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Mr Severin says the guarantee was to be a personal guarantee by Mr Wallader not simply another documented commitment by the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It seems the document as submitted to Mr Severin contained the reference to the First Respondent in the schedule as guarantor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Mr Severin says he simply did not read the document properly and assumed Mr Wallader was the nominated guarantor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">34 Mr Severin says that on 30 March 2001 he caused a bank transfer to be made on behalf of the Applicant of US$2 million into an account nominated by Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">The funds were transferred to the credit of an account in the name of the First Respondent with the National Australia Bank Ltd bearing an account description COMWFUSD1 and an additional code described as SWFT Code NATAAU3304B.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">Mr Severin says that the National Australia Bank records verify the transfer and that at no stage either orally or in writing has either Respondent contended to Mr Severin that the funds have not been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">On 29 March 2001, Mr Severin sent Mr Wallader a letter by facsimile confirming the instruction to his bank to transfer funds to the credit of the First Respondent at the above account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">35 Mr Severin says that on 22 May 2001 he received a copy of a letter from Mr Wilch to Mr Wallader which had the effect of advising Mr Severin that Mr Wallader had not been able to place the Applicant's funds into a pool for investment for particular reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">36 Mr Severin says that since that time, he has not received any further correspondence from Mr Wallader or the First Respondent advising him of the actual location of the Applicant's funds or the placement of those funds for investment purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">37 Mr Severin says that subsequent to the provision of the Applicant's funds for investment and the expiry of the 40 weeks contemplated by the agreement, Mr Severin spoke to Mr Wallader regularly about when the funds would be returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">These telephone calls took place frequently, often daily.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Mr Severin says he always initiated these calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Mr Wallader apparently never returned any telephone calls.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Mr Severin says that on pressing for information about the return of the funds, Mr Wallader's tone became evasive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">Mr Severin says he was given many assurances by Mr Wallader that the funds would be returned in the near future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Mr Severin made a demand upon Mr Wallader for return of the funds in early 2002 by telephone and sought return of the funds by facsimile letter sent to Mr Wallader in July or August 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">38 Within six months of the transfer of the Applicant's funds to the First Respondent, Mr Severin spoke with Mr Wallader and was told that notwithstanding the reference to Bainton Management in the agreement of 30 March 2001, neither Bainton Management nor Mr Wilch continued to have a role in the performance of the investment agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Accordingly, Mr Severin did not pursue Mr Wilch about the matter further.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">39 Mr Severin says that on two or possibly three occasions in telephone discussion with Mr Wallader between June 2003 and 1 March 2005, Mr Wallader told Mr Severin the Applicant's funds had been moved to Switzerland where other entities were in charge of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">Mr Wallader did not identify any individual or the relevant entity involved, the nature of that entity or any details of how the Applicant's funds were held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Mr Severin says that notwithstanding these things, the Applicant did not commence legal proceedings for some considerable time because Mr Severin believed that the Applicant's funds were to join a "pool" for investment with other funds and if that pooled investment could not be achieved the funds would be returned to the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">40 Mr Severin says that he ultimately elected to appoint commercial agents, Australian Receivables Pty Ltd ("ARL"), to try and recover the funds either from the First Respondent or Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">41 Ms Lisa Busch is an account manager employed by ARL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">ARL received instructions on 22 July 2004 from the Applicant to try and recover the Applicant's funds from the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">On 23 July 2004, Ms Busch spoke on the telephone to Mr Wallader and asked him what his intentions were about repayment of the Applicant's funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">Mr Busch says the conversation was lengthy and pleasant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Ms Busch says Mr Wallader's advice was that "repayment of the Applicant's funds 'wasn't an issue' and the Applicant could wait for the investment to mature in 45 to 50 days with interest but if the Applicant wanted the money to be withdrawn it would still take 45 to 60 days to retrieve the funds".</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">42 Mr Severin expressed scepticism about this advice from Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">On 28 July 2004, Ms Busch conveyed that scepticism to Mr Wallader in a telephone call and on the same day ARL sent a letter to Mr Wallader by facsimile advising that ARL had instructions to exhaust all avenues of recovery of the Applicant's funds should the redemption of the investment not be resolved immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">ARL sought confirmation in writing from Mr Wallader explaining the process necessary to redeem the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">ARL advised that upon receipt of satisfactory proof that the monies would be available within 60 days, no legal proceedings would be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">This confirmation was sought by 4 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">43 On 3 August 2004, Ms Busch received a letter from Mr Wallader on the letterhead of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Mr Wallader said this:
 
 "I refer to your letter of 28 July 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">
 
 ... 
 
 I have never met with your Client.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">He came to me through a party based in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">The request was to place funds in a 'high yield program' which are completed in United States dollars and that investment, in this case, lodged for investment 'off shore', not in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Funds are held in a pool pending entering into a program, and can only be entered into a program when sufficient funds are available and a program is also available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">There is no time given or guarantee when a fund may start to earn.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
 
 Principal funds are refundable when the party, this being Lifetime Investments Ltd, or Mr Joseph Severin make written application for the funds to be returned and confirming that the party have no further interest in the proposed investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">This has never been received from Lifetime Investments Ltd or Mr Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">I do not have an address of Mr Severin or any contact numbers of Mr Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I do have contact numbers and address of the party in Canada.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">
 
 The lead time for completion of such withdrawal is normally 60 days from the date the request is received plus the time normal transfers take between banks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">
 
 Investments of this status are completed under non-disclosure and confidential documentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">
 
 You state that you will be issuing Court documents on the company and individual names.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Any such documentation will be strenuously defended as the company does not hold the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">
 
 Since receipt of your letter, I confirm that I have been in contact with the nominee Investor and have advised the Group that withdrawal of the funds is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">There is no objection, however written request for withdrawal is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Please consider the time difference we all encounter in communication with off shore Constituents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">
 
 I have spoken with my solicitor re the contents of your letter and in need [indeed] he will confirm my actions as nominated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">He has been unavailable for the past few days due to conference and court commitments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">
 
 I confirm to you that I am prepared to have the funds refunded to your Client on full satisfaction of his notice of withdrawal and confirmation where such amount is to be paid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Payment will be in United States dollars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">
 
 I will confirm a settlement date of the 60 day period on receipt of the withdrawal notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">
 
 I have no interest in holding any monies of your Client.</sentence>

44 Ms Busch says Mr Wallader's letter of 3 August 2004 was the first occasion Mr Wallader advised Ms Busch that a formal written application for redemption of the funds would be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">Mr Wallader describes the instrument as a "notice of withdrawal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">Ms Busch says she had further conversations with Mr Wallader in which Mr Wallader said he could not disclose information concerning the placement of the funds due to reasons of confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">45 Ms Busch says that in order to secure the redemption of the investment, she drew up a document she described as a "notice of withdrawal".</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">The document was faxed to Mr Severin, signed by him and on 11 August 2004 the document dated 5 August 2004 was sent by facsimile transmission to Mr Wallader and the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">The document required a refund of US$2 million being the amount of the funds deposited with the First Respondent pursuant to the agreement of 30 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">The notice nominated the trust account of ARL at the National Australia Bank as the account for receipt of the monies and provided the details of the account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">46 Ms Busch says the notice of withdrawal was formulated simply to provide the instrument Mr Wallader asserted was necessary in order to effect the refund of the monies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">47 On 11 August 2004, Ms Busch spoke by telephone with Mr Wallader to confirm the transmission of the notice of withdrawal by facsimile.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">Mr Wallader confirmed the relevant facsimile transmission number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">48 On 17 August 2004, Ms Busch spoke with Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Mr Wallader told Ms Busch that he would be in Singapore for a few days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Ms Busch suggested Mr Wallader might like to take the opportunity of meeting with ARL's managing director, Mr Paul Cooney who would also be in Singapore at that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">Ms Busch says that Mr Wallader's disposition and manner in the conversation changed immediately.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Mr Wallader became abrupt and curt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">Mr Wallader said that he would be flying from Singapore that night to go to Europe to "try and fast track the withdrawal of the funds".</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Ms Busch says this was the only conversation or other communication in which Mr Wallader provided any indication of the location of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">Ms Busch asked Mr Wallader for the details of the solicitor for the Respondents and Mr Wallader refused to give Ms Busch those details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">Mr Wallader said he was "doing everything he could".</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">49 On 24 August 2004, Mr Cooney sent Mr Wallader a letter again confirming the transmission of the notice of withdrawal on 11 August 2004 and confirming ARL's authority to receive the funds and, in effect, therefore provide the Respondents with a good "discharge" upon receipt of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">50 On 20 August 2004, Ms Busch received an email from Mr Wallader's email address under the name of Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Mr Wallader referred to the facsimile of 11 August 2004 and Ms Busch's telephone conversation which he says took place on 18 rather than 17 August 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Mr Wallader says:
 
 "... 
 
 Notice of withdrawal dated August 5, 2004 has been received with your facsimile of 11 August, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 
 ... 
 
 Notice of withdrawal has been lodged and accepted on Wednesday 18 August, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Therefore settlement draw down will be 17 October, 2004, plus the normal Bank remittance/transfer time of the remittance of funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It is noted that funds are to be placed in an account with the National Australia Bank --- your [ARL] trust account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">I assume that such an account is a US dollar account as the party will be lodging funds in USD currency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">No liability of cost of conversion or delay in acceptance of the funds will be the care of the remitter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">
 
 I have noted words exchanged in our conversation of 18 August, 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 
 A number of your comments are resented and will be discussed with my Solicitor on my return to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">Our company does not owe your Client; your Client wished to enter into an investment which now he has nominated 'no further interest in the investment'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">I, on behalf of Commercial Worldwide Financial Services Pty Ltd, have lodged the notice of withdrawal and you have now been advised of the settlement date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">
 
 My letter of 3 August is clear and concise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">
 
 ... 
 
 It would be advisable for your Company to have a clear understanding what your Client in fact invested in before making any further threats on myself or my Company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">
 
 Yours faithfully 
 
 W D Wallader" 
 
 

51 Although Mr Wallader confirmed the acceptance and lodging of a request for redemption of the funds with whatever group held the funds, he nevertheless said that he would require additional confirmation from ARL that the notice had been issued with the authority of the Applicant and Mr Severin and that ARL had authority to receive the funds on behalf of the Applicant and Mr Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">52 The notice of withdrawal had been signed by Mr Severin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">53 Ms Busch says that the statement in the email of 20 August 2004 was the first occasion either orally or in writing that Mr Wallader asserted to Ms Busch that the First Respondent did not owe the Applicant the monies demanded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">54 Ms Busch says that the reference in the email to ARL establishing a clear understanding with Mr Severin of the investment before making "threats" seemed odd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">Ms Busch says she had spoken to Mr Wallader on a number of occasions and on three occasions to her recollection Mr Wallader suggested the Applicant knew and understood the investment was unreliable as to its date of refund or return.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">55 On 25 August 2004, Ms Busch sent Mr Wallader an email noting the proposed settlement date for draw down of the funds of 17 October 2004 and the nomination of ARL's National Australia Bank trust account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Ms Busch confirmed that the account was not a US dollar account however the National Australia Bank had been advised of the expected transfer and all costs of transfer would be accepted by ARL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">As to the question of further proof of ARL's authority, Ms Busch sent a further copy of the letter from Mr Cooney and noted that ARL had been provided as proof of the debt with a copy of the agreement of 30 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">Ms Busch requested further confirmation that the notice of withdrawal had been lodged with the "investment group" spoken of by Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">56 On 27 August 2004, Mr Wallader telephoned Ms Busch and told her he was not in Australia but that the Respondents were happy with the form of the notice of withdrawal provided by the Applicant and its agents and that he would be returning to Australia in a week and a half at which stage Ms Busch would be provided with confirmation of the location of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">57 On 9 September 2004, Ms Busch attempted to further contact Mr Wallader and was advised by a person who described herself as Mrs Wallader that Mr Wallader would be returning to Australia in a further three weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">On 9 September 2004, Ms Busch sent Mr Wallader an email in these terms:
 
 "It has been seven weeks since this office first contacted you and we are yet to receive the documentation required to defer the involvement of other authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">
 
 Our client is unsatisfied that the monies due will be forthcoming as stated by you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">We must insist that you provide this office with evidence from an appropriate party, directly involved with this transaction, which confirms the monies are being withdrawn from the investment and will be deposited into the bank account details previously provided to you.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">
 
 Furthermore, it is noted that the agreement dated 30/03/2001 was to run for 40 weeks and there is no clause relating to the 60 day withdrawal period you continue to claim is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Documented clarification is also necessary on this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">
 
 Please have the above issues addressed immediately".</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">
 
 

58 On 13 September 2004, Ms Busch received an email from Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In that email Mr Wallader says that he is tired of Ms Busch's unwarranted criticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Mr Wallader says that he will consider what action might be taken against ARL, Ms Busch and possibly the applicant company should Ms Busch wish to continue pressing her position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Mr Wallader describes Ms Busch's conduct as continual harassment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">As to the observation that the agreement did not require a 60 day notice of withdrawal, Mr Wallader observed that Ms Busch had embraced the notion of a notice of withdrawal and a 60 day period of notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">Mr Wallader repeats that ARL has been advised that the notice of withdrawal has been accepted and a date arranged for settlement of the return of the investment funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">Mr Wallader describes the pressure from Ms Busch for further confirmation as harassment and the suggestion that the managing director of ARL might meet with Mr Wallader in Singapore as audacious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">
 

59 As to the 40 week investment period, Mr Wallader says, "The 40 week period is an investment period for a high yield program if and when that program commenced ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In the context of Mr Wallader's annoyance about pressure for confirmation by Ms Busch, Mr Wallader reiterates strongly the arrangements in relation to the withdrawal of funds, the acceptance of the settlement date of 17 October and the settled arrangements as to the banking details for receipt of the refund of the investment monies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">60 Mr Wallader seems to be sufficiently annoyed about the demands from Ms Busch that he suggests he might take legal action against her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">As to the request for information concerning the investment of the monies, Mr Wallader says, "We will discuss your request for additional information to be supplied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">Confidential means --- secret, private entrusted with confidence --- I have such an arrangement with others and I will not break that confidentiality without legal advice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">61 Mr Wallader seems to be talking about the confidentiality of the arrangements he has with others as to the investment which prevents him from advising his own contracting party of the details of the investment of that party's monies notwithstanding the description in the agreement of the Applicant as a joint venturer with the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">62 On Monday, 13 September 2004, Mr Cooney responded to Mr Wallader's email in these terms:
 
 "...</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I am comfortable with the matters referred to by you as harassment are taken to whatever authorities you deem appropriate, as the history of the file supports the consistent request and in fact the agreement, that some evidence supporting the assertions that a notice of withdrawal has been given and that the funds will be paid on 17 October.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">I do not believe there has been inappropriate contact with you in all the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">We have provided all of the details requested by you, and have consistently asked for some satisfactory form of confirmation that this is not just a delaying tactic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">
 
 The fact that you are overseas, for an indeterminate period, is of course no concern of ours, but the fact that you are overseas should equally not mean you are unable to complete the undertaking that you made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">I am sure you appreciate that the sum involved is not insignificant, that you have had control of the funds for a long period, and that my client is seeking repayment of the principal sum only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">It is encouraging that we have your emailed advice that it will be repaid, but we simply seek some form of confirmation that this is the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">" 
 
 

63 On 7 October 2004, Ms Busch spoke to Mr Wallader by telephone concerning the return of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Mr Wallader said he would "sought it out when he was back in the country".</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Ms Busch suggested Mr Wallader was not out of Australia and Mr Wallader replied, "I've only just returned".</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Ms Busch sought confirmation that nothing had changed concerning the refund of the monies and Mr Wallader confirmed 17 October 2004 as the drawdown date for the refund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">64 On 19 October 2004, Ms Busch telephoned Mr Wallader as no information had been received as to the refund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Mr Wallader said the drawdown had not occurred because 17 October 2004 was a Sunday.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">Mr Wallader said he would be "in contact" with "people" about the drawdown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Ms Busch asked if she could contact the relevant people.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Mr Wallader declined and said he did not know where he stood legally in giving their details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">65 No refund occurred on 17 October 2004 or at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">66 Ms Mustafa-Ay is a solicitor employed by Harwood Andrews, the solicitors for the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">On 11 October 2004, Ms Mustafa-Ay wrote to the First Respondent addressed to Mr Wallader confirming the arrangement for the drawdown and refund of the monies on 17 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">On 22 October 2004, the solicitors for the Respondents, Watts &amp; Company, wrote to Harwood Andrews proposing repayments of US$50,000.00 per month without admission of liability but put on the basis of a "gesture of goodwill ... until such time as our client is able to arrange for repatriation of the principal of USD$2m (million)".</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">67 On 9 November 2004, Watts &amp; Company wrote to Harwood Andrews addressing certain issues and said:
 
 "We would be greatly assisted if you would direct our attention to any documentation in your possession which identifies Mr William David Wallader as a party to this transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Likewise, would you please identify any documentation which has the implication, either express or implied of investing any personal liability in Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">We look forward to hearing from you within seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">" 
 
 

68 On 1 December 2004, Watts &amp; Company wrote a "without prejudice" letter to Harwood Andrews.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is Exhibit "EMA3" to the affidavit of Ms Mustafa-Ay filed 10 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">It is marked "without prejudice".</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">No objection is made to the exhibit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">In terms, the letter does not make an offer but rather states a proposition, namely, "Our client is attempting to ensure the urgent repatriation of the funds to this jurisdiction from their external source, and would expect that upon receipt of the monies, settlement of the repayment of funds due to your client can take place within 14 to 21 days".</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">69 On 19 January 2005, Ms Mustafa-Ay noted the funds had not been repaid and said:
 
 "We request that you urgently seek your client's instructions and detail in writing the following: 
 
 (a) where the principal sum has been invested/deposited/dispensed; 
 
 (b) where the principal sum is now located; 
 
 (c) what the principal sum has been invested in (if at all); and 
 
 (d) if in fact the principal sum has been lost.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">
 
 We request that you advise our office of the above no later than Monday, 24 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">" 
 
 
 The Pleading of the Funds Transfer 
 
70 No reply was received to that letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">71 By paragraph 8 of the Amended Statement of Claim filed 14 July 2005, the Applicant pleads:
 
 
 "8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Pursuant to the agreement the Funds were transferred by the Applicant to a bank on or about 1 st of April, 2001 into an account nominated by the First and Second Respondents in the correspondence referred to in paragraph 5 hereof, 
 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 The account nominated was National Australia Bank, Brisbane Queensland Australia, SWFT Code NATAAUS304B for credit to Commonwealth Commercial (Worldwide) Financial Services Pty Ltd Account COMWFUSD01".</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">
 
 

72 By paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Applicant pleads the letter from Mr Wallader to Mr Wilch explaining that it had not been possible to invest the monies as at 22 May 2001, the acknowledgement by Mr Wallader of the indebtedness by reason of the email to Ms Busch of 3 August 2004 and the proposed redemption of the funds by 17 October 2004 and the oral and facsimile transmission demands by Ms Busch for payment of the money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">The Defence on the Point 
 
73 In response to these assertions, the First and Second Respondents both say that they do not admit paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 and as to paragraph 8, the Respondents:
 
 "7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">(a) admit that by letter dated 02.04.01 the First Respondent nominated its corporate bank account; 
 
 (b) deny that the Second Respondent, in his own right, nominated a bank account; and 
 
 
 
 
 (c) otherwise do not admit the allegations contained there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">" 
 
 
 
 

74 There is no affirmative pleading by either of the Respondents and, in particular for present purposes, the Second Respondent that the funds were not received by the First Respondent or that the funds were applied to a class of investment as contemplated by the agreement and lost consistent with any risk that might be asserted by the Second Respondent to be associated with the nature of the particular investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">75 For present interlocutory purposes, I am prepared to accept that there is compelling evidence that Mr Wallader nominated a National Australia Bank account in the name of the First Respondent as the account to which the investment monies were to be transferred and that the monies were so transferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">I also accept that the monies were transferred for the purposes of the agreement of 30 March 2001 and were to be applied for investment purposes on the terms and conditions of that agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">Moreover, I accept that the Applicant has not received any part of the US$2 million and no explanation has been given either orally or in correspondence or by affidavit in these proceedings as to the location of the funds, the nature of the investment, the entity holding the funds, whether the funds have been invested at all or any explanation of any dealing in relation to the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">The Anton Pillar Orders 
 
76 Metaphorically, "an iron curtain has descended across" (Churchill, Fulton Missouri, 5 March 1946) any information in relation to the funds both from the First Respondent through its directors Mr and Mrs Wallader and the Second Respondent individually.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">The Applicant sought to penetrate that iron curtain by securing access to documents pursuant to the Order of Kiefel J on 10 March.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">That Order required the Respondents to "forthwith upon service of a sealed copy of this order deliver up to the Applicant all originals and copies of the documents and classes of documents enumerated in Schedule A".</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">77 The Schedule A material is expressed in these terms:
 
 
 "1. bank statements, cheque books and stubs, receipts, invoices, share certificates, financial documents and records (including documents and records relating to gaming, wagering or betting accounts) and correspondence relating to financial dealings of the Respondents or real estate transactions of the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">
 
 
 
 
 
 2. computers (whether in whole or in part) computer disks or diskettes, CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMS, central processing units, hard drives, computer programs, bookmarks, passwords, log-ins, documents and similar articles which appear to the Applicant's representatives to contain financial information relating to: 
 
 
 
 (a) any of the Respondents; 
 
 (b) Bainton Investments; 
 
 (c) John Wilch; 
 
 (d) Swiss bank accounts or bank account numbers; 
 
 (e) international bank accounts; 
 
 (f) international money transfers; 
 
 (g) real estate transactions of either of the Respondents; and 
 
 (h) the National Australia Bank account or accounts.</sentence>

 The Various Directions Orders of the Court 
 
78 That order was executed on 14 March 2005 by Mr Mills, support lawyers and an adviser from KPMG under the supervision of Mr Bruce Virgo and Ms Jennifer Hetherington from Roberts Nehmer McKee Lawyers, the independent supervising solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">The Order was executed at 4 Covey Street, Chermside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">Mr and Mrs Wallader were present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">After discussion between Mr Wallader, Mr Mills and Mr Virgo concerning legal representation on behalf of the Respondents and related matters, the order was executed and an arrangement made with the solicitors for the Respondents to remove the documents and equipment to the office of Mr Mills, subject to a certain undertaking.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">The following morning, the solicitors for the Respondents were to attend the offices of Mr Mills, examine the documents and consider objections to production of the material.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">79 On 16 March 2005, Kiefel J made orders by consent in these terms:
 
 
 "(a) documents taken in execution of the Anton Pillar order be delivered into the custody of the independent supervising solicitors; 
 
 (b) certain documents be returned to the Respondents; 
 
 (c) the Respondents be given leave to inspect, copy and deal with the documents; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the documents be identified and sorted so as to delineate those documents the subject of a claim for privilege on the ground of legal professional privilege or self-incrimination or otherwise and those documents not subject to any claim for privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) within a reasonable time after the determination of the sorting of a document into a category of privileged or non-privileged, the Applicant be given inspection of the non-privileged document(s); 
 
 (f) the Applicant to file a statement of claim in the proceeding on or before 24 March 2005; 
 
 (g) the Respondents to file their defence on or before 24 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">" 
 
 
 

80 On 30 March 2005, the Applicant filed its Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">81 The Respondents failed to file a Defence on or before 25 April 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">82 On 18 July 2005, the Applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">83 On 20 July 2005, the lawyers for the parties attended a case review conference before Deputy District Registrar Reynolds who made orders that the Respondents be given leave to file and serve their defence by 9 August 2005 and inspection of the documents by the Respondents for the purpose of separating the documents into those the subject of a claim for privilege and those not so subject, be completed by 9 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">84 On 28 July 2005, the solicitors for the Respondents requested a deferment of the sorting task for a period of eight weeks due to a medical condition suffered by the Second Respondent which would require surgery for the removal of a kidney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">85 On 10 August 2005, the solicitors for the Respondents requested an extension of time by consent for the inspection of documentation until 9 October 2005 and advised that the Second Respondent would resist "any application to enforce the terms of Deputy Registrar Reynolds' order of 20 July 2005 in relation to the inspection of documentation".</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">Ms Mustafa-Ay asserts that since the orders of 16 March 2005 virtually no actions have been taken that she is aware of by the Respondents to undertake the prioritisation task of sorting the documents into the categories of privileged and non-privileged documents, pursuant to the Order of Kiefel J and the subsequent order of Deputy District Registrar Reynolds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">86 During March 2005, a dispute arose between the Applicant's solicitors and the supervising solicitors as to the scope of the role of the supervising solicitors in perusing each and every document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">It seems the Applicant's solicitors took the view that the role of the supervising solicitors was to supervise the sorting process to be undertaken by the Respondents and their legal advisers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">87 On 15 November 2005, the supervising solicitors made an application before his Honour Justice Spender, in effect, for directions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Spender J made the following orders:
 
 
 "(a) the documents in the custody and possession of the supervising solicitors to be produced to the court within seven days; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) within 21 days (6 December 2005) the Respondents to file a list of the documents in relation to which the Respondents claim privilege; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) within 14 days of that date (20 December 2005) the Applicant be authorised to inspect any document in relation to which the Respondents do not claim privilege.</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">" 
 
 
 

88 On 2 February 2006, Ms Mustafa-Ay made a request for a date for the consideration of urgent directions due to a failure by the Respondents to undertake the task of sorting the documents into the categories of privileged and non-privileged documents and the failure to file a list of the documents subject to a claim for privilege, in accordance with the order of Spender J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">89 On 9 February 2006, since the Respondents had failed to compile a list asserting a claim for privilege within the time limited by the order, the Court advised the Applicant that it was now at liberty to inspect the documents produced to the Court by the supervising solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The Documents Arising Out of the Execution of the Anton Pillar Order 
 
90 On 10 February 2006, the Queensland agents of the solicitors for the Applicant began inspecting and supervising the photocopying by officers of the Federal Court Registry staff of documents from the body of documents in the possession of the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">Counsel for the Applicant saw these documents in Melbourne for the first time in the week beginning 13 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">91 Having examined those documents the Applicant's legal advisers sought in late March 2006 to bring on this application ex parte .</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">However, the Court required the Notice of Motion to be heard inter-parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The affidavit of Ms Mustafa-Ay exhibits documents which she describes as copies of documents photocopied at the Federal Court consequent upon the failure of the Respondents to file a list asserting a claim for privilege in respect of any document, within the time limited by the order of Spender J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">The Second Respondent objects to paragraph 43 of Ms Mustafa-Ay's affidavit referring to "documents seized from the Respondents" and paragraphs 44 and 45 of Ms Mustafa-Ay's affidavit exhibiting true copies of documents marked Exhibits "EMA9" and "EMA10" on the ground that the documents "are not proved simply by saying that they were taken from an identified place".</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">92 Ms Mustafa-Ay, by paragraph 9 of her affidavit, deposes to execution of the Anton Pillar order by her agent, Mr Mills, and the identification by her agent of ultimately seven to nine boxes of documents taken into the possession of her agent although initially 47 boxes of documents were removed from 4 Covey Street, Chermside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">Ms Mustafa-Ay says on information and belief from Mr Mills that the number of boxes initially taken at the time of execution of the order might have been substantially less had Mr and Mrs Wallader assisted by identifying the materials relating to the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">The affidavits of Mr Mills describe the execution of the order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">93 Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes to the order by Kiefel J directing the delivery of the documents taken from 4 Covey Street, Chermside into the possession of the supervising solicitors and the order of Spender J directing those solicitors to deliver the seized documents to the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">94 Ms Mustafa-Ay further deposes to the Court's letter of 9 February 2006 sent to her confirming liberty to the Applicant to inspect the documents so delivered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes to the steps taken by her agent, Forbes Dowling Solicitors (Mr James Morgan) to then inspect and make copies of particular documents from those documents delivered to the Court by the supervising solicitors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">Paragraph 43 refers to documents seized by the Respondents which suggests a reference to the documents seized pursuant to the Anton Pillar order since no other documents have been seized from the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">The conjunction of paragraphs 43 and 44 make that clear because Ms Mustafa-Ay refers to each document as a photocopy of a document made by officers of the Federal Court Registry staff under the supervision of Mr Morgan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">Some of those copy documents are the documents Ms Mustafa-Ay says are produced before her marked "EMA9" cross referenced to a bundle of documents delivered to the Court marked documents 1 to 125.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Those copy documents forming Exhibit "EMA9" are said by Ms Mustafa-Ay to be some of the documents from documents 1 to 125 thought by Ms Mustafa-Ay to be relevant for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Perhaps paragraph 44 ought to say that the documents "EMA9" are copies of those documents delivered to her by her agent and she is informed by Mr Morgan and verily believes the documents sent to her are true copies of those made by the Federal Court Registry staff under his supervision on 10 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">However, Mr Morgan is Ms Mustafa-Ay's agent expressly for the purpose of copying the delivered documents and I infer that Mr Morgan's knowledge is imputed to his principal and Ms Mustafa-Ay can speak directly of the documents having established the material facts of the sequence described above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Similarly, the documents forming Exhibit "EMA10" cross referenced to Appendix 2 and numbered "A1" to "A21" are produced to Ms Mustafa-Ay as true copies of the documents made by Federal Court Registry staff under the supervision of Mr Morgan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">95 I am satisfied for interlocutory purposes that the documents marked "EMA9" and "EMA10" are admissible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">Appendices 1 and 2 identifying each document within "EMA9" and "EMA10" is attached to Ms Mustafa-Ay's affidavit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">96 By paragraph 46, Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes to and exhibits ("EMA11") an inventory list prepared by the solicitor supervising the execution of the Anton Pillar order, of documents taken from 4 Covey Street, Chermside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">Ms Mustafa-Ay by paragraph 46 ought to swear to information from the author of the document as to the authorship of the list and assert a belief in the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">The Applicant has proffered an undertaking to put such a paragraph in admissible form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Such an undertaking should be made good by Ms Mustafa-Ay filing a further affidavit within 14 days of publication of these Reasons swearing to the source of the information and her belief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">97 Document 0012 of "EMA9" is a document which bears the title "COMMERCIAL WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES PTY LTD --- National Australia Bank --- USD A/C".</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">98 The document describes debit and credit entries to the account for the period "1/3/2001 to 30/6/2001".</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The first entry on 1 March 2001 is the receipt of US$1 million from Mr Roger de Saint Quentin (see paragraph [8] of these Reasons).</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The account shows a credit entry on 4 April of US$2,000,100.00 described as "One Our Clients".</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">The account shows two debit entries on the following day, 5 April 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The first is a withdrawal of US$250,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">The second is an amount of US$1,760,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">The description field for the second account contains the letters CPFS.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">The document does not bear an account number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">CPFS may be an acronym for Commercial and Primary Financial Services Pty Ltd ("CPFSP/L").</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">Document "A19" is a bank statement for that company for an account at the Bank of Queensland Ltd Account BSB 124-001 --- USD Foreign Currency Account 170415, for the period 1 June 2001 to 1 July 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">99 At 1 June 2001, the opening balance was US$1,125,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">On 6 June 2001, a total of US$250,000.00 was transferred to two accounts at the Bank of Queensland Ltd, 93-170415 and 90-170415.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">100 On 19 June 2001, US$40,000.00 was transferred to "Asia-Pacific Corp".</sentence>

<sentence id="s339">Interest on the account of US$3,774.86 was credited to Account 90-170415.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">101 Bank statements for CPFSP/L for Bank of Queensland Account BSB 124-001, USD Foreign Currency Account 170415 for the important period of the transfer on 5 April 2001 (that is, statements for the period 1 April 2001 to 1 May 2001) from the USD account of the First Respondent at the National Australia Bank into the Bank of Queensland USD account are not available and were not produced to the solicitors for the Applicant on execution of the Anton Pillar order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Nor were documents relating to the Bank of Queensland Accounts 90-170415, 93-170415 and 94-170415 produced to the solicitors on execution of the Anton Pillar order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">However, the statements that were produced for CPFSP/L show that monies were transferred from the CPFSP/L account to each of Accounts 90, 93 and 94 --- 170415.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Further Inferences 
 
102 I am prepared to draw the inference for interlocutory purposes that the amount of US$2,000,100.00 (notwithstanding the addition of US$100.00) shown as a credit in the USD account of the First Respondent on 4 April 2001 is the amount of the Applicant's USD funds the subject of Mr Severin's instructions on or about 30 March 2001 to the Applicant's bank to transfer funds to the account of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">The date of the credit in the First Respondent's account is close to the instruction date by Mr Severin to the Applicant's bank.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">If acted upon reasonably promptly, the international electronic transfer to the First Respondent's account is likely to have occurred on or about 4 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">I am also prepared to infer for interlocutory purposes that the substantial transfer on 5 April to "CPFS" was a transfer to the USD account at the Bank of Queensland of CPFSP/L.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Further, I infer for interlocutory purposes that the withdrawal of US$250,000.00 occurred with the consent and approval of Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">103 Mr Wallader, by his pleading, does not admit the receipt of the Applicant's funds and has elected not to swear and file an affidavit responding to the matters asserted against him and the chronology of communications deposed to in the Applicant's affidavits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Mr Wallader is in a position as the principal individual involved in the events for the Respondents to say that the Applicant's funds were not received into the First Respondent's account (if it be the case) or that the funds were invested in a particular way, at a particular place, in a particular class of investment and the person or entity by which the investment was undertaken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s350">104 If the investment was made and the funds lost, Mr Wallader could simply say so and depose to the relevant particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s351">However, Mr Wallader chooses to put the Applicant to proof at a trial of an action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s352">Whilst Mr Wallader is entitled to so plead and has no obligation to file any affidavit material in answer to the Applicant's motion, he ought not to be surprised if, in the face of compelling evidence of a transfer of AU$2,854,700.00 into his care for the purpose of providing the Applicant with "expertise, advice, information and know-how to enable the purpose of the investment to be realised" [29], inferences are drawn against him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s353">105 For interlocutory purposes, I am prepared to infer that Mr Wallader has received the Applicant's funds and has applied those funds to his own use or to his use and that of his wife whether in his own name or that of his wife or through one or more companies of which he and his wife are shareholders and directors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s354">I infer from the facts of the conduct alleged against Mr Wallader that he has dealt with the Applicant's funds so as to obfuscate the ultimate transfer or use of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s355">The Company Searches 
 
106 Ms Mustafa-Ay has conducted a number of searches of the records of the Australian Securities &amp; Investment Commission concerning the First Respondent and companies associated with Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s356">107 The First Respondent is an Australian proprietary company registered on 30 August 1991 which commenced operation on 15 November 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s357">From 27 October 1998, the registered office of the First Respondent has been 4 Covey Street, Chermside West which is the principal residential address of Mr Wallader and his wife, Mrs Jill Margaret Wallader.</sentence>

<sentence id="s359">There are two $1 shares issued in the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s360">Mr and Mrs Wallader each hold one share.</sentence>
<sentence id="s361">Mr and Mrs Wallader have each been a director of the First Respondent since 3 September 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s362">Accordingly, on or about 30 March 2001 when the Applicant transferred US$2 million into the account of the First Respondent, both Mr and Mrs Wallader were directors of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s363">Mr O'Donnell QC accepts that if US$2 million was transferred into the account of that company, Mr Wallader must be taken to have known that such a substantial sum was paid to the account and if the money was transferred or dispersed from that account, Mr Wallader must be taken to have known, consistent with his governance duties as a director of the company, of the application of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s364">Similarly, Mrs Wallader must also be taken, consistent with her governance duties as a director of the company, to have known of the receipt of the monies and the application of the funds particularly since the company is one in which there are only two issued shares to a husband and wife both of whom are directors and the company conducts its affairs at a registered office and principal place of business at the residential home of those individuals.</sentence>

<sentence id="s390">110 A question then arises as to the evidence the Applicant has adduced of the manner of the use or application of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s391">The Pleading of the Applicant's Causes of Action 
 
111 The Applicant pleads its case against the Second Respondent in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s392">By paragraph 3, the Second Respondent was at all material times a director and shareholder of the First Respondent and a provider of financial advisory services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s393">By paragraphs 4 and 5, the Second Respondent represented to Mr Severin that he was very experienced in banking and investment and debentures and a financial adviser with international expertise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s394">112 By paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, the Applicant entered into the agreement of 30 March 2001 on the terms pleaded and transferred US$2 million to the First Respondent's account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s395">By paragraph 9, the First Respondent by Mr Wallader admitted that it failed to implement the investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s396">By paragraph 10, the First Respondent is indebted to the Applicant in the sum of US$2 million and by Mr Wallader's email of 3 August 2004, the First Respondent has admitted the debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s397">By paragraph 11, the debt has not been paid despite demands.</sentence>
<sentence id="s398">113 By paragraph 12, the agreement was rescinded in 2002 by reason of a total failure of consideration and either by reason of breach or conduct giving rise to rescission, the Applicant has suffered loss.</sentence>
<sentence id="s399">114 By paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, the Second Respondent by a Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity guaranteed the repayment of the funds transferred to the First Respondent on certain written terms and terms implied by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s400">Alternatively, the giving of a guarantee by the Second Respondent was a pre-condition to the transfer of the funds to the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s401">Notwithstanding the endorsement of the name of the First Respondent in the schedule to the guarantee instrument, the parties understood by reason of representations by Mr Wallader that the purpose and intention of the document was that the Second Respondent became a guarantor of the obligations of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s402">115 By paragraph 19, the Second Respondent is estopped from denying his position as a guarantor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s403">116 By paragraph 20, the conduct of Mr Wallader in transmitting the guarantee instrument and failing to indicate the manner of the endorsement of the Schedule, constituted conduct inducing the Applicant to enter into the agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s404">117 By paragraph 21, the Applicant says the conduct is misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of the Fair Trading Act (Qld) 1989 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Second Respondent is a person involved in that contravention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s405">118 By paragraph 22, the conduct of Mr Wallader was unconscionable conduct in contravention of s.51AB of the Trade Practices Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s406">119 By paragraph 25, the proposed investment was a financial product for the purposes for the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the conduct of the Second Respondent constituted false and misleading conduct contrary to s.1041E(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s407">120 By paragraphs 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32, the Second Respondent held himself out as an investment and business financial adviser making a series of representations as to his skill, experience and background.</sentence>
<sentence id="s408">The relationship between the Applicant and the Second Respondent was a fiduciary relationship imposing duties upon the Second Respondent to act in good faith, make proper disclosure, properly account to the Applicant and discharge a series of duties pleaded at paragraph 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s409">121 By paragraph 32, the Second Respondent breached those duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s410">122 By paragraphs 33 and 34, the Second Respondent owed the Applicant six pleaded duties of care and the Second Respondent has breached those duties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s411">123 By paragraph 34A, the Applicant says that by reason of the agreement, the transfer of the funds to the First Respondent, the failure to invest the funds and the failure to refund the monies upon demand being made, either the First Respondent or the Second Respondent holds the funds or properties purchased by the use of the funds on a resulting, implied or constructive trust for the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s412">By reason of the same matters, the Applicant says it is unconscionable for the Second Respondent to retain the benefit of the funds and in the alternative, by reason of the same matters, the Second Respondent has been unjustly enriched .</sentence>
<sentence id="s413">The Applicant says it is entitled to restitution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s414">124 By paragraph 35, the First Respondent constituted itself a trustee for the funds and the Second Respondent procured a misappropriation of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s415">125 The remedial orders claimed are damages in the sum of US$2 million and equitable damages, damages against the Second Respondent pursuant to contraventions of the Fair Trading Act and the Trade Practices Act , a declaration that the Second Respondent holds the funds or any property purchased with the funds on a resulting implied or constructive trust , such other orders as effect restitution, an inquiry as to damages and a tracing order .</sentence>
<sentence id="s416">The Assets of and Expenditures by the Respondents 
 
126 The Applicant is not in a position to adduce evidence of an application of the funds by the First or Second Respondent to a particular purpose or asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s417">The Applicant says it simply does not know how the money has been used or applied by Mr Wallader except to say that US$250,000.00 was withdrawn by Mr Wallader on 5 April 2001 from the account of the First Respondent to which the Applicant's funds were transferred and US$1,760,000.00 was transferred to another account controlled by a company controlled by Mr Wallader and his wife.</sentence>
<sentence id="s418">127 The identified assets associated with Mr Wallader are these:
 
 
 (a) a residential property at 4 Covey Street, Chermside owned by Mr and Mrs Wallader as joint tenants purchased by them in December 2000;
 (b) a property at Graham Road, Bridgeman Downs owned by Mr and Mrs Wallader as joint tenants also purchased in December 2000;
 (c) a unit at Burgess Street, Kings Beach, Caloundra, Queensland owned by Mr and Mrs Wallader as joint tenants and purchased in early 2001; and
 (d) a pastoral property, Colinton Station , owned by D &amp; J Wallader Pty Ltd as trustee of the Wallader Family Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s419">
 

128 The affidavit of Mr Mills filed on 10 March 2005 deposes to a number of searches conducted by Mr Mills of the records of the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s420">Certain documents arising from those searches are exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Mills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s421">One such document is the Deed of Settlement for the Wallader Family Trust which reveals a field of beneficiaries of the trust associated with the family interests of Mr and Mrs Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s422">The income of the trust is subject to discretionary distribution by the trustee amongst the field of the beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s423">Similarly, the trustee stands possessed of the capital of the trust on or prior to the termination date for one or more of the beneficiaries as the trustee determines in its discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s424">129 The documents reveal that the trustee of the trust entered into a contract to acquire Colinton Station on 19 October 2000 and the transfer instruments were lodged on 16 February 2001 well prior to the transfer of the Applicant's funds to the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s425">Settlement of the acquisition seems to have occurred on 1 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s426">The property was purchased for $2,500,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s427">130 Mr and Mrs Wallader continue to retain ownership of the first three properties described at paragraph 127 and the trustee retains ownership of Colinton Station .</sentence>
<sentence id="s428">Nevertheless, the Applicant is apprehensive that some of the investment funds have been applied to particular purposes associated with some of these properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s429">For example, Document 0013 which is a statement of expenses for the purposes of National Australia Bank Account No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s430">46 872 7272 for the trustee of the trust for the period 22 December 2000 to 29 March 2001 shows an expenditure of $1,882,563.02 for the purchase of Colinton Station and Document 0051 shows a cheque drawn on that account for the same amount.</sentence>
<sentence id="s431">The documents do not reveal the source of the further amount of $617,000.00 (approximately) required to complete the settlement of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s432">Document 0024 shows the receipt of funds into the same account of $1,894,657.06 but no document reveals the source of those funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s433">A spreadsheet Document 0044 shows the transfer of $1,894,657.06 for the purchase of Colinton Station on 1 March 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s434">The documents reveal some information for a No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s435">2 Account at the National Australia Bank in the name of the First Respondent - Account 62-775-0665.</sentence>
<sentence id="s436">The bank statement for the No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s437">2 Account for the period of the transfer of the Applicant's funds to the First Respondent and the period 16 March 2001 to 11 April 2001 does not show any substantial deposit which might be consistent with the withdrawal of US$250,000.00 from the First Respondent's USD account on 5 April 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s438">The documents obtained on the Anton Pillar order show that on 29 May 2001 ("A18") the operator of Colinton Station purchased equipment to the value of $121,496.10 and on 17 May 2001 ("A17") equipment purchases by the operator in the form of machinery totalling $552,256.50.</sentence>
<sentence id="s439">The Applicant says the documents produced on the Anton Pillar order do not demonstrate the source of the funds for those acquisitions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s440">131 The Applicant says that although it is conceded that the two residential properties, the unit and the pastoral property remain in the ownership of the same individuals and the entity from the date of purchase, there have been significant dealings in the properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s441">On 28 February 2005, the Kings Beach unit and Chermside properties were encumbered in favour of a Mr Francesco Paul Predebon in support of a $700,000.00 advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s442">On 19 December 2003, Rabobank Australia Ltd took a security in respect of Colinton Station in support of an advance of $2.3 million and on 6 February 2006 a further advance secured over the Bridgeman Downs property was taken in favour of Pepper Finance Corporation Limited for $561,400.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s443">132 Mr Watts, the solicitor for the Second Respondent deposes on information and belief from the Second Respondent that the advance of $561,400.00 was used to discharge an existing liability to the Bank of Queensland of $200,000.00 and to fund running expenses incurred by Colinton Station Pty Ltd in respect of the pastoral property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s444">Mr Watts says that he is informed by the Second Respondent that monies borrowed by Mr and Mrs Wallader for the benefit of the operator of the pastoral property and the owner (trustee) of the property were on-lent to each entity and those monies are repayable to Mr and Mrs Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s445">In other words, the Second Respondent says that there is an additional asset available to him comprising the debt owed to Mr and Mrs Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s446">Mr Watts does not describe the nature of any security in respect of those advances or on-lending.</sentence>
<sentence id="s447">133 In respect of the $700,000.00 drawn down on 28 February 2005 secured in favour of Mr Predebon, Mr Watts says on information and belief from the Second Respondent that those funds were applied in this way:
 Purchase of cattle $230,780.00 Irrigator $75,000.00 Upgrade of residence at Colinton Station $150,000.00 Upgrade of electricity supply at Colinton Station $75,000.00 Plumbing and sewerage system at Colinton Station $35,000.00 Repair and maintenance to dams at Colinton Station $45,000.00 Installation of underground irrigation lines $90,000.00 TOTAL $700,780.00 
 

134 Mr Watts exhibits an invoice in support of the purchase price for the cattle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s448">The Applicant says each of the other items of expenditure seems substantial and a round number.</sentence>
<sentence id="s449">No documents are provided in support of those expenditures and no affidavit is sworn directly by Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s450">The Applicant says one should view those claimed expenditures with a degree of caution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s451">135 In short, the Applicant says that $361,400.00 has been expended on running expenses for the pastoral property, a further $700,780.00 has been expended in connection with the property, equipment purchases in connection with the property have been made of $121,496.10 and $552,256.50 and the balance of purchase monies of approximately $617,000.00 has been appropriated to facilitate the settlement of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s452">Although explanations are offered for these expenditures and the source of securities identified, no documents detailing with any precision the source of the funds and the content of expenditures have been produced or sworn to by Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s453">136 There is one further matter addressed by the Applicant which is said to found apprehension and risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s454">Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes to certain steps taken by the Australian Federal Police to effect a search warrant at the premises of the supervising solicitors on 22 March 2005 pursuant to s.3E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s455">Objection to the references to the Australian Federal Police are taken on the grounds of both relevance and form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s456">Ms Mustafa-Ay does not depose properly to the source of the information and assert a belief in the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s457">Ms Mustafa-Ay does depose to information provided to her by Mr Catlin, counsel for the Applicant concerning statements made by one Mr Glen Wright, a representative of the Australian Federal Police who attended Court on a particular occasion and advised the Court that the Australian Federal Police were in the course of investigating potential counterfeit securities breaches of the Crimes (Currency) Act 1981 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s458">Mr Catlin has not sworn an affidavit about that matter but has informed his instructing solicitor who has deposed to the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s459">Although investigations by the Australian Federal Police as to whether Mr Wallader has engaged in any conduct which might involve a contravention of Commonwealth law (which presumably is denied) do not give rise to any inferences concerning any such matters, the question of whether the Australian Federal Police are in the course of examining a certain question is, it seems to me, relevant to the question of whether that matter elevates the risk that a person who might be the subject of such an investigation may be inclined to sell assets, realise their monetary value and deal with those assets in a way which might ultimately have the effect of depriving the Applicant of the benefit of a judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s460">137 As to that matter, the Applicant relies upon an argument put this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s461">The documents obtained in execution of the Anton Pillar order contain a number of documents which comprise letters apparently signed by Mr Wallader on the letterhead of the First Respondent addressed to note holders concerning dealings in United States Federal Reserve notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s462">For example, Document 0057 is a letter dated 31 July 2000 addressed to Ms Onate acknowledging receipt of United States Federal Reserve notes relating to a 1934 Note series with a printed face value of US$500 million handed to Mr Wallader for authentication.</sentence>
<sentence id="s463">A letter dated 2 November 2000 from Mr Wallader addressed to a note holder, Mr Quiambao, speaks of Mr Wallader returning to the Philippines to purchase for US$100,000.00 United States Federal Reserve notes Series F to the value of US$500 million "per piece" involving 250 pieces.</sentence>
<sentence id="s464">Letters marked "A10.1", "A10.2", "A11" and "A12" involve two letters from Mr Wilch to Mr Wallader on 15 February and 6 April, 2000 in relation to the release by St David's Investment Trust of original copies of "Victory Bonds" having a current market value of US$170 million and arrangements for establishing a credit line derived from the bonds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s465">Documents "A11" and "A12" are two letters signed by Mr Wallader dated 16 November 1999 and 19 April 2000 addressed to a Mr Ramamurthy concerning arrangements for the safekeeping of Victory Bonds Certificates and the authentication of the bonds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s466">138 In order to understand the context of these documents, Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes to a search she conducted of a website for the United States Department of the Treasury : Bureau of the Public Debt .</sentence>
<sentence id="s467">The Department Treasury has published information under the description of "Examples of Known Phoney Securities".</sentence>
<sentence id="s468">As to Victory Bonds, the Treasury says this:
 
 "There have been several inquiries regarding Philippine Treasury Certificates of deposit and their relationship to Philippine Victory Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s469">Philippine Treasury Certificates, Victory Series 66, commonly known as Philippine Victory Notes, were issued in 1944 by the Philippine Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s470">These currency notes were for use only in the Philippines, which at the time was a dependency of the United States, and were obligations of the Philippine Treasury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s471">
 
 The 500 peso Philippine Victory Notes were demonetized by the Philippine Government on December 31, 1957 and were withdrawn from circulation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s472">At that point, other denominations of the Philippine Victory Notes, Victory Series 66, were no longer regarded as legal tender but could be exchanged or replaced at par, without charge, for legal currency until July 30, 1967.</sentence>
<sentence id="s473">After that date, Series 66 was considered demonetized.</sentence>
<sentence id="s474">If these notes are presented to you and purported to have current value today, it is a scam.</sentence>
<sentence id="s475">" 
 
 

139 Similarly, the Department of Treasury makes reference to securities known as 1934 securities, sometimes described as Federal Notes or Bearer Bonds which Treasury says are not currency, constitute crude forgeries and appear to have originated out of the Philippines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s476">The general proposition put to investors concerning these documents is that the United States shipped them to Philippine Freedom Fighters during World War II to help finance the war effort.</sentence>
<sentence id="s477">Federal Treasury says that many individuals have brought to the United States Treasury so-called "Federal Reserve" metal boxes containing various denominations of United States currency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s478">These notes are said to have issued in 1934 and are said to have a face value of US$100 million or US$500 million denominations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s479">The United States Treasury says the certificates are fraudulent and were never issued by the United States Government.</sentence>
<sentence id="s480">140 The documents obtained on the Anton Pillar order contain photocopies of individuals holding sheets of what appear to be United States dollar certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s481">Document 55 is a copy of a Federal Reserve note depicting Benjamin Franklin marked US$500 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s482">141 It may be that these documents are simply consistent with efforts by the First Respondent, Mr Wallader and Mr Wilch to determine whether any such instruments are authentic and if so whether they are capable of redemption.</sentence>
<sentence id="s483">The existence of the documents may be consistent with some other conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s484">In any event, the presence of the documents is a matter relevant to the question of apprehended risk although for present purposes I place little weight on that material at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s485">142 There is one further matter related to both the receipt of the investment funds by the First Respondent from the Applicant and the question of dealings by Mr Wallader in Federal Reserve Notes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s486">Ms Mustafa-Ay deposes at paragraph 56 of her affidavit filed 6 April 2006 to a discussion with a Federal Police Officer concerning the examination of documents held by the supervising solicitors arising out of the Anton Pillar order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s487">A copy of a letter from Mr Wallader on the letterhead of the First Respondent to Mr Wilch dated 22 May 2001 was amongst those documents and obtained by the Australian Federal Police pursuant to a search warrant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s488">Ms Mustafa-Ay does not depose to a belief in the information provided by Mr Moore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s489">Ms Mustafa-Ay does say that she caused a further search to be made of documents lodged with the Federal Court by the supervising solicitors, so as to obtain a copy of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s490">Ms Mustafa-Ay says that she believes the failure to locate the document amongst the documents located at the Federal Court of Australia is due to the supervising solicitors not lodging that document.</sentence>
<sentence id="s491">Ms Mustafa-Ay says she forwarded a copy of the letter dated 22 May 2001 forming part of "EMA12" to Mr Severin who advised her that it is the document he refers to at paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s492">Counsel for the Second Respondent says the letter should have been proved formally and particularly by a handwriting expert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s493">An examination of the letter reveals a clear and precise signature which is identical to the signature appearing on the letter signed by Mr Wallader referred to at paragraph [30] of these Reasons and identical to the signature appearing on the contract signed by Mr Wallader and marked Annexure "PJW7" to the affidavit of Mr Watts sworn 20 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s494">It seems to be open to conclude simply by examination of the signatures that the signature on the letter of 22 May 2001 is that of Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s495">As to the matter concerning the Applicant's investment funds, the letter is marked with the description, as a reference, "Investment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s496">USD2 million Joseph Severin" .</sentence>
<sentence id="s497">Mr Wallader says:
 
 "I have not had a chance to complete any further investments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s498">This will be done on my return however if the Client requires his money returned I will attend to this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s499">The money is sitting in the account in USD as undertaken, ready to be added to profits of more than USD500 million, returning a minimum of 100% per week.</sentence>
<sentence id="s500">" 
 
 

143 This letter, in terms, represents an acknowledgement of the receipt of the money, Mr Wallader's exercise of control over the funds and an apparent willingness to refund the money although the funds have never been repaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s501">144 As to the Federal Reserve Notes, Mr Wallader says:
 
 "I have brought forward a Mother Box larger than ever expected, not counting the two boxes, to the point they have advised that they have had to abandon the purchase of some of the smaller boxes, just to take both boxes in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s502">I am of the understanding that a trading program is set to trade just to settle the boxes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s503">Once they [the boxes] were photographed the owners took them back to the hills and buried them once again.</sentence>
<sentence id="s504">Presentation of documentation and photographs were accepted by the purchaser with the comment that the material presented was impeccable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s505">Boxes have been legally entrusted to my company to complete, settle and disburse funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s506">The transfer has also been accepted by the trust taking them into Treasury.</sentence>
<sentence id="s507">" 
 
 

145 Counsel for the First Respondent says that notwithstanding the analysis by the Applicant of the financial transactions discussed at paragraphs [129] to [135], there is a proper explanation for the source and expenditure of those monies, the assets remain in place, to the extent that monies have been expended on the pastoral property and other properties, the inherent value of the property has been increased and that there is no evidence of Mr and Mrs Wallader or any entity associated with Mr and Mrs Wallader removing assets from the reach of the Court or Court processes or realising assets to convert real property into moveable property for dissipation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s508">146 Moreover, Mr Watts deposes on information and belief to market appraisals obtained by Mr Wallader in respect of the two residential properties and the unit and the mortgages secured by those properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s509">Mr Watts says the properties secure a total debt of $1,261,000.00 producing a net equity of between $600,000.00 and $700,000.00 having regard to the value of between $1,860,000.00 and $1,980,000.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s510">No information is provided in relation to the value based on market appraisal or otherwise of Colinton Station .</sentence>
<sentence id="s511">147 Mr Watts exhibits to his affidavit ("PJW7") a contract dated 5 April 2006 for the purchase by D &amp; J Wallader Pty Ltd as trustee of the Wallader Family Trust of a further pastoral property described as Nurinda which is said to be contiguous with Colinton Station .</sentence>
<sentence id="s512">An auction took place on Wednesday, 5 April 2006 which led to the purchase.</sentence>
<sentence id="s513">The deposit is recited as $1,000.00 and the purchase price is recited as $1.3 million.</sentence>
<sentence id="s514">The Applicant says one should approach the authenticity of the contract with some degree of caution because the deposit amount of $1,000.00 seems oddly low and the date of the contract is immediately before the date of filing of the Notice of Motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s515">I propose to proceed on the footing that the contract is a legitimate contract deriving from an auction of the pastoral property by public auction on 5 April.</sentence>
<sentence id="s516">It seems unlikely that Mr Wallader on behalf of the trustee would have instructed a bid to have been made bringing into existence an unconditional contract at the auction as a contrivance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s517">Moreover, the material does not demonstrate that Mr Wallader knew of an impending application for an asset preservation order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s518">The contract is due to settle on 3 May 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s519">It seems to me that the acquisition of the property ought to be allowed to proceed particularly since an order preventing settlement will affect the rights of bona fide third parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s520">However, any further dealing in the property ought to be the subject of an order so as to preserve what is, in effect, the aggregated asset of Colinton Station and Nurinda .</sentence>
<sentence id="s521">Principles and Considerations to be Applied 
 
148 In determining whether an asset preservation order ought to be made, I am influenced by these considerations:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s522">Although his Honour the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Gleeson CJ in Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd (1989) NSWLR 319 (Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Rogers A-JA) observed at page 321 that "... in addition to any other considerations that may be relevant in the circumstances of a particular case, as a general rule a plaintiff will need to establish, first, a prima facie cause of action against the defendant, and secondly, a danger that by reason of the defendant's absconding, or of assets being removed out of the jurisdiction or disposed of within the jurisdiction or otherwise dealt with in some fashion, the plaintiff, if he succeeds, will not be able to have his judgment satisfied", their Honours Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 408 observed that the applicant "has to show a reasonably arguable case on legal as well as factual matters ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s523">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s524">The Mareva order for the preservation of assets is an expression of the development of doctrines and remedies to protect the integrity of the processes of the Court in the administration of justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s525">The scope of the order to be made in a particular case is conditioned by the source of the remedy and the power conferred by s.23 of the Federal Court Act 1976.</sentence>
<sentence id="s526">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s527">In respect of orders sought against parties to the proceeding against whom final relief is framed, the focus of the order is directed against the frustration of the Court's process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s528">If relief is available against non-parties, the focus of the Court's intervention must be the administration of justice: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (supra) at page 401, paragraph 42.</sentence>
<sentence id="s529">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s530">The evidence may establish deliberate blurring and attempts at transferring of property rights and interests which go beyond mere mixing or intermingling of affairs and in the light of such evidence, there is a sufficient basis for the grant of the relief: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (supra) at page 402, paragraph 47.</sentence>
<sentence id="s531">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s532">Although the relief takes effect in personam, the availability of an equitable or other proprietary remedy such as tracing may be sufficient to constitute a substantive right in aid of which the Mareva relief, in personam, might go.</sentence>
<sentence id="s533">Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (supra) at page 405, paragraph 55.</sentence>
<sentence id="s534">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s535">The evidence may establish that the directors of a company against whom proceedings are brought are "mere conduits" for the transmission to a third party of funds received by a respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s536">Such directors may exercise control over other entities which have received funds transferred by an applicant to a respondent on a certain basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s537">In assessing the activities of third parties generally, their Honours in Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (supra) at page 405, paragraph 57 said this: 
 
 
 "What then is the principle to guide the courts in determining whether to grant a Mareva relief in a case such as the present where the activities of third parties are the object sought to be restrained?</sentence>
<sentence id="s538">In our opinion, such an order may, and we emphasise the word 'may' be appropriate, assuming the existence of other relevant criteria and discretionary factors, in circumstances in which: (i) the third party holds, is using, or has exercised or is exercising a power of disposition over or is otherwise in possession of, assets, including 'claims and expectancies' of the judgment debtor or potential potential debtor; or (ii) some process, ultimately enforceable by the courts, is or may be available to the judgment creditor as a consequence of a judgment against that actual or potential judgment debtor, pursuant to which, whether by appointment of a liquidator, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or otherwise, the third party may be obliged to disgorge property or otherwise contribute to the funds or property of the judgment debtor to help satisfy the judgment against the judgment debtor".</sentence>
<sentence id="s539">
 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s540">The application of that principle is a matter of law although discretionary elements are involved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s541">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s542">In Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd (1989) NSWLR 319 at page 325, Gleeson CJ accepted the force of the criticism of the proposition that an applicant must show a "more than usual likelihood" of a defendant dealing with or disposing of his assets so as to defeat a plaintiff's claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s543">His Honour observed that "it may be that all that is meant is that the facts of the case disclose circumstances giving rise to such a likelihood other than the bare circumstances, which exists in the 'usual' case, that one person is being sued by another".</sentence>
<sentence id="s544">His Honour also rejected a balance of probabilities test as too inflexible observing that "it is not difficult to imagine situations in which justice and equity would require the granting of an injunction to prevent dissipation of assets pending the hearing of an action even though the risk of such dissipation may be assessed as being somewhat less probable than not " .</sentence>
<sentence id="s545">
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s546">In Patterson v BTR Engineering (Aust) Ltd (1989) NSWLR 319, the conduct in issue concerned a senior employee of BTR purchasing major items of equipment from overseas suppliers through a company interposed by the employee between the supplier and BTR.</sentence>
<sentence id="s547">The employee fraudulently procured the overpayment by BTR for equipment purchases thus securing a secret commission of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s548">In examining the evidence of that conduct, his Honour said: 
 
 
 
 
 "... the evidence as to the nature of the scheme in which the appellant was allegedly involved, which established a prima facie case against him, was such as to justify the conclusion that there was a danger that the appellant would dispose of assets in order to defeat any judgment that might be obtained against him and that such danger was sufficiently substantial to warrant the injunction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s549">
 There is no reason in principle why the evidence which is relevant to the first of the issues earlier referred to [a prima facie case] might not also have a bearing on the second, and this will especially be so where the prima facie case that is made out against the defendant is one of serious dishonesty involving diversion of money from its proper channels.</sentence>
<sentence id="s550">
 
 The present is not a case in which a plaintiff who claims simply to be an unsecured creditor seeks to prevent a dissipation of assets which have no particular connection with the claim in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s551">This is a case in which the plaintiff claims that the defendant, making use of a corporation controlled by him, fraudulently misappropriated a large sum of money which, if it is still under the control of the appellant would be quite likely to constitute, directly or indirectly the bulk of his assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s552">As Giles J held, the nature of the scheme in which, on the evidence to date, the appellant appears to have engaged, is such that it is reasonable to infer that he is not the sort of person who would, unless restrained, preserve his assets in tact so that they might be available to his judgment creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s553">" 
 
 
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s554">The Applicant may choose to lodge a proof of debt in the liquidation of the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s555">That proof might be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s556">If rejected, the Applicant may challenge the rejection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s557">The liquidator might well consider whether monies have been transferred by individuals to other entities in circumstances which confer a basis for a claim by the liquidator against particular parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s558">It may be that certain third parties will be obliged to disgorge property or otherwise contribute to the funds or property of the First Respondent in satisfaction of an accepted or demonstrated claim against the First Respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s559">The Applicant may seek to pursue an equitable or other proprietary remedy tracing its interest in the fund or the chose in action which may stand outside the liquidation rather than a claim for damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s560">11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s561">The Applicant has a prima facie case of a claim for monies had and received against the First or Second Respondents and may seek to pursue tracing remedies either at common law subject to the limitations upon the common law remedy or more particularly a tracing order in equity or particular declarations of charge again subject to the limitations upon the equitable remedies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s562">As to those matters see: Recovering Lost Assets: Tracing at Common Law and in Equity , Mr David Murr SC (2006) 27 Australian Bar Review, 174.</sentence>
<sentence id="s563">12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s564">A claim against either the First or Second Respondent for monies had and received will give rise to a prima facie obligation to make restitution to the Applicant, in the sense of compensation for the benefit of any unjust enrichment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s565">In Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1988] HCA 17 ; (1998) 164 CLR 662 at 673, Mason CJ, Wilson, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ observed: "The common law right of action may arise in circumstances which also give rise to a resulting trust of specific property or funds or which would lead a modern court to grant relief by way of constructive trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s566">However, notwithstanding that the grounds of the action for recovery are framed in the traditional words of trust or use and that contemporary legal principles of restitution or unjust enrichment can be equated with seminal equitable notions of good conscience, the action itself is not for the enforcement of a trust or for tracing or the recovery of specific money or property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s567">It is a common law action for recovery of the value of the unjust enrichment and the fact that specific money or property received can no longer be identified in that hands of the recipient or traced into other specific property which he holds does not of itself constitute an answer in a category of case in which the law imposes a prima facie liability to make restitution".</sentence>
<sentence id="s568">13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s569">It may be, with the benefit of proper discovery and non-party discovery, that the passage of the actual funds will be identified beyond the account of CPFSP/L in a way which reveals the acquisition of specific assets out of the funds (or a part of the funds) or accounts (intermingled or mixed) which support a tracing order or a declaration of charge or a constructive trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s570">The Applicant claims by way of final relief the subsistence of a constructive trust and a tracing order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s571">14.</sentence>
<sentence id="s572">In this case, the evidence for interlocutory purposes, establishes a strong prima facie case that monies were transferred by the Applicant to the First Respondent controlled by Mr and Mrs Wallader to be applied for a particular purpose in reliance upon Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s573">A substantial proportion of the funds were transferred to another company controlled by Mr and Mrs Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s574">Mr Wallader chooses not to admit the receipt of the funds and has elected not to swear any affidavit disclosing the treatment of the funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s575">In the period since the receipt of the funds, the Applicant has expended significant sums in improving assets under his control or under the control of proprietary entities of which he is a director.</sentence>
<sentence id="s576">Although there is no evidence that the actual funds transferred on or about 30 March to the First Respondent have been applied in a particular way (apart from the transfer of substantial funds to the account of CPFSP/L and the withdrawal of US$250,000.00) or to a particular asset, the inference is open that Mr Wallader has applied the monies to his own advantage or to the advantage of himself and his wife whether directly or by the vehicle of companies controlled by him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s577">15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s578">Although the events leading to the agreement of 30 March 2001 and the transfer of the Applicant's funds occurred in March 2001, the evidence for interlocutory purposes, establishes an explanation for the election on the part of the Applicant not to commence proceedings until either it became clear that the investment would not be made by Mr Wallader or until efforts by ARL and the Applicant's solicitors failed to result in a refund of the investment monies as promised by Mr Wallader.</sentence>
<sentence id="s579">16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s580">Although the Second Respondent says the action has been on foot for a year, the Applicant secured access to the documents pursuant to the Anton Pillar order relatively recently on 10 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s581">Whilst the Respondents were not able to undertake the task of categorising of the documents into the privileged and non-privileged groups for eight weeks due to an illness on the part of Mr Wallader and other delays were explained on the basis of Mr Wallader suffering a bee sting which provoked an allergy reaction, the Respondents failed to comply with directions orders and ultimately took no step to assert privilege of any kind in respect of the documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s582">The Applicant was in effect held out of the benefit of the Anton Pillar order from the date of execution on 14 March 2005 until counsel for the Applicant saw the documents in Melbourne for the first time in the week beginning 13 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s583">The execution of the Anton Pillar order failed to reveal bank statements for the National Australia Bank account to which the Applicant's funds were transferred and nor do the documents reveal the field of documents comprehended by paragraph 1 of Schedule A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s584">17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s585">The conjunction of the failure on the part of the Second Respondent to effect a refund of the investment monies by the First Respondent as promised by him, his election to remain silent concerning the application of the funds and any material particular in relation to them, his election to put the Applicant to proof as to the receipt of the funds by the First Respondent, the delays in dealing expeditiously with the claim of privilege either on the ground of legal professional privilege or the privilege against self-incrimination thus preventing the Applicant from securing access to documents arising out of the execution of the Anton Pillar order, is evidence which has a strong bearing on the risk of a dealing in the assets of the Second Respondent or entities controlled by him so as to defeat the benefit of any judgment in terms of the relief claimed in the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s586">Although the Second Respondent says that the Applicant could and should have brought applications for third party discovery against various banks and other parties to discover the chain of dealing in the Applicant's funds, the Applicant is entitled to proceed on the basis that execution of the Anton Pillar order would properly reveal the receipt and treatment of the monies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s587">18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s588">Although it is true that the real property assets of Mr and Mrs Wallader and the trustee of the Wallader Family Trust remain in place and unrealised, there have been substantial dealings in the assets and the creation of charges.</sentence>
<sentence id="s589">Mr Wallader has not sworn to the value of the assets directly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s590">Mr Watts has sworn to information from Mr Wallader of information given to Mr Wallader by a valuer but limited to the three domestic properties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s591">No evidence has been provided of value in relation to Colinton Station .</sentence>
<sentence id="s592">19.</sentence>
<sentence id="s593">It seems to me that by reason of all these factors, there is, in the light of all the material, a risk of dissipation of assets or a risk of a further dealing in assets which would be prejudicial to an effective remedy ordered in favour of the Applicant consequent upon a trial of the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s594">20.</sentence>
<sentence id="s595">In Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (supra) at page 404, their Honours referred to a number of considerations demanding care in the exercise of the power to grant a Mareva order including difficulties associated with the quantification and recovery of damages pursuant to the undertaking should it transpire that the order ought not have been granted (see paragraph 52), the identification of the trigger events leading to dissolution of the order, discretionary considerations (see paragraph 53), the availability of and possible failure of the Applicant to take other proceedings which might be efficacious and the conditioning of the grant of the relief upon an undertaking by the Applicant to ensure as far as is possible, the expedition of the proceedings (see paragraph 53).</sentence>
<sentence id="s596">21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s597">In this case, it may be difficult to assess and quantify damages pursuant to the undertaking as to damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s598">However, the strength of the claim is compelling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s599">The difficulty of quantification of the claim might weigh more heavily in the exercise of the discretion if the Second Respondent had proffered some explanation as to the location of the funds or provided an explanation, by affidavit, of the apparent inconsistency between his election not to admit receipt of the monies and the sequence of oral and written communications contained in the affidavits of the Applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s600">The Directions Orders provide for a trial of the action in approximately two months which provide the Second Respondent with a clear commitment from the Applicant to prosecute the action and the horizon by which the orders might be dissolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s601">The Second Respondent remains at liberty to make an application for security for costs should he choose to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s602">22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s603">On the question of the susceptibility of the two instruments to stamp duty under Queensland legislation, that matter need not be resolved as the Applicant has now provided an undertaking to pay any stamp duty assessed to be payable in respect of the Agreement or the Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity.</sentence>

149 In the Notice of Motion, the Applicant seeks an order that the Second Respondent bring funds into the Commonwealth of Australia deposited to an account maintained at a bank with a head office within the Commonwealth, a further order that the Second Respondent surrender his passport and an order granting leave to the Applicant to further amend the Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s605">I am not prepared to make either of the first two orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s606">As to the third, the proposed amendment simply adds a prayer for relief based upon alleged contraventions of a number of provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and particularly sections 588FDA , 588FB and 5961(b).</sentence>
