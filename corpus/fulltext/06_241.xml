<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of Bennett J given and made on 4 November 2005, whereby her Honour refused an application for an order nisi in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 20 September 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">By that decision, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister which had refused the applicant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 By the applicant's proposed notice of appeal, the applicant seeks a declaration that s 424A(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) is ultra vires the Constitution , and relief is also sought upon the basis of alleged failure of the Tribunal to consider relevant country information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Though the applicant has filed written submissions in support of his application for leave to appeal, the same do not address the orders sought in his draft notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Instead by those submissions, the applicant asserts that the decision of the Tribunal involved a 'jurisdictional error of law involving an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law to the fact ( sic ) of the case'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">No legal basis or reasoning or at least adequate and plausible reasoning was purportedly provided for that assertion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The applicant arrived in Australia on 7 February 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">His application for a protection (class AZ) visa was refused by a delegate of the Minister on 23 March 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The applicant's subsequent application for review was addressed by the Tribunal with considerable thought and care, extending over some 17 pages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">A subsequent application for prerogative relief filed with the High Court on 19 May 2003 led to the subsequent remission to the Federal Court of the haring of the order nisi thereby sought, which, as I have above stated, was unsuccessfully pursued before Bennett J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 In his oral address to the Court, the applicant was unable to distil any viable basis for reversing in whole or in part the reasons for judgment of Bennett J handed down on 4 November 2005, such as to justify the grant of leave to appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">In particular no viable submission was made to me demonstrative of any error of law in her Honour's approach or reasoning, either in the applicant's written submissions filed on 3 March 2006 or otherwise in oral address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The written submissions constituted in substance or reality a rehearsal of complaints as to the Tribunal's findings upon the factual merits or otherwise of the Tribunal's findings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 The application for leave must therefore be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Associate:
