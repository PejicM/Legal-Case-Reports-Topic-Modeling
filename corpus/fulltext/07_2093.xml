1 Presently before the Court is an Applicatio n for an Anton Piller order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">This Court has jurisdiction to make such orders: see Television Broadcasts Ltd v Nguyen (1988) 21 FCR 34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">See also O 25B rr 1---2 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) and Practice Note No 24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 
2 The principles to be applied when considering such Applications have been addressed in a number of decisions, including Addison Wesley Longman Australia Pty Ltd v Kopystop Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1518.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Justice Stone there observed: 
 
 [9] The considerations governing the grant of an Anton Piller order in this Court are concisely set out by Branson J in Microsoft Corporation v Goodview Electronics Pty Limited (1999) 49 IPR 159 [9]-[14].</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Her Honour refers, as do most judgments in this area, to the oft quoted comments of Ormrod LJ in the seminal case, Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Ltd [[1976] 1 All ER 779 at 784], where his Lordship listed the preconditions for the grant of an Anton Piller order: 
 
 
 'First, there must be an extremely strong prima facie case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Secondly, the damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Thirdly, there must be clear evidence that the defendants have in their possession incriminating documents or things, and that there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before any Application inter partes can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">' 

The following observations of Lord Denning MR in Anton Piller at 783 itself may also usefully be recalled, namely:
 
 It seems to me that such an order can be made by a judge ex parte, but it should only be made where it is essential that the plaintiff should have inspection so that justice can be done between the parties; and when, if the defendant were forewarned, there is a grave danger that vital evidence will be destroyed, that papers will be burnt or lost or hidden, or taken beyond the jurisdiction, and so the ends of justice be defeated; and when the inspection would do no real harm to the defendant or his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 
 

Appl'd: Long v Specifier Publications Pty Ltd (1998) 44 NSWLR 545 at 554 per Powell JA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">These principles have now been largely enshrined in O 25B r 3 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 Upon undertakings being given in accordance with Practice Note No 24 , it is considered that such an order should be made in the present proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Consideration has been given to whether that order should be refused as a matter of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It has been concluded that that discretion should not be exercised so as to deny relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">THE APPLICANTS 
 
4 The First Applicant is the Australian subsidiary of Metso Minerals, a Finnish company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The Second Applicant is an American subsidiary of the Finnish company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 Both companies form part of the Metso Corporation, a global engineering and technology business with more than 26,000 employees in more than 50 countries and net sales in 2006 of approximately &#8364;5 billion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The Metso Group designs, manufacturers and services a range of ore processing equipment, the most important of which is its comminution equipment, including grinding mills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Group manufacturers a range of grinding mills in a range of sizes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">7 The design of a new grinding mill requires the preparation of extensive design documentation, including design standards, manufacturing drawings, assembly drawings and commissioning manuals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">THE RESPONDENTS 
 
8 The First Respondent, Mr Kalra, was employed by the First Applicant from 2001 to 2007 as the Regional Product Manager: Grinding (Asia Pacific).</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">His contract of employment contains express provisions as to confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 27 September 2007 he tendered his resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">9 The Second Respondent, Mr Rauscher, has been employed by the First Applicant for a number of years and for the last five years he has occupied the position of Senior Product Engineer: Grinding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He tendered his resignation on 13 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">His contract of employment also contains express provisions as to confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 The Third Respondent has been a contractor to the First Applicant for approximately 12 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">That contract was terminated on 14 November 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">It was the Third Respondent that employed the Fourth Respondent, Mr Tuckwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">The Fourth Respondent executed a confidentiality agreement with the First Applicant on 23 April 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">11 In early November 2007 the Applicants became aware that Messrs Kalra, Rauscher and Tuckwood had accepted positions as employees with the CITIC group of companies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The CITIC Group is a large Chinese corporate group predominantly involved in international banking and heavy manufacturing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">A STRONG PRIMA FACIE CASE?</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
12 Addison , it will be noted, refers to the need for there to be an " extremely strong prima facie case ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Order 25B r 3(a) refers to the need for there to be a " strong prima facie case ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">It is unnecessary in the present Application to pursue such differences as may be occasioned by r 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">On either appeal, the requirement is satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">13 The Application as filed claims that the Respondents have breached equitable duties of confidence owed to the Applicants together with other claims, including breach of copyright and breach of fiduciary obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">14 Submissions advanced in support of the ex parte relief sought have confined attention to breach of obligations of confidentiality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">15 The obligations of confidentiality, it was submitted, arose both by reason of the express terms of contractual provisions and by reason of the nature of the information itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">16 The breaches of those obligations was said to be evidenced by Messrs Kalra, Rauscher and Tuckwood downloading confidential computer programs and drawings of the Applicants and, in all probability, making that confidential material available to their current employer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">17 Reference has already been made to the express contractual obligations of confidence assumed by Messrs Kalra, Rauscher and Tuckwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In addition to each of the contracts executed by these Respondents, each also executed a " termination checklist " recording documents and other materials returned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Part of the checklist was an acknowledgment which referred to the documents and materials returned and thereafter stating in part as follows:
 
 I do not have any other Metso Minerals documents, reference manuals, part books, drawings, company property purchased by the company, or any other record containing confidential information which is the property of Metso Minerals ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In addition, I acknowledge that upon terminating my employment with Metso Minerals, that I am still bound by confidentiality clauses as stated in my employment agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">

18 In addition to these express contractual provisions being the source of the obligations of confidence owed by those individuals, the Applicants also correctly submit that there is a strong prima facie case that there is an independent equitable obligation of confidence: see Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories (Australia) Ltd &amp; AlphaPharm Pty Ltd v Department of Community Services (1990) 22 FCR 73.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Gummow J there observed at 87:
 
 A general formulation apt for the present case of an equitable obligation of confidence has four elements: (i) the plaintiff must be able to identify with specificity, and not merely in global terms, that which is said to be the information in question, and must be able to show that (ii) the information has the necessary quality of confidentiality (and is not, for example, common or public knowledge), (iii) the information was received by the defendant in such circumstances as to import an obligation of confidence, and (iv) there is actual or threatened misuse of that information, without the consent of the plaintiff.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">... 

19 Each of these " four elements ", it is considered, has presently been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The confidentiality of (for example) design drawings and design standards is evidenced in part by such documents being marked " This document is confidential and must not be made public or copied without prior written authorization from Metso .</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">"
 
20 Access to the documents is also strictly controlled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Thus, for example, even the Vice-President of the First Applicant does not have direct access to design documents for capital equipment products, such as grinding mills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Design drawings and design standards are said to be particularly sensitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Design drawings are never supplied to a customer or any other external party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">21 The breach of the obligations of confidence, it is considered, has also been prima facie established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">This breach has been established on a prima facie basis by reason of the downloading of computer programs, the lack of any reason why the Respondents should be in possession of some of the programs downloaded, and the ability of the CITIC Group to now compete in a market in which it was previously not a participant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">22 The Executive Manager of Computer Forensics at Ferrier Hodgson, Mr Carson, has conducted a forensic investigation of the Applicant's laptop computers used by Messrs Kalra, Rauscher and Tuckwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">That investigation exposed files of the Applicants being accessed and files being deleted 
 
23 With reference to the position of Mr Tuckwood, for example, searches were undertaken of Metso's computer systems after his departure to determine which documents Mr Tuckwood had accessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Concern was immediately expressed that Mr Tuckwood may have accessed documents for purposes other than the business of the Metso Group when it emerged that he had accessed design documents related to " pad bearings ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The design of these components is never undertaken in any part of the Metso Group other than in America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">There was no reason why Mr Tuckwood or anyone else outside the American centre would need to download these drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">A further analysis was undertaken to identify those documents which may have related to projects currently being undertaken by Metso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The result of that analysis was that a large number of documents were identified as having been accessed which did not relate to any such current engagement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">24 Moreover, on 5 November 2007 -- two days before Mr Tuckwood communicated his intention to terminate his company's contract with Metso -- he inserted a USB drive into the computer at 6:49am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">At 9:04am on the same day an internet site was accessed, being an email account of Mr Tuckwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Between 6:49am and 9:04am a number of the Applicants' documents were accessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">An available inference is that the Applicants' documents were accessed and transferred to the email address.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">25 On 12 November 2007 a generic USB flash drive was again inserted into Metso's computer system.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">There was no apparent and legitimate reason for Mr Tuckwood to be then accessing the Applicant's programs or information or downloading drawings or other information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">26 Comparable evidence has been given to specific programs accessed by Mr Kalra and Mr Rauscher, being programs to which neither had any legitimate reason to access.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In the case of Mr Kalra, specific documents were identified as having been accessed two or three days before he resigned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In the case of Mr Rauscher, there is evidence that he accessed documents upon the very day he tendered his resignation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">27 Both the time of day and the accessing of materials so close to termination of services or thereafter only serves to strengthen an available inference that the computer records of the Applicants have been improperly accessed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SERIOUS DAMAGE 
 
28 Order 25B r 3(b) refers to " potential or actual loss or damage to the applicant ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The actual or potential damage asserted by the Applicants in the present Application can loosely fall within either of two categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">29 One way in which the Applicants submit they may suffer damage is that at present the Metso Group have one main competitor, FL Schmidt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">FL Schmidt has, at present, the capacity to manufacture mills up to 38 ft in diameter, whereas the Metso Group can manufacturer mills up to 40 ft in diameter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">In addition to FL Schmidt, the next closest competitor is the Krupp-Polysius corporate group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">30 The manufacture of a successful grinding mill requires a great deal of " know-how " which cannot be discerned simply by a physical examination of individual mills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The documents which have been accessed would enable a competitor to immediately tender for projects and manufacture and supply mills without themselves having to undertake the research and development pursued by the Applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The Metso Group has invested 25 years of development into producing ever larger mills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">31 The second way in which the Applicants claim that they establish a serious risk of actual or potential damage is to maintain that the risk is real and immediate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The risk, contend the Applicants, has already materialised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In this respect the Applicants point to negotiations being carried out as from 2006 with the CITIC Group for the purchase by that Group of grinding mills for a mining project at Cape Weston in Western Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">32 The Cape Weston project will involve at least five and possibly up to nine ore processing " lines ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Each ore processing line consists of:
 
 
 (a) a primary grinding mill, likely a 40 ft autogenous grinding mill; 
 (b) two secondary grinding mills, likely 26 ft ball mills; and
 (c) a number of " tertiary " or " regrinding " Vertimills.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 

The Vertimill, it should be noted, is a unique grinding mill, largely developed by Metso.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">It is not manufactured by any other company in the world.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It is a particularly valuable product line for the Metso Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">To protect its technology, Metso does not subcontract the design and manufacture of this mill to any company outside of the Group.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">33 In July 2007, however, CITIC discontinued negotiations with Metso for the supply of mills and stated that it now planned to manufacture such mills itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In the absence of specific design standards, it is said to be almost impossible for any manufacturing subsidiary of CITIC to commence building mills of the requisite size.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">34 Prior to July 2007, the CITIC Group had never been a competitor of the Applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">And, it is said to be " almost impossible ... to commence building mills of that size and sophistication which would be ready for immediate operational use ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">A typical Metso grinding mill, it is said, might require 1000 hours of design and drafting of drawings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">35 The inference, submit the Applicants, is that the CITIC Group was only able to cease negotiations and to supply the mills itself via a subsidiary by reason of the information now available to it from Messrs Kalra, Rauscher and Tuckwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">A REAL POSSIBILITY AS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENTIARY MATERIALS 
 
36 The possibility that evidentiary materials in the possession of the Respondents may be destroyed in the absence of an order now being made is said to follow from the deletion to date of computer records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">37 There is, for example, evidence of Mr Tuckwood deleting material from his laptop and the deletion of email correspondence with Messrs Kalra and Rauscher.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Mr Tuckwood declined to allow Mr Carson to examine his laptop computer, except in his presence, and declined to allow Mr Carson to use his own software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The use of such software would have facilitated searches to be undertaken because the search functions in Microsoft Windows are limited and slow.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">Mr Carson's programs would also have enabled him to look for deleted files and hidden or encrypted data.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">No reason was given by Mr Tuckwood in refusing to allow Mr Carson to use that software.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Mr Tuckwood also modified files on his laptop less than a half hour before Mr Carson attended Metso's premises to conduct his investigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">38 An examination of Mr Kalra's laptop revealed that materials and emails had been deleted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Mr Carson, however, was able to recover over one thousand drawings documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Mr Rauscher's laptop also evidenced files being deleted and having " been filtered to remove some codes .</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">" 
 
39 The circumstances in which confidential information has been accessed, presumably downloaded or transferred, and thereafter deleted from computers is sufficient to found a conclusion that there is a real possibility that evidence will be destroyed if the orders now sought are not made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">ORDERS 
 

 
40 The orders of the Court are that:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Until further order, pages 19, 20, 22 and 23 of exhibit MG-01 to the affidavit of Mark Glendenning, affirmed on 29 November 2007, be confidential and access limited to: 
 
 
 a) The Applicants and their advisors; and
 b) The legal representatives of the Respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">Orders be made in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 27 of the short minutes of order of the penal notices directed to the First, Second, Third and Fourth Respondents in the form initialled by me and placed with papers on 11 December 2007.</sentence>
