1 Pinnacle Network (Australia) Pty Ltd (controlled by Mr Richards) and Amlaki FZ LLC, a Dubai company in which Mr Balfaqih (also known as Mr Mahfooz) is a director, agreed in 2004 to establish a joint venture that would develop software to sell, lease and market properties and accommodation over the internet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The joint venture was to operate through an Australian company, Amlaki Australia Pty Ltd, in which Pinnacle held 20 shares and Amlaki FZ held 80 shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The directors of Amlaki Australia were Mr Balfaqih and Mr Richards, who was also its secretary and Chief Operations Officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Pinnacle was appointed to provide consultancy services to Amlaki FZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 In late 2007 the relationship between the parties broke down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Amlaki FZ decided to remove Mr Richards as director and secretary of Amlaki Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A resolution to that effect was purportedly passed at a meeting of members held on 22 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">But there was no quorum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">To repair the position Amlaki FZ and Mr Balfaqih applied under s 1322(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for an order that the resolutions were not invalid notwithstanding the absence of a quorum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I made the declarations sought, but reserved the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 Immediately after the declarations were made, Pinnacle brought oppression proceedings against Amlaki Australia, Amlaki FZ and Mr Balfaqih.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Pinnacle sought an order that its shares in Amlaki Australia be purchased either by Amlaki FZ or Mr Balfaqih at an amount fixed by an independent valuer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In the alternative Pinnacle sought the winding up of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 It is convenient to deal first with the costs of the s 1322 application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The immediate background to the irregularly held meeting is as follows.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">On 29 February 2008 Mr Richards wrote to Mr Balfaqih giving 14 days notice of the termination of the consultancy agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This was followed by a letter dated 4 March 2008 from Baker &amp; McKenzie, acting on behalf of Amlaki FZ and Mr Balfaqih, requesting Mr Richards' "immediate resignation as a director and secretary of Amlaki Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">" On 1 April 2008 Mr Balfaqih wrote to Mr Richards advising him that his appointment as Chief Operations Officer was "terminated with immediate effect".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">In the same letter Mr Richards was invited to resign as a director and secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On the same day Pinnacle was served with a notice of a general meeting to be held on 8 April 2008 if there was consent to short notice, or if there be no consent, on 22 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Pinnacle was advised that the meeting would be convened by telephone and initiated by Amlaki FZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The only substantive item of business to be considered in the meeting was the removal of Mr Richards as director and secretary and the appointment of Mr Hinz to those positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">5 Pinnacle did not consent to short notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Accordingly, the meeting was held on 22 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is some dispute regarding whether the parties agreed to postpone the meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Baker &amp; McKenzie were told Pinnacle's solicitors, Kliger Partners, were not available on 22 April 2008 and that Mr Richards would be away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Kliger Partners asked that the meeting be deferred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">They are of the view that an agreement had been reached to that effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">That view, however, was rejected by Baker &amp; McKenzie in an email sent minutes before the meeting commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In the end nothing turns on the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">6 The meeting commenced by teleconference at 6.10pm.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Mr Balfaqih, with a lawyer for Amlaki FZ, attended the meeting from Dubai.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Mr Hinz and two solicitors from Baker &amp; McKenzie were in attendance in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">No representative of Pinnacle was present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Resolutions removing Mr Richards as a director and secretary were passed, as were resolutions appointing Mr Hinz to those positions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">7 The resolutions were ineffective because there was an insufficient quorum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Hence this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">According to s 1322(2) , a procedural irregularity will not invalidate a proceeding under the Corporations Act unless the irregularity has caused, or may cause, substantial injustice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Section 1322(1)(b)(i) specifies that a procedural irregularity includes the absence of a quorum at a meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Prima facie, the resolutions carried at a meeting inquorate may be regularised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Here the matter is not so simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Amlaki FZ knew that the meeting was without a quorum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">There is dispute in the cases as regards whether a "procedural irregularity" includes the absence of a quorum that is the result of deliberate conduct: see Re P W Saddington &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (1990) 19 NSWLR 674; Re Pembury Pty Ltd [1993] 1 Qd R 125; McGellin v Mount King Mining NL (1998) 144 FLR 288; Whitehouse v Capital Radio Network Pty Ltd (2004) 13 Tas R 27.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">8 For the purposes of this case, I need not enter the debate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">It is clearly undesirable for a member of a company to convene a meeting where the member knows that a quorum will not be present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">In most cases the meeting should be postponed or adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In this case, however, the particular circumstances warranted a pragmatic approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Counsel for Pinnacle and Mr Richards accepted the reality of the situation, namely that Mr Richards was to be removed as a director and secretary come what may.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">There is also the countervailing rule that a minority shareholder is not entitled to frustrate the wishes of the majority by absenting himself from company meetings: Re H R Paul &amp; Son Ltd (1973) 118 Sol Jo 166.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Accordingly I suggested to the parties it would have been an exercise in futility (and wasteful of costs) to require another meeting to achieve a known result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">With but feint opposition I made the declaration that the absence of a quorum was a procedural irregularity that did not invalidate the resolutions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The costs were put to one side pending the resolution of the still threatened oppression proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">9 So far as the costs are concerned, the usual rule is that where an indulgence is sought the party seeking the indulgence pays the costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">I can see no reason to depart from this rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">10 This brings me to the second dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">When I validated the resolutions I also ordered Pinnacle bring on its threatened oppression application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">In due course that application was filed and Amlaki FZ and Mr Balfaqih were joined as defendants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I indicated to the parties that, having read the plaintiffs' material, I was minded to make an order that its shares be purchased because it was apparent that Pinnacle and the defendants, Amlaki FZ and Mr Balfaqih, could never work together.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In these circumstances a buy-out order was preferable to a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The parties seemed to be in agreement and, accordingly, I ordered that Pinnacle obtain an independent accountant to value its shareholding and that Amlaki Australia make its books and records available for that purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">11 In the course of preparing the valuation some rather surprising facts came to light.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">When Pinnacle and Amlaki FZ established their relationship they entered into a joint venture shareholders agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">This is an important agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The recitals record that "Pinnacle and Amlaki Offshore (a company related to Amlaki FZ) wish to form a joint venture to develop and market information technology software in the Australian and New Zealand markets and have agreed to incorporate the Company [a reference to Amlaki Australia] as the joint venture vehicle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">" To this end cl 4 of the joint venture agreement provided (in cl 4.1) that the shareholders would procure that Amlaki Australia carried on business; (in cl 4.2) that Amlaki Australia would allot twenty shares to Pinnacle and eighty shares to Amlaki Offshare; and (in cl 4.3) that further shares would be issued to Pinnacle and Amlaki Offshore if the net profit after tax of Amlaki Australia exceeded a certain sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In other words the parties contemplated that Amlaki Australia would be an operating company through which the joint venture would be conducted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">12 Following the order that there be a valuation of Pinnacle's shares, Amlaki FZ alleged that Amlaki Australia was not the joint venture vehicle but rather the manager of a partnership between Pinnacle and Amlaki FZ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Mr Baron, an accountant who acts for Amlaki Australia, deposed that "the sole function of [Amlaki Australia] was to act as manager of the partnership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">" He said that Amlaki Australia "has not owned assets or traded in its own right".</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">He also said that if he "were to prepare accounts for [Amlaki Australia] in its own right, those accounts would show paid up share capital of $100 and assets of $100 and no liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">Accordingly the value of [ Amlaki Australia] is virtually nil.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">"
 
13 Mr Baron did not explain how it was that Amlaki Australia performed functions different from those which the joint venturers had agreed it would perform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Nor did he explain why he had prepared no accounts for Amlaki Australia during the years of its operations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">After all on his account Amlaki Australia did conduct operations as manager in at least the 2005, 2006 and 2007 financial years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">However that may be Pinnacle and Amlaki FZ agreed to compromise the oppression action on the basis that Pinnacle would sell its shares for $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is in those circumstances that the costs issue must be resolved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">14 I propose to deal with the costs in accordance with the following propositions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Pinnacle's application was bound to succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">It is problematic whether the evidence it filed in support of its application would justify a finding of oppression and, hence, a buy-out order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">But there is little doubt Pinnacle would at least have succeeded on its alternative claim for the winding up of Amlaki Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">15 Against that I must assess the reasonableness of Pinnacle's conduct in rejecting two offers of settlement that were made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">The first offer was made on 23 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Amlaki FZ offered to purchase Pinnacle's shares for $5,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The offer was open for acceptance until 9.30 am on 24 June 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It was not accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The second offer was made on 9 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">This time the offer was to purchase Pinnacle's shares for $10,000 plus pay the plaintiffs' legal costs assessed on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The second offer was open for acceptance until 24 July 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Pinnacle did not accept the second offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">If Pinnacle acted unreasonably in rejecting the two offers it would be proper to require it to pay the defendants' costs which, had Pinaccle accepted the offers, would not have been incurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">On this aspect, I think Pinnacle was justified in rejecting the first offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At the time Pinnacle did not fully appreciate the lay of the land and was at least justified in bringing the action to see what discovery would disclose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The same cannot be said of Pinnacle's refusal to accept the second offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">That refusal was unreasonable and nothing has been put forward to justify it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">16 In my view, therefore, the costs of the action should be apportioned as follows: (a) Pinnacle should have its costs taxed on a party party basis until 12 July 2008 (giving it three days to consider and accept the second offer); and (b) Pinnacle should pay the defendants' costs on and after 13 July 2008 taxed on an indemnity basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">By that day Pinnacle knew, or it ought to have known, that the offer was more favourable than what it would achieve in financial terms by continuing with the action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.</sentence>
