1 On 5 November 2004, in an action for breach of trust, and misleading or deceptive conduct, McInnis FM found for Internet Centre of Excellence 2000 Pty Ltd ("ICE 2000") [2004] FMCA 765.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">ICE 2000 was the applicant below and is the respondent to this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">His Honour ordered Computer World (Victoria) Pty Ltd ("Computer World"), the appellant, to pay an amount of just over $62,000 by way of damages, together with costs fixed in the sum of $28,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He dismissed a cross-claim filed on behalf of Computer World.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 The trial occupied several days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It was conducted without pleadings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The facts were essentially quite simple.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">ICE 2000 conducted a retail computer sales outlet on behalf of the Computer World until approximately April 2002.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Computer World permitted ICE 2000 to use its signage, and supplied it with stock.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">ICE 2000 would account to Computer World in relation to sales of stock, and receive commissions from it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 As part of the arrangement between the parties, ICE 2000 deposited an amount of $50,000 with Computer World pursuant to what was described as "a credit facility", dated 6 December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It is unnecessary to set out the terms of that document in their entirety.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">However, the relevant parts are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 "Re credit facility, 
 
 We, the undersigned, Computer World (Vic) Pty Ltd, agree to grant you credit facility for the purchase of computers and associated goods ("goods") on the following terms and conditions: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">That you deposit an amount of $50,000 ("security amount") (the receipt of which is acknowledged) into a separate interest bearing account to be opened in the name of Computer World (Vic) Pty Ltd and titled Internet Centre of Excellence 2000 Pty Ltd Trust Account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The security amount can only be drawn upon by Computer World (Vic) Pty Ltd in the event the Internet Centre of Excellence 2000 Pty Ltd fails to pay for goods purchased within the trading terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">" 
 
 

4 The credit facility was executed by Mr Murugesu Yuvarajah on behalf of Computer World, and by Mr Baris Hasturk on behalf of ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Mr Hasturk was, at that time, an employee of ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was common ground that a cheque for $50,000, described as "the security amount", was provided by ICE 2000 to Computer World, and banked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, the proceeds of that cheque were not put into a separate interest bearing account in the name of Computer World and "titled an Internet Centre of Excellence 2000 Pty Ltd Trust account", as specified in the credit facility, but rather into Computer World's general account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The money was used by Computer World in the course of its ordinary business dealings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">5 Ultimately the relationship between the parties broke down, and ICE 2000 sued to recover the $50,000 (less a minor adjustment of several hundred dollars), together with interest on that sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Computer World's cross-claim related to non-payment for goods supplied by it to ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">As previously indicated, his Honour dismissed the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">There is no appeal from that part of his Honour's orders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Nothing further need therefore be said about the cross-claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 The primary issue at trial was whether the $50,000, which was paid into Computer World's general account, and used for ordinary business purposes, was trust money.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The credit facility, in its terms, suggested that the parties regarded it as such.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Insofar as it represented a written agreement between them, the security amount was impressed with the character of a trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">7 Before his Honour Mr Yuvarajah gave evidence that, although he had signed the credit facility, it had been "a mistake".</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">He claimed that there was an oral agreement between Mr Hasturk and himself to the effect that, notwithstanding the terms of the credit facility, the $50,000 need not in fact be deposited in a separate interest bearing account, as specified, but could instead be used by Computer World as ordinary working capital.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">8 McInnis FM found that the credit facility created either an express or implied trust of the security amount in favour of ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He rejected the evidence of Mr Yuvarajah that a separate oral agreement had been reached with Mr Hasturk which relieved Computer World of its obligations under the credit facility to establish a separate interest bearing account as a trust account in favour of ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He regarded the terms of the credit facility as clear and unambiguous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">He also found Mr Yuvarajah not to be a credible witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He said that it was implausible that Mr Yuvarajah would have signed the credit facility, as he claimed, "by mistake".</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">9 His Honour regarded the evidence presented by both parties as unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">He noted that ICE 2000 had not called Mr Hasturk as a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">There was some hearsay evidence from Ms Anne Gardner, on behalf of ICE 2000, to the effect that Mr Hasturk had "since returned to his homeland of Turkey", and that his whereabouts at the time of the trial were unknown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">In these circumstances, his Honour declined to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference against ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 After judgment in this matter was delivered, Computer World discovered that Mr Hasturk had not in fact gone to Turkey, but had at all material times been in Melbourne and available to give evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Moreover, he was easily capable of being contacted by ICE 2000 because he retained the same mobile telephone number that he had used when employed by that company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">11 By notice of motion dated 11 April 2005, Computer World sought leave to lead further evidence on the appeal to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">Essentially, that further evidence is contained in an affidavit sworn by Mr Hasturk in which he deposed to his understanding of the arrangement he had entered into with Mr Yuvarajah at the time that the credit facility was signed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">12 Mr Hasturk's affidavit discloses that he first learned of the proceedings between Computer World and ICE 2000 on 23 November 2004, several weeks after McInnis FM delivered judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">He deposes that he was responsible, on behalf of ICE 2000, for all negotiations with Computer World in November and December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">He says that he can recall discussions regarding "a security deposit of $50,000".</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">He says that the deposit was paid so that ICE 2000 could obtain stock from Computer World, and that it was regarded essentially as a line of credit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">13 Importantly, Mr Hasturk deposes:
 
 
 "9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The only agreement in writing between the two parties that I am aware of is the contract concerning the $50,000 security deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">
 
 
 
 
 
 10.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I remember a verbal agreement, the exact terms which I cannot recall, with Murugesu Yuvarajah regarding a $50,000 security deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This money was to be held by Computer World until the termination of trading between the parties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">If either party terminated the contract then the basic understanding was that the security deposit less any outstanding stock unpaid for by Ice2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">[sic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">]
 
 11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The contract which I presented to Murugesu Yuvarajah was a formality which I had drafted using a solicitor as per my instructions from Ice2000 management.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">I can not recall anything about establishing a separate trust account for the $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">
 
 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">To the best of my knowledge I do not believe that Mr. Yuvarajah had any understanding of creating a separate trust account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">There had never been any discussions about creating a separate trust account for the security deposit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">" 
 
 

14 His affidavit continues:
 
 
 "15.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I have remained in Melbourne, Australia at all times since 1990.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">I have always been available to be contacted since then.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">
 
 16.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">I have not returned to Turkey to live nor have I ever considered doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Any such suggestion is entirely refuted and completely false.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">My contact details have remained the same since my departure from Ice2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">they [sic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">] have not changed since December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">My mobile phone number has remained 0419 200 040 and I could easily been [sic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">] contacted by management at Ice2000 should they have attempted to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Nobody from Ice2000 has attempted to make contact with me since my departure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">" 
 
 
 

15 Computer World relies upon s 27 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) as the basis for the receipt by this Court of this further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">Pursuant to that section, the power of the Court to receive further evidence on appeal is discretionary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The discretion is a wide one, but must be exercised judicially: CDJ v VAJ [1998] HCA 76 ; (1998) 197 CLR 172 at 185.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Factors such as finality, discoverability of the evidence and its likely effect on the orders made are usually relevant to the exercise of the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">16 Computer World submits that had the evidence of Mr Hasturk been led before his Honour, it may well have caused him to accept the evidence of Mr Yuvarajah, rather than rejecting that evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">That in turn might have led his Honour to find that there was a collateral agreement of the type alleged by Computer World, rather than a trust, as his Honour ultimately found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Computer World also submits that, had his Honour been aware that Mr Hasturk was available to give evidence, but had not been called by ICE 2000, he may well have been prepared to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference against ICE 2000, rather than refusing to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">17 This submission, despite its apparent force, nonetheless faces several difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Even if it be assumed that Mr Hasturk's evidence may have led his Honour to accept Mr Yuvarajah's account of what had occurred, the legal consequences of accepting that evidence would still be problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">On one view of Mr Hasturk's evidence, the $50,000 was paid to be held for a special purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It would therefore fall within the principles developed by the House of Lords in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1968] UKHL 4 ; [1970] AC 567 at 580-82 per Lord Wilberforce, and in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12 ; [2002] 2 AC 164.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Under those principles, the $50,000 would be trust money, as his Honour in fact found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">18 More importantly, Mr Hasturk's evidence would have to overcome the difficult legal hurdle created by the High Court's judgment in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 at [32] - [36] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">In that case, the respondents alleged that the "operative agreement" was not contained in a written loan agreement, but was reached earlier, and was wholly oral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Yet it was not said that the written agreement should be rectified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Nor was it said that a defence of non est factum was available, or that the agreement was executed by mistake, or that its execution was procured by misrepresentation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">19 The High Court explained why the law does not permit reliance upon a collateral agreement of the type alleged in circumstances where a written agreement has been executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">First, this ensures that the legal rights and obligations of the parties turn upon what their words and conduct would reasonably be understood to convey, and not upon actual beliefs or intentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Secondly, in the nature of things, oral agreements will often be disputable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Resolving such disputes can be difficult, time consuming, expensive and problematic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">As a consequence, where parties enter into a written agreement, courts will generally hold them to the obligations which they have assumed by that agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The obligations of written agreements between parties cannot simply be ignored or brushed aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 The High Court went on to state some general principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It noted that some contracts are alleged to have been partly oral, and partly written.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">In such cases, evidence as to the oral terms can be given, but not if those terms contradict the terms of the written agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">21 Turning back to the present case, it is far from clear just how Computer World put its case at first instance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">On one view, it submitted that the credit facility was nothing more than an acknowledgement of a loan, akin to a receipt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">Unfortunately for Computer World, the credit facility simply does not read that way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">Indeed, Mr Hasturk regarded it as a contract, albeit "a formality".</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Nor does the credit facility read as though it contains the terms of a contract that is intended to be partly written and partly oral.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Even if it did, the supposed oral agreement between Mr Yuvarajah and Mr Hasturk would directly contradict the written term in paragraph one of the document that the security amount be deposited on trust for ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">I am unable to accept Computer World's submission that, in some way, it impliedly sought rectification of the written agreement before McInnis FM.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Mr Yuvarajah's reference to a "mistake" does not, in context, suggest that any such application was being made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">In accordance with the principles so clearly enunciated in Equuscorp (and also stated in earlier cases such as Hoyts v Spencer [1919] HCA 64 ; (1919) 27 CLR 133 and BP Refinery v Hastings [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266), contradiction of a written term, absent rectification, cannot be permitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">22 It follows that Computer World would not have been assisted had Mr Hasturk's evidence regarding the collateral agreement been led before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Mr Yuvarajah's credibility might have been enhanced, but the legal consequences of accepting his evidence would not have altered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">It therefore follows that the application to rely upon further evidence in this appeal should be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">23 Computer World also relies on several substantive grounds of appeal which do not involve the reception of further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Its notice of appeal contains ten grounds, but a number of them were abandoned during the course of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">24 Ground three contends that his Honour erred in failing to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference in relation to the non-appearance of Mr Hasturk, and also of Ms Serif Memis, who was another employee of ICE 2000 at the relevant time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">For the reasons set out above in relation to the further evidence ground, a Jones v Dunkel inference in relation to Mr Hasturk could not have assisted Computer World.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Such an inference would not overcome the legal impediment to its claim created by the High Court's decision in Equuscorp .</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">25 In relation to Ms Memis, it would appear that she played some role in the preparation of the accounts by which the various exhibits to ICE 2000's affidavits were created.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">However, Ms Gardner had the central role in relation to the various accounting issues that were raised, and there is nothing to suggest that Ms Memis' part in what took place was of such significance as to warrant a finding of appealable error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">26 As part of ground three, Computer World claims that his Honour erred in drawing a Jones v Dunkel inference against it in relation to a particular witness who prepared the spreadsheets exhibited to Mr Yuvarajah's affidavits, but was not called ("Pinky").</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">However, "Pinky" seems to have played a more central role in preparing the accounting documents that were tendered on Computer World's behalf.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It was open to his Honour to distinguish between "Pinky" and Ms Memis in that regard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">27 Ground six complains that his Honour misconstrued the nature of the evidence by equating "stock transfers" with "invoices" when these are in fact different concepts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">His Honour dealt with this issue at [24] of his reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">Regardless of whether stock was transferred from Computer World to ICE 2000 for on-sale to customers, or for display purposes, the transaction and transfer of stock was evidenced by Computer World's "stock transfer" documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">These stock transfers were at times referred to as "invoices", which is effectively what they were, but the debate is somewhat sterile, and merely involves semantics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">There is nothing to suggest any error of the kind alleged in his Honour's reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">28 Ground seven complains that his Honour misunderstood the nature of the evidence in that ICE 2000 was the only party in a position to generate invoices and associated documentation, and not Computer World.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Once again, there is nothing in this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">His Honour was plainly aware of the distinction between Computer World's "stock transfer" documents, and the tax invoices generated by ICE 2000 for sales to customers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">29 Ground eight asserts that his Honour erred in finding for ICE 2000 on its claim pursuant to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">In particular, it alleges that even assuming that Computer World engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by representing that the security amount would be kept in a separate trust account in favour of ICE 2000, there was no evidence that ICE 2000 relied upon any such representation when Mr Hasturk handed over the cheque for $50,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">30 There is some substance in this ground.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Without Mr Hasturk's evidence, his Honour must have inferred reliance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">There was little, if any, evidence upon which such an inference could be based.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Mr Hasturk's evidence, if it were to be received, would tend to negate reliance because as he put it, he regarded the credit facility as nothing more than a formality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">31 The difficulty confronting Computer World in relation to ground eight is that it leads nowhere.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">His Honour found in favour of ICE 2000 primarily on the basis of breach of trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">No issue of reliance arises in relation to that cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Any findings that he made in relation to the alternative claim under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act were dicta, as his Honour specifically noted at [88] of his reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The relief to which ICE 2000 was entitled in relation to its claim for breach of trust was exactly the same as the damages that might have been awarded under s 52.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">It follows that, irrespective of whether his Honour fell into error on this point, no appealable error is demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">32 Ground nine complains that his Honour erred in finding contrary to the evidence that Ms Gardner was at all material times the managing director of ICE 2000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Ms Gardner was the managing director from at least 1 April 2002, and possibly earlier, through to February 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">By the time of the trial, she was a consultant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">If his Honour erred in the manner alleged in this ground, it was an error of a minor kind.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">It did not infect his overall reasons for judgment with appealable error, and did not lead to an incorrect result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">33 Finally, ground ten complains that his Honour acted upon hearsay, particularly hearsay derived from the various affidavits of Ms Gardner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">No objection was taken to those affidavits at the time that they were read.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">Subsequently, during cross-examination of Ms Gardner, counsel for Computer World purported to object to her affidavit evidence except for her analysis of business records which was conceded to be appropriate and unobjectionable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The hearsay objection was never properly particularised, and the matter was never thereafter pursued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">This ground cannot succeed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">34 It follows that the application for leave to rely upon further evidence will be refused, and the appeal itself dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The appellant must pay the respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg
