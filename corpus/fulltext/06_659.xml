<sentence id="s0">
 
1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the AAT") given on 5 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">By that decision, the AAT affirmed a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ("the SSAT") given on 18 April 2005, in which the SSAT set aside a decision by the applicant cancelling the respondent's newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The "appeal" to this Court is in fact an exercise of the Court's original jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The respondent indicated at a directions hearing that he did not wish to participate in this proceeding, and no longer had any interest in the matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Accordingly, I have heard argument only from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">BACKGROUND 
 
3 The background facts can be briefly summarised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The respondent completed a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree at Deakin University in July 2004, and thereafter unsuccessfully sought employment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He was in receipt of newstart allowance from that time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He was advised by his university lecturers that his prospects of finding a job would be significantly enhanced if he were to undertake an honours year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He enrolled for that extra qualification in February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 On 11 February 2005, a decision was taken by a Centrelink officer, acting as a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services (which, at that time, had responsibility for newstart), to cancel the respondent's newstart allowance on the basis that he was no longer eligible for that benefit as he was undertaking full-time study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">On 22 February 2005, that decision was affirmed by an authorised review officer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 24 March 2005, the respondent lodged an appeal with the SSAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As already indicated, he was successful in that appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He was also successful before the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It was that decision that prompted the appeal to this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">5 It should be noted that no newstart payments were made to the respondent after 11 February 2005, when the benefit was cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Accordingly, there is no issue as to recovery of any alleged overpayment in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
6 Section 593 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ("the SSA") sets out the basic qualifications for the payment of a newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Section 593(1)(b) provides that one such qualification is satisfaction of what is described as "the activity test".</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 Section 601(1) provides that a person satisfies "the activity test" in respect of a particular period if that person satisfies the Secretary that, throughout the period, the person is actively seeking and willing to undertake paid work in Australia, other than paid work that is unsuitable to be undertaken by the person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 Section 601(2) provides that a person also satisfies the activity test in respect of a period if the Secretary is of the opinion that, throughout the period, the person should, inter alia, undertake a course of vocational training or participate in another course approved by the Employment Secretary which is likely to improve the person's prospects of obtaining suitable paid work, or assist the person in seeking suitable paid work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">9 Section 606 provides that a Newstart Activity Agreement (which is relevantly defined in s 604(1C)) shall contain certain terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The person with whom such an agreement is entered is required to undertake one or more of a series of activities approved by the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">10 Section 613 deals with the conditions of eligibility of full-time students for a newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The section is pivotal to this proceeding, and provides as follows:
 
 "(1) Subject to subsection (2), a newstart allowance is not payable to a person who is enrolled in a full-time course of education or of vocational training for the period that: 
 
 (a) starts when the person starts the course; and 
 (b) finishes when the person: 
 
 (i) completes the course; or 
 (ii) abandons the course; or 
 
 (iii) gives notice to the provider of the course that the person: 
 
 
 (A) wishes to withdraw from the course; or 
 
 (B) wishes to withdraw from such number of subjects that the person's course will no longer be a full-time course; and 
 
 (c) includes periods of vacation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a newstart allowance from being payable for any period during which: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a person is enrolled in a course that the Secretary has required the person to undertake under subsection 601(2); or 
 (b) the person is engaged in a course undertaken under a Newstart Activity Agreement; or 
 (c) the person has deferred a course of education.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 
 
 
 
 

11 In substance, therefore, s 613(1) provides that a newstart allowance is not payable to anyone who is enrolled in a full-time course of study unless one or more of the exceptions contained within s 613(2) is made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Relevantly, these are s 613(2)(a) (that the person is enrolled in a course that the Secretary has required the person to undertake under s 601(2)) , or s 613(2)(b) (that the person is engaged in a course undertaken under a "Newstart Activity Agreement").</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 
12 The notice of appeal identifies three questions of law as being raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, only the first two were ultimately pressed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In substance, they are as follows:
 
 
 (a) whether the AAT erred in failing to apply s 613 of the SSA, which precludes payment of a newstart allowance to a person enrolled in a full-time course of education or vocational training unless one or more of the circumstances set out in s 613(2) are met, and which were not met in the present case;
 (b) whether the AAT erred by having regard to and relying upon s 606(5) of the SSA (the power to vary a Newstart Activity Agreement) in support of its conclusion that the applicant ought to have negotiated such an agreement with the respondent, incorporating provision for an honours year of study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">
 
 THE APPLICANT'S CONTENTIONS 
 
13 Put simply, the applicant submits that both the SSAT and the AAT erred in law in finding that newstart allowance was payable to the respondent, as a full-time student, in circumstances where the conditions specified under s 613(2) were not met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">14 The applicant submits that, with regard to s 613(2)(a) , the respondent was not enrolled in a course that the Secretary had required him to undertake under s 601(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">As for s 613(2)(b) , the applicant submits that the respondent was not engaged in a course undertaken under a Newstart Activity Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">As neither condition was met, and s 613(2)(c) had no application, s 613(1) rendered the respondent ineligible for newstart allowance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">15 The applicant further submitted that the fact that both the SSAT and the AAT apparently considered the honours year to be a useful exercise, and one which was likely to improve the respondent's prospects of gainful employment, was simply irrelevant as a matter of law, so far as his eligibility for newstart allowance was concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">16 To be fair to the applicant, the argument was put with considerably greater sophistication than this at the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Dealing firstly with the SSAT, which focussed predominantly upon s 613(2)(a) , it was submitted that there had been a failure on its part to address the question specifically before it, namely whether the cancellation decision should be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Rather, the SSAT had reasoned simply that the honours year would improve the respondent's prospects of obtaining suitable paid work, and that this justified treating the conditions under s 601(2) as though they were satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">17 However, s 601(2) is actually more complex than this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The section relevantly provides:
 
 "(a) the Secretary is of the opinion that, throughout the period, the person: 
 ... 
 (ii) should: 
 (A) undertake a course of vocational training; or 
 ... 
 (C) participate in another course; 
 approved by the Employment Secretary which is likely to: 
 
 
 
 (D) improve the person's prospects of obtaining suitable paid work; or 
 (E) assist the person in seeking suitable paid work; ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the Secretary notifies the person that the person is required to act in accordance with the opinion; and 
 
 (c) the person takes reasonable steps to comply , throughout the period, with the Secretary's requirement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">" (emphasis added)
 

18 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it was not sufficient for the SSAT to have concluded that the Secretary ought to have formed the opinion in s 601(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">That was to ignore the requirement of s 601(2)(b) concerning notification, and s 601(2)(c) concerning compliance, neither of which had been met in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">That being so, it was clear that the respondent had not enrolled in a course that the Secretary had required him to undertake under s 601(2) , within the meaning of s 613(2)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Accordingly, that exception to s 613(1) could not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">19 It was submitted that, when it came to the AAT's decision, the reasoning was, in a sense, even simpler.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The AAT noted that s 606(5) provided for an activity agreement to be varied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Such an agreement did exist between the respondent and Centrelink prior to the cancellation of the respondent's newstart allowance in February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In the AAT's view, the agreement should have been varied, and the honours course accepted as one that would satisfy the requirements set out in s 601(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">Alternatively, the course should have been regarded as one in which he was engaged, and which he would have undertaken under a Newstart Activity Agreement (had one been entered into), pursuant to s 613(2)(b).</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">20 As a further alternative, the AAT said that the honours course could have been regarded as "another activity that the Secretary regards as suitable for the person and that is agreed to between the person and the Secretary".</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Plainly, the AAT had in mind s 606(1)(g) in invoking this formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">21 Paraphrasing the AAT's reasons for decision, the honours year of study in which the respondent had enrolled was regarded as a valuable activity, and one which should have been included in a Newstart Activity Agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">In the AAT's words:
 
 "It was not, but through no fault of Mr Kelly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Centrelink cannot in the circumstances be permitted to succeed in this review by pointing to the absence of such an agreement or the absence of the Secretary having decided, by way of requirement, that Mr Kelly undertake such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">" 
 

22 This passage suggests that the AAT was influenced by some notion of estoppel on the part of the applicant, based upon its disapproval of Centrelink's failure to form the requisite opinion, and act upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">If so, there is no justification for that approach: Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 92 ALR 93 per Gummow J, and Attorney General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 18 per Mason CJ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">See generally M Aronson, B Dyer and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (3 rd ed, 2004) at 359-64.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">It may be noted that there is no suggestion in the present case of any abuse of power, or breach of promise, on the part of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">23 In the AAT's view, therefore, a Newstart Activity Agreement should have been created, or the previous agreement varied, to incorporate the honours year by way of a requirement on the part of the Secretary, and an undertaking on the part of the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Additionally, or in the alternative, the Secretary should have regarded the honours year as "suitable" as an "activity" and which should have been included in a Newstart Activity Agreement pursuant to s 606(1)(g).</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">CONCLUSION 
 
24 Plainly, it would have been open to the Secretary to have formed the opinion that the respondent should undertake the course contemplated on the basis that it would improve his prospects of obtaining suitable paid work.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The difficulty, so far as the respondent is concerned, is that the Secretary did not do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">25 Even if the Secretary had formed the requisite opinion, there was no notification of that opinion to the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">Nor was there any compliance with any such notification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">26 In addition, the Secretary did not enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement with the respondent regarding the honours course, and did not vary an existing agreement to include a term whereby the respondent agreed to undertake such a course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">27 None of the conditions required in order to avoid the operation of s 613(1) were met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It is simply that, in their different ways, the SSAT and the AAT both considered that the Secretary ought to have formed the opinion referred to in s 601(2) , or ought to have entered into a Newstart Activity Agreement with the respondent, allowing for the honours course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">28 In my view, neither the SSAT, nor the AAT, was entitled to conclude that the conditions under s 613(2) had been met in circumstances where manifestly they had not.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">The fact that these bodies considered the honours course to be worthwhile, and one that ought to have been the subject of approval under s 601(2) , or the subject of a Newstart Activity Agreement under s 606 , cannot overcome this fundamental hurdle.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">29 I would add that it is also difficult to see how something that manifestly did not occur can be deemed by a tribunal, with retrospective effect, to have occurred, at least in the context of statutory criteria that are strict, and clearly stated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The fact that there were several options available to the Secretary when dealing with the respondent's continuing right to claim a newstart allowance, does not mean that either the SSAT, or the AAT, was itself entitled to choose one or more of those options, and proceed upon the basis that it had been exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">A statute that sets out strict conditions for eligibility for a particular benefit is not amenable to a construction that treats that which ought to have been done as though it had been done.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">30 The second question of law raised in this proceeding does no more than restate the first question, albeit in a slightly different form.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">Both questions should be answered in favour of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">31 Accordingly, the "appeal" should be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">The decision of the AAT must be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In lieu thereof, it is ordered that the decision of the SSAT be set aside, and the applicant's decision to cancel the respondent's newstart allowance affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">The applicant, very properly, did not seek any order for costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.</sentence>
