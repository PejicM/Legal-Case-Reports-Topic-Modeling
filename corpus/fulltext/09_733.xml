<sentence id="s0">
 This is an application to set aside a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) affirming a decision of a delegate of the first respondent ( the Minister ) to cancel the applicant's visa ( Lafu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 107 ALD 678; [2009] AATA 218).</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant is a citizen of New Zealand.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The applicant held a visa permitting his entry to and presence in Australia from 19 May 2007 at which time the applicant was aged 37.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The applicant had a criminal record in New Zealand which had not resulted in any custodial sentence and which he did not declare on his visa application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In October 2008 the applicant was convicted of an assault occasioning grievous bodily harm relating to an incident in Queensland in August 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The applicant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Section 501(2)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) enables the Minister to cancel a visa if a visa holder does not pass the "character test".</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The "character test" is explained in s 501(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">A visa holder's criminal record is a central consideration with respect to the character test as set out in s 501(6).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">By reason of his conviction and sentence in Queensland, the applicant did not pass the character test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Minister's power to cancel his visa was thereby enlivened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Minister cancelled the applicant's visa on 24 December 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The applicant appealed to the Tribunal against the cancellation, but the Tribunal affirmed the Minister's decision on 2 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The effect of certain statutory provisions is that the applicant may obtain an order setting aside the Tribunal's decision only if the applicant establishes that the decision is vitiated by reason of jurisdictional error (ss 476A(1)(b) and (2) and 483 of the Migration Act , as explained in Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 171 FCR 345 ; [2008] FCAFC 160 at [4] ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The applicant alleged that the Tribunal "constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction by applying the wrong test and/or failing to consider a mandatory relevant consideration".</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The "mandatory relevant consideration" on which the applicant relied is "general deterrence".</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">A Ministerial direction, Direction No 21 --- Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section 501 ( Direction 21 ), requires that issue to be considered when deciding whether to cancel a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant contended that the Tribunal's consideration of general deterrence miscarried; although the Tribunal considered relevant principles, it disregarded or failed to apply those principles to the particular facts of the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The applicant claimed that this constituted a failure to consider the mandatory matter in accordance with law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">A failure to consider a relevant matter, if established, is a jurisdictional error ( Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 171).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The Minister contended that the Tribunal's decision disclosed that it discharged its statutory function in accordance with the terms of Direction 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In order to understand and resolve the competing submissions it is necessary to identify the terms of Direction 21 and the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Direction 21 is a written direction issued by the Minister under s 499(1) of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That section enables the Minister to give a direction to a person or body having functions or powers under the Migration Act about the performance of those functions or the exercise of those powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Section 499(2A) provides that a person or body having such functions or powers must comply with a direction given under s 499(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In deciding whether to affirm, vary or set aside a decision to cancel a visa, the Tribunal is a body having such powers and functions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Direction 21 is therefore binding on the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Direction 21 is in two parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Part 1 concerns the application of the character test and thus is not material to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Part 2 concerns the exercise of the discretion if a visa holder does not pass the character test and thus is material to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The relevant provisions in Pt 2 are as follows: 
 PART 2 --- EXERCISING THE DISCRETION 

 
 2.1 If a non-citizen does not pass the Character Test , decision-makers must have regard to the following considerations when exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">

 
 Weight of considerations 

 
 2.2 The Government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">In making such a decision, a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.3-2.16 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.17-2.24.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Decision-makers must have due regard to the importance placed by the Government on the three primary considerations, but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">

 
 PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS 

 
 2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations:
 (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community;
 (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and
 (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">

 
 2.4 The Government seeks to take reasonable steps to protect the Australian community from the actions of criminals and to take action to lessen the risk of crime and disorder within the Australian community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">The Government is especially mindful to take reasonable steps to protect the safety of the more vulnerable members of the community, such as children and young people who are especially at risk.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">This is of particular importance when the offences in question are in relation to drugs and crimes of violence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">

 
 2.5 The factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the entry or continued stay of a non-citizen include:
 (a) the seriousness and nature of the conduct;
 (b) the likelihood that the conduct may be repeated (including any risk of recidivism); and
 (c) whether visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct ( general deterrence ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">

 The seriousness and nature of the conduct 
 
 2.6 It is the Government's view that the following are examples of offences which are considered by the Government to be very serious:
 ...
 ...
 (f) murder, manslaughter, assault or any other form of violence against persons;
 ...
 ... 

 general deterrence --- the likelihood that visa refusal or visa cancellation would prevent (or inhibit the commission of) like offences by other persons 
 
 2.11 General deterrence aims to deter other people from committing the same or a similar offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">While not a conclusive factor in itself, general deterrence is an important factor in determining whether to refuse or cancel a visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The general deterrence factor may be relevant in a number of ways:
 (a) the nature of the offence may be such that visa refusal or cancellation may deter others from committing similar offences; and
 (b) the visa refusal or cancellation in respect of a non-citizen who has been involved in a criminal scheme or schemes may discourage or prevent another person or persons from engaging in similar schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">

 The applicant and the Minister agreed that, by reason of s 499 of the Migration Act and the terms of Direction 21, the Tribunal was required to consider "the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community" (paragraph 2.3(a) of Direction 21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In so doing the Tribunal, amongst other things, was required to assess "the level of risk to the community of the ...continued stay of [the applicant]..." including by reference to the factor "whether visa ...cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct ( general deterrence )" (paragraph 2.5(c) of Direction 21).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The applicant and the Minister also agreed that paragraph 2.11 of Direction 21 explained the concept of general deterrence as it was required to be considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">The applicant did not challenge the way in which the Tribunal framed the relevant issues for determination in [9] of its reasons as follows:
 
 (i) whether the applicant passes the character test in s 501(6)(a) of the Act, given his substantial criminal record as defined in s 501(7) of the Act; and if not,
 (ii) whether the tribunal should exercise its discretion to set aside or affirm the decision made by the delegate of [the Minister] to cancel the applicant's visa, applying [Direction 21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">

 Nor did the applicant challenge the Tribunal's finding that the applicant did not pass the character test (at [99]) with the consequence that the Tribunal was required, as it stated, to consider whether to cancel the applicant's visa and, in so doing, to have regard to Pt 2 of Direction 21 (at [100]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The applicant also accepted that the Tribunal correctly identified for itself the primary relevant considerations specified in paragraph 2.3 of Direction 21 and that the Tribunal was required to consider, amongst other things, general deterrence by reference to paragraph 2.11 of that Direction (at [101]-[103]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The applicant's challenge was founded on four paragraphs of the Tribunal's decision dealing with general deterrence as follows: 
 [ 124 ] In relation to the protection of the Australian community, [the Tribunal] is also required to consider the question of general deterrence, the likelihood that visa refusal would prevent or inhibit the commission of similar offences by other persons: Direction No 21 para 2.11.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The deterrent effect of a particular decision is impossible to prove in advance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The concept can perhaps also be expressed in positive form by saying that if bad behaviour is rewarded, there will be more of it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">That is a principle well known to parents, teachers, managers and most other members of the community.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">

 
 [ 125 ] Its incorporation in Direction No 21 may be simply a reflection of the need for decision-makers to consider the long-term effects of their decisions, not merely the short-term results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">While visa cancellation is not intended as a punishment, para 2.11 of the direction plainly contemplates that the prospect of it will operate to deter similar conduct in much the same way as the threat of punishment does.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">

 
 [ 126 ] As Callinan J observed in Al-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37 ; (2004) 219 CLR 562 at 659, "Deterrence may be an end in itself unrelated to a criminal sanction or a punishment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Deterrence can, for example, be an end of the law of tort".</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">

 
 [ 127 ] While general deterrence cannot be a decisive, or even a substantial, factor in the exercise of the discretion, it is a factor that must be taken into account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">

 The applicant submitted that these paragraphs disclosed that the Tribunal had done no more than recite the abstract formula from the relevant paragraphs of Direction 21 about general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The paragraphs, however, gave no indication that the Tribunal had applied its mind to the facts of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Direction 21, as evident from its terms, is to be applied to the circumstances of the particular applicant and visa decision in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Yet the Tribunal in this case, submitted the applicant, had simply "cut and paste" the statements of principle from Direction 21 without applying them to the applicant's individual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">According to the applicant, neither the applicant nor anyone else could possibly know what, if anything, the Tribunal had made of the issue of general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">General deterrence was a mandatory relevant consideration but the Tribunal's reasons gave no clue as to what weight it had been given or what part it played in the decision-making process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The Minister and the applicant had made a real issue about the general deterrence factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">In written submissions to the Tribunal the Minister had contended that general deterrence was a factor entitled to "significant weight".</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">The applicant had submitted that visa cancellation would have no general deterrence value given the lack of both publicity about the matter and any gang involvement (at [92]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The applicant thus submitted that the Tribunal's "abstract recitation of principle" in [124]-[127] of its reasons was insufficient to constitute consideration as required by law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The applicant also noted that this insufficient treatment could be contrasted with the reasons for decision of the Tribunal constituted by the same member in another decision ( Filipo v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] AATA 1144).</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">In that case, at [83]-[86], the Tribunal had used precisely the same formula of words but with the addition of a factor relevant to the individual applicant (at [86]) in the observation that the case (unlike the present) involved serious gang violence and thus the deterrent factor was particularly important.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">No equivalent observation, specific to the individual applicant, was apparent from the Tribunal's reasons in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">For these reasons the applicant submitted that the Tribunal, by failing to consider the mandatory relevant matter of general deterrence as required by Direction 21, had constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It had not engaged in an "active intellectual process" ( Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462) with respect to the nominated subject-matter as it had not applied its mind to the facts of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">The Minister acknowledged that the Tribunal was required to consider the factor of general deterrence in the context of the applicant's individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">According to the Minister, a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole supported the inference that the Tribunal had done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It may be accepted that the observations in [124]-[127] of the Tribunal's reasons, read in isolation, are capable of giving rise to a suspicion of "abstract recitation of principle" irrespective of the facts of the individual case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">But those paragraphs of the Tribunal's reasons cannot be read in isolation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Nor can a court exercising powers of judicial review act on mere suspicion as opposed to rational inference from the whole of the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The High Court has identified that "reasons of an administrative decision-maker are meant to inform and [are] not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed" ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272).</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Once the Tribunal's reasons are read fairly as a whole, I am satisfied that the applicant's case does not rise above a mere suspicion of error by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">As the Minister observed, before the impugned paragraphs appear in its reasons, the Tribunal correctly identified the questions it had to answer (at [9]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">It correctly identified the operation of Direction 21 (at [12]-[13]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It correctly identified the considerations made relevant by Direction 21, including general deterrence (at [98]-[103]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It also accurately recorded the applicant's evidence and submissions about general deterrence (at [19] and [92]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">In other words, the issue of general deterrence was evidently in the Tribunal's mind throughout its assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">It must also be recognised that matters relevant to other factors identified in Direction 21 are also potentially relevant to general deterrence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">For example, general deterrence involves consideration of the consequences for "similar conduct".</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Accordingly, the nature of the conduct in question is relevant to general deterrence but is also relevant to other nominated factors including the "seriousness and nature of the conduct" (paragraph 2.5(a)) and the expectations of the Australian community (paragraphs 2.3(b) and 2.12).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Tribunal made findings about the nature of the applicant's conduct, describing it as "gratuitous violence" (at [43]), which had elements of "collective action" despite not being part of a gang crime (at [108]), warranting the conclusion that the applicant had a "very serious" criminal record in Australia and as a consequence of which one Australian had already been caused to suffer "permanent disability" (at [123]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal's observations on general deterrence must be read in light of these preceding findings of fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">In that context the Tribunal assessed general deterrence to be neither a decisive nor even a substantial factor, but a relevant factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons indicates that this assessment must be understood as the Tribunal's conclusion on the facts of the individual case and not in the mere abstract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">This inference is also supported by the Tribunal's subsequent assessment of the expectations of the Australian community about a "person with a serious criminal record, who is assessed at being some risk of re-offending and who shows little evidence of stable and lasting rehabilitation" (at [133]) and the neutrality of the factor of the best interests of any children (at [139]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">When recording its overall conclusion at [146], the Tribunal said: 
 In my view the best interests of the child are a neutral factor in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">The primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The decision under review is affirmed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">

 Accordingly, when read as a whole the Tribunal's reasons indicate that the Tribunal concluded that the seriousness and nature of the applicant's conduct, combined with his risk of re-offending, meant that the two primary considerations in paragraphs 2.3(a) and (b) of Direction 21 (protection of the Australian community and the expectation of the Australian community) warranted the cancellation of the applicant's visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The Tribunal, in so concluding, accepted that general deterrence (paragraph 2.5(c)) was relevant to the first of these primary factors (protection of the Australian community) but concluded that it was not a decisive or even a substantial factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">Rather, the decisive or substantial factors in respect of this primary consideration were those specified in paragraphs 2.5(a) and (b) (respectively, the seriousness and nature of the conduct and the likelihood of the applicant re-offending).</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">No error is disclosed by this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">An observation of the Full Court of the Federal Court is also apt in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">In Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 ; [2003] FCAFC 184 at [47] French, Sackville and Hely JJ said: 
 The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">

 In the present case the Tribunal identified the issue of general deterrence as relevant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">It identified the submissions made for the applicant to the effect that the issue should be given little weight.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">Having considered both the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offence and the difficulty of being sure of the deterrent effect of any particular decision, the Tribunal made findings about the relevance of that issue (that is, the issue was relevant, but not decisive nor even entitled to substantial weight).</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The issue, if resolved one way, could not be dispositive; as the Tribunal said, Direction 21 recognised that the issue of general deterrence was "not a conclusive factor in itself".</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">In all of these circumstances the fact that the Tribunal did not expressly refer again to the applicant's circumstances in [124]-[127] of its reasons is insufficient to found the necessary inference of a failure of consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Given this conclusion it is unnecessary for me to consider the Minister's alternative submission of lack of utility other than to observe that, in discussion, the Minister's counsel (correctly, in my view) acknowledged the difficulty of making good this alternative submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The applicant has not established any jurisdictional error by the Tribunal and the application therefore must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
