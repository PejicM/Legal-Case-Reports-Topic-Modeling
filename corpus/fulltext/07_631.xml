<sentence id="s0">
 
1 United Medical Protection Limited (United) and The Medical Defence Association of Victoria Limited (MDAV), each a company limited by guarantee whose members for the most part are medical practitioners, were established as medical defence organisations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">They provide members with indemnity for claims arising from the members' medical practices.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Through subsidiaries, (Australasian Medical Insurance Limited (AMIL) and Professional Indemnity Insurance Company Australia Pty Ltd (PIICA) respectively), they have since 2003 provided indemnity to their members under contracts of insurance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It is now proposed that United and MDAV amalgamate (the word they use is "merge") their respective operations through schemes of arrangement under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and a scheme under the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">This application is concerned only with the Corporations Act schemes and is for an order for the convening of meetings of the members of United and MDAV to consider the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The nature of the schemes can briefly be described.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A new company is to be incorporated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Under the Corporations Act schemes the current members of United and MDAV will become members of the new company and United and MDAV will become its subsidiaries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">This common enough arrangement would be straightforward in the case of companies limited by shares.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The new company would acquire the shares of the existing companies from their shareholders who, in exchange, would receive shares in the new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">With companies limited by guarantee what is required is a little more complicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Special provision must be made in the constitution of the new company for the existing United and MDAV members to become its members and alterations are required to the constitutions of United and MDAV for them to become subsidiaries of the new company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">These matters will be attended to outside the schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The next step is for the undertaking and property, but not the liabilities, of MDAV to be transferred to United.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">A fund will be established sufficient to meet the claims of MDAV's trade creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The scheme proposed under the Insurance Act will result in the transfer of the insurance portfolio of PIICA to AMIL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">3 The Corporations Act schemes in fact consist of two arrangements, one between each company and its own members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It used to be the practice to require separate applications or petitions to be filed, one for each company, which would then be heard together as a matter of course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This undesirable practice, which apart from adding unnecessarily to the costs ran the risk of an appeal from one order only, has happily fallen by the wayside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">If each company wishes to be separately represented, as is the situation here, that can be accommodated as the requirement that there be one legal representative on the plaintiff's side is simply a rule of practice that can give way to the demands of fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">4 When the application was first mentioned several weeks ago, I raised with counsel a number of matters of concern.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">One was with the terms of the draft scheme of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Another was the contents of the explanatory statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It is not necessary to go into the detail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is sufficient to record that these matters have been attended to in a way which, I think, is satisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 A third concern was whether it was necessary to convene a meeting of the creditors of MDAV.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The scheme of arrangement provided for the discharge of the debts due by MDAV, with United being substituted as the debtor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I queried whether this involved a scheme between MDAV and its creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The point no longer arises as it is no longer proposed to release MDAV from any existing liabilities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">While its assets are still to be transferred to United, that company will indemnify MDAV against all claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Moreover, at my suggestion, a fund will be established out of which the claims of MDAV's trade creditors will be satisfied as occurred in Re Sandwell Park Colliery Co Ltd [1914] 1 Ch 589.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 For the record, however, I should indicate that, on further reflection, I have come to the view that the original proposal did not involve a scheme between MDAV and its creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">That company only proposed a scheme between itself and its members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">If an order were in due course made approving the scheme, the order would only bind the members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It will, of course, be necessary at some stage to bind creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">For that purpose MDAV must apply for appropriate orders under s 413 of the Corporations Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">That is how the parties proceeded in In re Star Tea Co Ltd [1930] WN 4 and Re Clydesdale Bank Ltd [1950] SC 30, although the judgment in the latter case may be better understood on this point if reference is made to the summary of counsel's argument reported in the Scots Law Times ([1950] SLT 123).</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">7 The final point raised on the last occasion concerned classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Section 411 of the Corporations Act authorises the convening of meetings of members or classes of members to consider a proposed scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">If meetings of proper classes are not held the court will not sanction the scheme, so great care must be taken to ensure that the correct meetings are held.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8 For a long time the practice has been to leave it to the company to decide whether there should be meetings of classes of members or classes of creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">If meetings were wrongly convened that was dealt with at the hearing to approve the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In England there was a practice note to that effect: Practice Note [1934] WN 142.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In Victoria see Nordic Bank Plc v International Harvester Australia Ltd [1983] 2 VR 298, 303.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">9 The practice was strongly criticised by Chadwick LJ in Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 241 ; [2001] 2 BCLC 480.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">With respect, I agree with his criticism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In my view the judge hearing the application for meetings should at least consider the question of classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">In some cases, when notice can be given of what is proposed, any dispute could be resolved at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">If notice is impossible, and I accept that in many cases it may be either impossible or impracticable to give notice, the judge should still form a preliminary view on the issue notwithstanding that his or her view might change at the hearing of the application for approval.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">That is also what Chadwick LJ had in mind in Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd .</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">10 I raise the question of classes because of a concern that some members might be differently affected by the schemes, in particular some members but not others might be required to pay a higher premium for insurance if the schemes were adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">Having considered the matter further I am presently satisfied that I raised a false issue for reasons I will now explain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Of course nothing I say will bind any member who, in due course, wishes to pursue the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Moreover, ASIC, which had been given notice of the application, said it may argue this issue at the second hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">11 The leading case on classes is Sovereign Life Assurance Co v Dodd [1892] 2 QB 573.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">According to Bowen LJ (at 583) "the word 'class' is vague and to find out what is meant by it we must look at the scope of the section, which is a section enabling the Court to order a meeting of a class of creditors to be called.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">It seems plain that we must give such a meaning to the term 'class' as will prevent the section being so worked as to result in confiscation and injustice, and that it must be confined to those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">"
 
12 That does not mean that where members or creditors have different considerations which may influence them, they are properly to be treated as belonging to separate classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In In the Matter of Chevron (Sydney) Ltd [1963] VR 249 Adam J said at 255 that debenture stockholders were in the same class "despite the differing considerations which may influence them" in voting for the scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In Re Landmark Corporation Ltd (in liq) [1968] 1 NSWR 759 Street J followed Adam J's approach holding that subsidiary companies of the scheme company were correctly included in the general class of unsecured creditors, despite their obvious additional interests.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In the previous year Street J had said in Re Jax Marine Pty Ltd [1967] 1 NSWR 145, 148, a case in which one unsecured creditor, Smithson, owned all the shares in the scheme company and was by the terms of the scheme, committed to sustain it as guarantor of certain payments:
 
 "The existence of this motive or personal interest does not, in my view, preclude the Smithson group from membership of the class of ordinary unsecured creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">The test is not similar to that applied to a person in a fiduciary position who is suggested to have some conflicting interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The test is rather one of whether or not the persons who, prima facie, appear to constitute the class of unsecured creditors should be dissected into separate classes by reason of some particular matter so affecting the rights of some as to render it impossible for them to pursue their own interests concurrently with their participating in the pursuit of the interests of the class of which they appear to be members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">" 
 

13 It cannot be said of members who may, in their capacity as policyholders of a subsidiary company pay a higher premium after the amalgamation, that it is impossible for them to pursue their own interests concurrently with those of other members of the parent company whose premiums may not increase as a result of the amalgamation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">14 During submissions I raised another point on classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The membership of both United and MDAV is divided into categories, to use a neutral term.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Although the constitution of each is worded differently, the position is roughly the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">United has two categories of member, referred to as "ordinary members" and "affiliate members".</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">The principal difference between the two is that an ordinary member is required to guarantee the obligations of United (to a nominal amount), is liable to make calls for contributions of funds up to an amount equal to his annual fee and is able to speak and vote at all meetings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">An affiliate member, on the other hand, is not required to guarantee the obligations of United, is not liable to meet any calls for contribution of funds and has no right to vote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">On a winding up there is a measure of equality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Strictly speaking, the constitution of United does permit a distribution of the net assets of the winding up to ordinary members if the assets cannot be given to another institution which has the same or similar objects as United.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The chance of a distribution to members is, however, so slight that I propose to discount it for present purposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">As regards MDAV, there are three categories of member, medical practitioners, companies that employ medical practitioners and students enrolled in a faculty of medicine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">Medical practitioners have rights similar to those of ordinary members of United; companies and students are similar to affiliate members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">No member is entitled to receive a distribution upon the winding up of the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">15 The first question that obviously arises is whether the different categories of member constitute different classes for the purposes of s 411.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">No doubt the different characteristics may influence them to vote differently on the proposed schemes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">But, as the cases show, this does not put them into different categories.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Adopting the approach of Chadwick LJ in Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd the question to be answered is whether the rights of the members who are to be bound by the schemes are "so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest".</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">If the answer is in the affirmative then it will be necessary to have a separate meeting of each class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Tentatively, I am of the view that while there may be different categories of membership there is but one class.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">I bear in mind that any overzealous subdivision may give a small group a right of veto that would defeat the basic object of the provisions dealing with schemes of arrangement which is to enable large groups to achieve a compromise or effect an arrangement: Nordic Bank Plc v International Harvester Australia Ltd [1983] 2 VR 298, 301.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">16 I observe that, in keeping with the decision in Re NFU Development Trust Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 1548, it is proposed that at each scheme meeting each member is to be given one vote.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">The underlying assumption is that each member has, qua his or her membership, the same financial stake in the company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">In a general sense that assumption is true, particularly on a winding up.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">On the other hand, the assumption ignores the fact that ordinary members may be required to make contribution to the funds of their company, albeit to a small extent, and may also liable on their respective guarantees, again to a small extent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It is not clear whether this difference is sufficient to require a change in the "one member one vote" formula.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">I would not wish to form any concluded view in the absence of argument.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">For the purposes of the proposed meetings it is not unreasonable for me to indicate that if something other than a "one member one vote" formula were adopted, it could only be that ordinary members be given greater voting rights.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">17 ASIC drew attention to a problem concerning the financial information relating to the net assets of the new group that appears in the draft explanatory statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It noted, and it appears to be common ground, that the information is simply the aggregate of the assets and liabilities of the United group and the assets and liabilities of the MDAV group as at 31 December 2006, subject to some adjustments allowing for differences in accounting policies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The problem identified by ASIC is that the underlying actuarial assumptions, particularly those leading to the calculation of liabilities, are different in the case of each company.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Hence, simply adding the assets and liabilities may present a false picture.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">18 I think this is a valid criticism of the manner in which the figures are presented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">However, the problem is capable of being cured by the addition to the explanatory statement of a note explaining the problem and making some observation about its impact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">I have been shown a proposed new paragraph to be added to the explanatory statement and am satisfied that it fairly explains to the reader the true position.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">19 Finally I should note that during the course of the hearing this morning there were further changes made to the scheme documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">None were of any great moment but I should mention that there were changes to the conditions to be satisfied before the schemes, if approved, come into effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">The scope of several conditions was unclear and I suggested they be deleted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">Moreover, I wanted to be sure the conditions were of a kind that would be satisfied before the schemes came into operation on the lodgement with ASIC of a copy of the approving order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The schemes are now in a form which are I think appropriate to go to members.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">So also is the explanatory statement which I propose to approve.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">20 There will be orders substantially in accordance with the minutes submitted by the plaintiffs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice FinkelsteinJ.</sentence>
