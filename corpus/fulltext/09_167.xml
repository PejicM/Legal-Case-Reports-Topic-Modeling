<sentence id="s0">
 The appellant appeals from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent not to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The appellant is a citizen of India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He claimed to fear persecution by reason of his political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He said he was "an active social worker" in the Bharatiya Janata Party ("BJP").</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In particular, the appellant made the following claims: He received threats to kill from political opponents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">On 12 August 2003 he and his wife were attacked at a bus stop by a group of political opponents belonging to a Muslim party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant reported this incident to the police but did not receive protection from them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant was threatened with violence to withdraw his complaint to the police and did withdraw it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The appellant then moved house but was still threatened by his attackers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">He was attacked again after obtaining a visa to leave India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">THE TRIBUNAL 
 The Tribunal accepted that the bus stop incident of 12 August 2003 occurred as the appellant claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal considered that the attack and the other subsequent threats did not occur for the reason of the appellant's political opinion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal did not accept the appellant's evidence that he had received threats because of interest in politics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It noted that the appellant said in his evidence before the Tribunal that he did not receive any direct threats after he moved house in 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">THE COURT BELOW 
 In the Court below, the appellant advanced three grounds of appeal: The first ground is an unparticularised contention that there was an error of law and a jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The Federal Magistrate found that this ground was meaningless in the absence of particularisation and does not on its face establish a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">I also find no error in this approach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The second ground before the Court below had two parts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Firstly, that the Tribunal failed to follow proper procedure at the time of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Secondly, that prior to making its final decision the Tribunal failed to provide the appellant with an opportunity to respond to any adverse information, in accordance with s 424A(1) of theAct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">There is nothing in the material before the Court to establish that the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal complied with its statutory obligations, specifically its obligation to invite the appellant to a hearing and to meet its obligations under s 425 to put dispositive issues to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The invitation of 8 February 2008, sent to the appellant, to a hearing on 18 March 2008 contained the required information in relation to time, date and place of the hearing and advised the appellant of the options available to the Tribunal if he did not appear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The appellant attended the hearing and had the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The Tribunal's reasons for decision state that at the hearing it considered the documents the appellant submitted and informed the appellant of matters likely to prove determinative, specifically the possible absence of a Convention nexus to the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In addition, the Federal Magistrate correctly found that the Tribunal engaged in the requisite consideration of whether there was evidence that the appellant's mental state was such that he was not able to take advantage of the invitation under s 425 of the Act in light of the appellant's suggestion at the end of the hearing that he may commit suicide if he had to return to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Therefore, the first part of the second ground was not made out and the Federal Magistrate was correct to so determine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Federal Magistrate found that the alleged breach of s 424A lacked particulars to identify the relevant information the Tribunal was said to have failed to put to the appellant for comment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Federal Magistrate correctly found that the alleged breach of s 424A had no basis since no information before the Tribunal fell within that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Information provided by the appellant to the Tribunal and independent country information were exempted from the operation of s 424A by s 424A(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Therefore the Federal Magistrate correctly found that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to put its provisional reasoning to the appellant under s 424A of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The amended application added a third ground that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424AA(b)(iv) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The Federal Magistrate correctly found that this section does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Rather, s 424AA complements the Tribunal's obligations under s 424A by enabling the Tribunal, if it so chooses, to give to an applicant orally during the hearing any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The explanatory memorandum to the bill which introduced s 424AA explains that this section provides a new discretion for the Tribunal to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the Tribunal in response to an invitation issued under s 425.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">This discretion is meant to complement the Tribunal's existing obligation under s 424A in that if the Tribunal does not orally give information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under s 424AA, it must do so in writing under s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">However, if the Tribunal does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under s 424AA, it is not required to give the particulars under s 424A: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Moreover, the exclusions contained in s 424A(3) apply with equal force to s 424AA, therefore the Tribunal is not compelled to give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on during the hearing nor information that the applicant gave for the purposes of the application for review: see s 424A(3) and SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 104 ALD 589; [2008] FCA 1270 at [29] ---[30];.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Such an inference is supported by the collective use of the term 'information' in s 424A(2A) of the Act (which applies to both ss 424A and 424AA), as such use implies uniformity of meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Therefore, the Court considers that what is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1): SZLXI at [27].</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's account of what occurred during the hearing does not indicate that the Tribunal sought to rely on the procedure under s 424AA to put information that would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review to the appellant in the course of the hearing so as to give rise to the obligation under s 424AA(b)(v) to adjourn the review if the Tribunal considered that the appellant reasonably needed additional time to comment or respond to the information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I agree with this assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The particulars in the amended application indicate that the appellant contends he requested time to provide a translated copy of a newspaper and further documents, including documents relating to his role in the BJP, and that he was not given that opportunity and that this was a failure to comply with s 424AA(b)(iv).</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The Federal Magistrate was correct when he found that these are not circumstances in which the provisions of s 424AA come into play.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Section 424AA(b)(iv) operates where the Tribunal orally gives an appellant particulars of information it considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">The Tribunal did not rely on such information for the purposes of s 424 AA, which has the same meaning as information for purposes of s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Therefore there was no requirement to disclose orally to the appellant particulars of such information and therefore no requirement that the appellant be given an opportunity to respond.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Moreover, the Federal Magistrate was correct when stating that there was nothing in the material before the Court below to indicate that the appellant had sought additional time to provide a translation of the newspaper article or further documents which would have had to have been considered by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">It is for the appellant to make out his case before the Tribunal and the Tribunal does not have any duty to make further inquiries: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; NAYU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 528 at [18] ---[21].</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In addition, the Tribunal accepted the appellant's contention that he had been attacked at the bus stop in 2003 and that this had been reported in the newspaper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">However, the Tribunal did not accept, for reasons which it gave, that the attackers were motivated for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Federal Magistrate correctly found that the Tribunal's findings were open to it and thus no jurisdictional error can be established.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The appellant raised the question of procedural fairness in his written submissions but did not raise the matter as a ground of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">The procedural fairness point is said to arise by the Tribunal making factual findings contrary to the appellant's claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">No issue of procedural fairness arises from the failure to accept evidence raised by the appellant in the circumstances of this review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">The same applies to a claim made in the appellant's written submission that the Tribunal did not consider the appellant's argument that his life would be under threat.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The Tribunal considered that argument but did not accept it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">It found that he would not be persecuted, on account of his political opinion if returned to India.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The appellant has not raised any new grounds in this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In fact, the notice of appeal, in so far as it alleges any jurisdictional error in the Tribunal or appeallable error in the Court below, only alleges unstated legal errors attributable to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Federal Magistrate carefully considered the Tribunal's decision, and in my view correctly found that the Tribunal's decision did not involve a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Associate:
