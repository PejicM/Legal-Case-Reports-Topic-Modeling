1 This is an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and s 475A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') as it was before the amendment effected by the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (No 137 of 2005) for prerogative relief directed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The applicant for relief applied for a Protection (Class XA) Visa on 12 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">On 13 April 2005 a delegate of the Minister refused the application and on 14 April 2005 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The Tribunal conducted a review and on 5 October 2005 decided to affirm the decision not to grant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">3 The applicant submits that the Tribunal made three errors of law which went to its jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Before identifying the alleged errors and considering whether the applicant's submissions should be accepted, it is convenient to identify the applicant's claims before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">4 
 
The Tribunal commenced its consideration of the application for review by referring to the claims made by the applicant upon his unauthorised arrival at Sydney airport on 9 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant told the interviewing officer of his general circumstances and his movements on leaving Iran in January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He gave details of his family circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He said that he had a friend who was of the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 The Tribunal then examined the claims made by the applicant in his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The applicant said he was an Iranian citizen and a Shi'a Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">He said that he had military service obligations in Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">He said that he left Iran legally and that he had no difficulty in obtaining a passport with an exit permit valid until the Persian New Year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">He said that his friend of the Baha'i faith had left Iran and gone to America.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">He said that his association with that friend and his parents in Iran had brought him to the attention of authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The authorities thought the applicant had converted to the Baha'i faith and on one occasion they took him to the police station where he was questioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The applicant said that he was fearful because he had attended Baha'i 'sessions' and knew a lot about the faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">He said that he and his cousin had attended an anti-government protest in Shiraz in July 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">His cousin had been arrested and then imprisoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The applicant said if he returned to Iran he would be arrested for not having a passport.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">He would also be required to do military service which he did not want to do.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">He said that if the authorities believed that he had converted to the Baha'i faith he would be executed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 The Tribunal then examined the claims made by the applicant during an interview with the delegate of the Minister on 15 March 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">It is not necessary for me to set out all the details of what was said by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The applicant said that he was not a Baha'i.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">He said that he was a practising Muslim, but he did not pray or attend mosque.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">He gave details of the Baha'i sessions he attended and said that he made no commitment at the sessions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicant's main problem was that he was suspected of being of the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">7 The Tribunal then set out the information and evidence put before it at the review hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The applicant reiterated a number of the claims already outlined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He said that the authorities did not prevent him leaving Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">As far as his possible military service was concerned the applicant said that if the authorities knew he was associated with the Baha'i faith 'they would really hassle him in the military'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He gave further details of his association with his friend of the Baha'i faith and that friend's family and of his questioning by the authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The applicant described his involvement with the Baha'i faith and said that he intended to convert to that faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He said that he had not mentioned that intention earlier because he was frightened to divulge everything when he arrived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">The applicant said that the authorities in Iran already suspect him of having converted to the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">8 After the hearing, the Tribunal received a further submission from the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 On 24 August 2005 the Tribunal, mindful of the obligation in s 424 of the Act, wrote to the applicant in the following terms:
 
 'Dear [Applicant], 
 Your Application for Review 
 The Tribunal has information that would, subject to any comments you make, be the reason, or part of the reason, for deciding that you are not entitled to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 The information is that, (in contrast to the claim made at the hearing that you intend to convert to the Baha'i faith), at your arrival interview, your protection visa application and in your interview with the Delegate, you said your concern was that you had been and would be accused of converting, although you were not a Baha'i and were still a practising Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">You did not say at any stage prior to the hearing, that you wished or intended to convert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">
 This information is relevant because it casts doubt on the genuineness of your stated wish and intention to adopt the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 Although this matter was discussed at the hearing and addressed [in] your later submission, legislation requires the Tribunal to put it to you in a letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 You are therefore invited to comment on this information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">Your comments are to be in writing and in English.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">They are to be received at the Tribunal by Friday, 16 September 2005 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">
 Yours sincerely 
 
 (Signed) 
 for District Registrar' 
 

10 On 19 September 2005 the Tribunal received a submission from the applicant in response to this letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">With the submission the Tribunal received a photocopy of a letter from the applicant's mother and a certified translation thereof.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">This letter is important because the applicant submits that the Tribunal did not have proper regard to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The contents of the letter are adequately summarised by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The Tribunal's summary is as follows:
 
 'The letter states that in May or June 2005 two vehicles (one police, the other unmarked) came to the house and four people claiming to be police entered, searched and ransacked the house, interrogated the applicant's family as to his whereabouts, and took the applicant's father away.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">He was detained for two days and was released on bail (giving his house deed as security).</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">Three days later they came again and interrogated the family about [Applicant] and accused the applicant and his family of converting to Baha'i.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Even before these contacts security people were patrolling the house.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The home phone was bugged, and she did not want the applicant to call.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">[Applicant]'s father had also been detained and questioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">The letter concludes that the applicant has caused them headaches, and (although concerned at being far from him) urges him to "just leave us alone and forget about us", and is signed his loving mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">' 
 

11 The Tribunal then considered the country information available to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">A summary of its findings based on that information is as follows:
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">The ability to travel in and out of Iran through legal exit/entry points is a reliable indication that a person is of no particular adverse political or security interest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">Such a person would not warrant inclusion on a black list which is kept, or arrest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">A person who applied for political asylum abroad but who failed would not face serious harassment on his or her return to Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">There is a general obligation on young men in Iran to perform a period of military service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Those persons who practise the Baha'i faith in Iran are the subject of discriminatory treatment by reason of that fact.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">However, there is no evidence that those who are friends with a Baha'i family suffer discriminatory treatment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">

12 Before identifying the critical findings made by the Tribunal, it is convenient at this point to identify the applicant's submissions as to the jurisdictional errors he said were made by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">13 First, he submits that the Tribunal erred in not addressing his claim that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because the authorities in Iran would think that he was of the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In other words, the Tribunal did not address his claim that even though he was not of the Baha'i faith, he would be persecuted because the authorities would think that he was of that faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">Secondly, he submits that the Tribunal erred in not addressing his claim that he would be persecuted during the performance of his military service.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">Thirdly, he submits that the Tribunal erred in not having proper regard to the letter from his mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">14 As to the first submission, in my opinion, the Tribunal did address the applicant's claim that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because the authorities in Iran thought or might think that he was of the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">The Tribunal accepted that the applicant had a Baha'i friend and attended Baha'i gatherings in Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It accepted that Baha'i is a persecuted religious minority in Iran, and that a convert from Islam to the Baha'i faith would be at an even greater risk of persecution than someone born into a Baha'i family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">15 The Tribunal found that the applicant was not of adverse interest to the Iranian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">It did not accept that he was detained and questioned as he claimed or that the authorities harassed his family as he claimed, 'notwithstanding the letter from his mother'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The Tribunal was satisfied that had the applicant been under investigation as he claimed, he would have been blacklisted and he would not have been able to leave the country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">It said that the fact that he was able to do so was a reliable indication that he was not of interest to the Iranian authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It said that its finding that the applicant was not of interest to the Iranian authorities was reinforced by the absence of information indicating that Iranians had been targeted merely for being friends with a Baha'i family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Furthermore, it said that if the authorities were aware that the applicant was attending Baha'i meetings, the country information suggested that it was most improbable that this would not have been an 'explicit' subject of his interrogation, or that he would have been released without charge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In my opinion, these findings were open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The critical finding is that the applicant was not of interest to the Iranian authorities and that negated a conclusion that the authorities thought that he had converted to the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">16 The Tribunal went on to deal with the applicant's claim that he intended to convert to Baha'i.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">He gave evidence of such an intention, and it was appropriate for the Tribunal to consider that question in view of the evidence that those of the Baha'i faith are a persecuted religious minority in Iran.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The Tribunal said that it was not satisfied that the applicant intends to convert to the Baha'i faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">It noted that in his interview with the delegate, the applicant had said that he was not of the Baha'i faith and that he was still a Muslim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">At that point he had a clear opportunity to state that he believed in the Baha'i faith and wished to formally convert.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">The Tribunal said:
 
 'Yet his replies left the clear impression was [sic] that his concern was only about being a suspected convert, not about being a real convert who would not be able to freely practice his religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">' 
 

17 The Tribunal noted that the applicant had taken no steps at all to research the Baha'i community in Australia and the reason he had not done that if he intended to convert was not persuasively explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">18 The Tribunal said by way of conclusion that it did not accept that the applicant faced a real chance of serious harm in relation to 'his real or imputed religion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The findings made by the Tribunal were open to it and it did address the claim that he intended to convert and would be persecuted as a result, and the claim that he would be persecuted because the authorities in Iran considered that he had converted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">The applicant's first challenge to the Tribunal's decision must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 As to the second submission, this submission is related to the first.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The laws requiring military service applied to all and there is no evidence that if he failed to perform military service he would suffer a harsher penalty for a Convention reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">Insofar as the applicant was saying that he would suffer persecution during his period of military service because the authorities considered that he was of the Baha'i faith, that submission must fail for the reasons that the first submission fails.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 As to the third submission, the Tribunal set out in its reasons for decision a full description of the contents of the letter from the applicant's mother and that description is set out in [10] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">It made specific reference to it in the context of its finding that it was not prepared to accept that the authorities in Iran had harassed his family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">That harassment was said to have taken place because of the interest the Iranian authorities took in the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">The Tribunal was entitled to conclude for the reasons it gave that the applicant was not of adverse interest to the Iranian authorities and therefore to reject his story that he had been detained and questioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">It was entitled to reject the assertion that his family had been harassed and it is clear that it took into account the letter from the applicant's mother in deciding whether it should reach that conclusion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">The Tribunal had regard to the letter from the applicant's mother and did not err in the way alleged by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">The third submission must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">Conclusion 
 
21 The appeal must be dismissed and the applicant must pay the first respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko .</sentence>
