<sentence id="s4">That decision determined, largely unfavourably to Dalvella and Donemate, their challenge to the adequacy of particulars given by the Trustees of the Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Some of the arguments dealt with in that decision have been raised again in the present application although on this occasion in the context of whether the Amended Statement of Claim properly pleads a cause of action reliant upon the integers of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 By their application, the Trustees seek the following declarations and orders in reliance upon s 121 of the Act:

4 For the reasons indicated at [24] of Duus v Dalvella , since the date of bankruptcy of Mr Waters and Mrs Waters is 22 September 1999 and 28 September 1999 respectively, s 121 of the Act applies in the following terms:
 
 SECTION 121 TRANSFERS TO DEFEAT CREDITORS 
 
 121(1) Transfers that are void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if:
 
 
 
 
 (a) the property would probably have become part of the transferor's estate or would probably have been available to creditors if the property had not been transferred; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was: 
 
 
 (i) to prevent the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor's creditors; or 
 (ii) to hinder or delay the process of making property available for division among the transferor's creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">
 
 121(2) Showing the transferor's main purpose in making a transfer .</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The transferor's main purpose in making the transfer is taken to be the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b) if it can reasonably be inferred from all the circumstances that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">
 
 121(3) Other ways of showing the transferor's main purpose in making a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Subsection (2) does not limit the ways of establishing the transferor's main purpose in making a transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">
 
 121(4) Transfer not void if transferee acted in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Despite subsection (1), a transfer of property is not void against the trustee if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the consideration that the transferee gave for the transfer was at least as valuable as the market value of the property; and 
 
 (b) the transferee did not know that the transferor's main purpose in making the transfer was the purpose described in paragraph (1)(b); and 
 
 (c) the transferee could not reasonably have inferred that, at the time of the transfer, the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">
 
 
 
 
 121(4A) Rebuttable presumption of insolvency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">For the purposes of this section, a rebuttable presumption arises that the transferor was, or was about to become, insolvent at the time of the transfer if it is established that the transferor: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) had not, in respect of that time, kept such books, accounts and records as are usual and proper in relation to the business carried on by the transferor and as sufficiently disclose the transferor's business transactions and financial position; or 
 
 (b) having kept such books, accounts and records, has not preserved them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">
 
 
 
 
 121(5) Refund of consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The trustee must pay to the transferee an amount equal to the value of any consideration that the transferee gave for a transfer that is void against the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">
 
 121(6) What is not consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5), the following have no value as consideration: 
 
 
 
 (a) the fact that the transferee is related to the transferor; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the transferee is the spouse or de facto spouse of the transferor --- the transferee making a deed in favour of the transferor; 
 
 (c) the transferee's promise to marry, or to become the de facto spouse of, the transferor; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the transferee's love or affection for the transferor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) if the transferee is the spouse of the transferor --- the transferee granting the transferor a right to live at the transferred property, unless the grant relates to a transfer or settlement of property, or an agreement, under the Family Law Act 1975 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 
 
 
 121(7) Exemption of transfers or property under debt agreements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This section does not apply to a transfer of property under a debt agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">
 
 121(8) Protection of successors in title.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This section does not affect the rights of a person who acquired property from the transferee in good faith and for at least the market value of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">
 
 121(9) Meaning of transfer of property and market value.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">For the purposes of this section: 
 
 
 
 (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and 
 
 (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 
 
 

5 Section 121(1) of the Act prior to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (Cth) (which introduced into the Bankruptcy Act s 121 in the terms above) addressed 'fraudulent dispositions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was in these terms:
 
 121(1) Subject to this section, a disposition of property, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, with intent to defraud creditors, not being a disposition for valuable consideration in favour of a person who acted in good faith, is if the person making the disposition subsequently becomes a bankrupt, void as against the trustee in the bankruptcy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 

6 Although s 121 in its present form addresses transfers of property made for the identified 'main purpose', the Amended Statement of Claim (like the earlier Statement of Claim) of the Trustees challenges particular transactions (called the '1996 transactions') on the footing that they were part of a scheme orchestrated by Waters with an intent to defraud their creditors; constituted a disposition of property of Waters for no consideration in favour of Dalvella which did not act in good faith; and were entered into for a main purpose which is said to fall within the scope of s 121(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">In other words, there is an amalgam of the elements of the old s 121(1) and the present formulation of s 121(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">The Trustees say that they have chosen to formulate a case of fraudulent disposition because the facts support that conclusion as to those transactions and the disposition falls within the present formulation of s 121(1) having regard to the pleaded main purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">There is, it is said, no inconsistency or failure to plead the required elements of the statutory cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">Dalvella and Donemate say inconsistency arises on both counts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The pleading 
 
7 The case pleaded by the Amended Statement of Claim is this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">8 On 10 August 1999, Richard Waters and Margaret Waters appointed Mr Bevan Schafferius controlling trustee of their property under s 188 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">On 9 September 1999 the creditors of Waters rejected a proposed composition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">On 22 September 1999 the estate of Richard Waters was sequestrated (with the appointment of the first applicant as trustee of the estate) consequent upon a Bankruptcy Notice issued to Mr Waters on 4 March 1999 by the Official Receiver and the presentation of a Creditors Petition against him by the liquidator of Delvine Pty Ltd ('Delvine') on 20 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">On 28 September 1999 the Insolvency Trustee Service of Australia ('ITSA') accepted a Debtors Petition filed by Mrs Waters and appointed the second applicant as trustee of her estate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">9 On 23 November 1984, Mr and Mrs Waters had become registered proprietors as joint tenants of a property at 46 Victoria Terrace, Caloundra, in Queensland referred to in the pleading as the 'Property'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The 1996 transactions 
 
10 In December 1996, a number of events and transactions occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">11 On 2 December 1996, Dalvella was incorporated as was Donemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">The directors from 2 December 1996 of each company were John Alexander Guest and Brian James Osborne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">On 2 December 1996, the Cliffside Trust was established with Dalvella as trustee and Mr and Mrs Waters as Principals.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">On the same date, the Kings Beach Trust was established with Donemate as the trustee and Mr and Mrs Waters as Principals of the trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On 9 December 1996, by deed, Mr and Mrs Waters retired as Principals of each trust, and appointed their children, Jane Waters, Louise Waters, and Adrian Waters, as the 'New Principals'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">12 Between 3 December 1996 and 24 December 1996, Waters entered into ten transactions with Dalvella in its trustee capacity (called, in the pleading, 'the 1996 transactions') implemented by effecting 'simultaneous flexiphone' transfers between the account of Waters at the Caloundra branch of the National Australia Bank ('NAB') and Dalvella's account at the same branch of the NAB.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">Those ten transactions had one of two characteristics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Some were loans by Dalvella to Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The others were gifts of money to Dalvella by Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In the result, Dalvella made unsecured loans to Waters in the aggregate of $2,199,960.00; and Waters gave a gift of $2,200,000.00 to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">By the end of those transactions on 24 December 1996, Dalvella had money receipts (gifts) of $2,200,000.00 and a debt due to it (payable according to its terms) from Waters of $2,199,960.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">13 The dates and amounts of the transfers were these:

14 These facts are pleaded at paras 1, to 21 of the Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">15 By para 22, the applicants plead: 
 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The 1996 Transactions were: 
 
 
 
 22.1 part of a scheme orchestrated by Mr and Mrs Waters with the intent to defraud their creditors; and

<sentence id="s63">
 
 
 

16 The applicants rely upon the following particulars as circumstances or facts from which an inference is to be drawn that the 1996 transactions were part of a scheme put in place by Waters with an intent to defraud their creditors and in which Dalvella gave no consideration and acted other than in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">

<sentence id="s82">
 
 
 
 

17 By para 22, the Trustees further plead:
 
 22.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The 1996 Transactions were: 
 
 ... 
 
 22.3 entered into by Mr and Mrs Waters with the main purpose being: 
 
 22.3.1 to prevent the purported gifted sums amounting to $2,200,000.00 from becoming divisible among Mr and Mrs Waters' creditors; or 
 
 22.3.2 to hinder or delay the process of making the purported gifted sums amounting to $2,200,000.00 and, or alternatively, the Property available for distribution among Mr and Mrs Waters' creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">
 
 Particulars 
 
 (a) The Applicants repeat and rely upon the particulars pleaded in paragraphs 22.2.1 to 22.2.13 and the facts pleaded in paragraphs 23 to 30 of the Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">
 

18 By para 23, the Trustees plead:
 
 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In the circumstances of: 
 
 
 
 
 23.1 the particulars pleaded in paragraph 22 herein, it is reasonable to infer that the Liquidators of Freedom Homes and the BSA were either creditors, contingent creditors or anticipated creditors for large sums of money and that inevitably there would come a time when these creditors would press Mr and Mrs Waters for payment of monies that they would not be able to pay; 
 
 23.2 the facts pleaded in paragraphs 20 to 22 above, the purported gifted sums amounting to $2,200,000 would probably have been available to creditors if that property had not been the subject of the purported gift.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">
 
 
 
 
 The 1997 transactions 
 
19 The Trustees then plead a number of transactions that occurred in February 1997 between Waters, Dalvella (in its capacity as trustee of the Cliffside Trust ) and Donemate (in its capacity as trustee of the Kings Beach Trust ), to this effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">20 On 1 February 1997, Waters by letter to Donemate requested an interest-free loan for 25 years of $2,199,960.00 from Donemate in order to repay the debt due by Waters to Dalvella from December 1996 and thus extinguish that debt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">21 On 3 February 1997, Donemate borrowed that sum from Dalvella interest free for 25 years.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Dalvella made the loan to Donemate on the security of a third party mortgage by Waters over the Caloundra property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">On 3 February 1997, Donemate made the 25 year interest-free loan to Waters; Waters repaid their debt to Dalvella; and Waters granted a mortgage to Dalvella over 17 lots of land including the Caloundra property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">The transfers on 3 February 1997 are said to have occurred this way: Dalvella made one transfer of $99,960.00 and seven transfers of $300,000.000 to Donemate totalling $2,199,960 in all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Donemate made transfers of the same number and amounts to Waters and they made transfers of the same number and amounts to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">Accordingly, Dalvella, supported by the third party mortgage given by Waters had become a secured lender to Donemate; Donemate a lender to Waters; and Waters had discharged the December 1996 debt to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The 1999 transaction 
 
22 The Trustees plead another transaction in May 1999 between Dalvella and Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">23 On that date, by REIQ contract subject to the conditions of special Annexure A, Waters sold the Caloundra property to Dalvella at 'market price' and Dalvella agreed to the release of the third party mortgage given by Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">By para 29 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Trustees plead that but for the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction, the estate of each bankrupt would have included a one-half legal and beneficial interest in the Caloundra property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">24 By para 30 of the Amended Statement of Claim, the Trustees plead that at the time of the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction, the main purpose of Waters in entering into those transactions was:
 
 
 30.1 to prevent the Property from becoming divisible among their creditors; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 30.2 to hinder or delay the process of making the Property available for division amongst their creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">
 
 
 

25 The particulars of the circumstances or facts supporting the pleaded fact of purpose are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">26 First, the facts and circumstances relied upon to support the inferences pleaded at para 23 of the Amended Statement of Claim, which in turn relies upon the facts and circumstances pleaded at para 22 and the particulars at 22.2.1 to 22.2.13.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">27 Secondly, three letters of demand sent to Waters by BSA on 20 February 1997, 3 April 1997, and 6 June 1997 claiming $14,368.44 (and a further foreshadowed claim of $57,465.00), $33,372.94 and $60,765.94 respectively, and threatening suit if payment should not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">28 Thirdly, on 3 February 1997, the liquidator of Delvine commenced proceedings against Mr Waters to recover a contended preference payment of $17,000.00.</sentence>

 31.1 Jefferson &amp; Stevenson, the DCT, the BSA and the Liquidator of Delvine were either creditors, contingent creditors or anticipated creditors for large sums of money and that inevitably there would come a time when these creditors would press Mr and Mrs Waters for payment of monies or obtain judgments that Mr and Mrs Waters would not be able to pay.</sentence>

35 In the course of dealing with the challenge by Dalvella and Donemate to the adequacy of particulars given by the Trustees of the Statement of Claim, I set out extensively the elements of the pleading as then formulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">For the sake of completeness in these reasons, I have recorded the matters pleaded by the Trustees by the Amended Statement of Claim .</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">It should be noted however that there is no change to the formulation of the 1996 transactions nor the pleaded particulars of those transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The Amended Statement of Claim introduces a new para 22.3 which pleads the main purpose of Waters in entering into the 1996 transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Paragraph 23.1 of the amended pleading adopts para 23 of the earlier pleading but also pleads that in the circumstances the facts pleaded in paras 20 to 22, the amount of the purported gifts by Waters to Dalvella ($2.2m) would probably have been available to creditors, but for the gifts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">There is no change to the formulation of the 1997 transactions nor the 1999 transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">The main purpose of the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction pleaded by para 30 of the Amended Statement of Claim is that pleaded by para 30 of the earlier pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">There is no change to para 31.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Paragraph 32 as previously formulated is now simply introduced by the word 'Alternatively'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">Paragraphs 33 and 34 are in the same terms as the earlier pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">The contentions of Dalvella and Donemate 
 
36 The contentions of Dalvella and Donemate are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">37 The first contention goes to para 22 generally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">38 Paragraph 22 is said to be embarrassing and ought to be struck out because it is inconsistent with para 23.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">The inconsistency is said to arise in this way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">Paragraph 22 pleads that the 1996 transactions were part of a scheme orchestrated by Waters with intent to defraud their 'creditors'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">Paragraph 22 does not plead that such creditors included 'future creditors'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Paragraph 23.1 however pleads that having regard to the particulars of para 22 (and thus operating in reliance upon para 22), a reasonable inference is open that the liquidators of Freedom Homes and the Building Services Authority were either 'creditors, contingent creditors or anticipated creditors' of Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The two paragraphs are said to operate inconsistently in their scope.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">39 There is no inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">40 Paragraph 22 pleads that the 10 transactions comprising the debt drawdowns and gifts back by Waters were part of a scheme orchestrated by them with the intent to defraud their creditors and involved a disposition by Waters of property for no consideration in favour of Dalvella which did not act in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Trustees provided particulars on 30 March 2007 (Particular 3) of the creditors for the purposes of para 22, in these terms:
 
 The reference to 'creditors' in paragraph 22 ... is a reference to all of Mr and Mrs Waters then present creditors and all future creditors of Mr and Mrs Waters, including Jefferson and Stevenson and the BSA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">
 

41 Paragraph 23.1 pleads that in the circumstances of the particulars identified at 22.2.1 to 22.2.13 (and Particular 3) a reasonable inference arises that within the field of existing and future creditors, a claim by the liquidators of Freedom Homes (appointed on 29 July 1996 by the creditors in the light of a report from the administrators of Freedom Homes that a claim could be made against Waters for an amount up to $2,647,255.00) is a claim by a creditor, a contingent or an anticipated creditor of Waters for that substantial sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Similarly, the particulars of para 22 provide the content of the contention that the BSA was either a creditor or a contingent or anticipated creditor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">It is true that the particulars of 30 March 2007 of para 22 use the term 'future creditors' to define, in part, the field of creditors Waters is said to have sought to defraud as 'then present creditors and all future creditors' and para 23.1 uses the term 'contingent creditors or anticipated creditors'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">It seems to me the distinction is not a real one in the context of the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">As I said at [29] of Duus v Dalvella , there must be a relation between the steps taken as part of the contended scheme and an intention to defraud identified creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Those creditors however might be existing creditors with provable debts or future creditors or any present or future creditors ( Barton v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1974] HCA 43 ; (1974) 131 CLR 370 at 374; PT Garuda Indonesia Ltd v Grellman (1992) 35 FCR 515 at 525-526; DM Cannane &amp; Anor v J Cannane Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 26 ; (1998) 192 CLR 557 at 566 and 593; Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1999] FCA 110 ; (1999) 91 FCR 353 at 370-371).</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Future creditors include anticipated creditors (such as the liquidators of Freedom Homes or the BSA) or contingent creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">42 The following further observations should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">43 Plainly enough, paras 22 and 23 are to be read together; para 23 is the expression of at least two creditors which fall within the broader class of present or future creditors; paras 22 (and the particulars of para 22) and para 23 assert facts arising out of the identified chronological events which give rise as a matter of pleading to an inference that Waters knew particular entities would inevitably pursue claims against them of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">44 The remaining contentions are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">45 First, para 22 is said to be deficient because although it alleges that the 1996 transactions were part of a scheme implemented by Waters with an intent to defraud creditors, para 22 does not plead, as a material fact, that any particular act undertaken by Waters was undertaken by them with the relevant intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">Further, it is said no material facts are pleaded that could, as a matter of law, support an inference of an intent to defraud creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">46 Secondly, it is said the particulars of the 'scheme' and the particulars of 'orchestration' of the scheme are inconsistent as two schemes are identified at paras 8 to 21, 11 to 16 and 20 and 21 of the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">47 Thirdly, para 22.1 is said to have no utility as the facts pleaded at para 22.1 do not satisfy the elements of s 121 of the Act and thus provide no basis for relief reliant upon s 121 ; motive is said to be irrelevant and therefore the phrase 'with intent to defraud their creditors' should be struck out; para 22.1 is thus said not to disclose a cause of action; to the extent that the Trustees place reliance upon the facts pleaded at para 22.1, the Trustees, must, it is said, also plead that at the time of the disposition, the effect of the disposition was that creditors would be deprived of payment, not simply that a disposal had the effect of reducing assets available to creditors; and para 22.1 does not plead that the creditors Waters sought to defraud included all present and future creditors at the time of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">48 Fourthly, para 22.3 fails to properly plead the elements of s 121 as the Trustees plead Waters' main purpose in entering into the 1996 transactions rather than the required statutory main purpose of a transferor 'in making the [relevant] transfer'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">49 Fifthly, para 22.3.2 pleads, it is said, a main purpose in the alternative to a main purpose related to a disposal of the gifted amounts, that of entering into the 1996 transactions for the main purpose of hindering or delaying the process of making the Caloundra Property available for distribution among Waters' creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">However, the Trustees do not plead facts to the effect that the Caloundra Property has been 'the subject of any impugned transfer'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">50 Sixthly, because the Trustees do not claim in the principal Application any relief in relation to the 1996 transactions and the Amended Statement of Claim confines the relief sought in the action to that sought in the Application, para 34 which pleads that the 1996 transactions are void dispositions, ought to be struck out as the 1996 transactions form no part of the controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">Similarly, it is said that paras 20, 21, 22 and 23 which concern the 1996 transactions also ought to be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Dalvella and Donemate say that the Trustees do not plead that the void character of the 1996 transactions is relevant to any relief sought in relation to the 1997 or 1999 transactions; nor is there any pleaded nexus, it is said, between the 1996 transactions and either the 1997 transactions or the 1999 transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Moreover, it is further pressed that because the scheme to which the 1996 transactions relate is confined to the matters pleaded at paras 8 to 21 of the Amended Statement of Claim which do not include the 1997 transactions or the 1999 transaction and because the particulars of the 'orchestration' of the pleaded scheme are confined to the 1996 transactions, paras 20, 21, 22, 23 and 34 ought to be struck out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Considerations 
 
51 Before dealing with each of these contentions, the case pleaded by the Trustees against Waters needs to be examined in the context of the pleading overall so as to test whether the Statement of Claim makes clear to Waters the case advanced against them which they must answer especially having regard to their contention that the 1996 transactions have no coherent relationship, within the pleading, with the 1997 and 1999 transactions in terms of remedial relief.</sentence>

<sentence id="s164">52 In sequence, the elements are these.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">53 From about February 1996 companies associated with Waters began to fail financially.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">Jefferson and Stevenson became voluntary administrators of Freedom Homes on 29 February 1996, David Clout was appointed voluntary administrator of Delvine on 14 March 1996 and official liquidator of that company on 10 April 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">Mr Waters was the primary examinee in a seven day public examination of the affairs of Freedom Homes and Delvine.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In July 1996, Mr Waters sought legal advice as to his personal liability concerning guarantees he had given to the BSA in support of Freedom Homes and in July 1996 Waters were provided with a report to creditors of Freedom Homes prepared by Jefferson and Stevenson postulating a potential claim against Waters on a number of bases in an amount up to $2,647,255.00.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">54 On 29 July 1996, the creditors of Freedom Homes resolved to place that company in liquidation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Between June and August 1996, Waters sought advice from solicitors and accountants concerning their liability to creditors and in relation to asset protection steps.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">In December 1996, the BSA issued letters of demand to Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">These matters are recited as the particulars to para 22 and are set out in full at [16].</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">55 On 2 December 1996, Dalvella and Donemate were incorporated; the Cliffside Trust and Kings Beach Trust were established; and Waters retired as principals of each trust seven days after the creation of the trusts, in favour of their children on 9 December 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Between 4 December and 24 December, Waters caused 10 inherently odd transactions to occur by which Dalvella lent $2,199,960.00 to Waters and Waters made a gift of all of it plus $40.00 ($2.2m) to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">These transactions purportedly gave rise by 24 December 1996, to a debt due by Waters to Dalvella of $2.199m and a gift or disposition by Waters to Dalvella of $2.2m.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">56 The pleaded events concerning the incorporation of Dalvella and Donemate, the creation of the two trusts, retirement of Waters and appointment of their children and the drawdowns and gifts back are said to be a scheme (see Particular 1) put in place by Waters with the intention of defrauding their present and future creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The Trustees say Dalvella did not give consideration nor act in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The 10 transactions were part of a sham 'orchestrated' by Waters in December 1996 against the background of the adverse financial events emerging throughout 1996 as particularised (22.2.1 to 22.2.13).</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Trustees' use the term 'orchestrated' to describe the conduct of Waters in implementing the scheme with intent to defraud their creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The events of orchestration are the steps taken on 2 December 1996 to create the trusts with companies (incorporated on the same day) as trustees; Waters retirement as principals and the consequent appointment of their children together with the sequence of simultaneous flexiphone transfers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">57 On 1 February 1997, Waters sought to deal with the resolution of their debt to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">58 Waters made a request for an interest free loan for 25 years of $2.199m to Donemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">On 3 February 1997, Donemate borrowed that sum from Dalvella so as to lend it to Waters so that Waters could immediately pay it to Dalvella and thus extinguish their debt to Dalvella leaving Waters with a debt to Donemate and Donemate with a debt to Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The difference, apart from the new debtor/creditor relationship, was that Dalvella lent the money to Donemate (and thus to Waters with payment to Dalvella) on the strength of a third party mortgage by Waters over 17 lots of land including the Caloundra Property in favour of Dalvella to secure Dalvella's loan to Donemate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">The transfers effecting the loans and payment all occurred on 3 February 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">59 These transactions and payments are described as round-robin payments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">60 On 25 May 1999, Waters purported to enter into a contract with Dalvella to sell the Caloundra Property to it at market price and secure the release of the mortgage.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">The elements of that transaction are pleaded at para 28 of the Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">61 The Trustees say that had Waters not entered into the 1997 transactions and round-robin payments nor the 1999 transaction, each of Mr and Mrs Waters would have retained an equal beneficial interest in the Caloundra Property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The Trustees say the main purpose of Waters in entering into the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction was to prevent the Caloundra Property from becoming divisible among the creditors of Waters or to hinder or delay the process of making the Caloundra Property available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">62 The facts from which an inference is to be drawn of this main purpose are the sequence of adverse financial events (and consequent steps taken by Waters) particularised at 22.2.1 to 22.2.13 [16] (and para 23) which identify demands made or claims to be made against Waters by then present or anticipated creditors; three letters of demand made by the BSA; proceedings taken by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation against Waters for indemnity in respect of a preference claim ($200,000.00); proceedings taken by the liquidators of Freedom Homes to recover damages for insolvent trading ($1,656,127.87) and other proceedings identified in the particulars to para 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">63 The Trustees say that the liquidators of Freedom Homes, the DCT, BSA and the liquidators of Delvine were either creditors, contingent creditors or anticipated creditors for substantial sums at the time of the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction; and those transactions effect a disposition of the Caloundra Property to Dalvella when the property would have been part of the estate of Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">64 Alternatively, the Trustees say the 1996 transactions involving the drawdowns and gifts back to Dalvella in December 1996, the transactions and payments in February 1997 and the proposed sale of the Caloundra Property and release of security in 1999, purported to result in a debt due by Waters to Dalvella, compromised and discharged by a payment by Waters, made possible by a loan by Donemate to Waters, in turn, reliant upon a loan by Dalvella to Donemate on terms that Waters provide Dalvella with security, which entitled Dalvella to take a transfer of the legal and beneficial interest of Waters in the Caloundra Property on the terms of the 1999 contract.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">65 The Trustees say that the 1996 transactions, the 1997 transactions and the proposed 1999 sale and transfer transaction involving Waters, Dalvella and Donemate are evidenced by circular transfers of funds in which no consideration arose as Waters did not borrow $2.199m from Dalvella nor gift back $2.2m; nor did Dalvella make a loan to Donemate of $2.199m; nor did Donemate advance that sum to Waters; nor did Waters repay a debt due to Dalvella of $2.199m; and nor was a third party security granted for consideration in favour of Dalvella.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">66 By reason of these matters, the Trustees say that the 1996 transactions, the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction are dispositions for the purposes of s 121 of the Act and are void as against the Trustees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">67 Waters could not seriously be in any doubt that the Trustees say these odd transfers between Waters and the trustees of the trusts in the events described were consciously put in place to defraud present or future creditors and the main purpose of Waters in entering into the 10 flexiphone transfers between them and Dalvella was, as to the gifts back of $2.2m, to prevent those monies remaining available to any present or future creditors of Waters or to hinder or delay the process by which those monies would become available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">Alternatively, the Trustees say Waters entered into the 10 transfers, with an intent to defraud creditors, for the main purpose of hindering or delaying the process of making the Caloundra Property available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">68 Accordingly, it seems to me that from the Amended Statement of Claim, Waters would understand the challenge by the Trustees to the 1996 transactions and the 1997 and 1999 transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">69 Against that background, I reach these conclusions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">70 As to [45], it can be seen that the pleading asserts by para 22 that particular acts, namely, the 1996 flexiphone transfers and the scheme events giving rise to the pleaded disposition were orchestrated or consciously undertaken by Waters with an intention to defraud creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">Secondly, intention is a question of fact determined, almost always, as an inference drawn from foundation facts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The chronology of the scheme events and orchestration together with particulars of para 22 are capable of supporting an inference of acts undertaken with an intention to defraud creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">71 As to [46], the particulars of the scheme are those facts commencing with incorporation of the companies and creation of the trusts (and related structural changes) and concluding with the 10 flexiphone drawdowns and gifts back at the same NAB branch.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The particulars of orchestration are the particular sequential steps between 2 December and 9 December 1996 and substitution of the Waters' children for Waters as principals and the implementation of the transfers in the manner and on the dates pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">There is no inconsistency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">The pleaded scheme of which the transfers are a part are identified and the method of organisation and implementation of the scheme is plain from the pleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">72 As to [47], it is true that, in terms, s 121(1) of the Act is no longer framed by reference to a disposition of property with an intent to defraud creditors not being a disposition for valuable consideration in favour of a person who acted in good faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The section operates upon a transfer of property to another if that property would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to the creditors of the bankrupt where the transfer was made for one of two main purposes identified by the Act (s 121(b)(i) or (ii) [4]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Here, the Trustees plead facts going to the identification of property comprising the 10 transactions; the identity, formation and creation of the companies and trusts participating in the events of transfer; the circumstances of transfer and the accounts used to effect the transfers; the intention of Waters in implementing the scheme and their main purpose for doing so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Those facts go to the question of whether a transfer of property occurred; whether, in all the circumstances, that property would probably have become part of the bankrupt's estate or would probably have been available to creditors but for the transfers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">In any event, if the Trustees seek to establish that the character of the conduct of Waters was fraudulent, that is, they set about a course of defrauding creditors, the Trustees are simply asserting facts that if proved, satisfy, they say, the statutory standard although on one view they may have set the bar for themselves unnecessarily high.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In addition, the assertion that the transfers in December 1996 were part of the identified scheme implemented with a fraudulent intent may be relied upon if proved as part of the factual matrix going to the pleaded main purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Therefore, para 22.1 does not suffer the vice of inutility; the facts pleaded of an intent to defraud creditors ought not to be struck out and para 22 does disclose a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">Two further final contentions are identified at [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">First, the notion that the Trustees must plead that at the time of the disposition, the effect of the disposition was that creditors would be deprived of payment not simply that assets would be reduced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">Secondly, para 22 fails to plead that Waters sought to defraud all present and future creditors at the time of the transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">73 As to the first, the pleading asserts by para 22 that at the time of the 10 flexiphone transfers, Waters undertook the transactions with an intent to defraud creditors, that is, so as to deprive creditors of the disposal funds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">This is not an allegation that steps taken by a transferor had the effect of reducing a pool of assets then available to a person who subsequently became bankrupt coupled with an allegation that the effect of a general reduction of assets from the pool should be regarded as an event of contravention of s 121(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The Trustees contend for something quite specific: a scheme calculated to defraud creditors at the moment of implementation of the disposition of property undertaken for the main purpose of preventing the monies becoming available to creditors or as part of a process of hindering or preventing the Caloundra Property from becoming available to the creditors of Waters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">74 As to the second matter, the Trustees contend that Waters sought to defraud creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">The particulars make it clear that the contended intention was held in relation to all present and future creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">In other words, Waters engaged in the conduct to defeat any person who had a debt then due and payable or any person Waters anticipated would, if put to it, be able to establish in the future a claim against them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">Examples of such persons included the liquidators of Freedom Homes and the BSA, not in any class closing way but only in the sense of future creditors emblematic of all future creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">75 As to [48], para 22.3 is to be read with paras 22.1 and 22.2 which are in turn reliant upon paras 8 to 21.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">That is, para 22.3 must be read in context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">It pleads that the 1996 transactions were entered into for an identified main purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">The entry into those transactions resulted in the transferor, it is said, making a disposition for no consideration in favour of Dalvella for the main purpose (put in the alternative) pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">Paragraph 22.3 does not fail for the reason contended at [48].</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">76 As to [49], the Trustees plead that the 1996 transactions were entered into for, in the alternative, the purpose of hindering or delaying the process of making the Caloundra Property available to creditors.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">At para 30, the Trustees say the main purpose of Waters entering into the 1997 and 1999 transactions was to prevent the Caloundra Property becoming divisible among the creditors of Waters or to hinder or delay that process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">The facts of the circular money transactions of 1997 are pleaded and the 1999 transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">The facts from which an inference of purpose is invited are pleaded as particulars of para 30.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Paragraph 32 pleads the construct arising out of the 1996, 1997 and 1999 transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Paragraph 33 pleads the contended true effect of those transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Paragraph 34 pleads that the 1996, 1997 and 1999 transactions are void as against the Trustees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">In reliance upon the void character of those transactions and instruments, the Trustees seek declarations in relation to the mortgage and the 1999 Contract of Sale.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Accordingly, the contention at [49] is not made out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">77 As to [50], the Trustees claim [3] a declaration that the mortgage granted by Waters to Dalvella on 3 February 1997 and the contract of 25 May 1999 is void; an order for removal of Dalvella's caveat; declarations as to the beneficial interest of each bankrupt in the Caloundra Property; and such further or other order as the Court thinks fit, in the resolution of the controversy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">The controversy of fact upon which the relief dispositive of the controversy rests includes a contention as to the efficacy of the 1996 transactions, the events surrounding those transactions and the intent and purpose of Waters in effecting those transactions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">The controversy comprehends contentions as to the relationship between the money transfers in December 1996, the round-robin of loans and payments in 1997 and the contended transfer of Waters' interest in the Caloundra Property to Dalvella in 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Arising out of those events and the identified transactions, the Trustees seek the relief formulated in the principal application and in particular declarations that particular instruments purporting to effect a transfer of property by Waters are void.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">Section 121(1) of the Act operates so as to render a transfer of property to another void (in the relevant circumstances).</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Orders declaratory of the legal effect of a transfer of property might well be made in circumstances where declarations are not sought as to each step in a sequence of steps the combined effect of which is to render a transfer made in reliance upon the steps void notwithstanding that findings of fact might be made about each step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">The relief claimed by the Trustees is confined to the transfer of property effected by the mortgage and the contract, and the nature of the interests held by Waters in the Caloundra Property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">That relief, in part at least, is framed by a controversy extending to the 1996 transactions and the validity of those transactions in the circumstances pleaded.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">Accordingly, there is no basis for striking out paras 20, 21, 22, 23 and 34 of the Amended Statement of Claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">78 Accordingly, the application by Dalvella and Donemate must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">I certify that the preceding seventy-eight (78) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Associate:
