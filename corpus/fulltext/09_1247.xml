<sentence id="s0">
 By Notice of Appeal filed on 12 May 2009 and Amended Notice of Appeal dated 21 September 2009, the appellant appeals from the decision of Federal Magistrate Raphael delivered on 21 April 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">His Honour's judgment dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') which was handed down on 17 September 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">That decision affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ('the delegate') made on 1 April 2008 to cancel the Higher Education Sector (Student) Subclass 573 visa ('Subclass 573 visa') which had been issued to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">FACTS 
 The appellant was born on 1 February 1987 in Myanmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He arrived in Australia on 3 February 2006 holding a Subclass 573 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">On 10 April 2006 the appellant was granted a further Subclass 573 visa valid to 30 July 2010.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The visa contained conditions, one of which, namely condition 8202, stipulated that the holder of the visa comply with the educational requirements of the institution at which the student was enrolled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The appellant enrolled at Curtin International College ('the college') for a Diploma of Engineering.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The course commenced on 6 March 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 16 October 2006 the appellant transferred to the Diploma of Information Technology course at the same college.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The appellant was due to complete such course on 15 October 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">By letter dated 1 February 2007, the college wrote to the appellant advising him that he had been reported to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Department') for non-compliance with the conditions of his Subclass 573 visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The college referred to his poor attendance and unsatisfactory record.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">On the same day the college issued the appellant with a notice under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) stating that in the period from 16 October 2006 to 25 January 2007 he had attended 69% of the scheduled contact hours and therefore that he had failed to comply with the extant version of condition 8202(3)(a) of the visa which required him to attend 80% of classes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">First Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation
 On 14 February 2007 the Department issued the appellant with a written Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation ('the first notice') under s 116 of Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') because of his failure to meet the attendance requirements of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The appellant was invited to provide comments at an interview to be held at the Department on 21 February 2007 in respect of the first notice and to provide reasons why his visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant attended the interview and provided information including evidence establishing that his maternal grandfather had died.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">In these circumstances a delegate from the Department decided not to cancel the appellant's Subclass 573 visa on the basis that there were exceptional circumstances beyond his control that led to his non-compliance with the conditions attaching to his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Second Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation
 On 23 November 2007 the Department (now the Department of Immigration and Citizenship) wrote to the appellant stating that it had been advised that he had ceased his studies at the college in June 2007 and that his failure to be enrolled could lead to the cancellation of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">On 21 January 2008 the Department forwarded an email to the appellant concerning his failure to attend an interview fixed for that date and advised him that he should arrange another appointment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 5 February 2008 the Department arranged a second interview at 9.00 am on 11 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The appellant did not attend such interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">On 13 February 2008 the appellant contacted the Department by telephone and advised that his non-attendance was due to poor health.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">A further interview was scheduled for 19 February 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The appellant again failed to attend and attempts to communicate with him by telephone were unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On 26 February 2008 the Department issued the appellant with a Second Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation of his visa ('the second notice') on the ground that he had ceased to be enrolled in a registered course of study.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">THE PRIMARY DECISION 
 Departmental Interview
 By the letter dated 26 February 2008 the Department invited the appellant to attend an interview scheduled for 10.00 am on 10 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The invitation informed the appellant that it had come to the Department's attention that there might be grounds for cancellation of his visa under ss 116(1)(b) and 116(3) of the Act and under reg 2.43(2)(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations').</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The letter stated: 
 
 At the interview you will be asked:
 &#8226; Why you think the ground(s) for cancellation does or does not exist;
 &#8226; Why you think your visa should not be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">
 
 There is no record of any interview having occurred before the delegate on that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">However, there is a Decision ('the primary decision') signed on 1 April 2008 at 10.15 am and also a Notification of decision signed 1 April 2008 at 10.20 am and verified by the appellant's signature on the same day at 10.40 am.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The primary decision and Notification of decision constitute the record relating to the interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Such documents (relevantly identical) suggest that the appellant raised three issues before the delegate on 1 April 2008 (there being no other record of an interview pertaining to the second notice).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Item 3 of the primary decision and Notification of decision contains the following: 
 
 Provide a summary of the reasons the visa holder considers the GROUNDS for cancellation DO NOT exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Mr KHANT has been unable to demonstrate exceptional circumstances under the following circumstances:
 &#8226; the wrong student was reported
 &#8226; the section 20 notice was defective
 &#8226; the event of a critical incident 
 
 Item 5 of the aforementioned documents are entitled: 
 
 Evidence of and reasons why GROUNDS for cancellation DO OR DO NOT EXIST.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 

Beneath such heading the identical entry is included as for Item 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Item 7 of the aforementioned documents require the decision maker to state whether the reasons for cancelling the visa outweigh the reasons not to cancel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the space provided, the decision maker is required to give reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The decision maker repeated exactly the same response as stated in Item 3 and 5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">On 1 April 2008 the delegate cancelled the appellant's visa for non-compliance with condition 8202 pursuant to ss 116(1)(b) and 116(3) of the Act and reg 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The delegate found that the appellant had not been enrolled and studying in a full-time registered course since June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">TRIBUNAL PROCEEDINGS 
 The appellant made an application for review of the primary decision to the Tribunal on 8 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">On 1 August 2008 the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellant by registered mail, addressed in accordance with the residential address for correspondence provided by him in his application for review ('the invitation').</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The invitation invited the appellant to comment upon numerous issues including his failure to attend several interviews before the Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The invitation relevantly stated: The invitation advised the appellant that if the Tribunal found that he did not comply with condition 8202 of his visa it would need to consider whether that non-compliance was ' due to exceptional circumstances beyond the non-citizen's control '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">It therefore invited the appellant to provide any evidence that the non-compliance was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">It stated that if no comments or additional information was received by 19 August 2008, the decision could be made without reference to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">The appellant did not provide information or comment to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Pursuant to s 359C(1) and (2) of the Act, the Tribunal proceeded to hand down its decision on 17 September 2008 on the premise that by virtue of the operation of s 360(3) of the Act the appellant lost any entitlement to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">The unchallenged facts establish that the invitation was never received by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">It was returned after the decision was handed down and marked 'unclaimed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">TRIBUNAL FINDINGS 
 In its findings the Tribunal referred to relevant authorities and statutory provisions of the Act, noting that the appellant failed to give information within the prescribed statutory period.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The Tribunal proceeded to make a decision without taking any further action in accordance with s 359C of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It did so on the alternative stated assumptions that it did or did not retain a discretion to invite the applicant to a hearing after he had failed to respond to the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">The Tribunal then considered the matters raised before the delegate and in reciting the facts, the Tribunal noted the following (at [19]-[21]): 
 
 On 26 February 2008 the Department issued the review applicant with a second Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation on the basis that he had ceased to be enrolled in a registered course of study and invited him to provide his comments at an interview scheduled for 10 March 2008 (D1, f.38-46).</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

 
 
 The review applicant subsequently provided to the Department untranslated medical records relating to Ms Daw Ong Saw Lyan, aged 79 years, and a translated birth certificate for her daughter, Ms Ng Han Chong, the review applicant's mother (D1, f.48-62).</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">However, there is no record on the departmental file that the review applicant attended and was interviewed by the Department at an interview held on 10 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">
 
 The Tribunal then referred to the primary decision under review as follows (at [22]): 
 
 On 1 April 2008 the delegate proceeded to cancel the review applicant's student visa pursuant to subsections 116(1)(b), 116(3) and subregulation 2.43(2)(b) for non-compliance with condition 8202 (D1, f.71-76).</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">The delegate found that the review applicant had not been enrolled in and studying a fulltime registered course since June 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">In addition, the decision record stated that the review applicant was unable to demonstrate that the wrong student had been reported, that the section 20 notice had been defective or that there had been a critical incident that constituted exception circumstances and which led to his non-compliance in relation to the requirement to maintain his enrolment in a registered course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 The Tribunal, having considered the relevant authorities to the application then before it, said (at [63]-[64]): 
 
 In the case currently before the Tribunal, the review applicant put forward to the Department untranslated medical records relating to his maternal grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">However, no submissions were provided to the Department to explain the significance or relevance of this evidence to the possible cancellation of the review applicant's student visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">In addition, the Tribunal notes that, in its section 359A letter dated 1 August 2008, the review applicant was invited to provide comment and further information relating to the issues arising in relation to his application for review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">However, the review applicant failed to do so within the prescribed period, namely, 19 August 2008, or at any time thereafter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">Accordingly, the Tribunal has had regard to the evidence presented to the Department, and accepts that the review applicant may well have been concerned about his maternal grandmother's health at the time that he ceased to be enrolled in a registered course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">However, based on the limited evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that having regard to Ministerial Direction No 38, the tests in Wang and Chen and the dictionary definition of "exception", that these circumstances, even once cultural matters are factored in, constitute exception circumstances beyond the review applicant's control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">Nor does the evidence before the Tribunal provide any causal link between the circumstances cited by the review applicant and the non-compliance that has occurred in relation to the cessation of his enrolment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 The Tribunal concluded by stating that it was satisfied that the relevant conditions existed for a cancellation of the visa under s 116(3) of the Act and reg 2.43(b) of the Regulations and upheld the primary decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">APPLICATION TO FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 The appellant then applied to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia for a review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">The grounds of application raised numerous issues relating to the alleged failure of the Tribunal in the conduct of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In support of such application the appellant swore an affidavit on 19 February 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">The affidavit makes no reference to the events on 10 March 2008 but states that a few days before 1 April 2008 the delegate telephoned him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The appellant deposed: 
 
 Ms Krishnan telephoned me a few days before 1 April, 2008 and told me to come for the interview at 10.0[sic] am on 1 April, 2008 or the visa would be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">I received the medical records about this time and took along copies of file notes of my grandmother's doctor to the Department 1 April, 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">These were notarised by a Notary Public.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">I had made up my mind to tell Ms Krishnan about the trouble that my family had suffered in Burma during 2007 and that my father had had trouble making payments in Australia as a result of those problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I was also going to tell her about my wish to transfer to the University of Technology in Sydney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">On 1 April, 2008, I arrived at the Department at 10.00 am and went to the reception counter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">I said words to the effect that I had a meeting with Ms Krishnan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">I was given a ticket and asked to wait.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">I waited for about 20 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Ms Krishnan then asked me to the counter and I spoke to her there.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">The conversation that I had with Ms Krishnan was to the following effect:
 Ms Krishnan: Why haven't you gone to school?</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">Myself: At that time, my grandmother was sick, and I was not healthy enough.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">My family also has had some other problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">Here are the medical records for my grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">Ms Krishnan didn't look at the records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">Ms Krishnan: This is not a good reason.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">Have you got a Doctor's certificate?</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">Myself: No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">Ms Krishnan: Your visa will be cancelled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">Ms Krishnan left the counter for about 5 minutes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">I had not had a chance to tell her about my family's problems.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">Ms Krishnan came back and gave me the document titled "Decision" on pages 67 and 69 of the Court Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">She also gave me a document titled "Notification of cancel visa under s116 of the Migration Act, 1958 ".</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">A copy of this document is at pages 71 and 73 of the Court Book.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">
 
 At the hearing before Raphael FM on 1 April 2009 the Minister objected to numerous portions of the affidavit on the ground of relevance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The transcript suggests that Raphael FM admitted both the affidavit of the appellant and an affidavit sworn by his father.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">No cross-examination was made on the allegations made in the appellant's affidavit by the Minister for the reason, expressed before this Court, that the affidavit was not relevant to any issue then being considered by the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">However, in his Honour's decision, it is apparent that several portions of the appellant's affidavit were relied upon by him in reaching his decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">There is simply no other source for many of the factual findings made by his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">Raphael FM dismissed the application for judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">APPEAL TO THIS COURT 
 By Notice of Appeal filed on 12 May 2009 the appellant raised three grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">At the hearing the appellant sought to rely upon an Amended Notice of Appeal containing five grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">The Minister objected to the appellant being granted leave to rely upon both the original Notice of Appeal and the Amended Notice of Appeal on the ground that the issues raised in both the Notices of Appeal had not been raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">To enable the Court to consider both the appellant's and the Minister's submissions the Court granted leave to the appellant to file in Court the Amended Notice of Appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The first submission of the appellant, as it was made orally, contended that there was a discretion vested in the Tribunal, pursuant to s 359(1) and s 359C of the Act, to not proceed to make a decision on the facts before it, even though the appellant had failed to respond to the invitation seeking more information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The appellant submits that the Tribunal retains a discretion to gain more information in such situation, and pursuant to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI and Another [2009] HCA 30 ; (2009) 258 ALR 434 , it may do that by telephone or other means.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">The appellant submits that in the very particular factual circumstances of these proceedings the Tribunal should have sought more information before making its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">These circumstances include the uncertainty surrounding 10 March 2008; the unclear decision of the delegate; the unclear purpose of the medical documents provided to the delegate; and the obligation of the Tribunal, pursuant to reg 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations, to be positively satisfied that there were no exceptional circumstances explaining the appellant's failure to comply with condition 8202 of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">Secondly, the appellant submits that the Tribunal, pursuant to SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 1592 ; (2007) 164 FCR 14 , was obliged to undertake reasonably open and regular administrative steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the ' real and meaningful nature of the invitation to comment ' (at [53]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The appellant submits that such obligation arises where the Tribunal is aware that the record of claims made by an applicant and received by the Tribunal is incomplete.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">It is submitted by the appellant that the Tribunal was aware of a ' conspicuous absence of any explanation ' of the medical records submitted by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">Thirdly, the appellant submits that, following the submissions in ground one (namely that the Tribunal retains a discretion pursuant to s 359(1) and s 359C of the Act to obtain further information even if a reply to an invitation is not forthcoming), that exercise of discretion is guided by s 353 and s 357A(3) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Section 353 states: (1) The Tribunal shall, in carrying out its functions under this Act, pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical and quick.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">(2) The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision: (a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and (b) shall act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">
Section 357A(3) states:
 
 (3) In applying this Division, the Tribunal must act in a way that is fair and just.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">
 The appellant acknowledges that Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eschetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK and Others [2009] FCAFC 83 ; (2009) 257 ALR 427 make clear that s 353 and s 357A(3) of the Act are not a source of rights for an applicant, but comprise only ' facultative ' ( Eschetu at [49], [77], [108]-[109], [158] and [179]) or ' exhortative ' ( SZMOK at [13]-[18]) provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The appellant submits, however, that while the provisions might not give rise to positive rights for an applicant before the Tribunal, they must be given some meaning, and they must govern the exercise of discretion of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">On the basis of this submission the appellant points out that the Tribunal did not explain why the appellant was not contacted by means such as email or telephone.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Following from similar considerations outlined in other grounds of appeal, the appellant submits that there was an obligation on the Tribunal to make such further inquiries.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Fourthly, it is submitted that the Tribunal failed to consider the appellant's claims as made before the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The appellant seeks to rely on his affidavit as admitted before the Federal Magistrate as unchallenged evidence of what was put by him in the interview before the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">Such evidence suggests that the decision of the delegate had nothing to do with the grounds put by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The appellant submits therefore that the Tribunal did not consider his claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">Fifthly, and finally, the appellant claims that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in determining whether grounds existed for the cancellation of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The appellant submits that rather than form a positive state of satisfaction that there were no exceptional circumstances beyond the appellant's control which explained his non-compliance with condition 8202 as reg 2.43(2)(b)(ii) of the Regulations requires, the Tribunal referred to the discussion in Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 229 ; (2005) 142 FCR 257 at [107] - [116] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">That discussion is based on s 137L(1)(b) of the Act which is phrased in different terms to reg 2.43(2)(b)(ii).</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">That section requires an appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that certain circumstances do exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">In contrast, reg 2.43(2)(b)(ii) requires the Tribunal to form a positive state of satisfaction that exceptional circumstances don't exist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">The appellant submits that such application of the wrong test constitutes a jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">NEW ISSUES 
 The Minister submits that all grounds raised on appeal are fresh grounds, that is, grounds that were not relied upon before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">Consequently the Minister submits that such grounds should not be entertained by this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">In particular the Minister objects to grounds one, three and four and suggests that such grounds are prejudicial because had they been put earlier there might have been (not necessarily would be) more evidence that the Minister would have put before the Court in answer to such grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The appellant's counsel acknowledges that the issues raised for consideration by the Amended Notice of Appeal were not raised in the hearing before the Federal Magistrate in the precise form currently argued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">However, the appellant submits that since the delivery of judgment by the Federal Magistrate, the High Court of Australia has delivered its decisions in SZMOK and in SZKTI which were on 2 July 2009 and on 26 August 2009 respectively, each of which the appellant submits are pertinent to the issues raised by the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Court granted leave to the appellant to make supplementary submissions highlighting where the submissions as put before this Court were before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">The appellant has done so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">The Court also granted leave for the Minister to make supplementary submissions in answer to the appellant's supplementary submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">The Minister, in making its supplementary submissions, acknowledged that the appellant's first ground of appeal was partly raised in written and oral submissions before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">The Minister maintains that grounds two, three, four and five were not raised before the Federal Magistrate in any form similar to that which is now argued before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">Authorities
 A detailed overview of authority discussing when leave should be granted for new grounds to be argued on appeal is to be found in the decision of Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 578 at [7] - [11] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Court has had regard to those authorities, particularly the decision of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [166] in which his Honour stated eight factors guiding the exercise of discretion to grant leave for an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">Those grounds were: Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success?</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below?</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved?</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">What is at stake in the case for the appellant?</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand?</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent?</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">If so, can it justly and practicably be cured?</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie?</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">
Overall, the leave will be granted where it is ' expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined ': see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">Consideration
 The Court has considered the matters raised before the Federal Magistrate and is satisfied that the issues now sought to be raised on appeal are different to the issues raised before the Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Court, having considered the eight factors referred to in NAJT , will grant leave for the appellant to rely on the new grounds of appeal for the following reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">In regards to the first factor, the Court considers that the legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">The explanation for the failure to raise the arguments below, that being recent High Court authority, is sufficient.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The Court accepts that the decisions of SZMOK and SZKTI are highly relevant for the purposes of the appellant's arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">The Court considers that there is no inconvenience to it in allowing the appellant's arguments, given that it was open to the Court to hear arguments in favour of granting leave and, if granted, then to proceed into a consideration of the new grounds of appeal in the hearing of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">As to the fourth factor referred to in NAJT , obviously much is at stake for the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">An unsuccessful appeal will see his visa cancelled and his deportation to Myanmar.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Indeed, one could imagine few more significant consequences for an individual in a hearing before the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">The Court does not consider that this decision will have wider application than the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">Indeed, as will become apparent in the Court's findings, the Court emphasises the very specific factual circumstances of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">Finally, as to the issue of prejudice to the respondent, the Minister relied upon Water Board v Moustakas [1988] HCA 12 ; (1988) 180 CLR 491 at 497 where the majority said ' more than once it has been held by this Court that a point cannot be raised for the first time on appeal when it could possibly have been met by calling evidence below '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">However, Moustakas relates to a situation distinct from the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">The appeal court described in Moustakas was an appeal court from a first instance trial .</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">In that circumstance, it is far more understandable that a court of appeal would seek to constrain grounds of appeal that could call for more evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">While this Court is acting as a court of appeal, it is so acting in respect of a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which itself was acting as a court of judicial review of a Tribunal decision, not a trial court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">In that sense, this Court is just as well placed as the Federal Magistrates Court to receive evidence or review the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">In the circumstance that this Court is effectively judicially reviewing a decision of the Tribunal, being the practical effect where new grounds are relied upon and no error is shown on the part of the Federal Magistrate, then this Court is in just as good a position as the Federal Magistrates Court to fulfil that role.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">Consequently, the Court does not believe that Moustakas is apposite in the present circumstances and prefers to rely on the considerations of minimising prejudice discussed in the decision of NAJT .</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">The Court notes the prejudice identified by the Minister relating to grounds one, three and four relied upon by the appellant and the assertion that the Minister might have chosen to lead evidence in the Federal Magistrates Court had it been on notice of the grounds as now raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Court also notes that the Minister, in supplementary submissions, noted that ground one had been partially raised before the Court below in similar terms to those now put.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">The Court notes that the Minister was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the appellant and was also granted the opportunity to adjourn the proceedings in order that it be able to put on further evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Such offer was declined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">An offer to allow the Minister to cross-examine the appellant on his affidavit in the Court below was also declined by the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">In the circumstances, the Court believes the Minister has been given adequate opportunity to rectify any prejudice identified, particularly as this Court is in just as good a position to take evidence to review a decision of the Tribunal as the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">Even if such prejudice is not overcome, the Court considers that it is ' expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined ': VAAC at [26].</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">FURTHER SUBMISSIONS 
 The decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI and Another [2009] HCA 39 ; (2009) 259 ALR 429 was due to be handed down shortly after the hearing of these proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">The Court granted leave to the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reliance upon this decision and for both the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reply to each other's further submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">Both the appellant and Minister took advantage of the leave to make submissions on the effect of SZIAI , and the Minister has also made submissions in reply to the appellant's submissions on the effect of SZIAI .</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">As will become apparent, the Court finds such submissions to be highly relevant to its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">FINDING 
 The Court will make its decision in the present matter having reliance only on the first ground of appeal made by the appellant and submissions on the effect of SZIAI .</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">The Court does not need to, and therefore declines to, make any findings in relation to the other grounds of appeal, though it should be noted that submissions in relation to the other grounds of appeal are partially relevant for the consideration of ground one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">The factual matrix
 The present proceedings arise out of very distinct factual circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">All of the following observations are made based on the information that was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Firstly, it appears that there was no interview between the delegate and the appellant on 10 March 2008, as had been scheduled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">No record existed explaining why there was no interview.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">There was no record of the rescheduling of the interview to 1 April 2008 when the decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">These facts must be considered against the background of detailed records of communications made and received between the Department and the appellant in previous communications such as those regarding the first notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">The absence of any information explaining what occurred on 10 March 2008 is, to say the least, puzzling.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">One would have expected there to be some record of events which occurred on that day, even if the proceedings were simply adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">Secondly, it was clear that there had to have been some kind of discussion between the appellant and the delegate concerning the proposed cancellation of the appellant's visa, given that the box in Item 3 of the Notification of decision was entitled ' RESPONDED to the notice of intention to consider cancelling the visa ' was ticked.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">The Court assumes that such notation was made on 1 April 2008, the day of the decision, and therefore that the interview occurred on that day, rather than 10 March 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Thirdly, it was apparent that medical records were provided by the appellant to the delegate, though it is entirely unclear when this occurred.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">It is also unclear what they evidenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">Fourthly, the reasons provided by the delegate for making the primary decision were lacking in detail and profoundly unhelpful in determining the basis of the decision, let alone what evidence was presented to the delegate by the appellant to show exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">The cryptic reasons, namely ' the wrong student was reported '; ' the section 20 notice was defective '; ' the event of a critical incident ', because of their brevity, do little to inform.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Even the Minister acknowledges before this Court that the primary decision is most unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">Fifthly, there was no apparent mention in those reasons, such as they were, that would explain the purpose of the medical records that were apparently provided to the Tribunal by the appellant, let alone what the delegate's opinion was in answer to them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">There is also a clear discrepancy in that the medical records, which were presumably evidence of something, were not listed under Item 5 in the primary decision as ' Evidence of reasons why GROUNDS for cancellation DO OR DO NOT EXIST '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">This was the state of the facts and evidence before the Tribunal at the time it made its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">One does not even need to consider the affidavit of the appellant, setting out his account of the circumstances, to be aware that there was a dearth of information upon which the Tribunal could make its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">The Tribunal recognised that this was a problem, as it wrote to the appellant on 1 August 2008 in the invitation seeking information under s 359A and s 359(2) of the Act and specifically sought information concerning 10 March 2008 and 1 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">The issue, therefore, is given that no reply was forthcoming from the appellant to such invitation, was the Tribunal entitled to proceed to make its decision upon the factual matrix as outlined above?</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">Section 359C of the Act
 The Court recognises that the Act, for practical reasons, allows the Tribunal to make decisions in circumstances where it has less than a perfect understanding of relevant events.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">For example, despite the reality, the Act deemed the invitation to have been received by the appellant seven days after it was sent provided that certain procedures were followed (s 379C(4)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">Such procedures were followed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The Act also allowed the Tribunal to proceed to make a decision in the absence of a reply by the appellant (s 359C).</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">However, it is imperative to note that section s 359C(1) and (2) are phrased as ' the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to obtain the additional information [emphasis added]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">That is a discretionary power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">If the Tribunal may proceed without seeking further information, the corollary is that it is possible for the Tribunal to not proceed without seeking additional information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">That information could be sought by contacting the appellant through other means (than that for which there was no response), or by seeking to contact someone other than the appellant who might have the relevant information, for example, the delegate or Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">Whatever course the Tribunal adopts ought to depend on the circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">The Tribunal addressed such issue obliquely at [33] to [38] of its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">However, it concentrated on the narrower issue of whether it could have invited the appellant to appear before it, notwithstanding his failure to reply to the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">The Tribunal referred to conflicting authority which considered whether s 360(3) and s 363A of the Act mandates that upon the failure to respond under s 359C of the Act, an applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">The Federal Magistrate also considered such issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">Since SZKTI it is clear that a Tribunal may obtain information without an appellant appearing before it, for example by telephone: see SZKTI at [47] (referring to s 424(1) which is in identical terms to s 359(1)) and s 366.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Therefore, the Tribunal never addressed the issue why it was not exercising its discretion to attempt to seek further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Instead it appears that the Tribunal either felt it had no power to invite the appellant to appear before it, or, even if it did, it refused to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">This is not to suggest that the Tribunal must positively state in every decision similar to the current one why it is not going to seek additional information when an applicant fails to provide a response.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">However, it is notable that the Tribunal did feel it necessary to explain its decision not to seek more information in the present circumstances, albeit on the narrower issue of whether it could have attempted to invite the applicant to appear before it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">In many situations, the Tribunal's decision to proceed to a final decision in the absence of comment by the applicant may not be problematic, as the reasons for not seeking further information would be obvious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">One of the reasons for the provision of invitations to provide more information or make comment under s 359A of the Act is procedural fairness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">For example, the requirement that an applicant ought to be able to make comment on information adverse to his or her position (s 359A(1)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">In the situation where no comment is forthcoming, there will usually be no difficulty with the Tribunal exercising its discretion to proceed to a decision because the applicant has been afforded procedural fairness, in the sense of being invited to comment, even if such offer is not accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">It is possible that, as demonstrated by the current circumstances, the Tribunal can proceed upon a fiction, that being that the applicant had been provided with notice when, in reality, the notice had not been received.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">The Act, pursuant to sections such as s 379C(4), makes it clear that such a course is open to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">However, the current situation is distinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Although the Act allowed the Tribunal to proceed to decision in the absence of a reply from the appellant, if it did so it would be proceeding on a paucity of facts on an issue critical to the eventual finding, that being whether there were exceptional circumstances which justified the appellant's failure to comply with condition 8202 of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">As the Tribunal itself said in the invitation, 
 
 If the Tribunal ultimately finds that you did not comply with condition 8202 of your student visa...the Tribunal will need to consider whether the non-compliance was "due to exceptional circumstances beyond the non-citizen's control".</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">
 
 There is no clearer demonstration of the problem with progressing to decision upon the paucity of information on such issue than [63] to [64] of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">It was entirely unclear when the medical records were provided, and for what purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Such issue was highlighted by the Tribunal at [63].</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Yet at [64] the Tribunal stated: ' accordingly, the Tribunal has had regard to the evidence presented to the Department, and accepts that the review applicant may well have been concerned about his maternal grandmother's health at the time that he ceased to be enrolled in a registered course '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">There is no evidence before this Court of any information available to the Tribunal upon which it could have based such statement, other than an assumption that that was the reason for the medical records having been provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">Such records might have been for that reason, but they might equally have been for another reason, for example, that the appellant's parents were unable to give him sufficient funds because they were paying for treatment of his sick grandmother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">Those records might have gone to proving any number of exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">That was entirely the problem, yet the Tribunal made a guess as to what the exceptional circumstances might be, and then took no further steps to verify the purpose of the records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">While the assumption may be that the Tribunal was merely taking the appellant's position at its highest, in doing so it exposed the paucity of information it had before it to make its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">Further, the statement ' evidence presented to the Department ' does not accord with the circumstance that the Tribunal had before it a record of the primary decision which cited three grounds that appeared to have nothing to do with the medical records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The Tribunal clearly had no idea what, if any, evidence supported those grounds, given that the evidence section of the decision merely repeated those three grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">The Tribunal did not appear to have any real understanding of what the grounds even meant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Failure to inquire: SZIAI and Le
 In the circumstances, the Court considers that the test at [25] of SZIAI may be apposite.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">It ' may be that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained, could, in some circumstances, supply a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">The majority in SZIAI found that a failure to make an inquiry in the above circumstances could constitute a jurisdictional error because of a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">As will be discussed, the majority also left open the door for failure to make an inquiry being a jurisdictional error for other reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le and Others [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 Kenny J at [63] observed: 
 
 The concept of vitiating unreasonableness has been extended to the manner in which a decision was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">Thus, a failure by a decision-maker to obtain important information on a critical issue, which the decision-maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker would proceeded [sic] to make the decision without making the enquiry: see Prasad 6 FCR at 169-170 per Wilcox J; Videto v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 326 ; (1985) 8 FCR 167 at 178 per Toohey J ( Videto ); Luu v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39 at 47-50 per Davies, Wilcox and Pincus JJ ( Luu v Renevier ); Detsongjarus v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1990] FCA 364 ; (1990) 21 ALD 139 at 143 per Pincus J ( Detsongjarus ); Rahman [2000] FCA 1277 at [30] per French J; Tickner v Bropho [1993] FCA 208 ; (1993) 40 FCR 183 at 197-198 per Black CJ; Ahamed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1325 at [12] per French J; Yang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 258 ; (2003) 132 FCR 571 at 579 per Ryan and Finkelstein JJ ( Yang ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">This proposition is also discussed in other cases, such as Yao-Jing v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 74 FCR 275 at 288 per Foster J and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 289-90 per Mason CJ and Deane J and 321 per McHugh J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">
 
 In Videto and Another v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 326 ; (1985) 8 FCR 167 , Toohey J at 178 said: 
 
 In such a case [potential deportation] it may be that the material placed before the Minister or his delegate contained some obvious omission or obscurity that needs to be resolved before a decision is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">
 
 In Luu and Another v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39 at 50 the Full Court observed: 
 
 But, equally, one may be able to say that a decision is unreasonably made where, to the knowledge of the decision-maker, there is readily available to him or her other factual material, likely to be of critical importance in relation to a central issue for determination, and which has not been obtained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">
 
 Therefore a failure of a Tribunal to make inquires in certain circumstances may also constitute jurisdictional error due to ' Wednesbury unreasonableness' (see [62] of Le regarding Wednesbury ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">Despite comments in SZIAI at [13]-[15] and [22]-[23] noting the difference between judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and judicial review under s 75(v) of The Constitution , SZIAI would not appear to disturb Le .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">Indeed at [26] of SZIAI the majority stated: ' no factual basis for the conclusion that the failure to inquire constituted a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or that it was otherwise so unreasonable as to support a finding that the tribunal's decision was infected by jurisdictional error ' [emphasis added].</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">Such statement would appear to confirm that a failure to make an inquiry could constitute jurisdictional error for at least two different reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Those are, a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in fulfilling the role of the Tribunal to review, and ' Wednesbury unreasonableness'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">...about a critical fact...
 Both SZIAI and Le formulate the type of information similarly: ' an obvious inquiry about a critical fact ' (in SZIAI at [25]) or ' obtain important information on a critical issue ' (in Le at [63]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">The Court believes that the information in the present circumstances satisfies such test.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">It was critical to the review whether the appellant's failure to comply with his visa conditions was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">The Tribunal was on notice that there evidently were exceptional circumstances claimed through the decision record of the delegate, and the unexplained medical records.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">However, on the information before the Tribunal, it could not be clear precisely what those grounds were.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">The Minister submits that a Tribunal is not required to make the case for an applicant before it, it is for the applicant to make their submissions: see Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] and Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) and Another; Ex parte APPLICANT S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">This is undoubtedly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">However, the inquiry in question would not make the appellant's case for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Rather, it would seek clarification of the grounds already provided to the delegate, in the circumstance where the delegate's record was wholly unsatisfactory.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">It is true that the appellant did not reply to the invitation of the Tribunal on these matters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">However, the Act, specifically s 359C, envisages the circumstance that no reply is forthcoming and the Tribunal may still need to seek additional information before it should make its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">This was such a circumstance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s270">Such finding is strengthened by the fact that the relevant test in reg 2.43(2)(b)(ii) of the Regulations is that the Tribunal ' is satisfied that...the non-compliance was not due to exceptional circumstances beyond the visa holder's control '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s271">That is, that a positive state of mind must be found on the part of the decision maker that there are no exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s272">The Tribunal could scarcely have positive satisfaction that the appellant's non-compliance was not due to exceptional circumstances if it had evidence before it that might go to exceptional circumstances, namely the medical records, but did not know to what issue such evidence related.</sentence>
<sentence id="s273">The Minister submits that as the Tribunal, in essence, conducts a de novo review on the merits, it is not essential that the record of the delegate be complete before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s274">This submission overlooks two important considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s275">Firstly, whether or not the Tribunal needed to, the Tribunal did have regard to the primary decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s276">In its decision at [64] it stated, ' accordingly the Tribunal has had regard to evidence presented to the Department...based on the limited evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied...that these circumstances...constitute exceptional circumstances beyond the review applicant's control '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s277">The only source of that evidence was the medical records and the primary decision itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s278">Therefore, the Tribunal, because it paid regard to, and embellished the primary decision, made the primary decision an issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s279">This leads to the second point which is that the critical inquiry to be made is not of the primary decision in the sense of what the delegate decided, but what evidence or submissions were put to the delegate in support of the claim of exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s280">It was clear that there were some submissions made to the delegate and medical records provided to the delegate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s281">It was also clear that there were discrepancies regarding the nature of those submissions and the evidence provided which should have been apparent to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s282">In short, the Minister misconstrues the true nature of the inquiry which is required.</sentence>
<sentence id="s283">...an obvious inquiry...
 Further to the above, SZIAI requires that the inquiry be an obvious one in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s284">The exact nature of the inquiry could have been to seek to contact the appellant by another means such as email or telephone since the Tribunal had his details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s285">Alternatively, the Tribunal could have contacted the delegate or Department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s286">The Minister submits that it would be strange that in the circumstance that s 359C and s 360(3) prevented the Tribunal from inviting the appellant before it that it should be able to seek oral evidence under s 359(1) and s 366.</sentence>
<sentence id="s287">However, that informal mechanism is exactly what the High Court has said is available in SZKTI at [47].</sentence>
<sentence id="s288">Even if the Tribunal did not seek oral evidence, the Tribunal could have sought to clarify whether the appellant had, in fact, received the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s289">To repeat, this is not to suggest that such step is always required of the Tribunal, merely that in certain circumstances it should be taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s290">As to the alternative source of information, the Department or delegate, the Minister submits that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed on the assumption that it had all the relevant documentation pursuant to s 352(4) of the Act which requires the Secretary, upon being notified of an application for review, provide to the Registrar all documents considered by him or her to be of relevance to the review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s291">The problem is that it was obvious that such documentary record was flawed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s292">As the Tribunal was acutely aware, the documentary record lacked any documentation regarding 10 March 2008 and there was little useful information regarding the interview on 1 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s293">In such circumstance, an enquiry of the delegate regarding these discrepancies could have resolved the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s294">...the existence of which is easily ascertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s295">Both SZIAI and Le make it plain that the inquiry must be directed towards information, ' the existence of which is easily ascertained ' (in SZIAI at [25]) or ' which the decision-maker knows, or ought reasonably to know is readily available ' (in Le at [63]).</sentence>
<sentence id="s296">In SZIAI the majority found (at [26]): 
 
 ...there was nothing on the record to indicate that any further inquiry by the tribunal, directed to the authenticity of the certificates, could have yielded a useful result.</sentence>
<sentence id="s297">There was nothing before the Federal Magistrates Court or the Federal Court to indicate what information might be elicited if the tribunal were to undertake the inquiry which was said to be critical to the validity of its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s298">The inquiry suggested was telephone contact with the persons whose mobile telephone numbers were shown on the certificates.</sentence>
<sentence id="s299">But the question whether the certificates contained false statements as to authorship or otherwise would not be able to be determined by calls placed to those telephone numbers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s300">If the respondents to the calls admitted to the tribunal or its officers that the certificates contained false statements, then the grounds for a decision adverse to SZIAI would have been strengthened.</sentence>
<sentence id="s301">If the respondents said that the contents were true, it would have added nothing to the statements effectively conveyed by the certificates themselves.</sentence>
<sentence id="s302">The second reason is that the response made by SZIAI's solicitors to the tribunal's letter of 14 January 2008 itself indicated the futility of further inquiry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s303">
 
 In Le , Kenny J found (at [77]-[78]): 
 
 At the least, a decision-maker, acting reasonably in the Wednesbury Corporation sense, would have sought to verify whether the primary decision-maker's statements regarding Mr Nguyen's supposed admissions derived from what the primary decision-maker mistakenly understood to be the effect of Mr Nguyen's written statement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s304">Additionally, a decision-maker, acting reasonably in this sense, would have enquired whether the interviewing officer, acting under the misapprehension that Mr Nguyen said that his marriage relationship had ended, had advised Mr Nguyen to withdraw his sponsorship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s305">In the circumstances of this case, especially the mistranslation, a decision-maker acting reasonably might also have made some enquiry as to whether the interpreter at the Departmental interview was adequately qualified and, perhaps, whether the interpreter had accompanied the others to Mr Huynh's residence that day.</sentence>
<sentence id="s306">These enquiries were not difficult to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s307">The Tribunal ought to have known that they might readily be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s308">Presumably, they would have yielded at least some relevant information on issues that were plainly critical to the outcome of the Tribunal's review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s309">
 
 The Court considers that a further inquiry of the appellant would have clarified the key issue, that being whether or not there were exceptional circumstances explaining his non-compliance with condition 8202 of his visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s310">The mere failure of the appellant to reply to the invitation was not evidence that there were no exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s311">As subsequent facts showed, such failure was because he never received the invitation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s312">The Tribunal was not to know that, but it could have emailed or phoned the appellant to find out with certainty whether there was evidence of exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s313">Such step would not have posed any difficulty, since the Tribunal held the appellant's email and telephone contact details.</sentence>
<sentence id="s314">Positive contact with the appellant himself could have put beyond any doubt whether there were, in fact, exceptional circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s315">It is absurd to claim in the light of SZKTI that a simple telephone call or email to the appellant to make contact with him did not render such information ' easily ascertainable '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s316">Alternatively, a call or email to the delegate or Department would be highly likely to have provided at least some degree of clarification of the exceptional circumstances claimed by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s317">Kenny J found in Le at [77], as extracted above, that an enquiry of the primary decision-maker was a step that could be taken by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s318">It is possible that the delegate would not recall the circumstances of 10 March 2008, 1 April 2008, or the exceptional circumstances claimed by the appellant at that time, as submitted by the Minister, but such possibility is unlikely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s319">Even if information was not forthcoming from either of these sources, had such enquiries been made the Tribunal would have put beyond all doubt that it had before it all the information it could to make its decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s320">In such circumstance s 359C of the Act would have allowed it to proceed to its decision and there would have been no ground for criticism from this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s321">As it stands, however, the Court finds that there was a failure by the Tribunal to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which was easily ascertainable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s322">Is there a jurisdictional error?</sentence>
<sentence id="s323">It is not enough that the Tribunal makes an error, that error must be a jurisdictional error if the decision is to be quashed: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [83].</sentence>
<sentence id="s324">As outlined above, two alternative grounds of jurisdictional error would appear to be Wednesbury unreasonableness or a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in failing to fulfil the role of the Tribunal, that is, to review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s325">The Court considers that the latter ground is relevant for the current circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s326">The Court considers that traditionally Wednesbury unreasonableness has been seen as only applicable in the most extreme of circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s327">That may well be why the High Court allowed the appeal in SZIAI .</sentence>
<sentence id="s328">The Court does not consider that the Tribunal's failure to make further inquiries was so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have adopted such course.</sentence>
<sentence id="s329">Rather, the Court prefers the view that the failure to make further inquires of the appellant, or to inquire of the delegate or Department; coupled with the ease at which such inquiry could be made; coupled with the paucity of information the Tribunal had to make its decision; coupled with the type of inquiry required by reg 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal failed to conduct a proper review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s330">Despite the prolixity of the Tribunal decision, in reality, the Tribunal only served as a 'rubber stamp' for the primary decision, a decision that was obviously highly problematic, even on the evidence before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s331">The affidavit
 The Court makes such finding in the absence of reliance on the affidavit of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s332">The Court does not need to rely on such affidavit, and it would be problematic to do so, given that the appellant has not been cross-examined on it, although the Minister declined the opportunity to do so in both the Federal Magistrates Court and before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s333">The Court accepts that when the appellant's affidavit was provided to Raphael FM the Minister was justified in considering that it was not relevant to any issue which was then identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s334">However, since the Federal Magistrate relied upon the affidavit in reaching his decision, this Court was obliged to take it into consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s335">The appellant's affidavit suggests that the delegate's three reasons for cancelling the visa have no relationship to the matters allegedly raised by the appellant at the interview on 1 April 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s336">Therefore if regard is paid to the contents of that affidavit and to the appellant's description of events before the delegate (which the Court has not needed to in order to come to a decision), the decision of the Court is fortified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s337">The invitation
 There is no explanation for the invitation having been returned to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s338">The envelope discloses that it was 'unclaimed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s339">Accordingly, no inference can be drawn that the appellant was responsible for its non-delivery.</sentence>
<sentence id="s340">Conclusion
 For the above reasons the Court upholds the appellant's contention that there has been a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s341">Consequently, the Court will make no finding on the other grounds of appeal sought by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s342">In making its decision, the Court emphasises that there is no error on the part of Raphael FM since the arguments as put before this Court were not put before his Honour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s343">Nevertheless for reasons already given the Court has found that it is in the interest of justice to entertain those arguments.</sentence>
<sentence id="s344">His Honour's decision should be set aside, the Tribunal decision quashed, and the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for rehearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s345">COSTS 
 In the circumstances where the appeal has been upheld on grounds that were not before the Federal Magistrate, or at least not before the Federal Magistrate in the form now put, the usual rule that costs follow the event should not apply.</sentence>
<sentence id="s346">This is because there was no fault on the part of the Federal Magistrate in making the decision he did.</sentence>
<sentence id="s347">Rather, the Court considers that each party should pay their own costs of the appeal, similarly to the basis for the costs order in Snedden v Republic of Croatia (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 132.</sentence>
<sentence id="s348">I certify that the preceding eighty-eight (88) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s349">Associate:
