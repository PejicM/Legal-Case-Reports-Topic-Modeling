 INTRODUCTION 
 VIP Plastic Packaging Pty Ltd commenced this original proceeding by an application and statement of claim filed on 28 August 2008, claiming to be the registered owner of Australian Standard Patent No 2001235262, entitled "Variable-length dip tube for a fluid transfer container".</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The complete specification for the patent was published and became open for inspection on 3 September 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">VIP Plastic alleged that B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Plastics Pty Ltd has infringed the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In an amended defence and cross-claim filed on 26 February 2009, B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Plastics denied infringement and, in its cross-claim, alleged that the patent in suit was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">B.MW.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Plastics sought an order that the patent be revoked pursuant to s 138 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">In its particulars of grounds of invalidity, B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Plastics alleged that the patent in suit and its claims were invalid on the grounds of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, as well as various other grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">VIP Plastic denied that the patent in suit was invalid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">This is an application by the respondent/cross-claimant, B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Plastics, for an order under s 97(3) of the Patents Act that the Commissioner of Patents be directed to re-examine a complete specification of the patent in suit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The notice of motion originally dated 8 May 2009, by which this application is made, also seeks an order as to the documents to which the Commissioner must have regard in re-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">VIP Plastic opposes the orders sought in the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Subsection 97(3) of the Patents Act provides that: 
 Where the validity of a patent is disputed in any proceedings before a prescribed court under this Act, the court may direct the Commissioner to re-examine the complete specification and the Commissioner must re-examine the specification accordingly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">

 Section 98 requires the Commissioner to make a report on a re-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Subsection 98(1) makes it clear that re-examination under s 97 is limited to the issues of novelty and obviousness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Section 98 states that: 
 (1) On re-examining a complete specification, the Commissioner must ascertain and report whether, to the best of his or her knowledge, the invention, so far as claimed in any claim and when compared with the prior art base as it existed before the priority date of that claim:
 (a) is not novel; and
 (b) does not involve an inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">

 
 (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the prior art base is to be taken not to include information made publicly available only through the doing of an act (whether in or out of the patent area).</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">

By virtue of subs 98(2), the Commissioner is limited to considering the prior art base as disclosed in documents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The re-examination provisions were introduced following the report of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee to the Minister for Science and Technology dated 29 August 1984.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The report was entitled "Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia", and recommended the availability of re-examination "so as to utilise the expertise in the Patent Office to decide appropriate questions in the hope that this may reduce the costs of, or in some cases avoid the need for, court proceedings": see the report as quoted in Emperor Sports Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [2005] FCA 996 ; (2005) 146 FCR 159 at 179-180 per Lindgren J and Termite Tite (NZ) No 2 Ltd v Term-Seal (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1493 ; (2007) 74 IPR 16 at 28 [50] per Besanko J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">These provisions are to be read against the patent regime established under the Patents Act , including the definitions of 'novelty' and 'inventive step' in s 7 , and the related definitions of 'prior art base' and 'prior art information' in the Dictionary in Sch 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Where the Commissioner reports adversely on a complete specification, the applicant or patentee may, within 2 months from the day when the Commissioner reports under s 98 , file a statement disputing the whole or any part of the report, whether or not the applicant or patentee also takes steps to amend the complete specification or files a statement of amendments in accordance with a direction of the Commissioner: see s 99.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Where the re-examination was directed under s 97(3) , a copy of the report under s 98 and any statement filed under s 99 must be given to the court that gave the direction: see s 100.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The Commissioner cannot revoke a patent under s 101 where (as would be the case here) relevant proceedings in relation to the patent are pending: see s 101(3).</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">As Besanko J said in Termite Tite at 28 [51], the Commissioner in this circumstance can only provide a report under s 100 , which may be of assistance to the parties, but ultimately "it is up to the court to determine the validity issue on the evidence before it and the commissioner's report does not in any way bind the court".</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Where re-examination has occurred pursuant to s 97(3) , the parties to the proceeding have no right of appeal to the Court from the report of the Commissioner on the re-examination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS 
 In written submissions, B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Plastics submitted that the Court should order re-examination because the matters in issue were appropriate to be determined by the expertise of the Patents Office and determination of these issues was likely to avoid expense.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">According to B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Plastics, resolution of the cross-claim would require: (1) the interpretation of the claims of the patent in suit to determine their scope; (2) the interpretation of the disclosure in a US patent known as the Hancock et al patent; (3) consequential on (1) &amp; (2), determination of the novelty of claims; (4) determination of the content of the "common general knowledge"; and (5) consequential on (1), (2) &amp; (4), determination of the inventiveness of the claims.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Plastics argued that the interpretation of the patent in suit and the Hancock et al patent would require expertise in the relevant technological art, which the Commissioner (but not a judge) might be said to have.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Plastics submitted that the Commissioner might exercise this technical skill without the need for evidence from expert witnesses, and that re-examination before the Commissioner was conducive to economy.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">At the hearing today, B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Plastics reiterated that the Hancock et al patent was the primary piece of documentation relied on for lack of novelty and inventive step.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">It proffered an undertaking that it would not, in effect, challenge the Commissioner's report if unsuccessful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">It sought an undertaking in similar terms from VIP Plastic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">VIP Plastic declined to give the undertaking sought and opposed re-examination by the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">In written submissions, VIP Plastic argued that this report could be no more than "an advisory opinion of limited forensic value and, even if relied upon by the Court, would not preclude or obviate the need for evidence on the issues of novelty or inventiveness".</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">VIP Plastic argued that the report would not result in any reduction of expense or avoidance of litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In written submissions, VIP Plastic submitted that re-examination by the Commissioner would not relieve the Court of the task of deciding the questions of novelty and lack of inventive step for itself, assisted by expert evidence tested in the usual way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">VIP Plastic went on to say that it did not anticipate that this would be a "particularly lengthy or involved matter" and would involve 3 or 4 witnesses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">Some would give evidence about the development of the invention and others, expert evidence about the field of invention, the common general knowledge and the place of the Hancock et al patent, and brief evidence touching interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">VIP Plastic anticipated a trial of a couple of days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">VIP Plastic submitted that the Commissioner's report on re-examination would be likely to raise further issues for debate and resolution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">Moreover, the Commissioner's report would not be apt to resolve the remaining claims of invalidity and infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">CONSIDERATION 
 I agree with the applicant/cross-respondent that Termite Tite does not support the view that a report after re-examination necessarily provides litigation economies: see Termite Tite 74 IPR at 27-28 [50]-[51].</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">I doubt that the provision of a report by the Commissioner after re-examination would reduce the cost of this proceeding and expedite its determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">First, the Commissioner's report after re-examination is not binding on the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">In the absence of an undertaking of the kind sought by B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">Plastics from VIP Plastic, the provision of a report under s 100 will not necessarily relieve the Court of the task of deciding the issues of novelty and lack of inventive step by reference to the admissible evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If the Commissioner's report were unfavourable to VIP Plastic, it would desire to put on evidence and dispute the report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">There may be additional issues for the Court to determine if it receives such a report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Further, both parties said that, regardless of the lack of novelty and inventive step grounds, there will be a need for evidence, including expert evidence, to be adduced before the Court on various other issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that re-examination by the Commissioner would be most expeditious or reduce costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">Moreover, it does not seem that the anticipated trial will be a particularly lengthy or complex one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">In these circumstances, I decline to make the order sought by B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Plastics.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">I would order that B.M.W.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">Plastics pay the costs of the motion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
