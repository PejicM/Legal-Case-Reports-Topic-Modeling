<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The question for decision is whether an existing proceeding in the Court, which is not filed as a proceeding under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act), can, by way of amendment, be converted into such a proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">This depends upon the construction of s 33C of the Act, which, so far as is relevant, reads:
 
 "(1) Subject to this Part, where: 
 
 
 (a) 7 or more persons have claims against the same person; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the claims of all those persons are in respect of, or arise out of, the same, similar or related circumstances; and 
 (c) the claims of all those persons give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact; 
 
 
 
 
 a proceeding may be commenced by one or more of those persons as representing some or all of them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">
 
 
 (2) A representative proceeding may be commenced ..." 
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">)
 

"Commenced" and "commences" also appear in s 33A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 It is submitted for the respondent that this proceeding has already "commenced" and cannot be "commenced" again under Pt IVA.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">It is put on behalf of the applicants that the matter is covered by authority and, in particular, the decision of O'Connor J in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 59 ; (1999) 89 FCR 417, that decision having been referred to with approval by Tamberlin J in Sreika v Cardinal Financial Securities Limited [2000] FCA 1647.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The respondent submits that the decision in Sreika [2007] FCA 1647 can be distinguished because the history of the proceeding was different, it having been intended to have been commenced as a representative proceeding --- it was, thus, simply a question of a wrong form being used.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 It seems to me that the decision of O'Connor J is directly in point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It also seems to me that the distinction sought to be drawn in relation to Sreika [2007] FCA 1647 is unconvincing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">If the point made by the present respondent is correct, and a proceeding is only commenced once, then I do not think that Sreika [2007] FCA 1647 can be distinguished in the way to which counsel for the respondent refers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It is also clear enough that the basic proposition which is in issue here was in issue in those cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It was not as if the decisions were made without regard to there having been a question to be determined.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Quite what the actual substance of the argument was in those cases is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I should say that those cases are referred to in the commentaries as authorities for the proposition that there can be conversion of an existing proceeding to a Pt IVA proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Thus, in order to accede to the respondent's opposition to this amendment based upon lack of power, I would have to find that both of those decisions were plainly wrong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 The argument presented for the respondent has much to commend it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The approach, slightly over simplified, is that you can only have one "commencement" of a proceeding --- once commenced, always commenced.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">It is said that it makes no sense at all that something can be commenced more than once.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A reading of s 33C of the Act in the light of s 33A supports the respondent's position, without a very subtle reading of both sections.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Also, the other provisions of Pt IVA seem to me to assume that a proceeding under that Part cannot also be a proceeding of another nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">That is not to say that Pt IVA is a complete code for the conduct of the case, but it is to say that a Pt IVA proceeding is sui juris and not to be joined with any other kind of proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That last point is not something which arises at this stage of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">5 However, without reproducing all of the arguments put by the applicants, it does not seem that they can make good their argument unless the view is taken that s 33C does not, as counsel put it, amount to a procedural definition of how things are to take place, but rather describes what must have taken place for the proceeding to be under the Part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Put another way, if the amendment here is granted, then a proceeding under Pt IVA , which does not exist at the moment, will exist and so be "commenced" once the amendment is made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">To so conclude does not raise the question as to whether or not the backdating of an amendment to the commencement of the proceeding is part of that process.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">6 I cannot say that that the applicants' argument is without merit.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It may well be correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">It does not appear to have been referred to in terms by O'Connor J or by Tamberlin J who have, rather, concentrated upon what might be called the practicalities of the situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Because of the brevity of the reasoning, particularly in Finance Sector Union [1999] FCA 59 ; 89 FCR 417, it cannot be said that this basis could not have been behind it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Therefore, I am not able to conclude that the decisions relied upon by the applicants are clearly wrong, although I have considerable doubt about their correctness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">In view of that conclusion, I allow the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Whether or not the applicants wish to pursue the amendment is a matter for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">7 There is no doubt that, in general principle, the parties seeking an amendment should pay the costs occasioned by that amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">However, this is an unusual situation for the reasons that have been mentioned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">The costs of the motion up to today should be borne by the applicants, but the costs of today should be their costs in the cause.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Associate:
