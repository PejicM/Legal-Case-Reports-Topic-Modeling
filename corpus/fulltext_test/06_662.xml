<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from orders made by a Federal Magistrate on 13 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The application is dated 28 February 2006 and is supported by an affidavit and a draft notice of appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The orders made by the Magistrate were as follows:
 

 
 
 '(1) That the application for judicial review filed on 13 October 2005 be dismissed on the grounds that: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) pursuant to part 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 the proceedings are an abuse of process; and, in the alternative 
 (ii) pursuant to part 13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 the application fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action; and, in the alternative 
 (iii) pursuant to section 13.10(b) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">
 
 
 
 
 (2) That no further application by the applicant to review the decision of the delegate of the respondent dated 22 June 1999 refusing his application for a protection visa or the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 19 December 2001 be accepted for filing except with leave of the court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">
 (3) That the applicant pay the first respondent's costs on an indemnity basis fixed in the sum of $2900.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">' 
 

2 The orders were made on an application by notice of motion brought by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Minister').</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The Minister sought the dismissal of the proceedings issued in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia by the applicant and relied on various rules of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Pt 13 r 13.10(a), (b) and (c)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The proceedings issued by the applicant that were the subject of the Minister's application were an application under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Migration Act 1958 (Cth) seeking the review of the decision of a delegate of the Minister whereby the applicant was refused a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">3 The matter has a long history which is relevant to the present application and which I summarise as follows:
 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The applicant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia on 21 April 1999.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">On 20 May 1999 he lodged an application for a protection (class XA) visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">On 22 June 1999 a delegate of the Minister refused the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">On 29 November 2001 the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirmed the delegate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The decision of the Tribunal was handed down on 19 December 2001.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">On 16 January 2002 the applicant issued proceedings in the Federal Court seeking a review of the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The application for review was dismissed by Gyles J on 30 April 2002: NABC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 539.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">On 25 November 2002 the Full Court dismissed an appeal from that decision: Applicant NABC of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 418.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">6.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Two applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court did not proceed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The first was deemed to be abandoned and the other was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">On 5 October 2004 the appellant lodged a second application for the review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court, but that application was subsequently discontinued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">On 13 October 2005 the applicant lodged his current application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court to review the delegate's decision and that application was dismissed on 13 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">
 

4 The Magistrate said that the applicant's application challenges the delegate's decision and she said it was doomed to fail because, among other things, the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">5 I do not think that the applicant's proposed appeal enjoys any reasonable prospect of success.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">This case is similar to the case which came before Wilcox J in SZDFW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1821.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The Tribunal conducted a full merits review in relation to the decision of the delegate and the applicant was given every opportunity to present his case (see s 415 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344).</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">This Court found that the decision of the Tribunal was in no way affected by jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The delegate's decision is now of no significance having regard to the fact that it was reviewed by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">6 I think that in view of the history of this matter as I have outlined it, the order prohibiting without leave the filing of a further application to review the decision of the delegate and the decision of the Tribunal is justified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">7 The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Associate:

Dated: 31 May 2006

 Counsel for the Applicant: The applicant appeared in person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">Counsel for the Respondent: Ms B Rayment 
 
 Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore
