 Respondent/Cross-Claimant 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 15 MARCH 2007 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
 
1 The applicant/cross-respondent Bayer Bioscience NV (Bayer) is the patentee of Australian Patent No 623530 (the Patent).</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">It has brought infringement proceedings against the respondent/cross-claimant Deltapine Australia Pty Ltd (Deltapine).</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By notice of motion filed on 9 March 2007 Deltapine seeks leave to amend its defence and cross-claim by raising an allegation of invalidity based on the contention that the true inventor was Dr Christina Hofmann.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 The invention the subject of the Patent relates to plant cells and plants, the genomes of which are transformed to contain at least two genes, each coding for a different non-competitively binding bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) for a specific target insect species.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 In the particulars to par 9 of the draft further amended particulars of invalidity exhibited to an affidavit in support of the motion it is said that Dr Hofmann undertook research in this area between 1983-1989, and then in 1987 she spent some time working at the laboratories of a predecessor in title to Bayer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">While at that firm, Dr Hofmann worked "with a number of researchers, including some of the alleged inventors", and that "as a result of the research and/or while working at that firm either alone or with the alleged inventors, Dr Hofmann developed and disclosed all or part of the alleged invention claimed in the patent".</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Deltapine seeks to reserve the right to rely on further particulars.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">4 The onus is on Deltapine to make out a case that the Court should exercise its discretion in its favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I am not disposed to exercise that discretion for the following reasons:
 
 &#8226; There is no evidence, even on a hearsay basis, as to the merits of the amendment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The allegations are broad and vague in the extreme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They deal with events of 20 years ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">&#8226; There is no evidence explaining the delay of Deltapine in bringing this application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">

5 The proposed amendments also include an allegation that Dr Hofmann assigned her rights to Delta and Pine Land Company by a deed of assignment dated 7 April 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It is also claimed that there was a further assignment to Deltapine dated 26 January 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Those assignments were not produced, but they found the inference that the alleged claim of Dr Hofmann was within the knowledge of Deltapine or its associates almost a year ago.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 It was said from the Bar table that Deltapine made a conscious decision not to raise this particular claim until late last year.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">I agree with counsel for Bayer that the decision of the High Court in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 does not mean that parties have a right to withhold amendments or other procedural steps to suit their tactical assessments of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Even by the standards of patent litigation in this country, which sometimes are the subject of criticism, this case has been very drawn out.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It has been on foot since 2003.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Any insertion of a totally new claim or defence needs to have some sound basis, which in my opinion has not been shown in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 The motion on notice dated 9 March 2007 will be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">
 
 
 
 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
