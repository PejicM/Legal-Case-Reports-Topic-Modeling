1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate given on 29 August 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") handed down on 13 January 2006: see [2006] FMCA 1834.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, dated 5 September 2005, refusing to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">She claimed to have significant concerns for her personal safety and the safety of her children should she be forced to return to Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In particular, the appellant emphasised that she had concerns about raising her three children in Fiji, stating that the situation was unstable and dangerous for both her and her family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 In submissions to the Tribunal the appellant raised concerns about her children returning to Fiji, noting that her two sons were New Zealand citizens with no ties to Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">It was also claimed that one of the appellant's sons suffered from eczema, which was said to be exacerbated by the humidity in Fiji.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 The Tribunal found that children born to a Fijian citizen would be entitled under the Fiji Citizenship Act to become citizens through registration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">While the Tribunal noted the concerns of the appellant, it ultimately found her statements regarding her fear of returning to Fiji to be both vague and imprecise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Tribunal concluded that the appellant's fear of returning to Fiji was not activated by reasons which would attract Australia's protection obligations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate not to grant protection visas.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 On 25 July 2006, the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates' Court claiming that the decision of the Tribunal was made without jurisdiction, or was affected by an error of jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Federal Magistrate found that the appellant had received a copy of the Tribunal decision on 15 January 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">She had not, however, applied for judicial review until 25 July 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">His Honour held that, under s 477 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act "), applications to the Federal Magistrates' Court must be made within 28 days of the notification of the decision, and that that the period could only be extended by up to 56 days if the application for an extension of time is made with 84 days of the actual notification of the decision and the Court is satisfied that it was in the interests of the administration of justice to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In this case, the Federal Magistrate noted that the application was not lodged within this 84 day period, and he held that he was, therefore, powerless to grant any extension.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His Honour proceeded to dismiss the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 The notice of appeal to this Court, which was filed on 15 September 2006, raised the following grounds:
 
(a) the decision of the Tribunal was made without jurisdiction or was affected by an error of jurisdiction;
 
(b) the decision of the Tribunal, being affected by jurisdictional error, was not a decision to which s 474 of the Act applied; and
 
(c) the decision was a denial of procedural fairness and natural justice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">7 None of these grounds allege error on the part of the learned Federal Magistrate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">As already noted, his Honour dismissed the appellant's application because he lacked jurisdiction to entertain it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The application had been filed after the prescribed period had elapsed following the promulgation of the Tribunal's decision and the Magistrate was constrained, by s 477(3) of the Act , from enlarging time within which to commence the proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">8 The appellant appeared in person.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">She had the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">She submitted that she wished to stay in Australia and that she was concerned that proper attention had not been given to the details of her claim to be a refugee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">9 The decision of the learned Federal Magistrate was plainly correct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">No appellable error on his part has been identified.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 The appeal must be dismissed wit h costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Associate:
