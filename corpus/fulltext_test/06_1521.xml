1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate, delivered on 29 May 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 3 March 2004 and handed down on 25 March 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant is a citizen of Tonga.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The appellant told the Tribunal that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Tonga because of his political opinions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The appellant claimed to support democracy, including supporting a democratic movement led by a People's Representative in the Tongan Legislative Assembly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant claimed that the Tongan police and officials were corrupt and that he feared being gaoled for civil disobedience.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The appellant indicated, in a response to an invitation to attend a hearing on 17 November 2003, that he wanted to give oral evidence and provide a witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">However, on the scheduled date of the Tribunal hearing, the appellant did not attend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Tribunal in its decision noted that the appellant did not contact the Tribunal to explain his absence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">It proceeded, pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'), to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal was unable on the material before it to be satisfied that the appellant's claims were authentic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Tribunal found that the appellant's evidence was vague and that the appellant had failed to provide supporting information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The Tribunal noted that there were omissions of certain details which were inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The Tribunal was unable to be satisfied, in the absence of supporting details, that the appellant was at risk of serious harm amounting to persecution for a Convention reason if he were to return to Tonga.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">4 On 15 April 2004 the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">In an amended application filed on 28 September 2004, the appellant relied on certain constitutional grounds and filed a Notice of a Constitutional Matter under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The appellant claimed that ss 474 , 475 and 476 of the Migration Act were unconstitutional.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">
 
5 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that s 474 of the Act was a valid enactment and referred to Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Section 475 of the Act was valid as it was ancillary to s 474.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Section 476 , although in a different form when the application was considered by the Tribunal, was validly made because s 77(i) of the Constitution allowed Parliament to make laws defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The appellant argued that citizens were entitled to have governmental decisions checked by an independent umpire.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">His Honour noted that no particulars of this ground were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Nonetheless it was quite clear, from Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v B [2004] HCA 20 ; (2004) 219 CLR 365, that the Parliament of Australia was the supreme legislative body in Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Federal Magistrate held that the constitutional validity of ss 474, 475, and s 476 of the Act could not be affected by other Commonwealth enactments even if there were inconsistencies between them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In relation to a ground regarding international instruments, the Federal Magistrate held that these only became enforceable under domestic law when incorporated in domestic legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">His Honour found no jurisdictional error was established by the grounds raised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">6 His Honour was mindful of the effect of s 424A of the Act, but found that no breach had occurred because the information relied on was covered by the exemption provided for in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act and, in any event, the decision was based on a lack of information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">His Honour found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">7 The notice of appeal to this Court raised the following grounds: 
 
 (a) that His Honour erred in finding that the application before him involved a matter arising under the Constitution ,
 (b) that the Federal Magistrate erred in law and fact in finding that the delegate was not acting in good faith, when making his decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">

No particulars of either ground were provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">8 The appellant appeared in person before this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">He had the assistance of an interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">He displayed very little understanding of his appeal grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">He advised that they had been drafted for him by a friend.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I advised him that I found the grounds very difficult to understand and asked for clarification.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">He could not assist.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It seems to me that neither ground alleges jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Moreover, I do not think that the learned Magistrate made either of the findings attributed to him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The appellant was unable to point me to any passages in the Magistrate's reasons in which the findings were said to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">9 No error is shown in the learned Magistrate's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">The appeal will be dismissed with costs fixed at $3800.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Associate:
