<sentence id="s7">These are my reasons for doing so.</sentence>

<sentence id="s9">6 Other evidence before the Court on the second court hearing established to my satisfaction:
 
&#8226; that the other resolutions referred to in my earlier reasons were passed at the PBL Annual General Meeting that was held immediately following closure of the PBL Scheme Meeting;
 
&#8226; that the Explanatory Memorandum, incorporating certain minor amendments that I had required, was duly despatched;
