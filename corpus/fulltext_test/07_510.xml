<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The final issue in this protracted battle is that of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">I propose to deal with them briefly, despite having received lengthy submissions from the parties that referred me to quite a number of cases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">In the end the authorities are of marginal assistance only.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Each case has its own peculiar facts that bear upon costs and it is difficult to translate the facts from one to another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">2 First I will deal with the claim against Ms Manning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">To recapitulate, if recapitulation be necessary, the plaintiffs sought to recover from Ms Manning damages which they assessed at around $4.3 million on the basis of alleged breaches of contract, breaches of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and breaches of fiduciary duty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The trial occupied six days and a further three days were spent on the assessment of damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In the result, Arrive Wealth Management obtained an order for compensation in the amount of $45,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The claim by AMP Services was dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Arrive Wealth Management now seeks an order that Ms Manning pay its costs (AMP Service's costs cannot be covered because it failed on its causes of action) on a party and party basis, with no reduction pursuant to O 62, r 36A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">3 I can put to one side O 62, r 36A, the principal purpose of which is to discourage plaintiffs from prosecuting small claims in the Federal Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Here the claims which the plaintiffs pursued were for the most part reasonably complex although, apart from one, they did not find favour with me.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Nevertheless, all the claims were bona fide, were seriously put and strongly argued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Moreover, the claims were sufficiently complex to warrant the retention of senior counsel on both sides.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It would be inappropriate to allow O 62, r 36A to act as a deterrent in such cases and I will make an order that the costs ordered to be paid not be reduced by reason of this rule.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 On the other hand I am a strong proponent of the view that while costs should ordinarily should follow the event, if the successful party has failed on issues that have taken up significant time or put the opposition to considerable expense the successful party should be deprived of the costs that relate to those issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Indeed, in some cases the successful party might even be ordered to pay the other party's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">If courts begin to adopt this approach more readily than in the past, it will force parties to concentrate their attention on those causes of action or lines of defence that are worth pursuing and eschew a scattergun approach to litigation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">This will result in the more efficient conduct of litigation, the cost of which is now all but prohibitive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">5 This is not to suggest that it will always be easy to apportion costs between successful and unsuccessful issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Often the task will only be impressionistic.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">But that difficulty should not stand in the way of an apportionment order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Even if the judge makes a rough and ready estimate of the time spent on unsuccessful issues the result should be fair.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 In this case I do not think Arrive Wealth Management should recover all its costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That would not be a just reflection of the outcome of the case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In my view Arrive Wealth Management's costs should be reduced by a factor that takes into account the time taken in pursuing claims in which it failed, particularly its claim in damages.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Indeed, if Arrive Wealth Management's money claim had been kept within reasonable bounds it is likely that the case would have been compromised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">In all the circumstances it is reasonable, in my opinion, to reduce Arrive Wealth Management's costs by 25 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">7 The claim against Ms Harkness gives rise to different considerations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In my reasons I said that the claim against her was hopeless and that I would consider awarding costs in her favour on a solicitor and client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">I am still minded to take that course notwithstanding the strong submissions made by the plaintiffs that Ms Harkness should only recover costs on a party and party basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The plaintiffs' claim against Ms Harkness can only be described as speculative.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">There was no direct evidence implicating her in any wrongdoing and the inferential case was less than borderline.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">I trust the order will discourage other litigants from bringing hopeless actions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">8 There will be orders that Ms Manning pay 75 per cent of Arrive Wealth Management's costs and that the plaintiffs pay Ms Harkness' costs on a solicitor client basis.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
