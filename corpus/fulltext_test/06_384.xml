1 This application was filed in the Victorian District Registry of this Court on 9 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The applicant seeks review of a decision of the first respondent to refer to the second respondent a notice of motion seeking a suppression order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The first respondent is a registrar in the Queensland District Registry of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The second respondent is a judge of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The decision that the applicant seeks to review, and all other events allegedly relevant to the application, occurred in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">2 This matter was listed for a directions hearing at 9:30 am on 28 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant contacted the Court seeking that the directions hearing be adjourned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">She claimed that she would be unable to prepare for directions on that day because she had a hearing in another matter before Finkelstein J that afternoon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">She was informed by the Court that, as the matter was listed for first directions only, an adjournment would not be granted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">3 Although the Court organised for video conference facilities to be available for the applicant in Brisbane, the applicant did not appear for the directions hearing of 28 February 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">It appeared that the respondents had not been served with any documents in this matter and there was no appearance for them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The Court adjourned the hearing of further directions in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">4 After the directions hearing, the Court contacted the applicant and informed her that, since the application concerned events that occurred in Queensland and persons there, it was proposed by the Court to transfer this (and another) matter to the Queensland District Registry.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The applicant was given an opportunity to file submissions regarding this issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">5 The applicant filed submissions opposing transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I accept that, as the applicant submitted, the other matter should not be the subject of the transfer order that I propose to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">In relation to the present proceeding, the applicant also submitted that "since the matter is against the Queensland Registrar and the Queensland judge, it cannot be transferred to the Queensland Registry [because] the respondents will have to act both as the respondents and the judicial officers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">" For the reasons stated below, I reject this submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">6 The principles that apply to transfer are well settled.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155, at 162, a Full Court (Bowen CJ, Woodward and Lockhart JJ) said that:
 
 " The power conferred on the Court or a judge by s 48 is in terms wholly unfettered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">It should be exercised flexibly having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">" 

The Court observed that the power conferred by s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) recognises the national character of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Court added, at 162:
 
 " The factors which the Court is entitled to take into account in considering whether one city is more appropriate than another for interlocutory hearings or for the trial itself are numerous.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The Court must weigh those factors in each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">Residence of parties and of witnesses, expense to parties, the place where the cause of action arose and the convenience of the Court itself are some of the factors that may be relevant in particular circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">... 
 Ultimately the test is: where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It cannot and should not, in our opinion, be defined more closely or precisely.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">" 

7 Although this proceeding has been commenced in the Victorian District Registry of the Court, the case has no ties whatsoever to Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The applicant resides in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Both respondents are resident in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Similarly, all events underlying the dispute occurred in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">In any other case, all the relevant factors would support the contemplated transfer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">The applicant submits, however, that the respondents will be subject to a conflict of interest if the matter is transferred to Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">It is true that the respondents are a registrar and judge whose responsibilities in large part concern the work of the Court in Queensland.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It does not follow from this, however, that the applicant's case cannot properly be dealt with in the Queensland District Registry, which has the benefit of more than one registrar and judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 For these reasons, I would order, pursuant to O 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 , that proceeding VID 1592 of 2005 be transferred to the Queensland District Registry of this Court .</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Associate:
