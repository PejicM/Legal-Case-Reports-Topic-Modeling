<sentence id="s0">
 The Applicant is the holder of a registered Australian Trade Mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">It came to its attention that the Respondent, who was once a franchisee, but whose entitlement in terms of franchise agreement to the use of the registered mark, referred to as the DDS logo, ceased upon the termination of the franchise, was still using signage which carried that mark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The further circumstances in relation to that usage were related in an interlocutory judgment, which I gave on 18 September 2009.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">At that time, I granted an interlocutory injunction in respect of what appeared on the material, then read, to be a serious question to be tried in respect of an infringement of the trademark.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I also made directions in respect of the further conduct of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Since then, the Respondent has shown what one might describe, to use a neutral term, as a studied indifference to the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">There have been, on his part, a number of events of default, which give rise to an entitlement on the part of the Applicant to default judgment in terms of O 35A r 3(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">Mr Philp, who appears for the Applicant, has, in that context, and commendably properly, drawn to my attention to the form of the statement of claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">It must be said that, in form, the statement of claim is an inelegant pleading insofar as the pleading of a cause of action in respect of an infringement of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth), in terms of s 120 , is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Nonetheless, it is possible to discern, within the pleading, the elements of a cause of action.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The affidavit material read today discloses that the Respondent has, albeit belatedly, changed the signage which, understandably, gave rise to a concern on the part of the applicant in respect of infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">There is nothing in the material which would suggest any likelihood of a continuing infringement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">That, to me, as a matter of discretion, tells against the granting of any permanent injunctive relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Nonetheless, having regard to the Respondent's conduct which, as I have noted, was belated in terms of rectification, and seemed only be a responsive to the initiation of court proceedings, as opposed to measured correspondence in advance, I propose to make declaratory orders in respect of the infringements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">There remains a question as to whether or not, in terms of O 62 of the Federal Court Rules , I ought to fix, as the Applicant has requested, its costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Mr Philp has, appropriately, drawn to my attention sentiments voiced by Gyles J in Gillette Co v Schiavini [2008] FCA 1053 at [4] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His Honour there considered that the circumstances of that case were appropriate for the making of a lump sum order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">There, as here, the Respondent had not appeared.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">His Honour observed that: 
 
 The task of taxation would involve yet further costs, expense and time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">
 

His Honour was satisfied, on the evidence, as I am, that the quantum proposed was reasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">In making that observation, what is reasonable is a subject upon which reasonable minds might reasonably differ.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Nonetheless, the overall amount of costs is within Australian Counsel's fees guidelines which this Court's Registrar publishes for the benefit of the profession from time to time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Further, and also persuasively, the Respondent has been served in advance with a detailed list, item by item, in respect of the amount which has come to be sought by way of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">The fact that this amount was to be sought by way of costs, has also been flagged to the Respondent, in advance of today's hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">For these reasons then, I make orders in terms of paras 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the draft, which has been provided, which I shall sign and place with the papers --- after deleting para 4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">Associate:

 Solicitor for the Respondent: No appearance by the Respondent 
 Date of Hearing: 20 November 2009
