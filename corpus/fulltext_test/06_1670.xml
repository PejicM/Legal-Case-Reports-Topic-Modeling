<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 The applicant has made a request pursuant to O 8 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules for service in a foreign country in relation to three respondents, namely, Gavin Rumney, Douglas Becker and Fathi Said.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In referring to the applicant, I refer to Mr Cox.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The proceeding purports to be also brought on behalf of an applicant called 'Christian Churches of God' but I am not yet satisfied that any such body with legal personality capable of suing in Australia exists.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The requests pursuant to O 8 r 9 are out of order as no leave has been given to serve a document in a foreign country.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">I indicated to Mr Cox that I would look at the merits of such an application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Before a party can be given leave to serve an originating process out of the jurisdiction, that party must have a prima facie case for the relief claimed in the proceeding (O 8 r 3(2)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">I am not satisfied that there is such a prima facie case for relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 The proceeding arises out of a decision by a delegate of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (the Delegate) to terminate a complaint of breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I have had regard to the contents of the Form 167 which has been filed, the application, a draft statement of claim and an affidavit of Mr Cox filed on 8 November 2006.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The Form 167 includes the information provided by Mr Cox to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in support of the claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">I have also had regard to what was said by Mr Cox on 6 November last.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The essence of the complaint was that the entity described as the Christian Churches of God, its members and adherents were attacked and vilified due to their adherence to Jewish Biblical doctrines.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">They claim to be, in effect, Messianic Jewish.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">They alleged they suffer similar racial discrimination as do adherents of Orthodox Judaism.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">It was claimed that the Jews are adherents to a religion but qualify for human rights protection on the grounds that they constitute a specific ethnic group due to their religious beliefs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It was claimed that the Christian Churches of God are in exactly the same situation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The faith was described as Sabbatarian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">5 The Delegate gave reasons for terminating the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Having considered the authorities in relation to what constitutes ethnic origin and an ethnic group for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 , the Delegate was not satisfied that the members of, and adherents to, the Christian Churches of God constituted an ethnic group or that any action against them was by reason of ethnic origin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The Delegate was, therefore, of the view that the requirements under s 18C(1)(b) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 were not satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">6 The Delegate was also of the view that, even if the members of the Christian Churches of God did constitute an ethnic group, the material complained of could not be considered to be 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' them on the basis of their 'ethnic origin'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It was pointed out that insult on the basis of religious beliefs is not a ground covered by the racial hatred provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 I can detect no error in the manner in which the Delegate dealt with and terminated the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I can see nothing in the information given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in the additional material that has been provided by Mr Cox or in what Mr Cox said in Court on 6 November 2006 which assists his case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">In my opinion, there is no reasonable prospect of establishing that persons who adhere to what is called the Christian Churches of God, being Sabbatarian, are of the same ethnic origin or would constitute an ethnic group for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In my opinion, the complaint was misconceived and the proceeding doomed to failure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">8 Leave to serve the proceeding outside the jurisdiction is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The requests which have been filed will not be acted upon.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">This ruling may have consequences for the proceeding as a whole.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">That is to be considered when the matter is next before the Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">



 I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.</sentence>
