 1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate dismissing his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The Tribunal found that the appellant did not face a real chance of persecution if he returned to China, in the reasonably foreseeable future.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The appellant claimed to be a Falun Gong adherent who was actively involved in a "protest demonstration" against the Chinese Government's ban on Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">He said that he had suffered physical harassment from Chinese security officers and feared that he would be sent to jail or a labour camp, without trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He also said that his wife, who remained in China, told him not to return, as policemen were looking for him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The appellant claimed to have started practising Falun Gong in 1998.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He said that Chinese authorities detained him for 10 days in August 2001 and questioned him about Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">He also said that Chinese officials treated him badly at this time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">He claimed that after his release from detention the authorities closed down one of two restaurants which he operated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">He said that he obtained a passport in Guangzhou by paying a large bribe.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had more than a rudimentary knowledge of the belief system of Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">It was also held that he had no significant devotion to Falun Gong.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">5 The Tribunal found that the appellant has not been, and is not now, a practitioner of Falun Gong in any serious sense, or a committed participant in the Falun Gong movement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">It rejected his claim that, in China, he was publicly associated with Falun Gong, undertook activities on its behalf, was arrested, detained and harmed or had his restaurant closed down.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The learned Federal Magistrate was not satisfied that the Tribunal's decision contained any jurisdictional error.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">Before the Court below, the appellant who appeared for himself, relied on two grounds.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">First, he submitted that the Tribunal took into account an irrelevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Second, he contended that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Both grounds as stated and set out at [4] of the reasons below were illogical and unintelligible.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Admirably, his Honour attempted to re-state them in an intelligible way.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The primary judge rejected them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">Both alleged issues sought to quarrel with findings of fact made by the Tribunal and no useful point is achieved by developing them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">7 The appellant filed his notice of appeal on 5 October 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">By consent, the Court ordered that he file and serve an outline of his submissions on or before 23 December 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">He failed to file any submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">He did not appear before the Court on the hearing of the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">His appeal grounds referred to the two issues raised before the Court below and others which were raised in his application below, but not developed before the primary judge.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">8 I have carefully read the judgment below and the reasons of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I am unable to discern any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate or any judicially reviewable error in the reasoning of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 The appeal is dismissed, with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Costs are fixed at $2 600.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
