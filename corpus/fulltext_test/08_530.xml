<sentence id="s0">
 
 1 On 8 April 2008 I gave ex tempore oral reasons for making an order under s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The following sets out those reasons subject only to grammatical and other editing but not such as to alter the substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Ellendale Resources NL seeks an order under s 411(1) of the Act for the convening of meetings of its members and option holders for the purpose of considering the proposed scheme of arrangement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The objective of the proposed scheme is to effect a merger between Ellendale Resources and Hawthorn Resources Limited, formerly known as Great Goldmines NL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">If, in due course, the proposed scheme is approved, Ellendale will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Hawthorn Resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">I am satisfied that the statutory requirements under both ss 411 and 412 of the Act have been satisfied.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The Explanatory Statement is assisted by the contents of Appendix A to the applicant's written outline of submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">This contains, in schedule form, the relevant Corporations Act requirements and related compliance with those requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Court has a supervisory role in relation to such applications.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I am satisfied to the requisite degree at this stage of the proceeding, that the proposed merger appears both fair and reasonable and is one which the relevant shareholders and option holders might well approve in a general meeting.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">That, of course, is no more than a provisional view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">I note, however, that it has the support of the directors of both Ellendale and Hawthorn Resources.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">It is supported by an independent expert's report which describes the proposed scheme as fair and reasonable, as well as being in the best interests of both the share and option holders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">4 The position of ASIC is relevantly contained in a letter from it, dated 7 April 2008, to the solicitors for the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">ASIC advises that it does not currently propose to appear to make submissions or intervene to oppose the schemes at the first hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">I note this to be expressly stated to be the position of ASIC upon the current information provided to it by the applicant to date in relation to whether the schemes have been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">It also notes that ASIC's position may change if it considers it appropriate to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Consistent with that statement in its letter, ASIC has not appeared this morning and there is no present change in the position evident in the terms of the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">5 I am satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the terms of the proposed scheme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Indeed, it was by reason of ASIC's requirements, for a number of amendments to the Explanatory Statement, which occasioned two prior adjournments to the application for convening the meetings which has been heard today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">So far as particular provisions of the scheme are concerned, and in particular, I am referring to the merger implementation agreement, I do not consider the exclusivity provision in clause 12 to be any barrier to making the orders sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The period of restraint is not unreasonable; it lasts only until approximately late May 2008.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">This provides a period reasonably required for the implementation of the proposed merger.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">6 I do not consider the 'Competing Transaction' carve-out to be unreasonable in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The break-fee is within a reasonable range, being just over half a percent of the aggregate of the values of the shares and options.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Finally, the vast majority of shareholders and option holders reside on the eastern seaboard of Australia with more than 50% of the shareholders and more than 70% of the option holders resident in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In those circumstances, it is appropriate for the meetings to be held in Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">7 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the orders sought in the minute of proposed orders dated 7 April 2008, as amended in the course of discussions with Mr Young, appearing as counsel for the applicant, are appropriate orders to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Accordingly, there will be orders in those terms.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Associate:

Dated: 18 April 2008


 Counsel for the Plaintiff: Mr J G Young 
 
 Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Steinepreis Paganin 

 Date of Hearing: 8 April 2008 
 
 Date of Judgment: 8 April 2008
