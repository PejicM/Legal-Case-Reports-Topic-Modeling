<sentence id="s0">
 
1 By notice of appeal filed on 9 March 2007, the appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Riley given on 21 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In that judgment, her Honour dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal rejecting the appellant's claim to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The basis upon which the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to review was the failure of the appellant to appear on the day of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Her Honour invoked r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She included in the orders dismissing the application a notation to the effect that pursuant to r 16.05(2)(a) the Court may vary or set aside a judgment or order made in the absence of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">She did not consider the case on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The respondent Minister has filed a notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That notice contends that the decision given on 21 February 2007 is an interlocutory judgment and accordingly not subject to appeal as of right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Further, pursuant to O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision, and the appellant must also obtain an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">No application for leave to appeal has been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Attempts have been made to contact the appellant in recent weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Save for the provision of a letter addressed to an officer of the Court, faxed on 17 May 2007, there has been no communication from the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In particular, in breach of directions given on 19 March 2007, no written submissions have been filed on behalf of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 When the matter was called on for hearing this morning, there was no appearance by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The explanation may lie in the letter dated 17 May 2007 which says that the appellant is unable to come to the hearing today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">It refers to a medical certificate as being attached for the attention of the Court and requests that the matter be adjourned to another date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">There was, however, no medical certificate attached to the letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Curiously, the appellant is not alone in being unwell, and unable to attend Court this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Two other persons, each of whom is associated with the appellant, and whose cases were dealt with by the Federal Magistrate at the same time as that of the appellant, have also failed to comply with Court directions, and have also provided letters indicating that they are sick, and unable to attend Court today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Those letters again referred to medical certificates as being attached, but only one of the letters in fact provided such a certificate which was pro forma in nature and, as I have found, worthless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The objection to competency is plainly well taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">Pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be brought from such a decision without leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 It follows that the objection to competency will be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">The purported notice of appeal filed 9 March 2007 will be struck out as incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The appellant will pay the first respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">Associate:
