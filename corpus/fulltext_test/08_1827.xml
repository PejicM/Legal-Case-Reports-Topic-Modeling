<sentence id="s0">
 
1 The respondent has recently changed its name to Sunaone Pty Ltd.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Under its former name GMCA Pty Ltd it was found to have infringed Black &amp; Decker's standard and innovation patents: Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) 76 IPR 99.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">I subsequently ordered that Black &amp; Decker's costs be the subject of a gross sum order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules : Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 1737.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 For this exercise the Court appointed Ms Margaret Gourlay of the Law Institute of Victoria's Costing Service as a court expert under O 34.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">In a very limited time Ms Gourlay provided a comprehensive and detailed report for which the Court is grateful.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">3 The respondent retained Mr Allan McGregor, a solicitor, who provided a report commenting on Ms Gourlay's report.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">Both gave evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">As is often the practice in such matters, Deputy District Registrar Tim Luxton sat with me to provide the benefit of his practical experience in taxation of costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">4 The relevant principles and details of previous cases where O 62 r 4(2)(c) gross sum assessments have been made are summarised by Sackville J in Seven Network News Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 2059 at [25] - [34] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">I incorporate that passage in these reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">5 Mr McGregor identified 10 items where he disagreed with Ms Gourlay's assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">With one exception, it seemed to me that Ms Gourlay had taken quite a conservative approach and that her opinion should be accepted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">The one exception was in relation to expert witness fees where the fees paid were very much in excess of the scale rate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">I thought the sum suggested by Ms Gourlay should be reduced by $33,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 The net result is that I assess the gross sum at $825,000.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">By way of a check, this sum is roughly half of the amount actually paid by Black &amp; Decker, so that gives additional comfort that the gross sum assessed is not excessive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 Black &amp; Decker elected to take an account of profits, which were duly assessed at $77,275.10: Black &amp; Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] FCA 1738.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Under O 62 r 36A where a party is awarded judgment for less than $100,000 for a money sum or damages any costs ordered to be paid will be "reduced by one-third of the amount otherwise allowable under this Order unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders".</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">A gross sum would be an amount "allowable" under O 62.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">8 I am satisfied the Court should otherwise order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The case was a substantial one concerning patent and design infringement and validity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The trial ran for seven days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There was substantial expert evidence and no less than 45 pieces of prior art advanced at various times by the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">9 Practically speaking, Black &amp; Decker had no alternative to commencing this proceeding in the Federal Court or some other "prescribed court" --- i.e.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; see Patents Act 1990 (Cth) s 120(1) and the definition of "prescribed court" in Sch 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Such a proceeding could have been brought in "another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter".</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">However the Federal Magistrates Court is not such a court, nor is the County Court of Victoria, although it may have jurisdiction to determine patent infringement issues in the course of other proceedings: AR Jamieson Investments Pty Ltd v Robak Engineering &amp; Construction Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 69 ; Bucknell D, Beattie K, Goatcher A, Rofe H, Australian Patent Law (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2004) at 186.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">10 The respondent, which vigorously prosecuted a cross-claim for revocation of Black &amp; Decker's patents and design, can hardly complain that the present proceeding was commenced in a "prescribed court", being the only court in which a revocation proceeding could be brought: Patents Act s 138 ; see LED Builders Pty Ltd v Hope [1994] FCA 1353 ; (1994) 53 FCR 10 at [17] ; Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd v Metro on George Pty Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 57 at [8]-[9]; Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [203] ; Axe Australasia Pty Ltd v Australume Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 844 at [6] ; Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at [32].</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">11 The injunctive and non-monetary relief (declaratory, validity certificates and delivery up) granted in addition to the account of profits was significant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Associate:
