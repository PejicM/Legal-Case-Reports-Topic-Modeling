<sentence id="s0">
 
1 Mr David has a grievance with the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">The grievance stems from his concern that the Tribunal has not dealt with a complaint he lodged with it to the effect that the trustee of his superannuation fund has not credited his superannuation accounts with the correct figures.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 Mr David filed an application under s 7(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) in this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">His concern is that the Tribunal has not made a decision dealing with his complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">He claims to be aggrieved by the failure of the Tribunal to make a decision on the matters raised in his complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Mr David named the chairperson of the Tribunal as the second respondent and MLC Nominees Pty Ltd as the third respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">MLC is the trustee of Mr David's superannuation fund.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">3 Sundberg J transferred the application to the Federal Magistrates Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The application was heard by Federal Magistrate Phipps on 9 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">On 22 December 2005 his Honour published reasons of judgment dismissing the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The issue for determination in this proceeding is whether his Honour erred in holding that the Tribunal had not failed to make a decision, or delayed unreasonably in making a decision, in relation to Mr David's complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">4 The Federal Magistrate noted that Mr David lodged his complaint with the Tribunal on 8 February 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">His Honour also noted the following relevant events, amongst others:
 
 &#8226; 14 February 2005 --- The Tribunal received a Registration of Complaint Form from Mr David;
 &#8226; 28 February 2005 --- the Assistant Director of the Tribunal allocated the complaint file to a Complaints Analyst;
 &#8226; 1 March 2005 --- the Complaints Analyst issued a notice under s 17 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) to Mr David and the trustee of his superannuation fund;
 &#8226; 12 April, 20 May and 5 July 2005 --- the Tribunal requested certain information from the trustee;
 &#8226; 1 August 2005 --- the Tribunal wrote to Mr David advising him that his complaint was still being investigated and that it had asked for information from the trustee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">&#8226; 3 August 2005 --- the Complaints Analyst completed the Complaint Report and provided it to the Director for action;
 &#8226; Later in August 2005, the Tribunal sought legal advice concerning whether the subject matter of Mr David's complaint was beyond the power of the Tribunal to investigate; and
 &#8226; On 25 August 2005 Mr David's application was served on the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">

5 Since 25 August 2005, the Tribunal has not been able to deal with the complaint due to the operation of s 20 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">6 Section 20(1) of that Act provides:
 
 "The Tribunal cannot deal with a complaint if a proceeding has been begun in a court about the subject matter of the complaint and the proceeding has not been finally disposed of.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">" 
 

7 The Tribunal was in the course of investigating the complaint by seeking information from the trustee and seeking advice as to the extent of its powers in relation to the complaint when Mr David filed his proceeding, the subject of this appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">The filing of that proceeding ensured that the Tribunal could not take any further step to investigate the complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">It was Mr David's own action in bringing his application which has resulted in nothing further happening in relation to his complaint.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The filing of the instant appeal has further prolonged the delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">8 The Court below correctly determined that the Tribunal had not failed to make a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">It also correctly determined that the Tribunal had not engaged in unreasonable delay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The only delays which occurred between the lodging of the complaint and the filing of the application arose as a consequence of the time taken for the trustee to respond to the Tribunal's requests for information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">9 For the above reasons, I consider that the Federal Magistrate made no legal error in dismissing Mr David's application under s 7 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The evidence before his Honour did not establish that the Tribunal had failed to make a decision but rather that Mr David's own action stymied its efforts to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">The evidence before the Federal Magistrate also did not disclose any unreasonable delay by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">10 It is appropriate to dismiss the appeal insofar as it affects the first and second respondents.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The Court dismissed the appeal against the third respondent on 14 March 2006 when it upheld its notice of motion to strike out the appeal insofar as it affected MLC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">The Court made that order because it considered MLC to be an unnecessary party to the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">11 On 14 March 2006 the Court ordered that Mr David pay MLC's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">No further costs order is necessary as the remaining respondents took no active part in the appeal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">12 The Court will order that the appeal is dismissed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Associate:

Dated: 7 April 2006


 The appellant appeared for himself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">There was no appearance by the 1 st or 2 nd Respondents 
 
 Date of Hearing: 7 April 2006
