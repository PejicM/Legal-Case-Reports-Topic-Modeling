<sentence id="s0">
 
1 By notice of appeal filed on 8 March 2007, the appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Riley given on 21 February 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In that judgment, her Honour dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal rejecting the appellant's claim to a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">2 The basis upon which the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to review was the failure of the appellant to appear on the day of the hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Her Honour invoked r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">She included in the orders dismissing the application a notation to the effect that pursuant to r 16.05(2)(a) the Court may vary or set aside a judgment or order made in the absence of a party.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">She did not consider the case on its merits.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">3 The respondent Minister has filed a notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">That notice contends that the decision given on 21 February 2007 is an interlocutory judgment and accordingly not subject to appeal as of right.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Further, pursuant to O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision, and the applicant must also obtain an extension of time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">No application for leave to appeal has been sought.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">4 Attempts have been made to contact the appellant in recent weeks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">Save for the provision of a letter addressed to the Registrar of the Court, faxed on 17 May 2007 together with a medical certificate dated 16 May 2007, there has been no communication from the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">In particular, in breach of directions given on 19 March 2007, no written submissions have been filed on behalf of the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">5 When the matter was called on for hearing this morning, there was no appearance by the appellant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">The explanation may lie in the medical certificate which says simply that the appellant attended a medical practitioner on 16 May 2007 and was considered to be "unfit for work" on 17 and 18 May 2007.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The certificate is a pro forma, and contains no information of any kind as to the nature or gravity of the appellant's condition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">His letter to the Registrar asserts that he is sick and unable to attend the Court, and requests that the matter be adjourned to another date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">6 Curiously, the appellant is not alone in being unwell, and unable to attend Court this morning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Two other persons, each of whom is associated with the appellant, and whose cases were dealt with by the Federal Magistrate at the same time as that of the appellant, have also failed to comply with Court directions, and have also provided letters indicating that they are sick, and unable to attend Court today.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">The letters referred to medical certificates as being attached, but none were in fact provided.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The medical certificate tells the Court nothing about the seriousness of the condition, and whether it is really likely to prevent the appellant from going to Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">There may be conditions that preclude someone attending work, but do not preclude the person attending Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">I regard the certificate as worthless.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">See generally MZWIK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 per Sundberg J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">8 The objection to competency is plainly well taken.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">Pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be brought from such a decision without leave.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">9 It follows that the objection to competency will be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The purported notice of appeal filed on 8 March 2007 will be struck out as incompetent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The appellant will pay the first respondent's costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">Associate:
