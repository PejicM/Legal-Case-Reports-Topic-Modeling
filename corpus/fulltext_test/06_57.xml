1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 27 October 2005 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal").</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On 10 December 2003, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("the Minister") refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The essence of the appellant's claim was that he was a Christian, a member of a particular Christian group called "Huhan" and was at risk of persecution in his country of nationality (the People's Republic of China) because of his Christian beliefs, together with his practising of the Christian faith.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">2 The appellant submitted certain material to the delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">By reference to that material, the delegate refused to grant the protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">The appellant sought a review of that decision by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">He resubmitted the same material to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The Tribunal notified him that on the basis of the material it then had, it could not make a decision in his favour.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The appellant was invited to appear before the Tribunal but declined to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The fact that the invitation took place through his migration agent appears to be irrelevant in the circumstances of this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal was not satisfied on the material before it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his religion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">3 In the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court no issue of substance was identified by the appellant and the Federal Magistrate was correct in dismissing the application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">However, in this appeal, counsel for the Minister has properly drawn attention to a potential argument available to the appellant concerning the operation of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The point raised by the Minister's counsel is one of substance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">I proceed on the basis that the application as originally filedand the notice of appeal raised this point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">4 In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal referred to two matters, particulars of which were not provided under s 424A.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">The first concerns the appellant's ability to leave China, which he did twice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">This was seen by the Tribunal as indicating that the appellant was not of interest to the Chinese authorities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The second matter concerned his having travelled to New Zealand before coming to Australia, having not claimed asylum in New Zealand and having only claimed asylum on his third visit to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">Broadly described, both appear to involve information on which s 424 would operate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">5 Additionally, these two matters appear to form part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">However, on a balanced reading of the decision, the Tribunal appears to have concluded that, on the material before it, the appellant had not made good his claim that he had been a Christian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The Tribunal rejected this claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">While the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion would have been fortified by the use it made of the information to which I earlier referred, the Tribunal's decision could have simply been founded on the conclusion that the appellant had failed to establish that he was a Christian.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">6 The approach of North J in VBAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965 is apt.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">In circumstances where the Tribunal's decision is based on alternative reasons and grounds, relief would not issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">It is unnecessary to deal with an additional argument put by the Minister that even if relief would otherwise issue the Court should not grant it, as a matter of discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Moore.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Associate:
