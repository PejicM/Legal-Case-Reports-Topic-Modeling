<text>53 The consequence of such an order, if made, would have been to order that the documents produced by the Second Respondent to the Authority under compulsion of law were not to be returned to the Second Respondent but to the Applicant. This may have been a reason why the Second Respondent was joined as a party to the present proceedings. In most cases it will be the party upon whom a notice has been served requiring the production of documents who will be the party seeking that the notice be set aside: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Limited [2003] FCA 601 , 129 FCR 298. Similarly, an applicant will be the entity whose premises are being compulsorily accessed: see, eg, Citibank Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 83 ALR 144 ; on appeal, see Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Limited (1989) 20 FCR 403.</text>

<tocase>Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/57.html</AustLII>
<text>45 Moreover, the assertion of the Motor Trades Association that " it was plain beyond doubt that the documents sought were the Trustee's own books and records " is rejected. It is an assertion which, even if accepted, exposes no error of law in the approach adopted by the Authority and, in any event, is an assertion not established on the facts: Breen v Williams [1995] HCA 63 , 186 CLR 71 at 88 9 per Dawson and Toohey JJ.

46 A further ground separately addressed in oral submissions (albeit frankly accepted by Counsel for the Applicant as not being the strongest of the Grounds of Review ) was that of unreasonableness. Although it is a ground frequently relied upon, and perhaps has been given a more tightly confined application than it may legitimately have, it is nevertheless a ground which tends to be relied upon indiscriminately. To do so adds little to such prospects of success as a judicial review application may otherwise have and only invites consideration as to whether an applicant is essentially inviting the Court to embark upon an impermissible review of the merits of the decision. If unreasonableness is to be relied upon as a ground of review, careful consideration should be given by such an applicant as to whether it is a viable basis upon which a decision may separately be impugned.

47 Reliance upon the ground of unreasonableness in the present proceedings is but an instance of the Applicant seeking to propel the Court into a review of the merits of the decision of the Authority. The ground is rejected. It adds nothing and only detracts from the primary ground of review -- namely error of law.</text>

<tocase>Collier Garland Properties Pty Ltd v O'Hair [1964] NSWR 775</tocase>
<text>22 Some reliance was sought to be placed by the Applicant upon the decision of Hardie J in Collier Garland Properties Pty Ltd v O'Hair [1964] NSWR 775. In issue in that case was the following provision of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW):
 
 171 
 ...
 (2) Every officer and agent of a corporation the affairs of which are being investigated under this Division shall if required by an inspector appointed under this Division produce to the inspector all books and documents in his custody or power and shall give to the inspector all assistance in connection with the investigation which he is reasonably able to give.
 (3) An inspector may, by notice in the prescribed form, require any officer or agent of any corporation whose affairs are being investigated pursuant to this Division to appear for examination on oath or affirmation (which he is hereby authorised to administer) in relation to its business; and the notice may require the production of all books and documents in the custody or under the control of that officer or agent.
 ...
 

Of this provision Hardie J concluded at 780:
 
 ... The point is by no means free from doubt. On the whole I have come to the conclusion that s 171 (3) empowers the inspectors to inspect and examine the books at the place at which their production has been required and given, and contemplates that when such inspection and examination at that place is completed the books and documents shall remain there and revert to the possession and control of the person to whom the notice was given. ...

23 For present purposes, it may be accepted that such power as may be conferred by statute to compel the production of documents may at some point in time become exhausted. An investigation, for example, may have concluded that thereafter there is no power to acquire further documents and (arguably) no power to retain documents previously acquired. Any statutory power is conferred for a purpose and, once that purpose has been fulfilled, questions inevitably arise as to the return of the documents previously produced. But the fact that such questions arise, it is considered, does not support any conclusion that any decision to return documents (or not to return documents) is a decision necessarily taken pursuant to the statutory provision authorising a regulator to compel production. Each decision must inevitably be considered in the statutory context (if any) within which it may be made.

24 In summary, the decision of the Authority not to return the documents in the manner sought by the Applicant is not a decision made under, or pursuant, to s 255. The decision of Hardie J in Collier Garland Properties is no authority to the contrary.

25 The decision of the Authority did not " alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations ". Whatever legal rights that the Authority may have as against Mr Rickus in respect of the documents produced by him pursuant to the s 255 notice, and whatever may be his obligations vis &agrave; vis the Motor Trades Association, they remain. If the documents are the documents of the Trustee, any decision of the Authority has not affected that position.

26 Section 56 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act does not expressly or impliedly require or authorise any decision to be made. It is a section which creates an offence for " protected information " or for a " protected document " to be disclosed (s 56(2)) and further sets forth those disclosures which are not an offence (s 56(3) and s 56(4)). Any decision not to return documents is not a decision made " under " this provision.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/49.html</AustLII>
<text>20 Section 255 and other like provisions confer a power to require the production of documents. The exercise of powers requiring the compulsory production of books should be carefully scrutinised by the Courts: Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 , 213 CLR 543 at 596. Justice Callinan there observed:
 
 [143] ... Creatures of the Executive of which this respondent is one are increasingly being armed with broader and more intrusive powers. That they are of these kinds requires, if anything, that the true and permissible ambit of the intrusion be carefully scrutinized and not be extended unnecessarily or in the teeth of unabridged (by legislation) fundamental, longstanding rights. ...

21 But s 255 does not expressly authorise the return of documents so produced. Nor does it impliedly do so. What happens to documents produced pursuant to s 255 and their subsequent return is simply not a subject-matter dealt with by that provision. It may be that the legislature should direct attention to the return of documents compulsorily acquired. It is not considered, however, that s 255 is the source of any authority pursuant to which the present decision of the First Respondent was taken.</text>

<text>29 Nor can reliance be placed by the Applicant upon s 11 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act as the source of the authority pursuant to which the decision was taken. A power of the kind conferred by s 11 does not authorise or require the making of any decision: cf Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269 at 272; Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133. As observed by the Full Court in Salerno , at 143:
 
 If a general authorisation in a statute for a decision by an organisation set up under that legislation is sufficient to make it a decision under the statute, and thus open to judicial review, every intra vires action of that organisation that has decisional effect and every kind of conduct engaged in by it for the purpose of making a decision will be examinable by the court. The potential for massive disruption of the organisation's activities that would be the consequence of such a conclusion is manifest.

<tocase>Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39 ; (1971) 124 CLR 367</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1971/39.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The fact that those statutory provisions must be construed does not of itself satisfy the requirement that the controversy or dispute between the parties must " arise under any law made by the Parliament ": Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39 ; (1971) 124 CLR 367. The then Chief Justice observed at 374:
 
 The critical question in the case is whether the defence did involve the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the Supreme Court. It would do so if the matter before the Supreme Court became or involved by reason of the defence raised to the applicant's claim, either wholly or partly a matter arising under a law made by the Parliament, in this case the Matrimonial Causes Act : see Constitution s. 76(ii) and Judiciary Act s. 39(2). Further the matter arising under a law of the Parliament will have arisen if the suit could have been disposed of by deciding the matter, whether or not the suit was so disposed of : cf. Nelungaloo Pty . Ltd . v . The Commonwealth [1952] HCA 11 ; [(1952) 85 CLR 545] ; The Commonwealth v . Bank of New South Wales [(1949) 79 CLR 497]. It is of course not enough that a law made by the Parliament must be construed in the course of the decision of the case. There must be a matter arising under a law of the Parliament. The contrast between the language of s. 76(i.) and 76 (ii.) is relevant in this connexion. The point at which interpretation of the federal statute, prima facie an apparently incidental consideration, may give rise to a matter arising under the statute is not readily expressed in universally valid terms. But the distinction between the two situations must be maintained.
 

Justice Walsh further observed at 408 9:
 
 A comparison between the terms of s. 76(i.) and those of s. 76(ii.) of the Constitution indicates that a distinction is to be drawn between a matter "arising under" a law of the Parliament and a matter which involves the interpretation of such a law. The fact that the interpretation of a law is involved does not necessarily mean that there is a matter arising under the law. But, in my opinion, there is a matter arising under the law if the source of the right claimed by the plaintiff or applicant or the source of a defence which asserts that the defendant or respondent is immune from the liability or obligation alleged against him is a law of the Parliament. I think that that view of what constitutes a matter arising under a law of the Parliament is in conformity with the statements made in R . v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration ; Ex parte Barrett [1945] HCA 50 ; [(1945) 70 CLR 141] by Latham C.J. and by McTiernan J. [(1945) 70 CLR, at p 173]. There Latham C.J. said: "If a right claimed is conferred by or under a federal statute, the claim arises under the statute" [(1945) 70 CLR, at p 154]. Likewise, in my opinion, if the answer made to a claim is that the defendant is free from the obligation asserted against him and that this freedom is conferred by an Act of the Parliament, the defence arises under that Act and the result is that there is before the Court a "matter" which arises under that Act. ...
 

And Gibbs J, as his Honour then was, observed at 416:
 
 ... I regard it as now settled that a matter cannot be said to arise under a law made by the Parliament within s. 76 (ii.) simply because to decide the matter it is necessary to consider or construe the law. To adapt some of the language used in James v . South Australia [1927] HCA 32 ; [(1927) 40 CLR 1 at 40], in relation to s. 30 of the Judiciary Act , it may be said that a matter arises under a law made by the Parliament when a right, title, privilege or immunity is claimed under that law. A right, title privilege or immunity may be claimed under a law, either because the law is the source of the right, title, privilege or immunity or because the right, title, privilege or immunity can only be enforced by virtue of the law.

40 The point at which interpretation of a federal statute may give rise to a matter arising under that statute is " not readily expressed in universally valid terms ". But the distinction between the two situations, it has been said, must be maintained: Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39 ; (1971) 124 CLR 367 at 374 per Barwick CJ.

41 Section 39B(1A)(c) does not confer jurisdiction on this Court to review the decisions of the Authority.

42 The conclusion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the Amended Application renders it unnecessary to separately consider whether or not any Ground of Review has otherwise been established by the Applicant. As the question was briefly addressed, some limited comments may nevertheless be appropriate.</text>

<tocase>Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 , 221 CLR 99</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/7.html</AustLII>
<text>13 Considerable care, of course, needs to be exercised in too rigidly approaching the definition in s 3 as having three discrete elements, namely that there be a " decision ", that that decision be of an " administrative character ", and that it be made " under an enactment ": Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 , 221 CLR 99 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. Their Honours there observed:
 
 [60] The cases, particularly in the Federal Court, have tended to see these as discrete elements. But there are dangers in looking at the definition as other than a whole. The interrelation between them appears from the following passage in the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [(1990) 170 CLR 321 at 377] respecting the ADJR Act: 
 It does not follow that, because s 5 is not confined to acts involving the exercise of or a refusal to exercise a substantive power, the acts which constitute a decision reviewable under s 5 of [the ADJR Act] are at large. They are confined by the requirement in s 3(1) that they be made 'under an enactment'. A decision under an enactment is one required by, or authorized by, an enactment. The decision may be expressly or impliedly required or authorized. If an enactment requires that a particular finding be made as a condition precedent to the exercise of or refusal to exercise a substantive power, a finding to that effect is readily characterized as a decision 'under an enactment'. However, it is otherwise with respect to findings which are not themselves required by an enactment but merely bear upon some issue for determination or some issue relevant to the exercise of a discretion. Findings of that nature are not themselves 'decisions under an enactment'; they are merely findings on the way to a decision under an enactment. (citations omitted)
 

Their Honours later went on to conclude:
 
 [89] The determination of whether a decision is "made ... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment. A decision will only be "made ... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met. It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise. Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question. Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.

14 The " enactment " pursuant to which any decision made by the Authority has been taken is identified in the Amended Application as being either s 255 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) or s 56(4) of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 (Cth). Written submissions filed on behalf of the Applicant also placed reliance upon s 11 of the 1998 Act. The Respondents contend that there has been no decision " under an enactment "; any decision made, it is contended, does not " alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations ".

15 No submission was advanced by the Authority contending that its August and December 2007 letters did not constitute a " decision " within the meaning of s 3(2) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act .

33 The term " matter " as used in s 39B has the same meaning that it has in ss 75 , 76 and 77 of the Constitution : Commonwealth v Lyon [2003] FCAFC 284 at [24] , [2003] FCAFC 284 ; 133 FCR 265 at 272 per Branson, Madgwick and Hely JJ. The term " matter ", it has been said, " requires some immediate right, duty or liability to be established by the court ": Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 at [90] , [2005] HCA 7 ; 221 CLR 99 at 131 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ.</text>

50 Notwithstanding the fact that no satisfactory explanation has been advanced as to why these proceedings were commenced approximately five months out of time, the fact remains that, prior to the commencement of these proceedings, the Applicant had repeatedly asserted its entitlement to have the documents returned to it.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/56.html</AustLII>
<text>27 Reliance by the Applicant upon Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 , 178 CLR 408 is misplaced. In issue in those proceedings was the disclosure of transcripts of examinations conducted pursuant to s 19 of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth). Section 25(3) authorised the Commission to give to persons a copy of a written record of an examination. Section 127(1) required the Commission to " take all reasonable measures to protect from unauthorised use or disclosure information given to it in confidence in or in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers ". Section 127(4)(b) authorised the disclosure of information where it would " enable or assist the government, or an agency, of a State or Territory to perform a function or exercise a power ". These statutory provisions, it is considered, stand in contrast to s 56(4) of the 1998 Act. The provisions in issue in Johns authorised the giving to persons of written copies of an examination. There is no such counterpart provision in the 1998 Act. Although, as observed by Brennan J in Johns, s 25(3) and s 127(4)(b) were both relied upon " as alternative sources of authority to give copies of the transcripts to the Royal Commission ", the " better view may be that s 25(3) was the source of the authority and s 127(4)(b) was a limitation on its exercise ": [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 at 426.

28 Section 56(4) certainly does not expressly authorise the disclosure of information; nor can that provision be construed as impliedly authorising any such decision. The decision or decisions of the Authority were not made under s 56.</text>

39 The fact that those statutory provisions must be construed does not of itself satisfy the requirement that the controversy or dispute between the parties must " arise under any law made by the Parliament ": Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39 ; (1971) 124 CLR 367. The then Chief Justice observed at 374:
 
 The critical question in the case is whether the defence did involve the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the Supreme Court. It would do so if the matter before the Supreme Court became or involved by reason of the defence raised to the applicant's claim, either wholly or partly a matter arising under a law made by the Parliament, in this case the Matrimonial Causes Act : see Constitution s. 76(ii) and Judiciary Act s. 39(2). Further the matter arising under a law of the Parliament will have arisen if the suit could have been disposed of by deciding the matter, whether or not the suit was so disposed of : cf. Nelungaloo Pty . Ltd . v . The Commonwealth [1952] HCA 11 ; [(1952) 85 CLR 545] ; The Commonwealth v . Bank of New South Wales [(1949) 79 CLR 497]. It is of course not enough that a law made by the Parliament must be construed in the course of the decision of the case. There must be a matter arising under a law of the Parliament. The contrast between the language of s. 76(i.) and 76 (ii.) is relevant in this connexion. The point at which interpretation of the federal statute, prima facie an apparently incidental consideration, may give rise to a matter arising under the statute is not readily expressed in universally valid terms. But the distinction between the two situations must be maintained.
 

Justice Walsh further observed at 408 9:
 
 A comparison between the terms of s. 76(i.) and those of s. 76(ii.) of the Constitution indicates that a distinction is to be drawn between a matter "arising under" a law of the Parliament and a matter which involves the interpretation of such a law. The fact that the interpretation of a law is involved does not necessarily mean that there is a matter arising under the law. But, in my opinion, there is a matter arising under the law if the source of the right claimed by the plaintiff or applicant or the source of a defence which asserts that the defendant or respondent is immune from the liability or obligation alleged against him is a law of the Parliament. I think that that view of what constitutes a matter arising under a law of the Parliament is in conformity with the statements made in R . v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration ; Ex parte Barrett [1945] HCA 50 ; [(1945) 70 CLR 141] by Latham C.J. and by McTiernan J. [(1945) 70 CLR, at p 173]. There Latham C.J. said: "If a right claimed is conferred by or under a federal statute, the claim arises under the statute" [(1945) 70 CLR, at p 154]. Likewise, in my opinion, if the answer made to a claim is that the defendant is free from the obligation asserted against him and that this freedom is conferred by an Act of the Parliament, the defence arises under that Act and the result is that there is before the Court a "matter" which arises under that Act. ...
 

And Gibbs J, as his Honour then was, observed at 416:
 
 ... I regard it as now settled that a matter cannot be said to arise under a law made by the Parliament within s. 76 (ii.) simply because to decide the matter it is necessary to consider or construe the law. To adapt some of the language used in James v . South Australia [1927] HCA 32 ; [(1927) 40 CLR 1 at 40], in relation to s. 30 of the Judiciary Act , it may be said that a matter arises under a law made by the Parliament when a right, title, privilege or immunity is claimed under that law. A right, title privilege or immunity may be claimed under a law, either because the law is the source of the right, title, privilege or immunity or because the right, title, privilege or immunity can only be enforced by virtue of the law.</text>

<tocase>Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133</tocase>
<text>29 Nor can reliance be placed by the Applicant upon s 11 of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act as the source of the authority pursuant to which the decision was taken. A power of the kind conferred by s 11 does not authorise or require the making of any decision: cf Hutchins v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 269 at 272; Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133. As observed by the Full Court in Salerno , at 143:
 
 If a general authorisation in a statute for a decision by an organisation set up under that legislation is sufficient to make it a decision under the statute, and thus open to judicial review, every intra vires action of that organisation that has decisional effect and every kind of conduct engaged in by it for the purpose of making a decision will be examinable by the court. The potential for massive disruption of the organisation's activities that would be the consequence of such a conclusion is manifest.

<tocase>Transport Workers Union v Lee (1998) 84 FCR 60 </tocase>
<text>32 No reliance is placed by the Applicant upon s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) conferring jurisdiction upon this Court. Reliance, however, is placed upon s 39B(1A)(c). That provision is as follows:
 
 (1A) The original jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia also includes jurisdiction in any matter: 
 ...
 (c) arising under any laws made by the Parliament, other than a matter in respect of which a criminal prosecution is instituted or any other criminal matter. 
 

This provision is " relevantly identical to s 76(ii) of the Constitution ": Transport Workers Union v Lee (1998) 84 FCR 60 at 65. Black CJ, Ryan and Goldberg JJ there observed that: 
 
 ... the identity of language suggests that the Parliament intended to exercise its power under s 77(i) of the Constitution to confer upon the Federal Court the same potential original jurisdiction as might be conferred upon the High Court of Australia under s 76(ii) [of the Constitution ]. ...</text>
