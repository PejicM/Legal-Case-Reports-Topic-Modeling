<text>42 A like comment may be made in respect to paragraphs [2], [3] and [4] of the Subpoena directed to Simpsons Solicitors. Paragraph [3] of that Subpoena employs the language of documents " that refer or relate to " a particular document -- as does paragraph [8] of the Subpoena to Jordan Djundja Lawyers. Again, properly construed, it is not considered that those paragraphs are oppressive. The use of the phrase " relating to " in a subpoena does not necessarily mean that the subpoena has been drafted too widely or is otherwise oppressive: cf Lucas Industries Ltd v Hewitt (1978) 45 FLR 174 at 192 per Smithers J. Paragraph [3] of the Simpsons Solicitors Subpoena , when read in its entirety, is confined to the circumstances in which the Affidavit of Mr Kiriakidis of 22 April 2008 was sworn. The confined nature of the documents required to be produced in answer to paragraph [3] is not rendered oppressive by reason simply of the use of phrases such as " relating to " or " without limitation ". The use of those phrases is in a context where the person upon whom the Subpoena has been served is not required to form a view as to whether other documents " relate to " a particular subject-matter (cf Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 573 per Jordan CJ); the task is confined to locating those documents " relating to " a particular document. In Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 929 Waddell J relevantly observed:
 Use of expressions such as "relating to" need not result in there being any oppression or abuse of process. It all depends on the context in which the expression is used. For instance, it could hardly be said to be objectionable to require a person to produce all "invoices" relating to sales of a particular item to the defendant on a particular day. The use of the word "invoices" would restrict the potential width of the expression "relating to". Similarly, in American Express Warehousing Ltd v Doe [1967] 1 Lloyd's Rep 222, the Court of Appeal held that a requirement to produce the "contract slips" and "quote slips" relating to each of a number of insurances was not objectionable. A much more complicated set of circumstances in which use of the expression "related to" was held not to be objectionable appears in the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in Lucas Industries Ltd v Hewitt (1978) 45 FLR 174; 18 ALR 555. ...</text>

<text>38 When considering whether or not a subpoena has been issued for a legitimate forensic purpose, it is sufficient if the material sought to be subpoenaed has some " apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings " that is " adjectival ": Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 103 per Beaumont J. Relevance which is purely " speculative " will not suffice: Mandic v Phillis [2005] FCA 1279 at [36] , [2005] FCA 1279 ; 225 ALR 760. Conti J there noted Beaumont J's reference in Arnotts to the judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486 at 502 and continued:
 [35] Drawing on Deane and Gaudron JJ's above dicta, Beaumont J next stated that the determination of whether a subpoena was issued for a legitimate forensic purpose depends not just on an analysis of the motive of the issuing party, but also on the impact of the subpoena on the party upon whom it is served. His Honour enumerated two questions to be asked (at ALR 103 of his reasons for judgment): (1) Does the material sought have an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings, that is, is adjectival, as distinct from substantive, relevance established? Does the subpoena have a legitimate forensic purpose to this extent? This involves a consideration of the matter from the standpoint of [the issuing party]. (2) Is the subpoena seriously and unfairly burdensome or prejudicial? This is to look at the matter from the point of view of [the party subpoenaed]. [36] His Honour (at ALR 103) referred to the meaning of "apparent relevance" in the following terms: The test of adjectival relevance is satisfied if the material has apparent relevance. In my opinion, the documentation called for here could possibly throw light on the issues in the main case. In my opinion, adjectival relevance is established. In Kimberley Homes at 115 16, Hill J referred with approval to Beaumont J's test for relevance and emphasised that it was not necessary for the court to determine whether the documentation or material, the subject of the subpoena, would be admissible in any final hearing of the proceedings. Although it is not necessary for the material to meet the standards of relevance required of evidence adduced at trial, Hill J considered that it was appropriate to have regard to the issues in dispute, as they appeared in the pleadings. In Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Cmr for Taxation (1997) 37 ATR 432 , Spender J also considered Beaumont J's test of "adjectival relevance" and explained it (at 439) as follows: Notwithstanding the use of the word "possibly" in this paragraph, in my opinion, that word is not used in any speculative sense. I take his Honour's conclusion expressed in that paragraph as an acquiescence to the correctness of the submission that the material sought could reasonably be expected to throw light on some of the issues in the principal proceedings. It is not a question of looking at the documents to see if the documents might permit a case to be made. As is the case presently before the court, Spender J was there concerned with a submission that a request for documents (contained in a summons) amounted to merely a "fishing expedition".</text>

<tocase>Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/23.html</AustLII>
<text>50 Notwithstanding the circumstances in which the orders were made, on 14 July 2008 the unusual course of permitting cross-examination was again raised with Counsel for the Applicants and, more relevantly, Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis. Reference was made to the observations of Menzies J in Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341. Counsel for Mr Kiriakidis requested, and was granted, a short adjournment to obtain further instructions in light of reference being made to the unusual course being pursued. The cross-examination thereafter continued without any submissions being advanced on his behalf. As events unfolded, it was probably the only effective means whereby the Applicants could have exposed what they believed were inadequacies in the existing discovery as provided particularly by the Fourth Respondent. As a result of the cross-examination, the Applicants were proved right. An order requiring a further affidavit to be filed in respect to particular documents, without knowledge of the manifest deficiencies in the existing discovery, may well have proved as ineffective as the discovery previously provided.

51 At least two observations need to be made.

52 First, some evidence given during cross-examination was that documents had been destroyed. As explained by Mr Kiriakidis, the destruction of documents occurred by reason of either:
 
&#8226; such records as had been kept by Mr Kiriakidis being stored in boxes in a room behind a caf&eacute; where he was then residing, and being thrown out when he was in Greece for a period of six months from July 2006 to January 2007. The owner of the premises was said to have thrown out the boxes when Mr Kiriakidis did not return after what was expected to be only a three month visit; and 
 
&#8226; such other records as may have been maintained being routinely destroyed by employees, upon instructions, at the conclusion of every two week period. Mr Kiriakidis explained his concern as to whether or not the business was illegal and that he did not want records being maintained in such circumstances. Whether or not there was a basis for those concerns was not an issue pursued by Counsel for the Fourth Respondent during his cross-examination. It is a matter, however, which it is expected will emerge as an issue to be resolved at the final hearing.</text>

<tocase>Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/174.html</AustLII>
<text>2 A fourth matter was sought to be raised by way of a Notice of Motion filed by the Fifth Respondent on 31 July 2008 seeking to set aside part of a Notice to Produce served by the Applicants upon the Fifth Respondent. Documents pursuant to that Notice to Produce were produced on 24 July 2008. When such documents as were produced were made available, neither the Court nor the Applicants were told that there were additional documents which, it was later said, also fell within the terms of one of the Subpoenas presently sought to be set aside by the Fifth Respondent and that those documents were being withheld. A notice to produce has the same coercive effect as a subpoena: Federal Court Rules , O 33 r 12; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [4] per Sackville J. The procedure to be followed when there is a " call " upon a notice to produce has been long-settled: Glass H (ed), Seminars on Evidence (1969) at 12 18. If documents which fall within a notice are not produced, it is incumbent upon those who have been served with such a notice to unequivocally identify those documents and the reason for their non-production.

3 All other outstanding Motions in the proceeding are to be heard on 11 August 2008. The First Respondent's Notice of Motion filed 31 July 2008 can also be heard on that date. The intent in resolving all outstanding interlocutory matters as quickly as possible is self-evidently to facilitate a final hearing at the earliest possible date. This proceeding has already taken far longer to resolve than is desirable -- or necessary, given the issues in dispute. It is hoped that on 11 August 2008 dates for the final hearing can be fixed for later this year.

4 The relevant orders as to costs against the First, Second and Fourth Respondents as made on 2 April 2008 were as follows:
 12. The First, Second and Fourth Respondents are to file and serve any Affidavit and submissions as to why an order for the payment of the Applicants' costs to date on an indemnity basis payable forthwith should not be made for any particular period from the commencement of this proceeding to date, by 5:00pm on 8 April 2008. 13. If the First, Second and Fourth Respondents do not file and serve an Affidavit and submissions in accordance with Order 12, the First, Second and Fourth Respondents are to pay the Applicants' costs to date on an indemnity basis with such payment to be made forthwith.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1530.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The discretion in respect to costs conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) unquestionably extends to a power to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis. In Sony Computer Entertainment Australia Pty Ltd v Dannoun (No 2) [2001] FCA 1530 , Lindgren J helpfully summarised the approach to be adopted in ordering indemnity costs as follows:
 [4] The question of the circumstances in which costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis has been discussed in many cases, recently in this Court by me in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd (No 11) [2001] FCA 480 and by Katz J in Waverley Council v Refkin Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1469. I will not refer to the various judicial formulations to date of the grounds on which it is proper to award costs on an indemnity basis. It suffices that I acknowledge that the circumstances must be "special", must take the case out of the "ordinary" category of case, and must involve behaviour associated with the conduct of the proceeding by the person sought to be made liable which is so unreasonable as to make it unjust that the other party should be limited in its recovery to party and party costs.

11 Notwithstanding the manner in which the proceeding has been conducted to date, the four factors relied upon by the First, Second and Fourth Respondents to oppose an order for costs on an indemnity basis are:
 
(a) the fact that those Respondents have made " significant admissions ", being admissions in respect to matters previously denied in their Defence but later admitted " consequent on service of evidence by the Applicants ";
 
(b) the conduct of those Respondents in respect to discovery, including the fact that their very consent to the order for cross-examination of the Fourth Respondent is a tacit acknowledgment on their part that the deficiencies therein are sufficient to justify the unusual exercise of the Court's power to permit cross-examination on Affidavits filed in respect to discovery;
 
(c) a contention that such delay as has occurred is " not all ... attributable to the Respondents "; and 
 
(d) a contention that a number of the Affidavits as filed by the Applicants " go predominately [sic] to the assessment of damages " and therefore would have been filed in any event.

12 A review of the materials as filed discloses that the First, Second and Fourth Respondents initially put in issue all aspects of the Applicants' case. They thus disputed (for example) whether the films in issue were " cinematograph film [s]" and the subsistence of copyright in those films and ownership of copyright. These matters were the subject of some admissions on 7 August 2007, but it was only on 2 April 2008 that orders for declaratory and injunctive relief were made by consent.</text>

<text>42 A like comment may be made in respect to paragraphs [2], [3] and [4] of the Subpoena directed to Simpsons Solicitors. Paragraph [3] of that Subpoena employs the language of documents " that refer or relate to " a particular document -- as does paragraph [8] of the Subpoena to Jordan Djundja Lawyers. Again, properly construed, it is not considered that those paragraphs are oppressive. The use of the phrase " relating to " in a subpoena does not necessarily mean that the subpoena has been drafted too widely or is otherwise oppressive: cf Lucas Industries Ltd v Hewitt (1978) 45 FLR 174 at 192 per Smithers J. Paragraph [3] of the Simpsons Solicitors Subpoena , when read in its entirety, is confined to the circumstances in which the Affidavit of Mr Kiriakidis of 22 April 2008 was sworn. The confined nature of the documents required to be produced in answer to paragraph [3] is not rendered oppressive by reason simply of the use of phrases such as " relating to " or " without limitation ". The use of those phrases is in a context where the person upon whom the Subpoena has been served is not required to form a view as to whether other documents " relate to " a particular subject-matter (cf Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 573 per Jordan CJ); the task is confined to locating those documents " relating to " a particular document. In Spencer Motors Pty Ltd v LNC Industries Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 921 at 929 Waddell J relevantly observed:
 Use of expressions such as "relating to" need not result in there being any oppression or abuse of process. It all depends on the context in which the expression is used. For instance, it could hardly be said to be objectionable to require a person to produce all "invoices" relating to sales of a particular item to the defendant on a particular day. The use of the word "invoices" would restrict the potential width of the expression "relating to". Similarly, in American Express Warehousing Ltd v Doe [1967] 1 Lloyd's Rep 222, the Court of Appeal held that a requirement to produce the "contract slips" and "quote slips" relating to each of a number of insurances was not objectionable.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/571.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In Spotwire Pty Ltd v Visa International Service Association (No 2) [2004] FCA 571 Bennett J summarised the principles to be applied when considering an application that costs be paid forthwith. Her Honour observed:
 [104] ... the following principles emerge: &#8226; The general principle is that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded and the rights of the parties have been finally determined. However, O 62 rule 3(3) contemplates that, in certain circumstances, the general principle can be varied, as a matter of the court's discretion. &#8226; The exercise of the discretion should only be exercised where the interests of justice in the particular case require a departure form the general practice. &#8226; The discretion should be exercised in favour or [sic] a party who establishes that the demands of justice require that there be a departure from what appears to be the general practice envisaged by the rule. &#8226; One consideration is the length of time that the proceedings will conclude, in the ordinary course of events. &#8226; Where costs are sought in respect of a successful strike out application, the fact that the unsuccessful party failed to remedy defects despite clear notice of those defects, may make appropriate immediate taxation and payment. &#8226; Costs incurred by reason of an ill-considered pleading may give rise to an exception to the principle that the costs await the final resolution of the issues between the parties. &#8226; In ordinary circumstances, it would be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately, since that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding.

22 The making of declaratory and injunctive orders on 2 April 2008 unquestionably brought that aspect of the claims for relief as against those Respondents to an end. Left to be resolved was a determination of damages.</text>

<text>38 When considering whether or not a subpoena has been issued for a legitimate forensic purpose, it is sufficient if the material sought to be subpoenaed has some " apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings " that is " adjectival ": Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd (1989) 88 ALR 90 at 103 per Beaumont J. Relevance which is purely " speculative " will not suffice: Mandic v Phillis [2005] FCA 1279 at [36] , [2005] FCA 1279 ; 225 ALR 760. Conti J there noted Beaumont J's reference in Arnotts to the judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 166 CLR 486 at 502 and continued:
 [35] Drawing on Deane and Gaudron JJ's above dicta, Beaumont J next stated that the determination of whether a subpoena was issued for a legitimate forensic purpose depends not just on an analysis of the motive of the issuing party, but also on the impact of the subpoena on the party upon whom it is served. His Honour enumerated two questions to be asked (at ALR 103 of his reasons for judgment): (1) Does the material sought have an apparent relevance to the issues in the principal proceedings, that is, is adjectival, as distinct from substantive, relevance established? Does the subpoena have a legitimate forensic purpose to this extent? This involves a consideration of the matter from the standpoint of [the issuing party]. (2) Is the subpoena seriously and unfairly burdensome or prejudicial? This is to look at the matter from the point of view of [the party subpoenaed]. [36] His Honour (at ALR 103) referred to the meaning of "apparent relevance" in the following terms: The test of adjectival relevance is satisfied if the material has apparent relevance. In my opinion, the documentation called for here could possibly throw light on the issues in the main case. In my opinion, adjectival relevance is established. In Kimberley Homes at 115 16, Hill J referred with approval to Beaumont J's test for relevance and emphasised that it was not necessary for the court to determine whether the documentation or material, the subject of the subpoena, would be admissible in any final hearing of the proceedings. Although it is not necessary for the material to meet the standards of relevance required of evidence adduced at trial, Hill J considered that it was appropriate to have regard to the issues in dispute, as they appeared in the pleadings. In Cosco Holdings Pty Ltd v Cmr for Taxation (1997) 37 ATR 432 , Spender J also considered Beaumont J's test of "adjectival relevance" and explained it (at 439) as follows: Notwithstanding the use of the word "possibly" in this paragraph, in my opinion, that word is not used in any speculative sense. I take his Honour's conclusion expressed in that paragraph as an acquiescence to the correctness of the submission that the material sought could reasonably be expected to throw light on some of the issues in the principal proceedings. It is not a question of looking at the documents to see if the documents might permit a case to be made. As is the case presently before the court, Spender J was there concerned with a submission that a request for documents (contained in a summons) amounted to merely a "fishing expedition".</text>
