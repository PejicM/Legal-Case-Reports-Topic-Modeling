<text>6 Despite the narrower scope of pre-action discovery and the different questions to which it relates, an estimation of the strength of a prospective case including consideration of possible defences may be material. Pre-action discovery is only directed to provide evidence sufficient to enable an applicant to decide whether to commence the proceedings . The sufficiency of this evidence need not go so far as to enable the applicant to decide there is a prima facie case or to evaluate the prospects of success on the ultimate hearing at any high level of probability. Pre-action discovery is not designed to enhance or justify a decision which has already been taken to commence proceedings: see Matrix Film Investment One Pty Ltd v Alameda Films LLC [2006] FCA 591. The focus of this form of discovery is on the question whether the requirements of O 15A r 6(a), (b) and (c) have been made out and, if so, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to require production. In discovery after an action has been commenced, the question is whether there are documents relevant to the matters and issues raised on the pleadings, including but not limited to those referred to in O 15 r 2(3). Any determination of an application for pre-action discovery must be made having regard to these considerations.</text>

<tocase>Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd (2005) 142 FCR 429</tocase>
<text>7 There is now no doubt that the Court has power to make an order that a Notice to Produce be issued in a pre-action discovery application if directed to the questions set out in O 15A r 6. However, notwithstanding this power, the Court retains its broad discretion whether to allow a Notice to Produce to stand in whole or in part: see Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428. In that case, as pointed out by Hill J at 438, although the issues in pre-action discovery are very limited, they can give rise to contestable issues of fact which can be the subject of cross-examination. Accordingly, before making a determination, the Court must consider whether the relevant Notice to Produce is limited to the establishment of those matters necessary to be satisfied under the requirements of O 15A r 6. A Notice to Produce like any other litigious measure must not be an abuse of process.</text>

<tocase>St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147</tocase>
<text>8 The relevant principles concerning pre-action discovery are concisely summarised by Hely J in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 153. It is unnecessary to reproduce his Honour's summary, but I have applied those principles in my consideration of the challenge to the present Notice.

9 The Notice to Produce in this application has four parts. The documents sought in the first part (paragraphs [1]-[4]) relate to the determination of issues in the proceedings and conform to the requirements of O 15A r 6. The documents sought in the second and third part (paragraphs [5]-[17] and paragraphs [18]-[20] respectively) relate to matters arising out of Mr Shale's and Mr Keldoulis' affidavits respectively. The documents sought in the fourth part (paragraphs [21]-[24]) relate to other miscellaneous matters.

10 Paragraphs [1]-[4] are relevant and appropriate and need not be struck out. I consider that they are not expressed too broadly because the descriptions of the documents sought are narrowed in each case by the introductory words. In addition, they are related to facts which may be contested on the application. Cross-examination on a suitably controlled basis may be allowed in some circumstances, but this is subject to the discretion of the Court, and extensive cross-examination on pre-action discovery is to be discouraged. As a consequence, it may be appropriate to allow some investigation of the documentary basis for the contention that there have been reasonable inquiries as to the sufficiency of the records and evidence relating to whether Optiver has already made a decision whether to commence proceedings. The making of any decision to commence prior to the O 15A r 6 application is important because pre-action discovery is concerned to identify any material on the basis of which such a decision can be made. If a decision has already been made, the application is not necessary and pre-action discovery will not be granted. I allow paragraphs [1]-[4] of the Notice to Produce.</text>
