<text>9 In purporting to create a contractual obligation by the former member in favour of a third party whether the member voted for or against the scheme or did not vote that clause appears to stretch the effect of an arrangement between a company and its members a long way. However, Lindgren J considered such a clause in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400; 25 ACLC 784; [2007] FCA 770 at [57] [63] with approval and took the same course in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [21] . In Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] QSC 207 Fryberg J considered such a clause at [20] [29]. His Honour was persuaded to change the initial adverse reaction which he had expressed in Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266; (2007) 25 ACLC 163; [2007] QSC 37 at [39] . In this field, it is acknowledged that uniformity of decision is important to avoid unnecessary uncertainty. As I cannot be satisfied that the other decisions are clearly wrong, I should follow them. If, on confirmation of the scheme, a party raises the issue so that an argument with a contradictor takes place, it is possible that a different result would occur. Even if that were so, the scheme could be confirmed without the relevant clause (cf Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) (2006) 58 ACSR 742; [2006] FCA 1203).</text>

<text>7 My attention has been drawn to several aspects of the scheme which have, in the past, caused debate. I am satisfied that there is no relevant performance risk for shareholders. The break fee, no shop and no talk obligations are within reasonable bounds and in accordance with authority ( Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400; (2007) 25 ACLC 784; [2007] FCA 770 at [25] [55]). There is no complication in relation to the scheme itself by reason of the existence of the options which are to be dealt with by another mechanism.

8 The following clause caused me some concern.
 
 "8.2 Scheme Shareholders' agreements and representations 
 
 
 
 (1) The Scheme Shareholders agree to the transfer of their Orion Shares in accordance with the Scheme. 
 
 (2) The Scheme Shareholders are taken to have warranted to M2 and Orion that all their Orion shares (including any rights attaching to those shares) which are transferred under the Scheme will, at the date of transfer, be fully paid and free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise, and restrictions on transfer of any kind, and that they have full power and capacity to transfer their Orion Shares together with any rights attaching to those shares."
