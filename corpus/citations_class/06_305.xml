<text>39 Mr Macaw referred to the judgment of a Full Court of this Court in Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH v Commissioner of Patents [2001] FCA 647 ; (2001) 112 FCR 595 (" Boehringer "). He submitted that Boehringer was authority for the proposition that the requirement that a patent involve a claim to a "pharmaceutical substance per se " requires more than that a pharmaceutical substance simply forms some element of the claim or claims. Mr Macaw also relied upon Boehringer as authority for the proposition that, in order to satisfy the requirements of s 70(2)(a) , the pharmaceutical substance must fall within the scope of the claim, that is, it must be included among the things claimed.</text>

<tocase>Boehringer Ingelheim International v Commissioner of Patents (2001) AIPC |P91-670</tocase>
<text>67 Dr Elliott was cross-examined at some length by Mr Caine. It is unnecessary for present purposes to set out in any great detail the nature of the cross-examination. Put simply, Mr Caine suggested to Dr Elliott that her opinion was idiosyncratic, and failed to reflect the authoritative interpretation that had been accorded to the definition of "pharmaceutical substance" by both Heerey J at first instance ( Boehringer Ingelheim International v Commissioner of Patents (2001) AIPC |P91-670), and by the Full Court in Boehringer .

68 The transcript of Mr Caine's cross-examination sheds considerable light on this issue:
 
 "MR CAINE:...Dr Elliott, just to identify it for the transcript, that is a copy of the Boehringer decision at first instance before Heerey J which is document 5 in the briefing documents that you were given for the purpose of preparing your report. Would you be good enough to go to paragraph 18 of that decision where his Honour sets out an extract from the Patent Office Manual of Practice and Procedure?---Yes, I have it. 
 
 Would you go to the part of paragraph 18 where his Honour extracts from the Manual paragraph 25.2.3 which is headed, "Mixture or Compound of Substances". Do you see in the first paragraph under that sub-heading his Honour - I am sorry, the Patent Office Manual says: 
 
 
 
 The definition of a pharmaceutical substance includes a mixture or compound of substances. 
 
 
 
 Just pausing there, you would accept that that is part of the statutory definition in schedule 1 of the Act, would you not?---It is. 
 
 Yes, and the Manual goes on to say: 
 
 
 
 In the case of such mixtures or compounds the test of whether or not a substance is a pharmaceutical substance applies to the mixture or compound as a whole, not to an individual component of the mixture or compound. 
 
 
 
 And then in the next paragraph the Manual says: 
 
 
 
 Thus a typical ARTG registration might refer to an active ingredient in a particular carrier or excipient. In this situation the pharmaceutical substance is the active ingredient in the carrier or excipient, not the active ingredient alone. 
 
 
 
 Now pausing there, do you recall reading those two paragraphs and taking them on board when you were reading Heerey Js decision for the purpose of your report?---Yes, I did. 
 
 Did you - the view that you have expressed in your report as I understand it is that the pharmaceutical substance as defined in the Act should be narrowly considered as the active ingredient on its own?---I do. 
 
 Yes. That is at odds, is it not, with what is set out in those two paragraphs in the Patent Office Manual?---I don't believe so and as far as the active ingredient is the pharmaceutical substance that is going to interact with the body and regardless of what the other components are, that is the product that is going to be exerting its pharmacological effect. 
 
 I understand that is your view but the view expressed here in the Manual and extracted by his Honour is that it is the active ingredient, my words, together with the carrier or excipient, not the active ingredient alone. Do you see that?---For clarification I would read that saying it is the pharmaceutical substance is the active ingredient in the carrier or excipient so that they go together and that is those components are being put in the body but in fact it will be only the pharmaceutical substance that is having an effect so you can have multiple products with the same active ingredient. 
 
 Yes. Why then do the words appear at the end of that sentence: 
 
 Not the active ingredient alone.
 
 MS STRONG: I don't think Dr Elliott can really answer that question, your Honour. 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Sorry, I didn't quite catch what you were saying, Ms Strong. 
 
 MS STRONG: Well, my learned friend has asked her why there is a particular sentence put into the Patent Office Manual. I doubt that she would know why. 
 
 HIS HONOUR: It seems to me this is cross-examination as to credit and quite permissible, Ms Strong. 
 
 MS STRONG: If your Honour pleases. 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Yes, you can ask the question again. 
 
 MR CAINE: As a result of that, I will put it again if I can. What I am simply putting to you, Dr Elliott, is I understand that the view you have expressed in the report is that the pharmaceutical substance defined in the Act is to be confined to the active ingredient alone and all I am putting to you is that the Manual, the Australian Patent Office Manual, does not share your view. It says that: 
 
 
 
 For the purposes of the Act the pharmaceutical substance is the combination of the active ingredient together with the carrier or excipient, not the active ingredient alone. 
 
 
 
 Do you accept that your view is at odds with the Manual?---In relation to that specific paragraph? 
 
 Yes?---The interpretation could be that it is. 
 
 Yes, and if the Manual expresses the correct test according to law and that will be a matter for his Honour later on, you would accept that your view is at odds with that test?---If that is that particular sentence as opposed to the other guidances that are provided in that extract from the Manual which again clearly are at odds there would appear to be an internal inconsistency within that. 
 
 Yes."

69 When Dr Elliott's attention was drawn to what the Patent Office Manual of Practice and Procedure ("the Manual") said about the meaning of "pharmaceutical substance", and what both Heerey J and the Full Court had said about that matter, she remained doggedly of the view that her position was correct, and what was said elsewhere was of little consequence. She regarded the Manual as leading to "confusion in terms of understanding what is the active component", and rejected its essential tenor.

70 In closing submissions, Mr Caine invited me to disregard the opinion expressed by Dr Elliott. He submitted that if her interpretation of "pharmaceutical substance" were correct, it would be impossible to obtain an extension of a patent involving any invented solution, of which only one component was of direct therapeutic use. That would be so even if the product as a whole, including inert compounds designed to achieve stability for the actual substance that exerts a therapeutic effect, had a therapeutic effect in the body (in this case a cytotoxic effect against cancer cells).

71 It is important to note that Mr Macaw expressly declined to adopt Ms Strong's submission that Pharmacia's product was not, relevantly, a "pharmaceutical substance". He confined his submission to contending that the product was not a "pharmaceutical substance per se ", essentially because it encompassed elements of process.

72 Ms Strong also made a number of submissions regarding the timing of Interpharma's application for review. She noted that s 11(4) of the ADJR Act provides this Court with the discretion to refuse to entertain an application for an order of review if "the court is of the opinion that the application was not made within a reasonable time after the decision was made " (emphasis added). She also noted that when forming its opinion, s 11(5) of that Act provides that the Court "shall have regard to the time when the applicant became aware of the making of the decision; and...may have regard to such other matters as it considers relevant." Ms Strong then sought to explain, and to justify, Interpharma's delay.

73 On this point, Ms Strong submitted that there was nothing in the evidence led on behalf of Pharmacia to suggest that it would, in any way, be prejudiced if time were extended to allow the application for review to proceed. She described that evidence as "broadbrush" and speculative. She further submitted that Interpharma had acted reasonably in assuming that the processes by which EBEWE Pharma proposed to manufacture doxorubicin EBEWE and epirubicin EBEWE for the Australian market did not come within the claims specified in the Patent.

85 The meaning of the expression "pharmaceutical substance per se " in s 70(2)(a) has been authoritatively considered by a Full Court of this Court in Boehringer . The facts of that case were set out succinctly by Heerey J, at first instance .

86 As previously indicated, the patent in that case related to compositions for the treatment of nasal hypersecretion (runny nose), containers adapted for nasal administration and containing compositions for such treatments, and methods of treating the condition. Claim 1 of the patent in that case was as follows:
 
 "A container comprising an aerosol or spray composition for nasal administration which composition comprises as active ingredient a quaternary tropane alkaloid derivative with atropine-like activity [hereafter "the Substance"], the container being provided with a nozzle adapted for nasal administration of the composition."

87 His Honour described at [4] the remaining claims in the following terms:
 
 "Claims 2 and 3 are for a container where the composition comprises or contains specified substances, being more particular forms of the Substance. Claim 4 is for a container claimed in any one of the preceding claims having a metering device. Claim 5 is for the container of claim 4 wherein the metering device is adapted to deliver specified quantities of the Substance. Claims 6 to 9 are directed to methods of treatment of nasal hypersecretion comprising the nasal administration of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient the Substance or particular forms or quantities of the Substance. Claims 10 to 12 are omnibus claims. Claim 13 is for a method of treatment as claimed in claim 6 with reference to any one of the Examples. Claims 14 to 16 are directed to an aerosol or spray composition as claimed in claim 1 when used in the container of claim 1."

88 Heerey J found it useful to consider the history of s 70 in order to understand why the expression "pharmaceutical substance per se " had been introduced. His Honour observed at [8]-[13]:
 
 "Under Part IX of the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) ("the 1952 Act") a patentee could seek an extension of up to ten years if it could be shown that the patentee had been "inadequately remunerated". Section 93 directed the court to have regard to the nature and merits of the invention, the profits made by the patentee and all the circumstances of the case. In practice patentees produced substantial accounting evidence endeavouring to show great expenditure on research and development and only modest sales. 
 
 Part IX applied to all patents, irrespective of subject matter. However extension applications were frequently brought in the case of pharmaceutical patents because regulatory approval requirements often meant that the product could not enter the marketplace until a substantial part of the patent protection period had already passed. 
 
 The first particularised legislative treatment of pharmaceutical patents came in 1989. By the Patents Amendment Act 1989 (Cth) a new s 90 was inserted in the 1952 Act. The new s 90(1) provided: 
 
 
 "90(1) Where: 
 
 
 (a) a pharmaceutical substance is in substance disclosed in the complete specification of a standard patent and in substance falls within the scope of the claim or claims of that complete specification; and 
 (b) the patentee has requested the issue of a marketing approval certificate in respect of that substance, 
 
 
 the patentee may, by notice in writing in accordance with the prescribed form given to the Commissioner not later than 12 months before the end of the term of the patent, apply for an extension of the term of the patent in respect of that substance and any other pharmaceutical substance which is in substance disclosed in the specification and in substance falls within the scope of the claim or claims of the specification." 
 
 
 
 When the 1990 Act was introduced, Part IX of the 1952 Act, as amended in 1989, was in substance re-enacted. 
 
 By the Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Act 1994 (Cth) Div 2 of Pt 3 of Ch 6 of the 1990 Act, containing the extension provisions in ss 70 to 79, was repealed. Section 70 and related sections in their present form were introduced by the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Act 1998 (Cth). For the first time, provision was made for the extension of not just of a "pharmaceutical patent", but a "pharmaceutical patent per se ". 
 
 The 1990 Act in its present form manifests a policy which draws a distinction between, on the one hand, a pharmaceutical substance that is the subject of a patent claim and, on the other hand, a pharmaceutical substance that forms part of a method or process claim. The specific exception to the latter (an exception which proves the rule) is the provision for recombinant DNA technology in s 70(2)(b)."

89 Heerey J went on to say at [14]-[16]:
 
 "Broadly speaking, a claim in relation to a pharmaceutical substance can be made in three ways 
 
 (i) a new and inventive product alone; 
 (ii) an old or known product prepared by a new and inventive process; 
 (iii) an old or known product used in a new and inventive mode of treatment. 
 
 
 What is clear in s 70 is that only the first type of claim to a pharmaceutical product is to be subject to extension rights. So far as a new process is concerned, it is only when the new process answers the particular description in s 70(2)(b) (recombinant DNA process) that it can be the subject of an extension. As counsel for the Commissioner submitted, the policy to be deduced in the light of the legislative history is that Parliament has decided that what is intended to be fostered is primary research and development in inventive substances, not the way they are made or the way they are used, with the sole (and important) exception of recombinant DNA techniques, this being an area particularly worthy of assistance for research and development. 
 
 In the light of this history, the relevance of the expression " per se " becomes clear. Section 70(2)(a) is only to make extension rights available when the claim is for a pharmaceutical substance as such, as opposed to a substance forming part of a method or process."

90 His Honour next referred to the Manual, a work used as an internal guide to the administration of the Patents Act , and available to the patent attorney and legal professions. He drew attention, in particular, to the following passages from the Manual:
 
 "25.2.2 Pharmaceutical Substance per se
 
 Except for substances produced by a process involving the use of recombinant DNA technology, an extension of term is only available in respect of a pharmaceutical substance per se being within the scope of a claim of the patent. 
 
 The explanatory memorandum to the Intellectual Property Laws Bill of 1997 noted that, except for substances produced by a process involving the use of recombinant DNA technology, claims to pharmaceutical substances per se would usually be restricted to new and inventive substances. The memorandum also mentioned a number of specific instances where an extension would not be available: 
 
 
 
 'Patents that claim pharmaceutical substances when produced by a particular process (product by process claims) will not be eligible unless that process involves the use of recombinant DNA technology. Claims which limit the use of a known substance to a particular environment, for example claims to pharmaceutical substances when used in a new and inventive method of treatment, are not considered to be claims to pharmaceutical substances per se .' 
 
 
 
 This distinction is specifically evident as between the reference in the Act to 'pharmaceutical substances per se ', and to 'pharmaceutical substances when produced by a process that involves the use of recombinant DNA technology'. The use of the word ' per se ' requires the claim to the substance to be unqualified by process, temporal, or environmental, components. 
 
 Thus, in order that the term of a patent be extended, the patent must contain one or more claims in the form: 
 
 a) A substance of formula **** 
 
 b) Substance X mixed with substance Y 
 
 Examples of claims that are not directed to substances per se are: 
 
 a) Substance X when used ... 
 
 b) Substance X for use ... 
 
 c) Substance X when produced by method Y 
 
 
 
 
 d) An antiseptic comprising substance X [unless the label 'antiseptic' was clearly non-limiting on the scope of the claim.] 
 
 e) A method of preparing substance X 
 
 f) A substance of formula ..., where component Y is produced by ... 
 
 g) [A specified quantum] of substance X 
 
 h) 'Swiss' style claims referring to substance X 
 
 i) Use of substance X in the treatment of Y 
 
 
 
 
 In limited circumstances, a substance could be new and inventive but can only be defined by reference to the process in which it was made (for example, compound X obtainable by process Y) because the chemical structure or composition is undetermined. In such circumstances, a claim which defines the substance by reference to such method steps would be a claim to the substance per se . 
 
 25.2.3. Mixture or Compound of Substances 
 
 The definition of a pharmaceutical substance includes a mixture or compound of substances. In the case of such mixtures or compounds, the test of whether or not a substance is a pharmaceutical substance applies to the mixture or compound as a whole, not to an individual component of the mixture or compound. 
 
 Thus, a typical ARTG [Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods] registration might refer to an active ingredient in a particular carrier or excipient. In this situation, the pharmaceutical substance is the active ingredient in the carrier or excipient not the active ingredient alone. 
 
 Of course, under patent law a patent is not granted for a substance capable of being used as a medicine if it is a mere mixture of known ingredients. Similarly, a collocation of known integers with no working interrelationship is not patentable. Consequently, while the ARTG may contain many entries involving an active substance with different carriers or excipients, separate patents corresponding to the differing ARTG entries are unlikely to have been granted. 
 
 25.2.4 'within the scope of the claim' 
 
 The mere fact that a substance is mentioned in a claim does not mean that the substance is within the scope of the claim. The phrase 'in substance fall within the scope' has been the subject of judicial interpretation in the context of amendments. In The Distillers Co. Ld.'s Application , (1953) 70 RPC 221 at page 223 the test for 'in substance fall within the scope' was stated to be: 
 
 
 
 'would the amendment make anything an infringement which would not have been an infringement before the amendment?'
 
 
 
 This was considered by the Commissioner in Astra Lakemedal AG 29 IPR 183, (1994) AIPC |P91-087, in deciding that a substance was not in substance within the scope of certain claims. On appeal to the Federal Court in Astra Lakemedal AG 31 IPR 1, the Commissioner's decision was overturned, having regard to the words 'to which the application relates' as present in the then s. 70 (and which are not present in the present legislation)."

91 His Honour said that he found this material to be of assistance, though he recognised that it was not extrinsic material of the normal type. Importantly, he implicitly approved of the examples set out at [25.2.2] as aiding in the interpretation of the expression "pharmaceutical substance per se " considered in the light of the history of the relevant section, and its evident purpose.

92 Not surprisingly, having regard to the nature of the claims relied upon in that case, Heerey J concluded that all of them were for "modes of treatment involving the Substance, not for the Substance in itself". Accordingly, the application to review the Commissioner's refusal to grant the extension was dismissed.

93 On appeal, the Full Court in Boehringer (Wilcox, Whitlam and Gyles JJ) held that the decision at first instance was correct. The Court noted that it had been conceded by counsel for the appellant that a container was fundamental to each of the claims, in the sense that, absent a container as described claim 1, there would be no infringement of the patent. However, it had been submitted that the requirements of s 70(2)(a) were met, and that Heerey J had erroneously interpreted paragraph (a) "as requiring the claim or claims of the patent to exclusively define a pharmaceutical substance per se or to be limited or confined to a pharmaceutical substance per se ". It had been further submitted that the paragraph required "no more than that a pharmaceutical substance... be included in one or more of those claims as an essential feature", and that all the relevant claims in that case had specifically included as an essential feature a pharmaceutical substance per se . The appellant submitted that it did not matter that each claim also included one or more other elements.

94 The Full Court regarded these submissions as being tantamount to an argument that the words " per se " made no substantial contribution to, and provided no limitation upon, the statutory provisions of s 70(2)(a). The Court rejected that argument. It referred with approval, at [34] and [37], to the submission of the respondent that the introduction of the words " per se " by the 1998 amendments indicated a clear intention, on the part of the legislature, to limit the operation of s 70 to patents disclosing and claiming a pharmaceutical substance "by or in itself, intrinsically, essentially" ( New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ), or "taken alone; essentially; without reference to anything else" ( Butterworth's Australian Legal Dictionary ).

95 The Full Court noted that the appellant's argument, if accepted, would have the effect of reading out of s 70(2)(a) the words " per se ". In addition, the Court regarded the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum as providing no support to the appellant's argument; quite the contrary. The emphasis in those materials was upon the development of new drugs, not drugs in combination with other elements. The explanatory memorandum, in particular, excluded the application of the new provisions to "new processes of making pharmaceutical substances or new methods of using pharmaceutical substances, where the substances themselves are known".

105 As extracted at [88] and [89] of these reasons for judgment, in Boehringer , Heerey J at first instance distinguished a pharmaceutical substance that is the subject of a patent claim from a pharmaceutical substance that forms part of a method or process claim. His Honour said that, broadly speaking, a claim could be made in relation to a pharmaceutical substance in three ways:
 
(a) a new and inventive product alone;
(b) an old or known product prepared by a new and inventive process; or
 
(c) an old or known product used in a new and inventive mode of treatment.

106 It is important to note that Heerey J did not distinguish between the "active ingredients" in a compound, and other components of that compound, in the way that Dr Elliott did. Nor did the Full Court.

107 His Honour's approval of the Manual, and its analysis of the concept of a pharmaceutical substance which was generally accepted as correct by the Full Court, cannot be reconciled with Dr Elliott's view that the introduction of any non-active ingredient into a product prevents it from being a pharmaceutical substance. For one thing, her approach would effectively mean that s 70 had almost no function to perform. Almost every pharmaceutical product will consist of a combination of individual substances, some of which may be intrinsically therapeutic (active ingredients), while others serve different, albeit essential, roles. To restrict the capacity to extend a patent to those unlikely cases where every component of the compound is itself therapeutically useful would be to deprive the section of any real utility, and largely defeat the purpose of its enactment.

108 For the reasons already given in the Pharmacia Proceeding, I reject Interpharma's alternative contention that claim 1 does not, by reason of any reference that it makes to process elements, disclose a "pharmaceutical substance per se ".

109 This makes it unnecessary for me to consider whether to grant Interpharma an extension of time within which to bring its application for review under the ADJR Act . It also makes it unnecessary to consider whether, as a matter of discretion, I would refuse relief to Interpharma, under the Judiciary Act , because of the lengthy delay that took place between the time the Commissioner granted the extension, and the institution of the Interpharma Review Proceeding. The simple fact is that, as in the case of Mayne, Interpharma cannot make good its contention that claim 1 does not involve a "pharmaceutical substance per se". For that reason, Interpharma's application must be dismissed, with costs.
 

 I certify that the preceding one hundred and nine (109) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.

<text>55 Mr Caine next referred to the requirement under s 70(2)(a) that a patent disclose and include within the scope of the claims a pharmaceutical substance per se . He rejected Mayne's submission that the Patent did not disclose or claim a pharmaceutical substance per se , but rather a pharmaceutical substance produced by a defined process or method. He submitted that the question whether claim 1, as currently formulated, identified a pharmaceutical substance per se , or extended into the realms of process or method, had to be approached as a matter of substance, and not form. That is, it was a question to be resolved by considering the scope of the claim "broadly, that is to say in a general sense": Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95 per Gummow J, cited with approval by the High Court in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [69] .</text>

<tocase>Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 552</tocase>
<text>2 VID 439 of 2003 ("the Pharmacia Proceeding") concerns the scope of the final injunction to be granted and, in particular, its duration, in a matter that was heard by Crennan J: Pharmacia Italia SpA v Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd (2005) 222 ALR 552 ("the Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding"). Her Honour found that Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd and the Faulding Co respondents ("Mayne") had infringed Pharmacia Italia SpA's ("Pharmacia") patent, Australian patent no. 598197 ("the Patent"). The injunction that she granted on 8 September 2005 restrains Mayne from infringing certain claims of the Patent until 19 June 2006, the end of the original term of the Patent, or until "such later date as the Court may hereafter order". Mayne objects to any further order being made that would extend the term of that injunction, namely to cover the period of the Patent's extension from 19 June 2006 to 19 June 2011.

3 In the second proceeding before the Court, VID 1274 of 2005 ("the Interpharma Review Proceeding"), Interpharma Pty Ltd ("Interpharma") challenges the decisions of the Commissioner of Patents ("the Commissioner") to:
 
 
 (a) accept an application for an extension of the term of the Patent;
 (b) fail to refuse to accept an application for an extension of the term of the Patent; and
 (c) to grant an extension of the term of the Patent.

4 It does so pursuant to s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act ") and s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ("the Judiciary Act "). Interpharma has also applied to the Court for rectification of the Register of Patents pursuant to s 192 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ("the Patents Act "). The basis of that claim is that the Register erroneously records the Patent as having been extended to 19 June 2011.

14 According to Crennan J, at [4] of her reasons for judgment, the primary issue in relation to infringement was whether Mayne's product had "not been reconstituted from a lyophilizate", as that phrase appeared in claim 1 of the Patent. A secondary issue identified by her Honour was whether Mayne avoided infringement on the specific occasions on which they used sodium hydroxide, in addition to hydrochloric acid, to adjust the pH of the solution, given that claim 1 of the Patent refers to the pH being adjusted "solely with a physiologically acceptable acid".

15 On 5 August 2005, Crennan J delivered judgment. Aspects of the dispute between the parties that were dealt with by Crennan J provide relevant background to the proceedings currently before me. Her Honour found that the Patent had been infringed. However, she did not make final orders on that day. Rather, she ordered:
 
 "The parties to prepare short minutes of final orders on liability in accordance with these reasons and include any other orders or directions as appropriate for the further disposition of the matter."

16 Pursuant to her Honour's orders, each party prepared proposed minutes of final orders. On 8 September 2005, Crennan J made orders by consent, including the following order:
 
 "Until 19 June 2006 or such later date as the Court may hereafter order , the respondents and each of them, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, servants or agents or otherwise, be restrained in Australia from exploiting any anthracycline glycoside ready-to use solution as claimed in any of claims 1 to 30 (inclusive), 5 to 10 (inclusive), 13 to 15 (inclusive), 18, 19, 22, 25 and 26 of Australian patent no. 598197, save that the respondents may until further order exploit: 
 
 
 
 i. doxorubicin hydrochloride injection; and 
 ii. daunorubicin hydrochloride injection." (emphasis added)

17 The orders reflect the reasons given in her Honour's judgment. However, they gave rise to the further issue that is now the subject of the two proceedings presently before this Court. In the Pharmacia Proceeding, Mayne contends that the term of the injunction granted by Crennan J should not be extended to 19 June 2011 to cover the extension of patent granted by the Commissioner, but rather should end on 19 June 2006. In the Interpharma Review Proceeding, Interpharma challenges the validity of the extension itself.

18 Of relevance to both proceedings currently before the Court, Crennan J, at [5], summarised the three aspects of the invention to which the Patent relates:
 
 
 "(a) a pharmaceutical product, being a stable intravenously injectable ready-to-use solution of an antitumor anthracycline glycoside, for example, doxorubicin; 
 (b) a process for preparing such a solution, [providing] the same in a sealed container; and 
 
 
 (c) a method for treating tumours by the use of the ready-to-use solution."

19 These three aspects of the invention are reflected in the 26 claims of the Patent which define the invention. Using the language adopted by Crennan J in her judgment at [19], Pharmacia submits that there are 20 product ("solution") claims, four "process" claims and two "method" claims. Of course, whether that is in fact a wholly accurate characterisation of the claims is the very point in issue in the proceedings before me.

20 The parties do not contend that all the claims are in issue. Relevantly, claims 3 to 19, and claim 22 (described by Crennan J as the "solution" claims), are dependent on claim 1. If claim 1 is not properly to be characterised as a "solution" claim, but does, in fact, incorporate significant elements of "process", Pharmacia acknowledges that none of the remaining "solution" claims can lawfully be the subject of an extension. The parties are agreed that resolution of the construction of claim 1 will resolve the controversy between them. It is convenient therefore, to deal with each of the alleged "process" features in the context of claim 1.

21 Claim 1, in its current form, is in the following terms:
 
 "1. A sterile, pyrogen-free, anthracycline glycoside solution which comprises a physiologically acceptable salt of an anthracycline glycoside dissolved in a physiologically acceptable aqueous solvent therefor at an anthracycline glycoside concentration of from 0.1 to 50 mg/ml, which has not been reconstituted from a lyophilizate and the pH of which has been adjusted [to] from 2.5 to 5.0 solely with a physiologically acceptable acid."

22 As will be seen, in broad terms Mayne focuses upon the terms "dissolved", "not being reconstituted from a lyophilizate" and "adjusted" as the basis for its submission that claim 1 contains elements of process that prevent it from being the subject of a lawful extension. I should interpolate that it was common ground between the parties that the word "to", which appears in square brackets in claim 1, as set out above, but does not appear in the claim as it actually stands, should be read into it. It does not matter, for present purposes, whether that is because the word was excluded inadvertently, or whether it is necessary to insert it in order to give sensible meaning to the claim.

36 Mr Macaw QC, on behalf of Mayne, submitted that the various claims of the Patent that Crennan J found had been infringed (namely, claims 1 to 3, 5 to 10, 13 to 15, 18, 19, 22, 25 and 26) were not claims to a "pharmaceutical substance per se " within the meaning of s 78(1)(b)(i) , and therefore do not warrant any protection by injunctive relief beyond the expiry date of the original term of the Patent, 19 June 2006.

37 Mr Macaw submitted that claim 1 (and therefore the dependent claims as well) was a "product by process" claim, because of the various process elements that were included in the claim, as formulated. He contended that the introduction of "process elements" as part of the description of the product prevented claim 1 from being a claim to a "pharmaceutical substance per se ".

38 According to Mr Macaw, it followed that any infringing activity on Mayne's part was, and is, by way of exploitation of a form of the invention other than a "pharmaceutical substance per se ". As a result, by reason of section 78(1)(b)(i) , the final injunction to be granted should not continue for the extended period of the Patent but, rather, should end at the expiry of the original patent period, on 19 June 2006.

44 Mr Macaw noted that in addition to manufacturing epirubicin hydrochloride solution, Mayne manufactured anthracycline glycoside solutions such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and daunorubicin hydrochloride, neither of which was alleged, nor found by Crennan J, to infringe the Patent in the Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding. Mr Macaw contended that the scope of the injunction should therefore be limited, on a permanent basis, to include only the epirubicin hydrochloride solution that was found to infringe, and not the other anthracycline glycoside solutions, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride and daunorubicin hydrochloride, that Mayne produces.

45 It seems that the position regarding these other anthracycline glycoside solutions remains somewhat uncertain. Order 1 of the orders made by Crennan J on 8 September 2005 reflected an agreement between the parties, on an interim basis, that doxorubicin hydrochloride and daunorubicin hydrochloride should be excluded from the scope of the injunction. There was also an agreement that they be excluded from any order for damages, or an account of profits, again on an interim basis only, pending Pharmacia having further time to consider its position in relation to them. Mr Macaw submitted that given that Pharmacia had now had that opportunity, but was unprepared to commit itself to a stance, the interim position should be made permanent.

46 In the course of oral submissions Mr Macaw referred to Mayne's licence to produce doxorubicin hydrochloride and daunorubicin hydrochloride and the question of "the appropriate formulation of the injunction". He stated:
 
 "[T]he parties have attempted a commercial resolution of that matter and my instructions are that it's close and we would seek merely have that aspect of the matter adjourned to a date to be fixed" .

47 Mr Caine SC, on behalf of Pharmacia, did not have anything to say regarding this matter. It may be, therefore, that the form of the injunction granted by Crennan J will have to be varied irrespective of the outcome of this proceeding, in order to make it clear that Mayne's entitlement to manufacture its non-infringing products is not in any way impaired by that injunction.

48 Finally, Mr Macaw referred to order 2 of Crennan J's orders of 8 September 2005. That order is in the following terms:
 
 "Save for the samples referred to at paragraph 27 to 29 of the affidavit of Joanna Elizabeth Johnson sworn on 7 September 2005, the respondents, within 21 days of the date of this Order, destroy all epirubicin hydrochloride ready-to-use solutions in their possession, custody, power or control, the sale, supply or use of which by the respondents, their servants or agents or by any person to whom such epirubicin hydrochloride solution were to be supplied would be in breach of the foregoing injunction."

49 Mr Macaw contended that it was implicit that the injunction should not prevent use of the retained samples, referred to in order 2, for the particular purposes identified in the affidavit of Joanna Elizabeth Johnson sworn on 7 September 2005. In relation to this matter, Mr Macaw stated:
 
 "...I don't think I need to trouble your Honour with [the samples point] , because I understand that it's not contentious. We'll hand your Honour a form of the order which incorporates those which accommodates those matters... in due course, but we apprehend to say that that's not an issue. 
 
 HIS HONOUR: So, on any view the injunction would be limited if the injunction extends beyond June of this year in the weigh [sic] group. 
 
 MR MACAW: Would in any event be limited, yes. 
 
 HIS HONOUR: Yes, I follow."

50 Mr Caine did not have anything to say about this matter. Accordingly, it may be necessary, once again, to vary the terms of the injunction to reflect any agreement that is reached between the parties regarding this issue.

51 Mr Caine did not contend that the "process" or "method" claims defining the invention (by which he meant claims 2, 20, 21 and 23-26) could provide a basis for the extension of the term of the Patent. He agreed that the claims in issue were limited to claim 1, and claims 3 to 19. Claim 22, though not regarded as a "process" or "method" claim, was expressly abandoned by Mr Caine during the course of the hearing.

52 Mr Caine submitted that the solution that was the subject of the Patent was plainly a "pharmaceutical substance" within the meaning of Schedule 1 of the Patents Act . He further submitted that claim 1 involved a claim in relation to a pharmaceutical substance per se. In simple terms, he argued that the injectable ready-to-use solution was a mixture of substances which had particular characteristics. Those characteristics were what I referred to in argument as "descriptors", enabling the substance to be readily defined, and differentiated from other pharmaceutical substances that were not within the protection of the Patent.

59 Finally, Mr Caine referred to the judgment of Crennan J in the Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding. He noted that her Honour had found Mayne liable for infringing Pharmacia's patent rights, and submitted that it was at least implicit in her Honour's reasoning that Mayne had been seeking to exploit a form of the invention that was a pharmaceutical substance per se . It was equally implicit in that reasoning that the product was in substance disclosed in the complete specification of the Patent and that its product fell within the scope of the relevant claims of that specification, as Boehringer required. Accordingly, he submitted, Mayne would not be able to avoid infringement by reason of s 78(1)(b)(i). It followed that the term of the injunction granted by Crennan J should extend to 19 June 2011.

60 Interpharma seeks an order of review under s 5 of the ADJR Act of the following decisions of the Commissioner:
 
 (a) the decision of 24 October 2001 to accept Pharmacia's application for an extension of the term of the Patent filed on 14 March 2001;
 (b) the failure on or about the 24 October 2001 to refuse Pharmacia's application for an extension of the term of the Patent;
 (c) the decision to grant an extension of the term of the Patent by certificate dated 6 April 2002 for five years to 19 June 2011.

61 Ms Strong SC, who appeared on behalf of Interpharma, submitted that each of these decisions was of an administrative character, and that Interpharma was, and is, a "person aggrieved" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act . Pharmacia did not take issue with these contentions.

74 Ms Strong argued that it was not until Interpharma was in a position to market doxorubicin EBEWE, in about August 2005, after the judgment of Crennan J in the Pharmacia Infringement Proceeding had been delivered, that it was reasonable to expect Interpharma to challenge the extension of the Patent. Interpharma had filed its application for review of the Commissioner's decisions on 11 October 2005, not long after her Honour's judgment had become available. According to Ms Strong, "[f]rom August 2005, Interpharma moved with great expedition".

75 It should be remembered that Interpharma also relied upon s 39B of the Judiciary Act in challenging the validity of the Commissioner's decision to grant the extension of the Patent. Ms Strong noted that there was no specific time limit, under the Federal Court Rules , for the grant of certiorari, which was the principal remedy sought. It was only necessary, as a matter of discretion, to persuade the Court that relief should not be withheld by reason of excessive delay. She submitted that in context, the delay was adequately explained.

76 Finally, Ms Strong sought to invoke s 192 of the Patents Act , as a separate basis upon which relief should be granted. That section allows for rectification of the Register. She submitted that the need to ensure that the Register was properly maintained justified the relief sought, no matter how long, or how unjustified, the delay might be.

102 It follows that, in my view, the injunction granted by Crennan J, with some minor modifications, should continue over the life of the extension of the Patent, until 19 June 2011. I will order that the parties file proposed minutes of orders giving effect to these reasons for decision. The proposed minutes of orders should also deal with any other matters the parties consider appropriate, such as the resolution of the issues discussed above at [43]-[50].

103 That takes me to the Interpharma Review Proceeding. The first issue to be determined in that proceeding is whether claim 1 relevantly describes a "pharmaceutical substance", putting to one side any additional requirements imposed by the words " per se ".

104 In that regard, I reject the evidence given by Dr Elliott. I accept that she is a highly qualified expert, and that she genuinely holds the opinions that she expressed in her report. However, she was cross-examined to very good effect by Mr Caine who demonstrated, to my satisfaction, that Dr Elliott's view of s 70(2)(a), and the meaning of the expression "pharmaceutical substance" in the context of that section, did not accord with the law as authoritatively determined in Boehringer .</text>

<text>40 In addition, Mr Macaw referred to the later judgment of a Full Court of this Court in Prejay Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2003) 57 IPR 424 (" Prejay "), where the decision in Boehringer was expressly approved. The Court in Prejay held that s 70(2)(a) requires a pharmaceutical substance itself to be an integer of a claim in the relevant patent. It is not enough that the substance appears in a claim in combination with other integers, or as part of the description of a method (or process) that is the subject of a claim. The Court noted at [24] that "[t]he policy adopted in s 70 was to confine extensions to patents that claim invention of the substance itself".

41 Mr Macaw submitted that claim 1 had the following process components, and therefore was not a claim to a pharmaceutical product per se :
 
 
 "(a) the product of claim 1 must be made by a process other than by reconstitution from a lyophilizate (in a vial immediately prior to administration); 
 (b) the salt of the active ingredient must have been dissolved in an aqueous solvent; 
 (c) the product must be made by a process of adjustment of the pH into a range of between 2.5 and 5.0; 
 (d) that adjustment must solely have been done with a physiologically acceptable acid."

42 According to Mr Macaw, it was not any anthracycline glycoside solution that would infringe claim 1, but only a solution obtained in accordance with the process integers of that claim. He referred to a series of amendments that Pharmacia had made to the form in which claim 1 was drafted at various stages. He contended that by adding "pH adjustment integers", for example, Pharmacia appeared to have made a conscious decision to include a process element in the claim, thereby widening the scope of the protection sought for its product. It was in part for this reason that Mr Macaw contended that the product of claim 1 was defined by the process by which it was obtained.

54 In his submissions, Mr Caine distinguished claim 1 from the claims considered in Boehringer, and in Prejay . He noted that in Boehringer the claim had not been limited to a pharmaceutical substance alone, but included a container with a nozzle designed to deliver that substance. He also noted that in Prejay the claim had been expressed in terms of a method for treating menopausal women using a transdermal patch to provide continuous dosages of progesterone and estrogen. He submitted that in each case, whilst the invention claimed was patentable, the claim related to a known substance coupled with a novel delivery system. He contended that this was in marked contrast to the invention the subject of the Patent, which claimed a new and inventive pharmaceutical substance, on its own.</text>

<text>55 Mr Caine next referred to the requirement under s 70(2)(a) that a patent disclose and include within the scope of the claims a pharmaceutical substance per se . He rejected Mayne's submission that the Patent did not disclose or claim a pharmaceutical substance per se , but rather a pharmaceutical substance produced by a defined process or method. He submitted that the question whether claim 1, as currently formulated, identified a pharmaceutical substance per se , or extended into the realms of process or method, had to be approached as a matter of substance, and not form. That is, it was a question to be resolved by considering the scope of the claim "broadly, that is to say in a general sense": Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95 per Gummow J, cited with approval by the High Court in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Limited [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [69] .</text>
