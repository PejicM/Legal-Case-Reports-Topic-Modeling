<text>20 The Tribunal is conducting a review of the Delegate's decision but that review is conducted on the basis of the claims advanced and materials before the Tribunal ( SZEIV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1798 at [34] ). While the Tribunal is obliged, in certain circumstances, to review claims not expressly advanced at the hearing ( NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [58] and [68]), if a claim raised before the Delegate is abandoned before the Tribunal, it is entitled to take the view that the applicant does not make that claim or a case based on that claim ( SZEIV at [34]).</text>
