<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/433.html</AustLII>
<text>In respect of Bowesco, it should be noted that on 20 April 2006 freezing orders were made in respect of its assets pursuant to s 1323 of the Act Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 3) [2006] FCA 433. The orders were varied on 30 June 2006. They were expressed so as to permit the Bowesco receivers to exercise their powers pursuant to their appointment by Sunway-Metcorp, including their powers under s 420 of the Act.

On 11 August 2006 Ms Karen Carey-Hazell, a director of both Lanepoint and Bowesco, filed a motion in each of the proceedings seeking leave '... to take responsibility on behalf of the respondent in these proceedings'. Argument on her motion was heard on 16 August 2006 and reserved until today.

Section 459A lists the categories of persons who may apply to the Court for a company to be wound up in insolvency. They include the company itself, a creditor, a director and ASIC. An application by a director or by ASIC may only be made with the leave of the Court (s 459P(2)). The Court may give leave if satisfied that there is a prima facie case that the company is insolvent but not otherwise (s 459P(3)). Except as permitted by s 459P a person cannot apply for a company to be wound up in insolvency (s 459P(5)).</text>

<tocase>George Barker (Transport) Ltd v Eynon [1973] 3 All ER 374</tocase>
<text>The appointment of a receiver under a charge over its property does not end the life of the company to which the receiver has been appointed. It has been said that the company in such a case is 'anaesthetised' but may be restored to 'full conscious activity when the anaesthetic is no longer applied after the debts owing to the debenture holders have been paid' George Barker (Transport) Ltd v Eynon [1973] 3 All ER 374 at 380 (Mocatta J). Moreover, while receivers may effectively control a company's dealings with the outside world, receivership does not change the company's internal structure Hawkesbury Development Co Ltd v Landmark Finance Pty Ltd [1969] 2 NSW 782 (Street J). Street J there said (at 790): 
 
 structure continues to exist notwithstanding that the directors no longer have authority to exercise their ordinary business management functions. A valid receivership and management will ordinarily supersede, but not destroy, the company's own organs through which it conducts its affairs. The capacity of those organs to function bears a direct inverse relationship to the validity and scope of the receivership and management.'</text>

<tocase>Re Geneva Finance Ltd [1992] 7 WAR 496</tocase>
<text>In Re Geneva Finance Ltd [1992] 7 WAR 496, Owen J accepted that, upon the appointment of a receiver under a charge, there will be limited residual duties that a company's directors can carry out (at 510): 
 
 are residual duties which the directors must carry out. I do not doubt that they are limited in nature.' 
 

Importantly for the present case, his Honour also said (at 510): 
 
 
 
 
 is difficult to see why a director should be prevented from taking a step which he believes to be in the interests of the company unless that step would, in the reasonable opinion of the receiver, prejudice the proper administration of the receivership.'

The practical concern must be whether the exercise by a director of any power in the name of the company would interfere with the legitimate exercise by the receivers of their powers. As Owen J said in Re Geneva Finance (at 511): 
 
 real question is whether the directors, wishing to exercise a power which they would otherwise have, can do so without prejudicing the legitimate interests of the receiver and the secured creditor in the realisation of the asset.'

In the present case the receivers do not oppose the ASIC applications. There is no actual or apparent conflict between that non-opposition and Ms Carey-Hazell's proposed exercise, in the name of the companies, of their rights to oppose the winding up applications.

The existence of the power, conferred upon the receivers by s 420 of the Act, to defend the winding up applications, does not give rise to any such conflict. Nor does the assistance provided to ASIC by the receivers in the form of the affidavits sworn by Messrs Fraser and McMaster. Their cooperation with ASIC does not of itself involve any exercise of their powers which would be compromised by Ms Carey-Hazell's defence of the winding up applications in the names of the companies.

Absent Ms Carey-Hazell's participation as proposed, there is no contradictor to the winding up application. She asserts that there is a case to be made against the orders sought by ASIC. Quite apart from the question of her entitlement to bring that contention before the Court, it is in the interests of justice that as a director of the company she has an opportunity to make that case if she does so in accordance with the duties imposed upon her by the Act and not, for example, for some collateral purpose. In so doing, it should not be assumed that Ms Carey-Hazell will have any a priori entitlement to resort to the assets of the company for the purpose of funding legal representation in the winding up proceedings. I will, however, allow liberty to apply at the termination of the proceedings in that respect.

In my opinion the matter need be taken no further than this. There is no need for an application for leave under s 237 of the Act. Ms Carey-Hazell is at liberty, without the leave of the Court, to defend the winding up application in the name of each of the companies subject to the restrictions I have already mentioned in relation to access to the assets of the companies

For the preceding reasons I will permit Ms Carey-Hazell to continue to instruct legal representatives for the purpose of defending the applications in the name of the respondent companies. The costs of the motion in each case will be reserved. I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.

<tocase>Deangrove Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 173 ; (2001) 19 ACLC 595</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/173.html</AustLII>
<text>There may be a question whether the power conferred upon a receiver can displace all of a director's powers and functions for the duration of the receivership. Given that a receiver's powers must be exercised for the purposes of the appointment and the enforcement of the security under which appointment is made, it may be doubtful whether such a situation could arise even in theory. In Deangrove Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2001] FCA 173 ; (2001) 19 ACLC 595, Sackville J said (at 600): 
 
 general principle, at least so far as the usual form of debenture or charge is concerned, is that the appointment of receivers does not entirely displace the powers and authority of the directors.'</text>
