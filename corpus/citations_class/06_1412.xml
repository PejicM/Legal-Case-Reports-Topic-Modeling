<text>A minute of a proposed further amended statement of claim was filed by QPSX on 15 August 2006. In contemporaneous submissions it was described as containing a number of minor amendments to the amended statement of claim already before the Court. It is convenient to set out the proposed further amended statement of claim in outline. The summary that follows reproduces the summary of the amended statement of claim set out in QPSX Limited v Ericsson Australia Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 933 with adjustments to reflect the proposed additional amendments. The summary outlines the allegations made by QPSX. For convenience it is presented in narrative form. It involves no finding of fact.

QPSX, QPSX Communications and QPSX Europe each carry on business 'licensing and otherwise commercialising intellectual property'. That business is carried on in Australia and internationally by QPSX and QPSX Communications. QPSX Europe carries on its business outside Australia. The Ericsson parties and the Longreach parties are all involved in the manufacture and supply of communications products and services (pars 1 to 7).

QPSX Communications is the registered patentee of patents in the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. These are known as the QPSX Communications SAR Patents. QPSX Europe holds a patent in Germany, known as the QPSX Europe SAR Patent. Each of the patents relates to a method and apparatus for segmentation and reassembly technology. This involves the transmission of variable length messages on a network from a source to a destination in fixed length slots which include a header field and a message segment. Steps involved in the method are pleaded and registration dates and numbers of the various patents are particularised (par 8). Further patents are held by QPSX Communications in the USA, Australia, Canada, the UK and Germany (QP Patents). They involve a queuing protocol for a communications network for queued transmission of information in packets. The network composition is set out and particulars of the patents given (par 9). The method and apparatus which are the subjects of the SAR Patents and the protocol which is the subject of the QP Patents are integral parts of a Distributor Queue Dual Bus Technology which is also known as a Queued Packet and Synchronous Exchange Technology. This technology has been an integral part of the international telecommunications standard approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for metropolitan area networks since 1988 (par 10). Another protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is described as the networking standard for high speed, high capacity voice, data, video and graphics transmission. The method the subject of the SAR Patents is said to be a fundamental element of the ATM protocol and to be incorporated into the International ATM's Standards set by the International Telecommunications Union (par 11).</text>
