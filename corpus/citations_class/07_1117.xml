<text>1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the appellant a protection visa. The nature of the appellant's protection visa application, the reasons of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate are set out in more detail in the Federal Magistrate's decision, SZJXC v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FMCA 545 , which is available on the internet.

2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and his claim to be a refugee rests on an alleged fear of persecution based on his involvement in the practice of Falun Gong.

3 In his protection visa application he claimed to have been a member of Falun Gong since 1999. He said that after Falun Gong was banned by the authorities he would transport members for meetings and gatherings and provide emergency transportation. He claimed that in March 2005 while assisting the leader to escape from detention he was caught by police and held and interrogated for eight days and suffered "serious mental and physical torment". He claimed to have been forced to attend re-education classes and be supervised by what was called the 610 office. His job was "interfered many times," [ sic ] the truck he drove was checked frequently, members of his family were questioned many times and "we all lost our freedom".</text>
