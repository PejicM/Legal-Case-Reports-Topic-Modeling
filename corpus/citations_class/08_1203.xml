<text>10 As to the alleged "harsh approach" it is useful to recall, in my opinion, observations made by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 651, para 130: 
 The "jurisdictional fact" upon the presence of which jurisdiction is conditioned, need not be a "fact" in the ordinary meaning of that term. The precondition or criterion may consist of various elements and whilst the phrase "jurisdictional fact" is an awkward one in such circumstances it will, for convenience be retained in what follows. In Bankstown Municipal Council v Fripp, Isaacs and Rich JJ pointed out that, with the object of preventing litigation on questions of jurisdictional fact, the legislature may introduce into the criterion elements of opinion or belief by the decision-maker. Section 65 of the Act is an example. The prosecutor was entitled to the grant of a visa only if the Minister were "satisfied" that the prosecutor answered the description in section 36(2).</text>

<tocase>Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1976/24.html</AustLII>
<text>11 His Honour is there referring to particular sections in the Migration Act 1958 which remain pertinent. Later in that same case, having referred with approval to observations made by Gibbs J (as he then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 as to ways in which satisfaction-based decisions might be amenable to judicial review, Gummow J observed at page 654, para 137:
 This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question.

12 Those remarks seem to me to be apposite in the circumstances of this case. There were findings of fact, in part, based on questions of credibility. They seem to me to be findings that were reasonably open. That is not to say that another person hearing that same evidence might not have come to a different view. Whilst I can well understand that the Appellant might regard the findings made as indicative of a "harsh approach," in terms of legal principle, if those findings were reasonably open, it was incumbent on the part of the Federal Magistrate and is incumbent upon me to respect those findings and not interfere with them.

13 Ground 2 in the notice of appeal appears to conflate what might be described as a shorthand description of a test which informs an assessment as to whether a fear of persecution for a Convention reason is "well-founded," with a standard of proof that applies in civil proceedings in a court. The Tribunal though was not a court, but rather part of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth charged with reviewing on the merits a decision of another official of the Executive Government, namely the Minister's delegate.

14 In that review and in relation to the engendering of the "satisfaction" for which the statute made provision, it was obviously in the interest of a visa applicant to introduce material, which would engender the requisite "satisfaction." In this case, as it happened, the male Appellant, who was the person who gave evidence before the Tribunal, did not engender through that evidence the requisite satisfaction. That, though, as I have said, was a product of credibility findings that were in my opinion, reasonably open for reasons that were not irrational or illogical on the part of the Tribunal.

15 What followed from the findings of fact that the Tribunal came to make, was an absence of satisfaction that the persecution claimed by the Appellants was for a Convention reason. The consequential finding that there was no entitlement to a protection visa flowed automatically from this finding of a lack of satisfaction.

16 Ground 3 in the notice of appeal alleges that the Tribunal used particular information without affording opportunity to comment, contrary to s 424A of the Migration Act . As was pointed out on behalf of the Minister in submissions, an immediate difficulty with this ground, which was not cured in oral submissions on behalf of the Appellants, was an absence of particularisation of just what the "information" used by the Tribunal was.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>17 In oral submissions in respect of this ground, the male Appellant referred to a finding on the part of the Tribunal to allow him to identify his fear. That though did not amount to a particularisation of the "information" which ought to have been put to him and his wife. In dealing with s 424A , the learned Federal Magistrate made reference to what was said by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 at para 18. It was there observed that "information":
 "does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc".

18 Regard to that passage and to the Tribunal's reasons shows that there was no occasion for the Tribunal before making its decision to send to the Appellants a notice identifying information so as to comply with s 424A.

19 There were other grounds advanced in oral submissions. Reference was made to confusion on the part of the male Appellant in the proceeding before the Tribunal and to translation difficulties. As the Federal Magistrate rightly apprehended s 427 of the Migration Act required the Tribunal to provide an interpreter when a visa applicant was unable to give evidence without one. The learned Magistrate at para 32 of his reasons cites authority pertinent in that regard. His Honour also appreciated that an absence of adequate interpretation of proceedings might yield a violation of s 425 of the Migration Act in that the hearing conducted by the Tribunal would not be "real and meaningful." Again, at para 32 of his Honour's reasons, pertinent authority for this proposition is cited.

20 As the learned Magistrate rightly apprehended however, to make out such a challenge very particular evidence is needed. None was offered by the Appellants in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate. And there was nothing before me which would in any way have engendered a consideration of whether fresh evidence on such a subject could, or should, be allowed to be advanced on the hearing of the appeal.

21 There was also reference before me and it seems before the Federal Magistrate, to the nature of the hearing opportunity which was extended to the Appellants by the Tribunal. That opportunity in the end took the form of a hearing via video link from the police station at Griffith. That opportunity had been extended by the Tribunal after the male Appellant had signified to the Tribunal a difficulty based on illness in attending in person at Sydney. The appeal book contains in it a note by an officer of the Tribunal prior to the video link hearing to ask whether the male Appellant was attending the hearing tomorrow. According to the note he confirmed that he would be attending. There is nothing in that note, or in the Tribunal's reasons, to indicate that either when that contact was made, or at the hearing itself, any difficulty in relation to the Appellant's wife's attendance based on a fear of being present at a police station was put forward. Nor, it should be stated, is there any reference in the Tribunal's reasons of any complaint being voiced about the quality of interpretation which was offered at the hearing. Instead, in terms of evidence, one is left to look to the Tribunal's reasons, which do not on their face disclose any difficulty being noted either in respect of the attendance of the female Appellant or in translation. Section 425 of the Migration Act certainly requires when it is sought the extension to a visa applicant of a real and meaningful hearing. On the evidence, and I emphasise on the evidence, this is what the Tribunal did in this case.

22 In short then, whether one approaches this matter by reference to the formal grounds of appeal or other matters of complaint which emerged in the course of oral and written submissions on behalf of the Appellants, there is no merit in the challenge made to the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

23 The orders that I make formally are:
 
1. The appeal is dismissed.
 
2. The Appellants are to pay the First Respondent's costs of and incidental to the appeal which are fixed in the amount of $2300.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
