<tocase>Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/137.html</AustLII>
<text>6 Earlier on 25 August 2004, a complaint had been lodged with HREOC by the present applicant Mr Jeremy Jones, in his capacity as President of the said Executive Council of Australian Jewry. Contained within that letter of complaint was the following:
 
 'We write to lodge a formal complaint under the anti-racial-hatred provisions (Part IIA) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) in respect of material published on the Australian website http://www.biblebelievers.org.au ("The website"). 
 
 The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak representative organisation of the Australian Jewish community, complains that: 
 
 
 
 (i) the material on the website is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate Jewish Australians; and 
 
 (ii) one of the reasons that the material has been published is the race or national or ethnic origin of Jewish people, including Jewish Australians. 
 
 
 
 The specific matters complained of are as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. At http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/nl242.htm under the heading Lies and the First Anniversary of the 9/11 Conspiracy where the following words appear: 
 
 We have all seen how the holocaust hoax of six-million Jews claimed to have been gassed and cremated by Germany in World War I failed to deceive the mob in 1919. Whereas monopolistic control of the media, film, and a more boldly pursued holocaust hoax of six-million Jews claimed gassed and cremated by Germany in World War II has produced such powerful psychological and material results the entire world is enslaved to the beneficiaries of the lie and Temples of Equivocation affront the intelligence of humanity in major cities world-wide. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. At http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/wasthere.htm the following words appear: 
 
 The Holocaust has become the greatest instrument of sympathy which any nation has ever been able to use to gain support for wars, expansion and foreign-aid: This has made Israel the world's sixth strongest military power. The gravest threat to all this wealth and influence is the growing doubt over the question of whether or not a real holocaust of 6 million Jews actually took place. 
 
 3. At the " wasthere.htm " webpage the following words appear at the conclusion: 
 
 The main theme of Jewish fund-raising is the holocaust and has been for 38 years. When they don't use the holocaust the money collection sharply drops off. Thus the more the Press, TV and Hollywood promotes the holocaust the more money the United Jewish Appeal and other Zionist funds can extract from gullible people... Jewish leaders have discovered that by repeating holocaust stories over and over again they can instil a guilt complex within all Gentiles. This effectively silences most critics of Zionist political goals... Why doesn't the Jew-controlled press, TV and film industry give massive media attention to real victims and to proven holocausts of Gentiles in recent history. 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 In our submission, the above material breaches the provisions of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act because it conveys the following imputations: 
 
 
 
 (a) there is serious doubt that the Holocaust occurred; 
 (b) it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz; 
 (c) Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence; and 
 (d) some Jewish people, for improper purposes, including financial gain, exaggerated the number of Jews killed during World War II and the circumstances in which they were killed. 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 In this respect, we refer you to the case of Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 in which the Full Court of the Federal Court upheld the decision of Branson J at first instance that it is unlawful under Part IIA of the Act to publish material that conveys inter alia the imputations particularised above. 
 
 In our submission the material complained of conveys further imputations that are also in breach of Part IIA of the Act, namely that: 
 
 
 
 (a) Jews as a group are inherently malevolent towards other people; 
 (b) Jews as a group are engaged in a global conspiracy to dominate other people; and 
 (c) the State of Israel, as the State of the Jewish people, is a product of that conspiracy. 
 
 
 
 We further submit that none of the material complained of falls within the exemptions contained in s 18D of the Act. 
 
 You will be aware that this Council has brought two cases of racial hatred before HREOC in the past, one against Olga Scully and the other against Fredrick Toben. Both cases were ultimately heard and determined in favour of the Council by the Federal Court of Australia. In both cases the Court was satisfied that Jews, and Jewish Australians in particular, constitute a race or a national or ethnic group for the purposes of the Act. In the Toben case, the Court also found that the publication of material on the internet is an act that is done otherwise than in private for the purposes of s 18C of the Act. 
 
 We are seeking to have the material complained of removed from the internet and an apology to Australia's Jewish community being given publicly by the website's owner/s.' 


The reference in the above letter to 'Jewish Australians' and 'Australian Jewish Community ' may be observed. The connection of the BBC and of Mr Grigor-Scott to the foregoing Bible Believers' website will be further indicated in these reasons. The grounds or particulars of the complaint were at least implicitly adopted by Mr Jones therein and subsequently pursued in the present proceeding.

7 The foregoing decision on appeal in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515 was made on 27 June 2003 by a Full Federal Court comprising Carr, Kiefel and Allsop JJ in favour of Mr Jones as complainant also in those proceedings, in line with the decision at first instance of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629. Mr Jones, being the applicant for relief there involved, is the same representative person for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry as here constituted.

8 The circumstances leading to the Court's decision-making in Toben [2003] FCAFC 137 ; 129 FCR 515 were similar in substance to those which have led to the bringing of the present proceedings, and reflected a not dissimilar theme to the subject matter of complaint involving denial of the Holocaust which preceded and continued throughout World War II, an attack upon the widespread exposure of those circumstances on the part of Jewish people, and assertions that Jewish people exaggerated the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust for improper purposes. The language the subject of complaint in Toben was described by Carr J at [45] as 'deliberately provocative and inflammatory' and a 'flamboyantly-worded challenge' , and lacking in good faith, those being descriptions adopted by the applicant in relation to its case against the respondents.

9 I observe moreover that in the concurring appellate judgment of Kiefel J in Toben [2003] FCAFC 137 ; 129 FCR 515 , her Honour concluded, at [77], that:
 
 ' [t] he likelihood that the appellant wrote only to pursue the truth of those subjects is rendered implausible by this unnecessary aside, which appears to have no real purpose in such a debate other than to disparage Jewish people. In my view, it confirms what a reading of the article as a whole raises as a prospect, namely that it was published with Jewish people in mind, as those responsible for concocting the Holocaust and, indeed, as an attack upon them'. 


A similar approach has been adopted by Mr Jones in his presentation of the present case. Her Honour agreed with Carr J that there was no proof of the appellant's (ie Toben's) good faith.

10 In the further concurring judgment of Allsop J, his Honour made the following observation at [98]:
 
 
 '98. The above history (taken from the works of scholars, Lerner and Schwelb, working contemporaneously with events) is given to illuminate what it was that the international community was dealing with. By this time in the twentieth century, the nations of the world had experienced a century stained by, amongst other catastrophes, racial slaughter, pogroms, forced removal and relocations of whole peoples, religious and ethnic genocide, and were undergoing the trauma involved in the break-up and disintegration of colonial empires and national and regional political structures based on racial characteristics. The unexpected recrudescence, in the winter of 1959-1960, of some of the most recent and horrific manifestations of racist behaviour enlivened the world community to act swiftly and (with an inevitable degree of variation in political perspective) unanimously, to take steps towards the elimination [his Honour's emphasis] of the perceived evil. The perceived evil was all [again his Honour's emphasis] forms of racial discrimination and racial prejudice, the manifestation of which had been, in recent generations, at times horrifically violent and strident, at times overt, and at times less overt and less brutal, but nevertheless insidiously pervasive. In any form, it was recognised, by all nations in the international community, to strike at the dignity and equality of all human beings.' 
 


Thereafter at [100]-[101], his Honour added:
 
 
 '100. Racial hatred was one form or manifestation of the perceived evil. Unhappily, it was a form with which the nations in the General Assembly in 1960 to 1965 were all too familiar. It was the form of the perceived evil most likely to lead to brutality and violence, but it was not the only form of the perceived evil antithetical to the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings upon which the Charter of the United Nations was based. It was to all [his Honour's emphasis] such forms and manifestations that the Convention was directed. 
 
 101 The definition of "racial discrimination" in Art 1 of the Convention confirmed the wide aim of the Convention: 
 
 
 
 Article 1 
 
 1. In this Convention, the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.' 


His Honour then referred at some length to the public discussion and debate, and to issues as to in-roads into freedom of speech, which led to the enactment of the RD Act in Australia.

11 The material relied on, in particular, by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry was The Bible Believers' Newsletter #242 , (the copy before the Court bearing the date 9 May 2005). It is 15 pages in length and contains the following segments ( inter alia ):
 
 '(i) an introduction commencing 'We focus on the PRESENT Truth what Jesus is doing NOW...' 
 
 
 'Seven Pillars of Jewish Denial' 
 'Landmark Court Ruling Against Holocaust Denier' 
 'September 11 US Government Accused' 
 'Thinking Up a Pretext for War' 
 'Lies and the First Anniversary of the 9/11 Conspiracy' 
 
 
 (ii) the following concluding material: 
 
 
 'Pass it on... Send this article to someone you know Brother Anthony Grigor-Scott is a non-denominational minister. He has ministered full-time since 1981, primarily to other ministers and their congregations in other countries. He pastors Bible Believers' tiny congregation, and is available to teach in your Church.' 
 

Below that appeared reference to the details of the BBC website.

12 The website also contained the following material:
 
(i) an article by Dr E R Fields headed ' Was there Really a Holocaust '?
 
(ii) an abridgment of a book titled ' The International Jew , The World's Foremost Problem ' (the author whereof was stated to be Henry Ford Senior) containing the ' Editor's Forward ' of one page in length, together with a summary of the life of Henry Ford contained in a journal apparently published, and which referred to the circumstances that Mr Ford ' was accused by many Jews' and 'was a resolute opponent of Roosevelt's policy of "controls" in industry and commerce ...'.

13 Following upon that material being placed before HREOC, Mr Grigor-Scott purportedly on behalf of the BBC or in any event in the name of the BBC, wrote further to HREOC the following communications in support of his request that it terminate what he described as 'Mr Jones unwarranted complaint' (now forming Exhibit A1 in the present proceedings):
 
 (i) letter dated 5 November 2004; 
 (ii) letter dated 18 November 2004 (which comprised in all some 11 pages); 
 (iii) email dated 19 November 2004; 
 (iv) letter dated 18 January 2005.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629</tocase>
<text>7 The foregoing decision on appeal in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515 was made on 27 June 2003 by a Full Federal Court comprising Carr, Kiefel and Allsop JJ in favour of Mr Jones as complainant also in those proceedings, in line with the decision at first instance of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629. Mr Jones, being the applicant for relief there involved, is the same representative person for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry as here constituted.

22 Whether the first respondent has legal personality upon the basis of being the registrant of that domain name may be a moot point. The applicant submitted that the BBC was an unincorporated association and 'does not appear to have any corporate identity or existence'; the applicant supported that proposition with evidence that the BBC is not listed in either ASIC or Australian Business Registrar records. The applicant made the further submission that in Jones 71 ALD 629, the first respondent, 'the Adelaide Institute', was also found to be an unincorporated association in the control of the second respondent, Mr Toben. In Jones 71 ALD 629, Branson J found, at [66], as follows:
 
 'The respondent has made it plain during the course of the proceeding that he does not dispute that he controls the Adelaide Institute. He describes himself as the director of the Adelaide Institute and in correspondence utilises the letterhead of the Adelaide Institute [...] I am satisfied that the respondent is responsible for the actions of the Adelaide Institute. In particular I am satisfied that at all material times it has been the respondent who has caused the material which is displayed on the websites of the Adelaide Institute to be displayed on those websites.' 


The applicant observed that the first respondent's letterhead identified the second respondent, Mr Grigor-Scott, in the email contact as ags@biblebelievers.org.au. In any event of course, Mr Grigor-Scott has legal personality as a natural person and he at least has been properly constituted as a respondent to the proceedings, and can be appropriately sued by the applicant.

23 As already indicated, neither The Bible Believers' Church (which I have foreshadowed is to be abbreviated as the 'BBC'), nor Mr Grigor-Scott, filed a notice of appearance with the Registry of this Court, whether in accordance with the Federal Court Rules or at all. As I have foreshadowed, the BBC does not appear to have been registered anywhere in Australia, whether as any form of incorporated or deemed legal entity created under the auspices of Federal or State legislation in Australia or otherwise, though as already exemplified as well as explained, it does operate a website. As I have foreshadowed, it would seem that the BBC has no legal personality, being at most an unincorporated association and merely an emanation of Mr Grigor-Scott, which is probably the more accurate description. There is no evidence of any other person being a member of the BBC, whether by way of a register of members or otherwise. Nevertheless in the light of the way in which the proceedings have been structured and the litigation conducted by each of Mr Jones in his stated represented capacity as applicant and of Mr Grigor-Scott as respondent, the Court record in respect of the proceedings has continued as a matter of expediency to be as it presently appears in the heading to these reasons for judgment.

24 Prior to the filing and service of the amended statement of claim by Mr Jones, which remained in operation for the purpose of the hearing, the proceedings had been on 20 September 2005 the subject of what may be described imprecisely as preliminary proceedings. On that occasion Mr Grigor-Scott informed the Court that '... the Church is not a justiciable body' and that '... nobody can appear for it', and hence he was not seeking to appear for the BBC. Notwithstanding that neither respondent had filed an appearance, counsel for the applicant informed the Court that the applicant did not seek to exclude either respondent in those circumstances from objective relief. Mr Grigor-Scott explained to the Court on that occasion the following:
 
 ' [BBC] is not a legal entity. It's not a corporation. It's not registered with anybody. It's just a group of believers. It's just part of the Body of Christ. As such, it cannot sue, neither can it be served a Summons'. 

On that purported basis he said that he appeared for himself alone.

59 Mr Grigor-Scott's case has failed moreover to confront and answer the nature and the extent of the findings and reasoning of this Court in Jones v Toben , both at first instance and on appeal, to which authority I have of course earlier made reference. There was ample corresponding support in the present case for the making here of similar findings to those made in Jones v Toben . Moreover it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of the second respondent's assertions regarding the Holocaust. Hely J observed in Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [176] - [177] as follows:
 
 
 '176. I am not in a position to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the claim made by the author of the pamphlet that the Holocaust never occurred is true or not. I do not have the evidence which would be needed to enable me to make that determination, assuming that the matter is susceptible of proof in a court. As Gray J observed in Irving v Penguin Books Ltd [2000] EWHC QB 115 at [1.3] , that is a task for historians whose role it is to provide an accurate narrative of past events; whereas my role is to determine whether the public dissemination of the leaflet by Mrs Scully in Launceston contravenes s 18C of the RDA. 
 
 177. In my view, a leaflet that conveys an imputation that Jews are fraudulent, liars, immoral, deceitful and part of a conspiracy to defraud the world is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate Jews in Australia. This would be so regardless of whether or not the leaflet made mention of the Holocaust. However, the fact that the imputation arises in the context of a debate about the Holocaust makes it even more likely that the leaflet would cause offence. This is particularly so owing to the inflammatory language used in the leaflet, as well as the fact that it is unambiguously dismissive of the Jewish view of the Holocaust. I therefore find that this leaflet contravenes s 18C.' 
 
 

I think it is appropriate for me to refrain from addressing further what appears in the evidence as to Mr Grigor-Scott's apparent views concerning the occurrence or otherwise of the Holocaust.

65 In the result the application by Mr Jones made on his own part and on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry should be granted, and the relief sought thereby should be ordered in principle. Given however that the BBC does not have legal personality, not being an incorporated entity as I have earlier explained, no order may be made against what is merely a name or description, though of course restraints may be made against future conduct of Mr Grigor-Scott as to causing or committing proscribed conduct to occur, including proscribed conduct undertaken in the name of the BBC. I should add that the applicant's amended application sought inter alia an order that the second respondent, Mr Grigor-Scott, deliver to the applicant a written statement of apology. I consider such an order to be inappropriate. I refer in that regard to the observation of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106], where her Honour stated as follows:
 
 '...I do not consider it appropriate to seek to compel the respondent to articulate a sentiment that he plainly enough does not feel. As Hely J pointed out in Jones v Scully at [245] , "prima facie the idea of ordering someone to make an apology is a contradiction in terms"...' 
 
 

The second respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings, including any previously reserved costs. 

 I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

<tocase>Miller v Wertheim [2002] FCAFC 156</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/156.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The applicant submitted that 'Jews in Australia comprise a group of people with an 'ethnic origin' for the purposes of the Act...'. In support of that proposition, the applicant relied on Miller v Wertheim [2002] FCAFC 156 at [14] , where Heerey, Lindgren and Merkel JJ observed as follows:
 
 '... it can be readily accepted that Jewish people in Australia can comprise a group of people with an "ethnic origin" for the purposes of the Act (see King-Ansell v Police [1979] 2 NZLR 531)....' 
 
 

I agree with that submission by the applicant, and find that Jews in Australia are a group of people with a common "ethnic origin" within the meaning of s 18C of the RD Act.</text>

<tocase>Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Anor (2004) 135 CLR 105</tocase>
<text>48 The question as to the reasonableness or otherwise of conduct for the purposes of s 18D was explained by a Full Federal Court in Bropho v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and Anor (2004) 135 CLR 105 comprising French, Lee and Carr JJ. My attention was drawn by counsel for the applicant to the following passages in the reasons for decision, being pars [80]-[82], [96] and [102] in the reasons for judgment of French J, [141] and [144] in the reasons of Lee J and [178] in the reasons of Carr J. I would draw attention in particular to the formulation of the reasonableness requirement addressed by French J in those passages in his reasons, and in particular the following in [80]-[81] concerning 'the public interest':
 
 
 '80. An Act will be done reasonably in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work if it is done for the purpose and in a manner calculated to advance the purpose of the artistic expression in question. An act is done reasonably in relation to statements, publications, discussions or debates for genuine academic, artistic or scientific purposes, if it bears a rational relationship to those purposes. The publication of a genuine scientific paper on the topic of genetic differences between particular human populations might, for one reason or another, be insulting or offensive to a group of people. Its discussion at a scientific conference would no doubt be reasonable. Its presentation to a meeting convened by a racist organisation and its use to support a view that a particular group of persons is morally or otherwise "inferior" to another by reason of their race or ethnicity, may not be a thing reasonably done in relation to para (b) of s 18D. 
 
 
 
 
 
 81. The same kind of criterion may be applied to acts done in reports or comments on events or matters of public interest. A presentation of a report or comment which highlights, in a way that is gratuitously insulting or offensive, a matter that is irrelevant to the purported question of public interest under discussion may not be done "reasonably". A feature article on criminal activity said to be associated with a particular ethnic group would in the ordinary course be expected to fall within the protection of para (c). If it were written in a way that offered gratuitous insults by, for example, referring to members of the group in derogatory racist slang terms, then it would be unlikely that the comment would be offered "reasonably".' 
 
 

The second respondent Mr Grigor-Scott made the following assertion in his submission document bearing date 25 September 2005 ( ante ):
 
 
 'Everything that has been said or done by the respondents, or either of them, about which complaint has been made in this matter, has been said or done reasonably and in good faith for the purpose of making a fair and accurate report of events or [sic] matters of public interest or had been the expression of a genuine belief about such events or matters held by the person making the comment'.

49 As to the statutory notion of 'good faith', I would draw attention to what was said by French J at [96] and [102] on that subject in his majority judgment:
 
 
 '96. It follows from the preceding discussion that good faith may be tested both subjectively and objectively. Want of subjective good faith, ie, seeking consciously to further an ulterior purpose of racial vilification may be sufficient to forfeit the protection of s 18D. But good faith requires more than subjective honesty and legitimate purposes. It requires, under the aegis of fidelity or loyalty to the relevant principles in the Act, a conscientious approach to the task of honouring the values asserted by the Act. This may be assessed objectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 102. A person acting in the exercise of a protected freedom of speech or expression under 18D will act in good faith if he or she is subjectively honest, and objectively viewed, has taken a conscientious approach to advancing the exercising of that freedom in a way that is designed to minimise the offence or insult, humiliation or intimidation suffered by people affected by it. That is one way, not necessarily the only way, of acting in good faith for the purpose of s 18D. On the other hand, a person who exercises the freedom carelessly disregarding or willfully blind to its effect upon people who will be hurt by it or in such a way as to enhance that hurt may be found not to have been acting in good faith.'

50 What was next submitted to the Court on the occasion of Mr Grigor-Scott's attempted re-opening of the evidence in the case was a large bundle of documents. That course of re-opening was opposed by counsel for the applicant upon the basis that Mr Grigor-Scott's affidavits of 7 September 2006 and 11 October 2006 were in any event of no relevance to the defence by the respondents of the proceedings, and otherwise to any issue in the proceedings relevantly to the statutory scheme. Moreover it was emphasised that the respondents had already passed up ample opportunity to present any such material to the extent that it was relevant, and in any event, no relevance to the issues properly arising had been demonstrated by Mr Grigor-Scott.

51 By way of rejoinder, Mr Grigor-Scott pointed broadly to what appeared on the BBC's website and 'to ... what I have got on the computer here', that being however a response of no utility, much less an explanation as to how any specific instance of his website documentation bore upon the issues arising, or for what reason. It is convenient at this point that my impression was that Mr Grigor-Scott's purported unspecific tender of vast numbers of unidentified documents might operate to draw out the current proceedings indefinitely. Moreover Mr Grigor-Scott continued to repeat in the course of his purported address to the Court vaguely or at best broadly expressed criticisms of the applicant's case of obviously no assistance, such as that '[t]here were a whole series of implausible submissions ...', that 'they have no case', that there was 'no evidence of breach of the statute', that 'the applicant is misusing the Act in order to promote the objectives of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith', that 'my church has done nothing wrong', and that the applicant's case was 'untruthful'.

61 I have recorded in some detail Mr Grigor-Scott's assertions and submissions, advanced as they were from the Bar Table and which were contained in written material which he sought to tender, inclusively of his short purported written submissions dated 25 September 2006. He maintained to the Court that all that he had done in the course of the proceedings the subject of complaint was undertaken ' .... to determine reasonableness and good faith', in line with the operation of s 18D of the RD Act upon which he repeatedly claimed reliance. I should further record additionally that on the concluding day's hearing, I rejected the admissibility of the remaining evidence of 7 September 2006 and 11 October 2006, which he sought to tender into evidence, as 'oppressive and irrelevant', though I nevertheless agreed to treat his relatively short two and a half page 'submission' of 25 September 2006 as having been placed before the Court for consideration. By that document, Mr Grigor-Scott asserted reliance upon what appeared in the judgments of the Full Federal Court in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; (2004) 135 FCR 105, and specifically at [79] and [101]-[102] in the case of French J and [178] in the case of Carr J, though I am unable to discern how those passages conceivably assisted his case.

62 As foreshadowed, counsel for the applicant placed reliance upon what appeared in the reasons for judgment in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; 135 FCR 105 of French J at [96] and [102], of Lee J (dissenting) at [141], and of Carr J at [178], and contrary to the submission of Mr Grigor-Scott, counsel for the applicant explained further by supplementary outline of written submissions the basis for his invocation of those principles enunciated in Bropho [2004] FCAFC 16 ; 135 FCR 105 which he thereupon cited. Those principles related to the statutory tests as to ' reasonableness', 'public interest' and 'good faith' , in relation to which tests it was submitted by counsel that Mr Grigor-Scott's case fell well short, being a submission which in my opinion, in the light of the matters I have recorded in these reason, was clearly correct. Mr Grigor-Scott's purported invocation of s 18D was made incidentally by way of a so-called written 'submission', and not by way of formal application for relief in the form prescribed by the Federal Court Rules .

63 I should record for completeness that Mr Grigor-Scott sought to contend in his belated 25 September 2006 document that '[t]he matters about which the complaints in this matter have been made do not relate to every "Jew", but are part of an academic or public interest discussion in relation to "Zionist" policies and practices'. I have not been able to identify, much less rationalise however, the existence of any such discussion in the context of the present proceedings and of the conduct complained of by the applicant which has led thereto. I agree with the response of counsel for the applicant that the submission is misconceived in its purported aspects.

64 I should acknowledge that by letter bearing date 1 August 2006 written very belatedly by Mr Grigor-Scott, there was sent, without prior approval of a direction or otherwise of the Court, a comprehensive five page closely typed letter. This document bore implicitly the fact of a likely receipt by him of legal assistance, by at least the latter stage of the proceedings. It included what may be described as an unfortunate hotchpot of repetition, abuse of the applicant's case, misstatements, and otherwise irrelevant material that constituted no sufficient basis for specific consideration in the course of these reasons.</text>

<text>59 Mr Grigor-Scott's case has failed moreover to confront and answer the nature and the extent of the findings and reasoning of this Court in Jones v Toben , both at first instance and on appeal, to which authority I have of course earlier made reference. There was ample corresponding support in the present case for the making here of similar findings to those made in Jones v Toben . Moreover it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of the second respondent's assertions regarding the Holocaust. Hely J observed in Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [176] - [177] as follows:
 
 
 '176. I am not in a position to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the claim made by the author of the pamphlet that the Holocaust never occurred is true or not. I do not have the evidence which would be needed to enable me to make that determination, assuming that the matter is susceptible of proof in a court. As Gray J observed in Irving v Penguin Books Ltd [2000] EWHC QB 115 at [1.3] , that is a task for historians whose role it is to provide an accurate narrative of past events; whereas my role is to determine whether the public dissemination of the leaflet by Mrs Scully in Launceston contravenes s 18C of the RDA. 
 
 177. In my view, a leaflet that conveys an imputation that Jews are fraudulent, liars, immoral, deceitful and part of a conspiracy to defraud the world is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate Jews in Australia. This would be so regardless of whether or not the leaflet made mention of the Holocaust. However, the fact that the imputation arises in the context of a debate about the Holocaust makes it even more likely that the leaflet would cause offence. This is particularly so owing to the inflammatory language used in the leaflet, as well as the fact that it is unambiguously dismissive of the Jewish view of the Holocaust. I therefore find that this leaflet contravenes s 18C.' 
 
 

I think it is appropriate for me to refrain from addressing further what appears in the evidence as to Mr Grigor-Scott's apparent views concerning the occurrence or otherwise of the Holocaust.

65 In the result the application by Mr Jones made on his own part and on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry should be granted, and the relief sought thereby should be ordered in principle. Given however that the BBC does not have legal personality, not being an incorporated entity as I have earlier explained, no order may be made against what is merely a name or description, though of course restraints may be made against future conduct of Mr Grigor-Scott as to causing or committing proscribed conduct to occur, including proscribed conduct undertaken in the name of the BBC. I should add that the applicant's amended application sought inter alia an order that the second respondent, Mr Grigor-Scott, deliver to the applicant a written statement of apology. I consider such an order to be inappropriate. I refer in that regard to the observation of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106], where her Honour stated as follows:
 
 '...I do not consider it appropriate to seek to compel the respondent to articulate a sentiment that he plainly enough does not feel. As Hely J pointed out in Jones v Scully at [245] , "prima facie the idea of ordering someone to make an apology is a contradiction in terms"...' 
 
 

The second respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings, including any previously reserved costs. 

 I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.
