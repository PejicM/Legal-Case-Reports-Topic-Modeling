<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 605</tocase>
<text>In the present context the word "interlocutory" must be used with caution. Palmer J pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 605 that when granting an injunction under s 1324(1) or (4) of the Act the Court is not exercising the traditional equitable jurisdiction to grant final or interlocutory injunctions. While considerations that are customarily relevant to the exercise of that jurisdiction may be also relevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 1324(1) or (4), the dominant consideration in cases under the section is the purpose of the provision of the Act that is said to have been contravened.

Unfortunately, to a large extent the parties have not joined issue in their submissions. HPM emphasises that the purpose of Pt 5C of the Act is to establish a r&eacute;gime to protect those who contemplate acquiring or have acquired interests in MISs. Counsel for HPM submits that the arrangement established and implemented by the defendants was the very kind of arrangement that the legislature intended should be registered and regulated by Pt 5C. This submission, however, assumes what is to be decided that there was an MIS in the first place.

Counsel for the defendants, on the other hand, places heavy reliance on s 564 of the Act. That section expressly contemplates the possibility that a creditor or creditors will indemnify a liquidator and so enable the liquidator to recover property which would not otherwise have been recovered. The section empowers the Court to make such orders as it deems just with respect to the distribution of the property recovered with a view to giving the funding creditor or creditors an advantage over others in consideration of the risk assumed. Counsel correctly points out that the notion of "creditors" for this purpose includes contingent creditors. It seems not to be disputed by HPM that the various investor-borrowers are contingent creditors of TROM or Merilbah or of both of them.</text>

<tocase>Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (2009) 260 ALR 643</tocase>
<text>The parties made submissions for and against the proposition that the arrangement established by the defendants constituted an unlawful MIS. HPM's submissions were founded upon the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (2009) 260 ALR 643. More precisely, HPM's submissions were founded on the majority judgment of Sundberg and Dowsett JJ in that case Jacobson J dissented. Over all, two Judges of this Court, the majority in the Full Court, considered that the litigation funding arrangement in that case constituted an MIS as defined in s 9 of the Act, while the primary Judge Finkelstein J, and Jacobson J in dissent in the Full Court, considered that it did not.</text>

<tocase>National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2009/152.html</AustLII>
<text>I referred the parties to the more recent decision of the Full Court in National Australia Bank Ltd v Norman [2009] FCAFC 152 delivered on 30 October 2009, on which the parties also made submissions.

I do not propose to embark upon a detailed consideration of the various elements of an MIS as defined in s 9 of the Act. It suffices to say that I do not think that either of the authorities named above or others to which I was referred demonstrate conclusively that the arrangement in the present case was or was not an MIS. Both possibilities are arguable.

It seems to me that for the purpose of this application for urgent interim relief, I should proceed on the assumptions that arguably funds have been and are to be raised under an unlawful MIS and that arguably the assignments are invalid and HPM lacks title to them.

In his submissions, counsel for HPM has stated in a different connection that neither TROM nor Merilbah has any assets from which to pay damages and that TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are not a source of recovery. I infer that unless the funds already raised from investor-debtors are made available, the question of the validity of the assignments will not be able to tested. TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are officers of the Court. So far as the evidence reveals, no investor-debtor who has provided funding or been asked to provide it is complaining. I appreciate that it can be said that the investor-debtors would not be aware of circumstances giving them a right to complain. For example, apparently they would not know that HOL has misrepresented to them that if the assignments are held to be invalid, they will definitely obtain a discharge of their debts. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is aware of the present dispute but has not sought an injunction restraining the defendants from approaching the investor-debtors.

Several questions of concern are raised by the present application for interim relief. Who are the creditors (including, but not limited to, contingent creditors) of TROM and Merilbah who will benefit from a determination that the assignments are invalid? What is the ground of their status as creditors or contingent creditors? What is the fund that it is hoped will provide the basis of a distribution to creditors? Have TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators been encouraging investor-debtors to make claims and thereby to become contingent creditors? How can TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators support a result that all investor-debtors be released from their debts? Has there been an abuse by TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators of their powers in seeking to create challenges to the validity of the assignments in circumstances in which, if it be the case, the only persons who will benefit in terms of payment of money will be themselves?</text>
