<text>It was also submitted on behalf of Mr Watson that the privilege against self-incrimination has a role to play in related civil cases. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd [2007] FCA 1620 ; (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [9] (p 36), Finkelstein J said: 
 
 In the case of self-incrimination privilege the defendant must establish that the provision of information or the production of documents in the civil case leads to a real and appreciable risk of a criminal prosecution before the privilege can be invoked: Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation v Westinghouse Electric Corporation [1978] AC 547 at 574; Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre [1982] AC 380 at 392; Sorby 152 CLR at 290, 294. That will not be difficult to show when, as here, the proceeding is aimed at proving that the directors engaged in conduct which would establish, or go a long way toward establishing, that they had also committed criminal acts.

I do not disagree with these statements of principle.

It must, however, be remembered that the examinations which are recorded in the transcripts were conducted as part of an investigation undertaken by ASIC pursuant to s 13 and ss 19 27 of the ASIC Act. In examinations conducted as part of such an investigation, the ASIC inspector may require the examinee to answer a question that is put to the examinee at the examination which is relevant to a matter that ASIC is investigating (s 21(3)). The examination is to take place in private (s 22) and a written record of the examination is to be created and kept (s 24). Under s 25(3), ASIC may, subject to such conditions as it may wish to impose, give to a person a copy of the written record of the examination.</text>

<tocase>Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 ; (2008) 235 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/36.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the examinees have submitted that express undertakings should be required by the Court in the circumstances of the present case and that the precise terms upon which access is to be granted should be spelled out in order to avoid any future misunderstanding as to those terms. Counsel for the applicants resists the imposition of such a term on the basis that it is unnecessary. He referred me to passages in Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 ; (2008) 235 CLR 125 which make clear that the implied undertaking not to use documents produced under compulsion in litigation for any purpose other than the purposes of the litigation for which they were produced is a substantive obligation and need not be incorporated into an express undertaking.

Whilst the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicants in this respect may well be correct, I do think that there is some advantage in articulating with precision the precise terms upon which access is to be granted. This is not out of any concern that the legal representatives in the present case would not both understand and respect their obligations under the implied undertaking. It is simply the best way to ensure that all persons to whom access is granted have a very clear understanding of the terms upon which that access is being granted. I prefer to impose a requirement that express undertakings be given.

The parties are also in broad agreement that I should provide that notice be given to the examinees if the transcripts are intended to be deployed at the trial. I will accommodate such a term in the orders which I will make.

Finally, there is a dispute between the applicants, on the one hand, and the respondent, on the other hand, as to whether or not any claims for legal professional privilege intended to be made by the respondent should be dealt with by way of affidavit or by letter in the first instance. Given the fact that the commencement of the trial is fast approaching, I think that the best course is for the applicants' proposal to be adopted. I will therefore incorporate the applicants' suggested orders in this respect in the orders which I will make.

For all of the above reasons, I think that the interests of justice are best served by granting access to the transcripts to certain named legal representatives of the parties and to do so on strict terms as to confidentiality. I propose to make orders accordingly.</text>

<tocase>R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCCA/1999/86.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Studdy SC focussed more upon matters of confidentiality and relevance. He submitted (correctly, I think) that the applicant for the subpoena must: 
 
 ... identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought and establish that it is on the cards that the documents will materially assist his case 
 

 
( R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at [11] per Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing). There was evidence before me which satisfied me that the contents of the transcripts were very likely to be at the heart of the subject matter of the case.

Originally, Mr Studdy SC urged upon me that I should send off the transcripts to an independent barrister with a request (or perhaps subject to an order) that that barrister read all of the transcripts and come to a view by reference to the pleadings which particular questions and answers might have some conceivable relevance to the issues in the case as discerned by that barrister. He or she would then mask those portions of the transcript which were considered to be irrelevant. During the course of argument, I indicated to Mr Studdy SC that I saw many difficulties with that approach. In the end, notwithstanding that he did not abandon the suggestion, he did not press it as vigorously as he had at the outset. I am not prepared to engage some third party in the manner and for the purposes suggested by Mr Studdy SC. Mr Studdy SC then urged upon me that I should perform the task that he said the independent barrister should perform. I decline to take that course. It is unnecessary. In addition, the respondent objects to my looking at the transcripts, in any event.

All Counsel focussed on questions of confidentiality. These matters are more appropriately dealt with when I come to consider the terms upon which access might be granted.</text>

<tocase>Reid v Howard (1995) 184 CLR 1</tocase>
<text>Counsel for Michael Watson submitted that the privilege against self-incrimination (of which the right to silence is part) is a fundamental bulwark of liberty which is deeply ingrained in the common law of Australia. In support of that submission, Counsel cited Reid v Howard (1995) 184 CLR 1.

In Reid v Howard 184 CLR 1 , former clients of a chartered accountant, having learned that he was misappropriating funds, applied for orders in the Supreme Court of New South Wales compelling him to disclose information about certain assets. The accountant claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Court of Appeal accepted the claim for privilege but made orders compelling disclosure upon conditions intended to protect the accountant from the risk of prosecution. The Crown was not a party to the making of the orders. The High Court held that there is no scope for an exception to privilege against self-incrimination, in criminal or civil proceedings, other than by statute or waiver.

At 184 CLR 5, Deane J said: 
 
 Unless it appears that the assertion of potential incrimination is unsustainable, a claim to the benefit of the privilege cannot, in the absence of statutory warrant, properly be disregarded or overridden by the courts.

In Reid v Howard 184 CLR at 11, the majority who delivered the joint judgment (Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) said that the privilege against self-incrimination was not simply a rule of evidence but was " a basic and substantive common law right ". Their Honours went on to hold that there was no scope for an exception to the privilege other than by statute (at 184 CLR 14).

In terms of principle, the ASIC Act has modified the privilege against self-incrimination to some extent. As envisaged by the relevant statements of principle in Reid v Howard 184 CLR 1, the scope of the privilege has, to some extent, been modified by statute and that modification of the privilege is effective. However, the answers to the questions asked during the course of the relevant examinations which are recorded in the transcripts cannot be used in criminal proceedings other than as permitted by s 68(3) of the ASIC Act.

This is not a case of a court in a civil proceeding seeking to override the privilege before the privilege can be invoked. The simple fact is that, to the extent permitted by law, the privilege in its modified form has already been invoked.

For these reasons, I do not think that the examinees have made out their submission that access to the transcripts should be denied as a matter of law.</text>
