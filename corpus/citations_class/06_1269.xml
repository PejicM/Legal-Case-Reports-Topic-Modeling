<text>I was referred to what Windeyer J said in Shell concerning 'deceptive similarity', quoted at [25] supra, and to what was said by Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills at 658: 
 
 'In deciding this question, the marks ought not, of course, to be compared side by side. An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought. The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same. The effect of spoken description must be considered. If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods, then similarities both of sound and of meaning may play an important part. The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected. Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution. On the other hand, exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The cause of business and the way in which a particular class of goods are sold gives, it may be said, the setting, and the habits and observations of men considered in the mass affords the standard. Evidence of actual cases of deception, if forthcoming, is of great weight.'</text>

<text>I was also referred to the recent decision in Beecham Group at [54] [56] where the Court considered the established principles in Southern Cross and confirmed that the approach adopted by the Court is to attempt to estimate the 'effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers' and to determine whether there is a 'real, and tangible danger of confusion'.</text>

<text>Further, the respondent submitted that any emphasis solely on the similarities would be misconceived. In considering marks as a whole where they contain common words, one should look primarily to those aspects of the marks that are not common: Cooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v Sigmund Pumps Ltd [1952] HCA 15 ; (1952) 86 CLR 536 at 538 539; Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd v Australian Chinese Newspapers Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 38 at [40]; Chantelle v Kabushiki Kaisha Chandeal (1996) 36 IPR 549 at 568; and Re London Lubricants (1920) Ltd's Application [1925] 42 RPC 264 at 279.

But while greater weight may have to be given to some aspect of a registered mark over other aspects in assessing the impression it may create for the determination of the ultimate question whether another mark so nearly resembles that registered mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion the authorities are quite clear that the marks have to be considered as a whole: Cooper Engineering at 538; SAP Australia at [27] and [41].

The two marks, 'STARR Partners' and 'Star REALTY', along with their respective star logos, are neither visually nor aurally similar. Indeed, they are quite distinct. One is reminded of what the High Court said in Cooper Engineering at 538 539: 
 
 'In the present case the prefix of the two words is the same word "Rain", but the suffix "master" differs from the suffix "King" in appearance and in sound. This makes the two marks as a whole quite distinct and the marks must be judged as a whole. "Rainmaster" does not look like "Rain King" and it does not sound like it. There is not a single common letter in master and in King. The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for the appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising from the two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or supremacy of the article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to falling rain or artificial rain as it was called during the argument. But it is obvious that trademarks, especially word marks, could be quite unlike and yet convey the same idea of the superiority or some particular suitability of an article for the work it was intended to do. To refuse an application for registration on this ground would be to give the proprietor of a registered trademark a complete monopoly of all words conveying the same idea as his trademark. The fact that two marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create a deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or sounded alike were likely to deceive.'

Similarly here, the fact that the two marks convey the same idea, a star in word and a star in logo, is not sufficient in itself to create a deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or sounded alike were likely to deceive. But that is not this case and for that reason, the applicant's submissions based on the same idea should be rejected.

At the conclusion of its judgment in Cooper Engineering , the High Court said (at 539): 
 
 'The learned registrar was right in holding that the only similarity between the two marks is the common prefix "Rain" and that this similarity is not sufficient to create a reasonable likelihood of deception when the remaining portions of the marks are so different.'</text>

<tocase>Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd v Australian Chinese Newspapers Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 38</tocase>
<text>Further, the respondent submitted that any emphasis solely on the similarities would be misconceived. In considering marks as a whole where they contain common words, one should look primarily to those aspects of the marks that are not common: Cooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v Sigmund Pumps Ltd [1952] HCA 15 ; (1952) 86 CLR 536 at 538 539; Melbourne Chinese Press Pty Ltd v Australian Chinese Newspapers Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 38 at [40]; Chantelle v Kabushiki Kaisha Chandeal (1996) 36 IPR 549 at 568; and Re London Lubricants (1920) Ltd's Application [1925] 42 RPC 264 at 279.

The same can be said with respect to the words 'STARR' and 'Star', even coupled with the star logo in each case; the similarity is not sufficient to create a reasonable likelihood of deception where the remaining portions of the marks are so different. As was recently said by a Full Court of this Court in Melbourne Chinese Press at [40]: 
 
 'Cases like Cooper Engineering, Coca-Cola Co [(1942) 59 RPC 127] and Sports Caf&eacute; [(1998) 42 IPR 552] do not support the proposition ... that non-descriptive words should be emphasised in considering deceptive similarity. In considering marks as a whole, where they contain common words, one should look primarily to those aspects of the marks that are not common: Cooper Engineering at 538-9. Where distinctive aspects of the marks are the aspects that would remain with a consumer, that is sufficient to avoid confusion: Coca-Cola Co at 134. Elements of the mark were not discounted in these cases because they were descriptive but because they were common to the two marks.'

But there is another reason.

It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that there was visual similarity between the two marks in their use of colours blue and white. But that is where the similarity starts and finishes. One has only to view the evidence of the depiction of the two marks as a whole to see that the different shades of those colours, particularly the blue, and the juxtaposition of those colours, in the case of the registered mark, the dark blue lettering on the sky blue background and, in the case of the respondent's mark, the white lettering on the dark blue background, is such that there is no visual similarity; the contrast is stark.</text>

<text>There seemed to be common ground as to the governing principles to be applied in a case where the question is whether a mark so nearly resembles a registered mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion. It is a different comparison than that for substantial identity; in the case of deceptive similarity, it is one of impression based on recollection: Shell at 415, which will be an imperfect recollection, measured against a standard of side by side comparison. As Windeyer J said in Re Bali Brassiere Co. Inc's Registered Trade Mark and Berlei Ltd's Application [1968] HCA 72 ; (1968) 118 CLR 128 at 139:

<text>The respondent submitted that the applicant's submissions disregard the fact that the respective marks must be considered in their entirety when assessing whether they are deceptively similar. The focus on the use of the word 'STARR' and the applicant's 'star symbol' is, in effect, to infer that infringement will occur if another mark contains the word 'star', either of its own accord or in combination with a star symbol of some type. It was submitted that it is erroneous to focus on that word or symbol in isolation from the remainder of the mark.

<tocase>Shell Co. of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1961) 109 CLR 407 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1961/75.html</AustLII>
<text>I was referred to what Windeyer J said in Shell Co. of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [1961] HCA 75 ; (1961) 109 CLR 407 at 414 415 concerning the different ways of assessing the criteria of 'substantially identical with' on the one hand, and 'deceptively similar to' on the other. His Honour said: 
 
 'In considering whether marks are substantially identical they should, I think, be compared side by side, their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison. ... 
 
 On the question of deceptive similarity a different comparison must be made from that which is necessary when substantial identity is in question. The marks are not now to be looked at side by side. The issue is not abstract similarity, but deceptive similarity. Therefore the comparison is the familiar one of trade mark law. It is between, on the one hand, the impression based on recollection of the plaintiff's mark that persons of ordinary intelligence and memory would have; and, on the other hand, the impressions that such persons would get from the defendant's television exhibitions.'

The applicant submitted that: 
 
 (i) The essential features of the registered mark are the star logo and the word 'STARR'. The essential features of the respondent's mark are the star logo and the word 'Star'.
 (ii) The star logo in both marks is eye catching. The star logo appears at the front of both marks. It is the first thing seen when looking at the marks.
 (iii) The star logo in both marks abuts the word part of the mark.
 (iv) The differences in the star logos are minor. The differences in the word part of the marks are also minor; the registered mark has an additional 'R' and the word is capitalised. The word 'Partners' is in lower case in the registered mark and is not an essential feature. Similarly, the word 'REALTY' is not an essential feature of the respondent's mark.
 (v) Comparing the two marks side by side, demonstrates that the essential features are substantially identical to each other and the differences do not detract from the total resemblance of the two marks.

The applicant referred to s 10 of the Act which provides: 
 
 'For the purposes of this Act, a trade mark is taken to be "deceptively similar" to another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion.'

I was referred to what Windeyer J said in Shell concerning 'deceptive similarity', quoted at [25] supra, and to what was said by Dixon and McTiernan JJ in Australian Woollen Mills at 658: 
 
 'In deciding this question, the marks ought not, of course, to be compared side by side. An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought. The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same. The effect of spoken description must be considered. If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods, then similarities both of sound and of meaning may play an important part. The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected. Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution. On the other hand, exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded. The cause of business and the way in which a particular class of goods are sold gives, it may be said, the setting, and the habits and observations of men considered in the mass affords the standard. Evidence of actual cases of deception, if forthcoming, is of great weight.'

As noted in the extract from the judgment of Windeyer J in Shell quoted in [25] supra, following the side by side comparison of the marks, the noting of their similarities and differences and the importance of these assessed against the essential features of the registered mark, it is the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison that determines whether the criteria of 'substantially identical' is satisfied.

Apart from the partial star logo, and even that is different in each mark, the positioning of that logo with respect to the 'STARR'/'Star' word and the aural similarity of the 'STARR'/'Star' words, the two marks have a number of differences. I am of the view that the word 'Partners' is an essential feature of the registered mark because it articulates the very structure of the applicant's business a franchise operation involving various unrelated parties (the partners) carrying on discrete businesses under a common banner. If that be right, then the essential features of the two marks are quite different, both visually and aurally; and even if it is not right, that difference between the two marks, particularly coupled with the difference between 'STARR' and 'Star', are sufficiently significant themselves to militate against any conclusion that they are substantially identical.

In my view, there is no substantial similarity, let alone identity, visually or aurally, between the two marks.

There seemed to be common ground as to the governing principles to be applied in a case where the question is whether a mark so nearly resembles a registered mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion. It is a different comparison than that for substantial identity; in the case of deceptive similarity, it is one of impression based on recollection: Shell at 415, which will be an imperfect recollection, measured against a standard of side by side comparison. As Windeyer J said in Re Bali Brassiere Co. Inc's Registered Trade Mark and Berlei Ltd's Application [1968] HCA 72 ; (1968) 118 CLR 128 at 139:

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1953/73.html</AustLII>
<text>I was also referred to certain propositions set out by Kitto J at first instance in Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 73 ; (1953) 91 CLR 592 at 594 595: 
 
 (1) To show that a trade mark is deceptively similar to another it is necessary to show a real, tangible danger of deception or confusion occurring. A mere possibility of confusion is not sufficient.
 (2) A trade mark is likely to cause confusion if the result of its use will be that a number of persons are caused to wonder whether it might not be the case that the two products or closely related products and services come from the same source. It is enough if the ordinary person entertains a reasonable doubt.
 (3) In considering whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion, all the surrounding circumstances have to be taken into consideration. These include the circumstances in which the marks will be used, the circumstances in which the goods or services will be bought and sold, and the character of the probable acquirers of the goods and services.

The respondent accepted, generally, the summary of the relevant principles as set out in the applicant's submissions; the test in respect of infringement, it was submitted, remains that as set out in Southern Cross .

I was also referred to the recent decision in Beecham Group at [54] [56] where the Court considered the established principles in Southern Cross and confirmed that the approach adopted by the Court is to attempt to estimate the 'effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers' and to determine whether there is a 'real, and tangible danger of confusion'.</text>

<text>The respondent submitted that the marks 'STARR Partners' and 'Star REALTY' are not identical and they fall short of being 'substantially identical'. The respondent referred to the following points of difference: 
 
 (i) In the use of capitals for the entirety of the word and the additional 'R' in 'STARR';
 (ii) there is the use of the word 'Partners' as opposed to 'REALTY'. The use of the word 'Partners' is essential to the registered mark and some analogy can be drawn to the circumstances in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Limited v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 132 FCR 326 at [54] [60];
 (iii) the use of different words results in completely different aural sounds when the marks are spoken in their entirety;
 (iv) the 'star symbols' at the commencement of each of the respective marks are different;
 (v) the applicant's 'star symbol' has four points to the star including points on the eastern and southeastern points whilst the respondent's symbol has only the northern and western points;
 (vi) the applicant's 'star symbol' is also separate and distinct from the letters in the word 'STARR' with the southern line of the symbol directed to the northwest and coming inside, and parallel to, a line heading directed to the southeast;
 (vii) the respondent's 'star symbol' leans against, or is cut off by, the 'S';
 (viii) further, the 'S' in the respondent's mark is stylised and the letters 't', 'a' and 'r' are separate from one another whilst the applicant's 'T', 'A', 'R' and 'R' are more standard, closely positioned letters.

I was referred to a summary of the principles, recently extracted by Bennett J in Torpedoes Sportswear at [78] from the leading authorities.

The respondent submitted that the applicant's submissions disregard the fact that the respective marks must be considered in their entirety when assessing whether they are deceptively similar. The focus on the use of the word 'STARR' and the applicant's 'star symbol' is, in effect, to infer that infringement will occur if another mark contains the word 'star', either of its own accord or in combination with a star symbol of some type. It was submitted that it is erroneous to focus on that word or symbol in isolation from the remainder of the mark.
