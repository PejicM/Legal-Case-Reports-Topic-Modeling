<tocase>Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc, [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998) </tocase>
<text>44 Mr Geller examined the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc , [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998). He treated it as authority for the proposition that copyright ownership issues are governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property at issue and the parties claiming ownership.

45 Mr Geller noted that Itar-Tass has been applied by the District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division: Lahiri v Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Inc 513 Supp 2d 1172 (2007).

47 Mr Geller has appended to his report copies of Title 17, the cases referred to above, and others. I have read the cases. I need refer only to Itar-Tass itself. The case concerned a copyright newspaper article, and had nothing to do with films. The Court first noted that Title 17 contains no provision concerning conflicts issues. It was necessary therefore to fill the interstices of the Act by developing federal common law on the conflicts issue. The Court said:
 Conflicts rule for issues of ownership. Copyright is a form of property, and the usual rule is that the interests of the parties in property are determined by the law of the state with "the most significant relationship" to the property and the parties. ... The Restatement recognises the applicability of this principle to intangibles such as "a literary idea". 
The Court then applied that rule to the facts of the case, which as the respondents pointed out, were much more related to Russia than are the facts of the present case related to Australia. But that is neither here nor there. It is the choice of law rule that matters, not the outcome of its application in Itar-Tass .

48 The respondents relied on the evidence of Mr Reichman who has undoubted expertise in copyright law. He disagrees with Mr Geller's opinion and believes "there is a strong possibility that the US Court will apply US Copyright law to determine copyright ownership of The Secret". He gives his reasons.

53 The second related deficiency in Mr Geller's report concerns Itar-Tass . He records the essential reasoning of the Court in that case, but does not advert to the note appended to the following statement:
 To whatever extent we look to the Berne Convention itself as guidance in the development of federal common law on the conflicts issue, we find nothing to alter our conclusion. The Convention does not purport to settle issues of ownership, with one exception not relevant to this case. 
The note (n 12) reads in part:
 The Berne Convention expressly provides that "ownership of copyright in a cinematographic work shall be a matter for legislation in the country where protection is claimed" ... Art 14bis(2)(a). 
The note goes on to explore whether the Article contains any implication as to the choice of law for copyright issues other than ownership. As indicated at [46], Itar-Tass did not concern a cinematographic work.

54 One of the attachments to Mr Geller's report is his article in Journal, Copyright Society of the United States of America (2004): Conflict of Laws in Copyright Cases: Infringement and Ownership Issues . At 326 Mr Geller says:
 To repeat our basic point: if a field, such as copyright, has a treaty-governed "international system", an ordre public international, such as the Berne/TRIPs regime, then the principles of that system, to the extent relevant to choice of law, must serve as binding constraints on conflicts analysis in the field. In terms of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, reading treaty commitments into the first criterion of section 6(2)(a), "the needs of the ... international system", help to meet other criteria of section 6. Because it is anchored in treaty principles, this approach enhances the "certainty, predictability and uniformity of results": The Restatement framework sets up two levels of conflicts analysis. We have already indicated that, at a first level, section 6(2)(a) of the Restatement sets out a number of criteria for generally resolving conflicts of law, the first being "the needs of the ... international system". The second level of analysis of the Restatement is found in provisions regarding special areas of law, for example, ... in section 222, regarding the choice of laws to govern [copyright] ownership issues. In such instances, the Restatement proposes to choose the "local law" of the jurisdiction which, with respect to the issue in question, has the "most significant relationship" to the ultimate facts of the case, but this relationship is to be determined "under the principles stated in" (italics added) section 6. Thus, in resolving conflicts of laws in cross-border cases under the Restatement, US courts are directed to attend to any relevant "international system" at the first level of analysis, in order to guide focusing on any arguable "significant relationship" adumbrated at the second level of analysis. Following the Restatement analysis in cross-border copyright cases, the courts should then take account of the relevant system, that is, the Berne/TRIPs regime, which the United States has implemented in the Copyright Act . 
Although Mr Geller does not refer to Art 14bis(2)(a), that passage provides additional support for attending to the provisions of the Berne Convention in any search by a United States court for the appropriate choice of law in a copyright ownership case.

55 Art 14bis(2)(a) directs one to the law of the country where protection is claimed. That is the law of the United States. Title 17 provides in s 104(b) that the works specified in s 102 , which include motion pictures, are "subject to protection under this title" if the work is first published in the United States, as the works in question here were.

68 
 
(c) TS Production's registration under Title 17 is a clear invocation of the protection of the US copyright regime. The effect of that invocation is that under Art 5(2) of the Berne Convention, claims in the United States are governed by US law.
 
(d) Drew Pictures has also sought to avail itself of the protection of US Copyright law.
 
(e) The Film and the screenplay were first published in the United States. Accordingly that country is their "country of origin" under Art 5(4) of the Convention.
 
(f) Title 17 grants copyright protection to joint authors of cinematograph films. If Mr Heriot makes out his case as a co-author of the screenplay and a director of the Film, he is entitled to copyright protection in the US, and it is irrelevant whether the works were conceived in Australia or partly made here.
 
(g) Article 14bis(2)(a) of the Convention allows the US to legislate for ownership of copyright in a cinematograph film, and US law makes provision for joint ownership in films, which counsel submitted the Act does not appear to do.
 
(h) Mr Reichman's expert evidence should be preferred to that of Mr Geller. Mr Geller's reliance on Itar-Tass is misplaced. Here the works were first published in the United States. That is their country of origin. Further, Itar-Tass observed that although the Berne Convention does not purport to settle all questions of copyright ownership, Art 14bis(2)(a) does deal with ownership of copyright in cinematic films this very case.
 
(i) Australian law will apply in the proceeding in this Court. Title 17 will apply to the Illinois proceeding. There is no identity of issues because the two statutory regimes are different. On that basis there can be no anti-suit injunction to stop the respondents prosecuting their claim in the Illinois proceeding.
 
(j) US domestic law will apply to infringement in the Illinois proceeding: Itar-Tass .
 
(k) Where initial infringement occurs in the United States and subsequent infringement occurs elsewhere, United States law allows the recovery of damages for external infringement, at least if there is a causal link between the infringements: Sheldon v Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation 106 F2d 45 (1939). That is not the position in Australia: s 101(1) of the Act. Thus a cross claim for infringement in this proceeding would only cover damages for infringement in Australia.
 
(l) Joint authors of films are not known to Australian law, and that is the central claim in the Complaint. The declarations sought in the Illinois proceeding that the works are joint works, that the respondents can exploit the works independently of TS Production, and that Mr Heriot is a co-author of the works, are not available under Australian law. It is common ground that amendment of the United States copyright register can only be ordered by a United States court.
 
(m) The provisions of the Act relied on, namely ss 22(4) and 98, are quite different from the co-ownership provisions in Title 17 on which the respondents rely in the Illinois proceeding.

74 For the reasons I have given at [49] to [55], the US court will apply United States law to the ownership dispute. If the plaintiffs establish ownership in Drew Pictures, infringement and damages or lost profits will also be governed by United States law: Itar-Tass .</text>

<tocase>Bumper Corporation v Commissioner of Police of Metropolis [1991] 1 WLR 1362</tocase>
<text>49 A court does not conduct its own researches into foreign law. But if an expert witness refers to foreign statutes, decisions or texts, the court is entitled to look at them as part of the evidence. It does not however go on a roving inquiry of its own. However, if the evidence of experts conflicts as to the effect of foreign sources, the court must look at the sources in order to decide between the conflicting opinions. See Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws 14 th ed (2006) at 262-266; Cross on Evidence 6 th Aust ed (2000) at 1218-1220; Bumper Corporation v Commissioner of Police of Metropolis [1991] 1 WLR 1362 at 1368-1371.

50 I am forced by my own consideration of the material placed before me by Mr Geller and Mr Reichman to prefer the opinion of the latter. There are in my opinion two related deficiencies in Mr Geller's reasoning. The first concerns Art 14bis(2)(a) of the Berne Convention. Although Mr Geller quotes that provision, he does not to my satisfaction explain why it does not cover the present case. The explanation he offers appears in the paragraph beginning on page 7 and ending on page 8 of his report. In view of its length I will not set it out. I am unable to discern how Mr Geller's centrifugal/centripetal and false conflicts discussion enables him to put Art 14bis(2)(a) aside.

51 The World Intellectual Property Organisation's Guide to the Berne Convention at 85-86 (which is quoted by Mr Reichman and is exhibited to his report), commenting on Art 14bis(2)(a) says:
 Here the Convention provides expressly that the ownership of copyright of the film is a matter for the country where protection is claimed. This may be the maker in his own right, as under the 'film copyright' system, or the maker by reason of a legal assignment, or it may be the various artistic contributors to the film. National legislation is free to adopt any of the systems. The reference to the law of the country where protection is claimed makes it clear that ownership depends on the law of the country of importation, whoever may be considered the owner of the copyright in the country of origin of the film. For example, if protection is claimed in the United Kingdom, it is the British law which governs ownership; if in France it is the law of that country. 
I accept Mr Reichman's opinion that Art 14bis(2)(a) is a special choice of law rule applicable to motion pictures.

52 That is also the view of the authors of the leading text on the Berne Convention: Ricketson and Ginsburg, International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights The Berne Convention and Beyond 2 nd ed (2006). In volume 2 at 20.12 they say that in Article 14bis(2)(a) the Convention "both addresses questions of ownership and designates the applicable law". At 20.36 they describe the Article as providing "a choice of law rule regarding initial ownership of cinematographic works".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/32.html</AustLII>
<text>57 The following principles can be derived from decisions of the High Court in Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 , Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345. 
 
(a) Where an anti-suit injunction is sought in an Australian court in relation to proceedings in another country, the court should first consider whether it is appropriate for it to determine the matter in issue before deciding whether to grant the injunction.
 
(b) A stay is only granted if the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum.
 
(c) The onus is on the party seeking a stay to satisfy the court that the continuation of the case would be oppressive or vexatious to the party having regard to the existence an appropriate tribunal in another country.
 
(d) The power to stay proceedings is discretionary, in that it involves a subjective balancing process in which the comparative weight to be given to the particular factors in the circumstances of the case, and the decision whether the power should be exercised, are matters for individual judgment and, to a significant extent, matters of impression.
 
(e) Relevant connecting factors include the law that is to be applied, whether the proceeding has a substantial connection with the law of Australia or the foreign jurisdiction, whether the relevant acts or omissions took place in Australia or the foreign jurisdiction, the parties' places of residence, the location of witnesses and the relative ease of access to sources of proof.
 
(f) If the Australian court is clearly an inappropriate forum, that is the end of the matter, and the considerations going to whether anti-suit relief should be granted do not arise.
 
(g) If the Australian court is not clearly an inappropriate forum, the court may require the applicant to seek a stay or dismissal of the foreign proceeding, or may proceed to determine whether an anti-suit injunction should be granted.
 
(h) Where there is litigation in an Australian court in which complete relief may be had, the institution by a party to that suit of proceedings abroad will generally be vexatious or oppressive, because there is nothing that can be gained by the party over and above what may be gained in the local proceeding.
 
(i) Where the proceeding abroad will give other or additional remedies beyond those available in the Australian court, the foreign proceeding will not be vexatious or oppressive.
 
(j) Where different issues are involved in the local and foreign proceedings, albeit that the two proceedings arise out of the same substratum of fact, the question is not whether the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the litigation of the issues involved in the Australian proceeding. Rather it is whether, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceeding is vexatious or oppressive, namely that they are productive of serious and unjustifiable trouble and harassment to the other party.</text>

73 The respondents contend that the Illinois court is able to make an award of damages or loss of profits by reference to infringements occurring outside the United States. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Sheldon v Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation 106F 2d 45 (1939). The respondents rely, by analogy, on CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 , where an influential factor in holding that the New South Wales proceeding was oppressive was that CSR could not there pursue its claim for statutory damages under the Sherman Act . However no expert gave evidence here that the Illinois court could make an award of damages or loss of profits by reference to infringements occurring outside the United States. Accordingly I am not at liberty to act in reliance on Sheldon . This is the more so because one of the commentaries to which I was referred spoke only of "sporadic cases" adopting the Sheldon approach, which the authors say is a doctrine invoked "relatively infrequently", and which "many cases ignore": Nimmer on Copyright (2007) SS14-05. Accordingly I have not taken into account this possible advantage to the respondents.</text>

<tocase>Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 29</tocase>
<text>75 The respondents' counsel initially submitted that the Act appears not to make provision for joint copyright ownership in films. Later he became more positive, contending that joint authors of films are not known to Australian copyright law. It may well be correct that the joint authorship provisions in Div 9 of Pt III of the Act do not apply to films, though this question was not mentioned in argument. However, in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 29 Gyles J held that copyright in a film the product of a joint venture between two persons was "jointly held" by them. On appeal Lindgren J agreed with Gyles J on this point. He said at [20]:
 Although the circumstances may indicate otherwise, ordinarily co-owners of copyright hold as tenants in common, not as joint tenants .... In the absence of the consent of the other co-owner, one co-owner is neither entitled to do an act comprised in the copyright, nor to grant a licence to a third party to do such an act, and the non-consenting co-owner is entitled to an injunction against the infringing co-owner or putative licensee .... 
See Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v TCN Channel Nine [2005] FCAFC 144 ; (2005) 66 IPR 101 ( Seven Network ) Finkelstein J at [72] said Gyles J's finding that the two venturers were joint owners was not challenged, and his Honour referred to Prior v Landsowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 68 as authority that co-owners hold copyright as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants. Edmonds J was of the view that the copyright was acquired by the venturers not as co-owners but separately in accordance with their respective contributions to the joint venture. The whole issue of joint ownership is conveniently summarised in Copinger and Skone James on Copyright 15 th ed (2005) vol 1 at 5 165-5 169. See also Ricketson and Creswell, Law of Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs and Confidential Information at 14-140, where the significance of s 36(1) of the Act is elaborately discussed.

76 These ownership issues were not canvassed in argument, and TS Production did not contest the assertions at [74]. Nevertheless, in view of the observations of Gyles J and Lindgren J in Seven Network , I do not accept the submission that joint ownership of copyright in films is not known to Australian law. See also s 98(4) and the definition of "director" in s 98(7).

77 Given the first publication of the Film in the United States, the substantial exploitation of the Film in that country, that United States law clearly provides for joint ownership of copyright in motion pictures, that the declarations sought by the plaintiffs are available under United States law, and that that law governs ownership and infringement issues, the plaintiffs have in my view issued their proceeding in the most appropriate place. A United States court is the most obvious and natural form in which to litigate their claims. I attach great importance to the fact that United States law will apply to the ownership as well as the infringement and relief issues.

78 I do not accept TS Production's contention that the plaintiffs' purpose in instituting the Illinois proceeding was to prevent it from pursuing the Australian proceeding. I find that their dominant purpose in taking action in the United States was to obtain the relief they seek in the Complaint.

80 In coming to my conclusion, I have not taken into account any assertions of law made in the Complaint that were not proved by expert evidence. For example, there was no evidence that under United States law one co-owner of copyright can exploit the copyright independently of another. That appears not to be the position under Australian law: Powell v Head (1879) 12 Ch D 686 ; Seven Network at [20] and [74] above.

81 On the respondents' motion I will order that the proceeding be stayed pending the outcome of the Illinois proceeding. I will dismiss TS Production's motion. TS Production must pay the respondents' costs of both motions.

82 Since writing the foregoing, a decision of Judge Susan B Conlon in the Illinois proceeding dealing with, amongst other things, a forum non conveniens application by the defendants, has been handed down. Her Honour's reasons for decision are consistent with what I have written, but I have not taken them into account in reaching my own conclusion.

 I certify that the preceding eighty-one (81) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.
