<text>18 Finally, with respect to potential issues of prejudice to the respondents, whether relating to privilege or otherwise, I emphasise that:
 the issue of the subpoena does not at this stage produce any prejudice to the [respondents]. If the [applicants], after leave is granted and the subpoena is answered, decide[s] to seek to bring any documents from that yield to the Court, then the Court will need to be addressed on any issue that might prejudice the [respondents]. 
 Calder v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1770 at [11] . To the extent that the subpoena yields documents said to be problematic for one reason or another, those problems can be dealt with in due course.

19 For the foregoing reasons, leave to issue the subpoena will be granted.


 I certify that the preceding nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.

<text>14 Secondly, the ACC is not presumably ignorant of the dispute in light of the prior correspondence. Thirdly, it is not being asked to form a judgment as to potential relevance of documents; it is simply being asked to produce documents as to which it has already formed a judgment regarding relevance (ie the documents referred to in the 1 May letter). Because it appears from the correspondence that the ACC has already reviewed and identified the relevant documents, I consider that the documents are identified with "reasonable particularity": Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) SR (NSW) 564 at 573. Indeed, the ACC does not appear to make any complaint regarding undue burden or oppression.</text>

<text>3 The Court has power to refuse to grant leave to issue or to set aside a subpoena: O 27A and O 27 of the Federal Court Rules . It is well established that a subpoena must be issued for a legitimate forensic purpose: NSW Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [20] . A subpoena will be refused unless the documents sought to be produced "on their face, have some potential relevance to the issues in dispute between the parties": Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2004] FCA 1137 at [29] . Subpoenas may be issued to non-parties provided that they specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced: P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Pty Ltd (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24].</text>

<text>17 With respect to the remainder of the respondents' objections, I note: (1) that some of the documents requested may not be relevant in the end does not matter - the standard is potential, not actual, relevance; and (2) that the pleadings have not yet closed does not matter because there is no limit on the time at which the court can issue a subpoena: Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 66 ALR 541 at 543-44. The problem of potential costs to the respondents in dealing with documents generated by the subpoena can and will be addressed in two ways. First, under the ordinary rule, costs follow the event, so that if the respondents prevail in the proceedings they will have the costs incurred in relation to this subpoena as part of those costs. Secondly, if the respondents, after seeing the response to the subpoena, are of the view that it has led to costs thrown away or other waste, their remedy is to make application for a separate costs order.</text>

12 Ordinarily, that sort of request contained in the catch-all would be set aside, given the well-settled rule that the court will not ask a stranger to the proceedings "to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant." P Dawson (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24].

13 However, the applicants submit that the form of the subpoena is, in this case, justified by the prior correspondence with the ACC. I accept this submission. The applicants are not asking the ACC to incur the costs of ransacking their records at cost. The 1 May 2008 letter from the ACC states that the records have already been searched. Similarly, the applicants are not asking the ACC to form a judgment about matters which the ACC is ignorant; the judgment has already been formed. Moreover, public investigatory bodies like the ACC which have previously conducted or are conducting an investigation and collected documents in the course of such investigation stand in a different position to a non-party such as a bank or business that simply happens to have acquired or generated potentially relevant documents in the ordinary course of business but has no special reason to know of any litigation or relevance of its records to that litigation. Such records as the ACC has can be, and usually are, clearly and separately identifiable and identified as documents obtained in the course of a particular investigation. P Dawson (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [25].

15 In addition, the submission that a court will not issue a subpoena as a substitute for discovery is not apposite. First, the authorities to that effect relate to the issue of subpoenas to a party to the litigation, not a non-party such as the ACC: P Dawson (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24]. Secondly, "discovery" in this context is a term of art, as was explained by Heerey J in P Dawson (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [24]. It means only that a court will not ask a person to ransack their records without clear instructions as to what is being sought. Again, as I have explained, that is not the case here. The ACC has already identified the documents; the subpoena is simply a formality requested by the ACC as condition precedent to their handing over the documents.

16 In short, I consider that where a non-party (particularly a public investigatory agency) has: (1) confirmed to a party that it has searched for and identified potentially relevant documents; (2) indicated in writing that it has no objection to producing those identified documents provided a formal subpoena is issued; and (3) the court is satisfied identified documents in fact appear to be potentially relevant, there is in general no obstacle to the court exercising its discretion in the interests of justice to issue a subpoena for the production of those documents.</text>
