<text>23 The need for further inquiry, as opposed to proceeding to resolve the application on the materials before it, was not " obvious ": cf Applicant M164/2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 16 at [76] per Lee J. Indeed, it is considered that further inquiry may well have been inappropriate.

24 Nor can the Appellant avoid these consequences by, for example, contending that the failure to invite further clarification was a denial of procedural fairness. It was for the Appellant to advance such information as he considered relevant to his application. An invitation seeking further information was forwarded and a response provided by the Appellant. A party cannot thereafter, in effect, ask for an assessment from the Tribunal as to whether the response provided satisfied their concerns or not. Such assessments as were made by the Tribunal of the responses provided inherently involved part of the Tribunal's decision-making processes. The rules of procedural fairness: " do not require the decision-maker to disclose what he is minded to decide so that the parties may have a further opportunity of criticising his mental processes before he reaches a final decision ": F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Lord Diplock.
 
Procedural fairness does not require giving to an Applicant a running commentary on his prospects of success and warning him of every reason why his claims might not be thought sufficient to justify the relief sought: Applicant S 214 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 375 at [32] , [2006] FCA 375 ; 90 ALD 632 at 641 per Edmonds J. An appeal has been dismissed: Applicant S 214/2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 166.</text>

<text>21 The source of any duty or obligation to seek " more specific information " -- in the circumstances of the present case -- was not identified. Section 427(1)(d), it may be noted, empowers the Tribunal to require the Secretary " to arrange for the making of any investigation ". But that section does not impose any general duty to inquire: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Cassim [2000] HCA 50 at [12] [14], [2000] HCA 50 ; 74 ALJR 1404.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/1129.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The fact that the Tribunal proceeded to reach a decision without seeking " more specific information " cannot be characterised as either unreasonable (cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155) or capricious (cf Holmwood Holdings Pty Ltd v Halkat Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1129). Any such characterisation would be denied by:
 
(i) the general nature of the request being made by the Appellant;
 
(ii) the fact that he had on three occasions been invited to attend a hearing before the Tribunal, being an occasion upon which he would then have had an opportunity to further develop his concerns and to provide such further " information " (if any) as he saw fit; and
 
(iii) the fact that the detailed letter had been forwarded to him on 2 January 2007 inviting him to comment on the matters there set forth.
 
 At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, it should also be noted that the Appellant summarised his case by stating:
 
 " I told them everything but why were they not accepting me ?"
 
 The Appellant, it may be concluded, had in fact told " everything " and there was nothing left to tell.</text>

<text>20 The difficulty confronting the Appellant is simply the fact that the Tribunal was under no obligation to seek further information from him before proceeding to make a decision. In the circumstances of the present case, it is considered that it had no duty to inquire further: cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 at [42] [43], [2004] HCA 32 ; 207 ALR 12 at 21 2 per Gummow and Hayne JJ. As concluded by the Full Court in Mohammed v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 47 at [24] by Moore, North and Emmett JJ, " the Tribunal was under no general duty to inquire. It was entitled to act on the material presented by the appellant ".</text>

27 As such, it is rejected.

28 At the outset of the hearing of the appeal an application was made by Mr Laba Sarkis to appear on behalf of the Appellant. Mr Laba Sarkis is neither a solicitor nor a registered migration agent. The application was opposed by the Respondent Minister and the request was denied.</text>
