<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/396.html</AustLII>
<text>The categories of costs in which a court may order a non-party to pay costs are not closed: Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 396 ; (2002) 125 FCR 488. In that case, at [62] the Court said: 
 There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non-party has been exercised, if not frequently, then with some degree of regularity. One such category is where the non-party is considered to be the "real party" to the litigation: Knight v Special Assets at 188 per Mason CJ and Dean J. Another is where the non-party is a legal representative of a party to the proceedings. A costs order may be made, for example, against a solicitor in consequence of his or her conduct in the litigation: Caboolture Park at 231. While s 43 of the Federal Court Act empowers the Court to make a costs order against a legal representative of a party, a second source of jurisdiction is the "implied", "accrued" or "inherent" jurisdiction of the Court over its own officers: Caboolture Park at 231.</text>

<tocase>Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley (1996) 136 ALR 431</tocase>
<text>That decision was approved by Lindgren J in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley (1996) 136 ALR 431. In that case, Lindgren J said at 441: 
 The terms of s 1335(2) of the Law are mandatory: once a proceeding before a court is seen to be one "under" the Law, s 1335(2) requires the costs of the proceeding to be borne by a party or parties. The court's discretion relates only to how the costs are to be so borne. Such terms are inconsistent with an exercise of the power given by s 43 of the FCA Act to order a non-party to pay costs. The excepting words in s 43(2) of the FCA Act are apt to refer to, inter alia, a provision of such a nature.

The non-parties contended that I should follow the decision of Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and Lindgren J in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431. Both those decisions were given prior to the enactment of the Corporations Act but s 1335(2) has been re-enacted in the Corporations Act . There is nothing in the Corporations Act itself which would allow those decisions to be distinguished. I should as a matter of comity and unless I think the decisions to be plainly wrong follow them.

The decision in U.T.S.A. v Ultra Tune 1 VR 204 was followed by Brereton J in Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 238. His Honour said at [50]-[51]: 
 At first sight, the suggestion that the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted a provision to detract from the existing costs powers of courts in which it invests jurisdiction to deal with proceedings under the Corporations Act is a surprising one. But were it not for the judgment of Chernov J in UTSA , despite these initial impressions about s 1335 , I would unquestionably have followed Wridgemont and Australian Forest Managers , particularly given Lindgren J's strong endorsement of Wridgemont , and also given that those cases had been followed in this court by Bergin J. However, in circumstances where there has been, since Australian Forest Managers , what impresses me as a compelling analysis of the history and purpose of the section by Chernov J &#8212; the benefit of which does not appear to have been afforded to Bergin J when her Honour came to consider the point &#8212; and where Ryan J, albeit without reference to the authorities, had adopted an opposite approach, I consider that I am at liberty to give effect to my own views. 

 
 I agree with Chernov J that s 1335 should not be construed as a limiting provision, but as an enabling one. Its history shows that it was intended to confer a jurisdiction or a power to make costs orders when there was doubt as to the existence that power, at least in the equitable jurisdiction of this court in this state. If there were no s 1335(2) , the court would not be without power to make costs orders in proceedings under the Act; it would have all its powers under the Supreme Court Act and the Civil Procedure Act. Section 1335 was not intended to limit such other powers to make costs orders as the court already enjoyed, but to supplement them. In my opinion, the current provisions ought not be taken as intended to exclude the power of courts under, for example, Civil Procedure Act, s 98, and UCPR, r 42.27, to make costs orders which are designed to protect the processes of the courts and the integrity of those processes and the procedural rights of parties who litigate in those courts.

The defendants contended that in the event that the decisions of this Court in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431 are to be preferred to the decisions of in U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd 1 VR 204 and Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; 56 ACSR 238 then I should make an order joining the non-parties as parties for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of s 1335(2).

The Master thought he was constrained by the decisions in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431 from ordering costs against persons who were not parties. However, he was of the opinion that O 63.21 of the Supreme Court Rules of the Northern Territory, which provides for the costs liability of a legal practitioner where the legal practitioner has caused costs to be incurred improperly or without reasonable cause or be wasted by undue delay or negligence or by some other misconduct or default, was not in conflict with either the Corporations Regulations or s 1335(2).</text>

<text>It is not possible to determine whether the statutory demands were in fact ever served on the defendants in accordance with the Act. Mr Byrnes contends they were and the defendants contend they were not received. That was an issue to be determined at the trial but the proceedings were dismissed for the reasons given. I do not think, in the absence of hearing the witnesses whose evidence is relevant to this issue and particularly Mr Byrnes, the issue can be resolved.

<tocase>Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd (1990) 1 WAR 465</tocase>
<text>That finding is enough, it seems to me, to make the order sought by the defendants that the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs on an indemnity basis: In the matter of Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd (1990) 1 WAR 465 ; Packer v Meagher (1984) 3 NSWLR 486. In Ragata Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1993) 217 ALR 175 , Davies J said at [7]: 
 ... it is not open to an individual Judge to award costs having regard to his own view as to the adequacy of party/party costs so fixed. An award of costs on an indemnity basis may be made only in a special case, where the circumstances justify departure from the ordinary principle. The circumstances must be such as to justify an award indemnifying the successful party in respect of all of the costs incurred, save only as to those costs which are unreasonable in amount. 

 
 The very nature of the award of costs on an indemnity basis gives a guide to the type of case in which such an award is appropriate. Thus, indemnity costs may be awarded where unsuccessful proceedings have been brought and prosecuted, not for the bona fide purpose of protecting and enforcing a legal right, but to achieve an ulterior or extraneous purpose. 

 
However, there are further reasons for making the orders.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/1999/327.html</AustLII>
<text>Debelle J agreed with the decision in Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission 80 FCR 283 in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood [1999] SASC 327 and said at [22]: 
 I immediately acknowledge the assistance of Hill J but suggest that proposition (3) is of limited assistance. The fact that a party has not conducted himself reasonably may disentitle him to costs. But, beyond that, the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties is not likely to assist in determining whether the applicant should recover his costs. The real question is whether the applicant had reasonable prospects of success. It seems preferable, therefore, to express proposition (3) in different terms.

The three questions I have posed mean that I disagree with respect with Debelle J's decision in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood [1999] SASC 327. A party may behave so unreasonably in the bringing or conducting of proceedings so that an order for costs against that party is required in the interests of justice without ever deciding whether the party had a good cause of action.</text>

<tocase>Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/471.html</AustLII>
<text>The decision in Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 and its application to s 43 of the Federal Court Act was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224. The Full Court said at 229: 
 There seems no reason to doubt that s 43 confers upon the court jurisdiction to award costs not only against persons who are parties but also against persons who are not. Clearly the section is no narrower than the provisions of O 91, r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered by the High Court in Knight v FP Special Assets .

In Caboolture Park v White Industries [1993] FCA 471 ; 45 FCR 224 , it was argued that the Court's jurisdiction under s 43 to award costs ceased at the time that judgment was entered. It was submitted in that case that "once the original action or proceedings had been completed by entry of judgment there was no longer a 'proceeding' before the Court in respect of which a cost order could be made" (at 230).

That argument was rejected by the Court as being inconsistent with the definition of "proceeding" in s 4 of the Federal Court Act which is defined to mean: 
 ... a proceeding in a Court, whether between parties or not, and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of, or in connexion with, a proceeding, and also includes an appeal;

The Court said at 230: 
 The context of the Act provides no indication that the words defining the grant of jurisdiction in s 43 of the Act have a temporal meaning which limits the jurisdiction conferred to a jurisdiction which terminates when a judgment has been pronounced and extracted in the proceeding that has invoked the jurisdiction. 

 
The Court said at 231:
 
 What s 43 requires is that the jurisdiction to order costs be one limited to costs relating to a proceeding. In other words, there is no jurisdiction to order costs at large. There has to be or have been, within the Court's jurisdiction, instituted a proceeding. It is irrelevant, subject to the application of common law principles discussed later, that judgment has been given and entered.

As I have already observed, the first argument was rejected by the Court following the decision of this Court in Caboolture Park v White Industries [1993] FCA 471 ; 45 FCR 224. His Honour then turned to consider the effect of s 1335(2).

Section 24(1) of the SC Act (Vic) relevantly provided: 
 Unless otherwise expressly provided by this or any other Act or by the Rules, the costs of and incidental to all matters in the Court ... is in the discretion of the Court and the Court has full power to determine by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.

The Master relied upon two decisions for the second proposition that the rule was not inconsistent with s 1355(2): Myers v Elman [1940] AC 282 and Caboolture Park v White Industries [1993] FCA 471 ; 45 FCR 224. I am not sure how those cases support the proposition that there is no conflict between the Rules of Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act . The first case stands for the proposition that the High Court in England has power to order a solicitor to indemnify a party who has been injured by the solicitor's default. The power rests upon the Court's jurisdiction over its own officers. That proposition can no longer be doubted. The second case, a decision to which I have already referred, is authority for the proposition that the Federal Court has the power to award costs against a non-party and, in that case, the solicitors for a party.

The power to award costs against a non-party, and in particular against a solicitor, are not the questions in issue. The question, further refined, is whether the Court can award costs against a legal practitioner who is a non-party. The Master, it seems to me, with respect, did not address that issue.

The categories of costs in which a court may order a non-party to pay costs are not closed: Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 396 ; (2002) 125 FCR 488. In that case, at [62] the Court said: 
 There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non-party has been exercised, if not frequently, then with some degree of regularity. One such category is where the non-party is considered to be the "real party" to the litigation: Knight v Special Assets at 188 per Mason CJ and Dean J. Another is where the non-party is a legal representative of a party to the proceedings. A costs order may be made, for example, against a solicitor in consequence of his or her conduct in the litigation: Caboolture Park at 231. While s 43 of the Federal Court Act empowers the Court to make a costs order against a legal representative of a party, a second source of jurisdiction is the "implied", "accrued" or "inherent" jurisdiction of the Court over its own officers: Caboolture Park at 231.</text>

<text>The defendants relied upon a decision of Master Coulehan of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Construction Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lafarge Plasterboard Pty Ltd [2002] NTSC 21 for the proposition that an order for costs could be made against solicitors without making the solicitors parties and notwithstanding s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act .

That case concerned an application to set aside a statutory demand pursuant to s 459G of the Corporations Act . Shortly after the proceeding was commenced, the plaintiff was wound up by order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The defendant sought costs against the plaintiff's solicitor who had pursued the application on the part of the plaintiff, notwithstanding that the plaintiff had been wound up before the hearing of the application and notwithstanding that the liquidator was unaware of the application.</text>

<tocase>Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App Cas 944</tocase>
<text>Section 154 of the Licensing Act provided for a penalty of imprisonment for a term not less than six months or more than 12 months for a second offence of selling liquor without a licence. The question for the Court was whether the exceptive words in s 74(1) meant that the Court could not exercise the power in s 74(1) to reduce a penalty to something less than imprisonment if the justice of the case would be better met. The Court said: 
 Because this is so, exceptive words such as those which introduce s. 74(1) have no legal effect beyond saving earlier enactments which otherwise would be inconsistent with the provision introduced. In regard to later enactments they "go no farther than the general law": Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App. Cas. 944 , at p. 965 and "are not really necessary because if the later Act shows a contrary intention the earlier enactment cannot control it. But they remind us of the general rule". So Isaacs J. observed in Bennett v. Minister for Public Works (N.S.W.) [1908] HCA 50 ; (1908) 7 C.L.R. 372 , at p. 384, speaking of the exceptive expression "unless the contrary intention appears". Whatever the verbal formula employed, it cannot have in regard to later legislation any greater force or value than that expression. As Keating J. remarked in Chorlton v. Lings (1868) L.R. 4 C.P. 374, "to do more would be exceeding the competency of parliament with reference to future legislation" (1868) L.R. 4 C.P., at p. 395. 

 
The Court said at 359:
 
 The general provision of s. 74(1) of the Justices Act is accordingly prefaced by words which have a saving effect as regards earlier enactments and serve as a reminder in relation to later, meaning in regard to both that the general provision which follows is not to be denied any of its operation save by something actually inconsistent with it in the operation of another enactment.

Section 43 authorises the Court to make an order for costs against a non-party. The exceptive words in the body of s 43 do not by themselves limit the operation of s 43 by any later Act. Section 43 of the Federal Court Act was enacted before s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act . It cannot control that subsection. A later Act could limit the operation of s 43 but that would raise the question of the construction of the later Act.

Therefore, the question which is to be determined is whether s 1335(2) as a later enactment has the effect of limiting the operation of s 43(1) to a party or a party to a proceeding brought under the Corporations Act .

His Honour traced the legislative history of s 1335(2). He noted that the English Judicature Acts of 1873-1875 did not address all of the anomalies which then existed in relation to the Court's powers in relation to costs. Costs in the common law courts were entirely creatures of statute: Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App Cas 944 at 962. On the other hand, the Court of Chancery claimed to have power to deal with costs at its discretion although there was some uncertainty as to the extent of that power. The authorities suggested that the position in equity continued after those Acts. He noted that s 5 of the Judicature Act 1890 (UK) which gave the Court expanded jurisdiction to award costs resolved the uncertainty. That section relevantly provided: 
 subject to the ... Acts and the Rules ... and to the express provisions of any statute ... the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the Supreme Court ... shall be at the discretion of the Court or Judge and the Court or Judge shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent such costs are to be paid. 

 
He noted that it was not until 1928 that s 5 of the Judicature Act 1890 (UK) was adopted in Victoria as s 32(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1928 (Vic) (now s 24(1) of the SC Act (Vic)). Section 32(1) gave the Court jurisdiction to deal with all questions of costs, including proceedings under the Companies Act. Before the Uniform Companies laws of 1961, there was no equivalent of s 1335(2) in the Victorian legislation. There was on his Honour's reasons no need for s 1335(2) because s 32(1) gave the Court power to award costs in all proceedings and therefore s 1335(2) was not picked up by the Victorian Companies Act of 1938 or its consolidation in 1958.

He turned his attention to the New South Wales jurisdiction. He noted that New South Wales did not adopt the Judicature Acts until 1970 when the Court was given the statutory provision equivalent to s 5 of the Judicature Act 1890 (UK). In the meantime, the predecessor of s 1335(2) was introduced into the Companies Act 1936 (NSW) (the Companies Act) by s 365(2). Section 365(2) eventually became s 1335(2). His Honour said at 211: 
 It seems fairly clear that this subsection was an enabling provision, intended to give the Supreme Court in New South Wales a similar discretion to that which was given to English Courts in 1890 and to the Victorian Supreme Court in 1928. Bearing in mind that s. 24(1), or its equivalent, was in force in Victoria and England, there was no need to introduce in those jurisdictions a provision such as s. 365(2) of the Companies Act of New South Wales. On the other hand, there was reason to pass such legislation in New South Wales in 1936 if its Supreme Court was to have a wide discretion to award costs in a proceeding under the companies legislation.

Because there was no general power in New South Wales of the kind given by s 5 of the Judicature Act, it was arguable that the Courts did not have the power to award costs in matters under the Companies Act. The enactment of s 365(2) was to put beyond doubt the Courts' power to award costs for proceedings under that Act. It was not enacted to limit the circumstances in which costs might be awarded. Thus it was that his Honour held that s 365(2) at the time of its introduction was an enabling provision, not a limiting provision.

His Honour also noted that the equivalent of s 365(2) was not introduced into Victorian law until 1961 at the time of the Uniform Companies legislation in the form of s 363(2). His Honour pointed out that there was no need to introduce such legislation into the Victorian Uniform Companies legislation because the position was covered by s 24(1) of the SC Act (Vic).

Moreover, his Honour observed was that there was no need to continue with s 365(2) in the New South Wales legislation after the New South Wales Parliament adopted the Judicature Act in 1970 but the provision has remained and has become s 1335(2).

For those reasons, his Honour found that s 1335(2) was intended to be an enabling provision, not a limiting provision. In those circumstances, it did not limit the provisions of s 24(1) of the SC Act (Vic).

His Honour concluded and said at 212: 
 Whatever may be the position in relation to s. 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , s. 1335(2) does not so inhibit the jurisdiction of this court on the question of costs as was contended for by the respondents.

His Honour's analysis of the legislative history of s 1335(2), in my opinion, has the same application in the construction of s 43 of the Federal Court Act.</text>

<tocase>Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission (1997) 80 FCR 284 </tocase>
<text>In Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission (1997) 80 FCR 284 , Finkelstein J said at 287: 
 For my own part I should wish to emphasise that in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order, other than an order that each party bear its own costs, can be made except in special circumstances. To do otherwise would require some prediction of the outcome of the case. It seems to me that the third proposition stated by Hill J was intended to cover the situation where the Court was in fact able to form a clear view about the merits of a case without a trial. So, if a claim is patently hopeless that would be a good reason to make an order for costs against the claimant. Likewise if a defence was bound to fail that would be good reason for awarding costs in favour of the claimant. But I venture to suggest that there will be very few cases where the issues will be sufficiently clear, in the absence of a hearing, for an order for costs to be made in favour of a party.

Debelle J agreed with the decision in Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission 80 FCR 283 in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood [1999] SASC 327 and said at [22]: 
 I immediately acknowledge the assistance of Hill J but suggest that proposition (3) is of limited assistance. The fact that a party has not conducted himself reasonably may disentitle him to costs. But, beyond that, the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties is not likely to assist in determining whether the applicant should recover his costs. The real question is whether the applicant had reasonable prospects of success. It seems preferable, therefore, to express proposition (3) in different terms.

Finkelstein J cast some doubt on the third principle referred to by Hill J. I do not need to decide whether I agree with the proviso mentioned by Finkelstein J because, in my opinion, at the very least this is one case where the issues are sufficiently clear, in the absence of a hearing, for orders for costs to be made.

The plaintiffs' behaviour, which was demonstrated by Mr Byrnes' emails and correspondence generally prior to the commencement of proceedings, was quite unreasonable. Mr Byrnes behaved like a bully as he claimed to be. He threatened the defendants and Mr Harris with all sorts of commercial harm. His communications were calculated to induce fear into the defendants. His threats, if carried out, would have ruined the defendants in circumstances where he knew the defendants took issue with the debts. His actions were taken for the benefit of the plaintiffs and for the assignors, Cobra and Contor. The threats which were made prior to the proceedings commencing indicate that the proceedings were to be used for a collateral purpose; namely, the recovery of a debt, rather than for the purpose for which the proceedings were designed; namely, the winding up of an insolvent corporation.

<tocase>Hardel Investments Pty Ltd (ACN 083 276 000) v Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (ACN 111 052 585) [2009] FCA 400</tocase>
<text>These reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons given today in action number NSD 584 of 2008 in which the defendants to these proceedings are the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in these proceedings are the defendants: Hardel Investments Pty Ltd (ACN 083 276 000) v Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (ACN 111 052 585) [2009] FCA 400.

This is an application by the defendants for the costs of these proceedings. It is necessary to trace the history of the proceedings before identifying against whom the defendants seek orders for costs and the particular orders sought. THE PROCEEDINGS

Both these proceedings were commenced in the New South Wales Registry of this Court on 28 March 2008 by the plaintiffs seeking the winding up of the two defendants in the separate proceedings in insolvency pursuant to s 459P of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ). In both proceedings the plaintiffs claimed to be creditors of the defendants and relied upon the defendant's failure to comply with two statutory demands. They claimed that debts had been assigned to them.

As I have said in [2] of these reasons, these reasons should be read with the reasons in Hardel Investments Pty Ltd (ACN 083 276 000) v Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (ACN 111 052 585) [2009] FCA 400 given today. I have made no order for costs in that proceeding for the reasons given.

However, the affidavit sworn by Peter William Harris on 28 April 2008 which was filed in that other proceeding was used extensively in these proceedings and for the purpose of these reasons. Indeed, the defendants filed an affidavit in each of these proceedings sworn by Mr Harris on the same day in which he referred to and relied upon his affidavit sworn in the other proceeding. In that way the affidavit was used in these proceedings.

It would be appropriate to allow the defendants the costs of that affidavit even though it was filed in the other proceeding because it contained the relevant information relied upon by the defendants for the defence of these proceedings. The costs which the defendants are entitled to recover on the orders in these proceedings shall include the costs of the preparation, swearing and filing of Mr Harris' affidavit sworn on 28 April 2008 and filed in action number NSD 584 of 2008.</text>

<tocase>Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/28.html</AustLII>
<text>That decision was given about three weeks before the High Court's decision in Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178. In that case, the High Court was concerned with s 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1857 which provided, "The Supreme Court shall have power to award costs in all cases lawfully brought before it and not provided for otherwise than by this section." Order 91 rule 1 of the Rules of Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland provided that costs should be in the discretion of the Court.

The High Court held that the discretion to award costs was not confined to the parties to the proceeding but that the Rules conferred jurisdiction to make orders for costs against non-parties and, in that case, the receiver.

The decision in Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 and its application to s 43 of the Federal Court Act was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 471 ; (1993) 45 FCR 224. The Full Court said at 229: 
 There seems no reason to doubt that s 43 confers upon the court jurisdiction to award costs not only against persons who are parties but also against persons who are not. Clearly the section is no narrower than the provisions of O 91, r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered by the High Court in Knight v FP Special Assets .

The Federal Court Act and Rules recognise that the Court may make orders for costs against non-parties in accordance with the general rules relating to costs: Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178. That jurisdiction must carry with it the power to enforce any order that justice demands be made. If it be necessary to make an order that the non-party be made a party so that an order can be made that the non-party pay that party's costs then it must be assumed that the Court has jurisdiction to make the non-party a party to the proceeding. Order 6 rule 8 gives that power to the Court.

Where it appears that a non-party ought to be held liable to pay a party's costs the Court can, in my opinion, utilise O 6 r 8(1)(b) to join that non-party to the proceeding.

It follows therefore that if I am of the opinion that any of the non-parties should be ordered to pay the defendants' costs and contrary to my opinion s 1335(2) prevents any such order being made, I can make an order joining those non-parties as parties to the proceedings.

Mason CJ and Deane J (with whom Gaudron J agreed) said in Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; 174 CLR 178 at 192-193: 
 For our part, we consider it appropriate to recognize a general category of case in which an order for costs should be made against a non-party and which would encompass the case of a receiver of a company who is not a party to the litigation. That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw, where the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed, has an interest in the subject of the litigation. Where the circumstances of a case fall within that category, an order for costs should be made against the non-party if the interests of justice require that it be made.

It cannot be thought, as some of the non-parties contended, that the High Court was intending to lay down the only category of case in which an order for costs may be made against a non-party.

The discretion to award costs against a non-party is unfettered except that it must be exercised judicially. Having said that, the cases identify the principles upon which the exercise of the discretion might be exercised.

The categories of costs in which a court may order a non-party to pay costs are not closed: Applicant NAGM of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 396 ; (2002) 125 FCR 488. In that case, at [62] the Court said: 
 There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non-party has been exercised, if not frequently, then with some degree of regularity. One such category is where the non-party is considered to be the "real party" to the litigation: Knight v Special Assets at 188 per Mason CJ and Dean J. Another is where the non-party is a legal representative of a party to the proceedings. A costs order may be made, for example, against a solicitor in consequence of his or her conduct in the litigation: Caboolture Park at 231. While s 43 of the Federal Court Act empowers the Court to make a costs order against a legal representative of a party, a second source of jurisdiction is the "implied", "accrued" or "inherent" jurisdiction of the Court over its own officers: Caboolture Park at 231.</text>

<tocase>L &amp; D Audio Acoustics Pty Ltd v Pioneer Electronic Australia Pty Ltd (1982) 7 ACLR 180 </tocase>
<text>The winding up procedure is not to be used for the purpose of compelling a solvent company to pay a disputed debt: Radiancy (Sales) Pty Ltd v Bimat Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 962 ; (2007) 25 ACLC 1216. Nor is it to be used for the purpose of coercing a company into paying a debt without allowing the company a reasonable opportunity to ascertain that the debt is payable: L &amp; D Audio Acoustics Pty Ltd v Pioneer Electronics Australia Pty Ltd (1982) 7 ACLR 180 at 183.

In L &amp; D Audio Acoustics Pty Ltd v Pioneer Electronic Australia Pty Ltd (1982) 7 ACLR 180 , McLelland J said at 183: 
 Proceedings by a person as creditor for the winding up of a company on the ground that it is unable to pay its debts will ordinarily be held to be an abuse of process: 

 
(1) if the winding up proceedings are bound to fail eg if it is clear that the applicant will not be able to prove that he is a creditor within the meaning of s 363(1)(b) of the Code, or will not be able to prove that the company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 364(1)(e);
 
 
(2) if the application is made for some improper purpose eg if the applicant is seeking to use the winding up proceedings to coerce a company into paying an alleged debt without affording the company a reasonable opportunity to ascertain or have it established that the debt is properly payable; or
 
 
(3) if issues will arise in the winding up proceedings of a kind inappropriate for determination in such proceedings eg a substantial contest as to the existence or enforceability of a debt relied on by the applicant, which should properly be resolved in separate proceedings brought for that purpose.

The question to be determined when it is asserted that the proceedings constitute an abuse of process is the purpose for which the proceedings have been brought. If the proceedings have been brought for an ulterior or collateral purpose, then the proceedings are an abuse of the Court's processes. The party who has initiated the proceedings may then be liable to pay the costs of the party against whom the proceedings were brought on an indemnity basis.

The defendants' claims for indemnity costs against the plaintiffs and the non-parties necessitate an examination of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the bringing of the winding up applications and the circumstances which transpired after their commencement.</text>

<tocase>Naomi Marble and Granite Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Company Ltd (No 2) [1998] QSC 18 ; (1999) 1 Qd R 518</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/1998/18.html</AustLII>
<text>In Naomi Marble and Granite Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Company Ltd (No 2) [1998] QSC 18 ; (1999) 1 Qd R 518 , Shepherdson J identified categories of cases where it might be appropriate to make an order for costs against a non-party. He said at 545: Where a person has some management of the action e.g. a director of an insolvent company who causes the company improperly to prosecute or defend a proceeding (191).
 Where a person has maintained or financed the action (citing Singh v. Observer Ltd [1989] 2 All E.R. 751). 
 
 Balcombe L.J. was a member of the Court of Appeal in each of Bahai v. Rashidian and Symphony Group and in Symphony Group went on to say that he accepted that the categories which he had set out were neither rigid nor closed. 

 
 To the above two categories of non-parties against whom costs orders may be made the following can be added: 

 
 (a) Where the unsuccessful party is a corporation (as is the case here) the director or directors who have the right to control the corporation; ( Oz B and S Pty Ltd v. Elders IXL Ltd [1993] FCA 371 ; (1993) 117 A.L.R. 128 (Einfeld J.); Re Land and Property Trust Co. Plc. [1991] 1 W.L.R. 601 at 604-605 and H. Leverton Ltd v. Crawford Offshore (Exploration) Services Ltd unreported decision on costs of Garland J. in Queens Bench Division dated 11 October 1996). 

 
 (b) In the situation of a party to litigation who was an insolvent person or a man of straw, a person who has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and who has an interest in the subject matter of the litigation ( Knight v. F.P. Special Assets Limited at 193 in a passage I set out earlier in these reasons). 

 
 (c) Where the non-party is the effective litigant standing behind the actual party Knight v. F.P. Special Assets Limited at 202 (per Dawson J.). 

 
 (d) Where the non-party is funding or otherwise financially assisting the unsuccessful party to the litigation and stands to benefit if that party has been successful ( Re Foster; Ex parte Foster v. Duus (1994) 121 A.L.R. 494 at 503; (Einfeld J.) H. Leverton Ltd v. Crawford Offshore (Exploration) Services Ltd) . 

 
 (e) Where a non-party has supported the unsuccessful party and has done so acting in bad faith towards the other parties and towards the court such as by giving false testimony or forging documents or preventing relevant documents being discovered ( H. Leverton Ltd v. Crawford Offshore (Exploration) Services Ltd ).

As I have already said, I am not satisfied that either of the plaintiffs are in a position to satisfy an order for indemnity costs which is the order I propose to make against them. As I have already said, CBH's financial position is that Mrs Byrnes would be in a position to cause CBH not to be able to pay costs if she called upon the amount owing to her. Dr Low has not descended into advising the Court of the financial position of Alpha.

In my opinion, the plaintiffs may well be incapable of satisfying the orders for costs which are to be made against them.</text>

<tocase>Packer v Meagher (1984) 3 NSWLR 486</tocase>
<text>That finding is enough, it seems to me, to make the order sought by the defendants that the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs on an indemnity basis: In the matter of Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd (1990) 1 WAR 465 ; Packer v Meagher (1984) 3 NSWLR 486. In Ragata Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1993) 217 ALR 175 , Davies J said at [7]: 
 ... it is not open to an individual Judge to award costs having regard to his own view as to the adequacy of party/party costs so fixed. An award of costs on an indemnity basis may be made only in a special case, where the circumstances justify departure from the ordinary principle. The circumstances must be such as to justify an award indemnifying the successful party in respect of all of the costs incurred, save only as to those costs which are unreasonable in amount. 

 
 The very nature of the award of costs on an indemnity basis gives a guide to the type of case in which such an award is appropriate. Thus, indemnity costs may be awarded where unsuccessful proceedings have been brought and prosecuted, not for the bona fide purpose of protecting and enforcing a legal right, but to achieve an ulterior or extraneous purpose. 

 
However, there are further reasons for making the orders.</text>

<text>This is not to try a hypothetical action between the parties. The Court should not be called upon to decide whether the plaintiffs' proceedings if pursued would or would not have succeeded. The parties should not be burdened with the conduct of proceedings already dismissed. Moreover, the only evidence before the Court is in affidavit form. The Court has not had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses on matters where the facts are in dispute. In those circumstances, the inquiry must be limited to whether commencing the proceedings was reasonable and whether the conduct in the proceedings, including the conduct leading up to my dismissing the proceedings, was reasonable: Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Quin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 per McHugh J at 624.

<text>The decision in U.T.S.A. v Ultra Tune 1 VR 204 was followed by Brereton J in Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 238. His Honour said at [50]-[51]: 
 At first sight, the suggestion that the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted a provision to detract from the existing costs powers of courts in which it invests jurisdiction to deal with proceedings under the Corporations Act is a surprising one. But were it not for the judgment of Chernov J in UTSA , despite these initial impressions about s 1335 , I would unquestionably have followed Wridgemont and Australian Forest Managers , particularly given Lindgren J's strong endorsement of Wridgemont , and also given that those cases had been followed in this court by Bergin J. However, in circumstances where there has been, since Australian Forest Managers , what impresses me as a compelling analysis of the history and purpose of the section by Chernov J &#8212; the benefit of which does not appear to have been afforded to Bergin J when her Honour came to consider the point &#8212; and where Ryan J, albeit without reference to the authorities, had adopted an opposite approach, I consider that I am at liberty to give effect to my own views. 

 
 I agree with Chernov J that s 1335 should not be construed as a limiting provision, but as an enabling one. Its history shows that it was intended to confer a jurisdiction or a power to make costs orders when there was doubt as to the existence that power, at least in the equitable jurisdiction of this court in this state. If there were no s 1335(2) , the court would not be without power to make costs orders in proceedings under the Act; it would have all its powers under the Supreme Court Act and the Civil Procedure Act. Section 1335 was not intended to limit such other powers to make costs orders as the court already enjoyed, but to supplement them. In my opinion, the current provisions ought not be taken as intended to exclude the power of courts under, for example, Civil Procedure Act, s 98, and UCPR, r 42.27, to make costs orders which are designed to protect the processes of the courts and the integrity of those processes and the procedural rights of parties who litigate in those courts.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/604.html</AustLII>
<text>The non-parties' argument was accepted by Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; (1992) 39 FCR 193. In that case, Jenkinson J held that s 43(2) had to be read subject to s 1335(2) which limits persons whom the Court may direct to bear the costs of the proceeding to those who are parties to the proceeding. He thought, however, an application could be made to join a person as a party to obtain an order for costs.

The non-parties contended that I should follow the decision of Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and Lindgren J in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431. Both those decisions were given prior to the enactment of the Corporations Act but s 1335(2) has been re-enacted in the Corporations Act . There is nothing in the Corporations Act itself which would allow those decisions to be distinguished. I should as a matter of comity and unless I think the decisions to be plainly wrong follow them.

The decision in U.T.S.A. v Ultra Tune 1 VR 204 was followed by Brereton J in Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 238. His Honour said at [50]-[51]:

Professor Dal Pont GE in Law of Costs (2nd ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2009) says, after referring to Jenkinson J's decision: 
 [22.11] ... 

 
 As a significant proportion of proceedings under the Corporations Law are heard before the Federal Court, it appears strange that that court &#8212; which by s 43(1) of its Act is conferred the jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before it except those 'in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded' &#8212; should be denied the jurisdiction to make a non-party costs orders in this context. In that s 1335(2) simply replicates the former s 533(2) of the Companies Code, enacted prior to the courts' recognition of a jurisdiction to order costs against non-parties, it could not have been intended to deny that jurisdiction. Certainly this has not been the approach of other judges when ordering costs against directors, receivers or liquidators of companies as litigants. Moreover, s 43(2) deals with the court's discretion , not its jurisdiction, which is the province of s 43(1), and which is not expressed '[e]xcept as provided by any other Act'. 

 
 [22.12] The fact remains that s 1335(2), as a more specific provision than either s 43(1) or 43(2), could be argued to prevail. Even so, it does not necessarily follow that s 1335(2) should be seen as ousting the operation of s 43(1) or 43(2), which provisions can arguably operate consistently with s 1335(2). To remove any degree of uncertainty, however, it would be useful if the legislature either reworded s 1335(2) to extend to non-parties, or defined the term 'party' more extensively. This is more pressing following the replacement of the Corporations Law with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which comes within the phrase 'any other Act' in s 43(2). 

 
 In any case, Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes referred to O 71 r 10(4) of the Federal Court Rules , which empowers the court to order a person who is or claims to be a creditor, contributory or officer of the company to be added as a respondent in proceedings under the Corporations Law. According to his Honour, this power could circumvent the lack of jurisdiction just mentioned, allowing it to be exercised in a case where the court considers that such a person ought to bear the costs of the proceeding.

Like Brereton J, I would have, but for the decision of Chernov J, followed the decisions at first instance in this Court. However, in my opinion, Chernov J's reasoning is compelling and I think should be adopted. For the reasons given by Chernov J in relation to the legislative history of s 1335(2), s 1335(2) does not limit the operation or reach of s 43(1) of the Federal Court Act.

It would be surprising if Parliament intended in enacting the Corporations Act to limit the circumstances where this Court might make an order for costs to parties or parties to the particular proceeding and to exclude from the scope of an order for costs non-parties who would, if it were not for the proceeding being brought under the Corporations Law, be liable to pay the costs of a party to the proceeding.

The defendants contended that in the event that the decisions of this Court in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431 are to be preferred to the decisions of in U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd 1 VR 204 and Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; 56 ACSR 238 then I should make an order joining the non-parties as parties for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of s 1335(2).

The defendants relied upon the dicta in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 in support of this contention. In that case, Jenkinson J said that the obstacle which was presented by s 1335(2) on his construction of that subsection "may, and in an appropriate case should, be obviated by the exercise of the power conferred by Order 71, rule 10(4)" to join a non-party whom the Court considers ought to bear the costs of the proceedings. The equivalent of O 71 r 10(4) is now rule 2.13 of the Corporations Rules.

Rule 1.3 of the Corporations Rules provides that those rules apply to a proceeding in this Court under the Corporations Act : Rule 1.3(1)(a). The rules also provide that the other rules of the Court apply to the extent they are relevant and not inconsistent with the Corporations Rules: Rule 1.3(2). It follows that an examination of the Corporations Rules must be made to determine whether a source of power exists for the joinder of non-parties to a proceeding under the Corporations Act .

Rule 2.13 deals with creditors, contributories and officers of a corporation and empowers the Court to give leave to allow such persons to be heard in a proceeding without becoming a party to the proceeding. Rule 2.13(3) provides: 
 (3) The Court may order that a person who is, or who claims to be, a creditor, contributory or officer of a corporation be added as a defendant to the proceeding.

The Master thought he was constrained by the decisions in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431 from ordering costs against persons who were not parties. However, he was of the opinion that O 63.21 of the Supreme Court Rules of the Northern Territory, which provides for the costs liability of a legal practitioner where the legal practitioner has caused costs to be incurred improperly or without reasonable cause or be wasted by undue delay or negligence or by some other misconduct or default, was not in conflict with either the Corporations Regulations or s 1335(2).</text>

<tocase>U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 13 ; (1999) 1 VR 204</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/1998/13.html</AustLII>
<text>That decision was followed by Chernov J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 13 ; (1999) 1 VR 204. His Honour held that orders for costs are truly supplemental and do not affect the legal impact of the earlier judgment. He said at 208: 
 Consequently, it is my view that the entry of judgment in this case did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear and determine an application under s. 24(1) of the Act for an order that the non-party respondents pay U.T.A.'s costs incurred in relation to its proceeding against U.T.S.A. and Titan.

It follows therefore that the Court would have jurisdiction to order costs against the non-parties in these proceedings even though orders have already been made dismissing the proceedings.

The non-parties argued that s 1335(2) of the Corporations Act is a bar to making an order in a proceeding under the Corporations Act against a non-party. Section 1335(2) provides: 
 The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the proceeding as the court, in its discretion, directs.

However, there are decisions of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the Supreme Court of New South Wales which need to be considered. In U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd 1 VR 204, Chernov J was concerned with an application by the defendant to a proceeding for an order that two non-parties pay the costs of the proceeding. His Honour assumed, but later decided otherwise, that the proceeding with which he was concerned was a proceeding under the Act.

The two non-parties sought to set aside the notice of motion seeking costs on two grounds. First, because judgment had been entered and therefore there was no jurisdiction for the Court to exercise its discretion under s 24(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) (SC Act (Vic)) to order that costs be paid by the respondents; and secondly, because s 24(1) of the SC Act (Vic) which gave the Court jurisdiction to award costs was to be read subject to s 1335(2) of the Corporations Law.

The decision in U.T.S.A. v Ultra Tune 1 VR 204 was followed by Brereton J in Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; (2005) 56 ACSR 238. His Honour said at [50]-[51]: 
 At first sight, the suggestion that the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted a provision to detract from the existing costs powers of courts in which it invests jurisdiction to deal with proceedings under the Corporations Act is a surprising one. But were it not for the judgment of Chernov J in UTSA , despite these initial impressions about s 1335 , I would unquestionably have followed Wridgemont and Australian Forest Managers , particularly given Lindgren J's strong endorsement of Wridgemont , and also given that those cases had been followed in this court by Bergin J. However, in circumstances where there has been, since Australian Forest Managers , what impresses me as a compelling analysis of the history and purpose of the section by Chernov J &#8212; the benefit of which does not appear to have been afforded to Bergin J when her Honour came to consider the point &#8212; and where Ryan J, albeit without reference to the authorities, had adopted an opposite approach, I consider that I am at liberty to give effect to my own views. 

 
 I agree with Chernov J that s 1335 should not be construed as a limiting provision, but as an enabling one. Its history shows that it was intended to confer a jurisdiction or a power to make costs orders when there was doubt as to the existence that power, at least in the equitable jurisdiction of this court in this state. If there were no s 1335(2) , the court would not be without power to make costs orders in proceedings under the Act; it would have all its powers under the Supreme Court Act and the Civil Procedure Act. Section 1335 was not intended to limit such other powers to make costs orders as the court already enjoyed, but to supplement them. In my opinion, the current provisions ought not be taken as intended to exclude the power of courts under, for example, Civil Procedure Act, s 98, and UCPR, r 42.27, to make costs orders which are designed to protect the processes of the courts and the integrity of those processes and the procedural rights of parties who litigate in those courts.

The defendants contended that in the event that the decisions of this Court in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 604 ; 39 FCR 193 and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd (in liq) v Bramley 136 ALR 431 are to be preferred to the decisions of in U.T.S.A. Pty Ltd (In liquidation) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd 1 VR 204 and Re Struthers (liq of Project Management, Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd) (No 3) [2005] NSWSC 1113 ; 56 ACSR 238 then I should make an order joining the non-parties as parties for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of s 1335(2).</text>

<tocase>Vestris v Cashman (1998) 72 SASR 449</tocase>
<text>In Vestris v Cashman (1998) 72 SASR 449 at 467, I said, when a member of the Supreme Court of South Australia: 
 The circumstances in which it is just to order costs against a person who was not a party to the litigation will be both rare and exceptional: see Aiden Shipping Ltd v Interbulk Ltd per Lord Gough of Chieveley. If the order for costs which is sought against non-parties in lieu of, in substitution for or complementary to an order for costs against a party, the circumstances for making such an order will not arise unless there is some connection or association between the party to the litigation and the non-party against whom the order for costs is sought. The connection must be of a kind that makes it just to make an order for costs in that the connection must be material to the question of costs: see Bischof v Adams (1992) 2 VR 198 at 205.

The ordinary rule is that only parties to the proceedings will be subject to costs orders but that rule will give way where "within the circumstances of the particular case, it is just and equitable that a non-party pay the costs of a party to the litigation": Vestris v Cashman 72 SASR 449 at 469.</text>
