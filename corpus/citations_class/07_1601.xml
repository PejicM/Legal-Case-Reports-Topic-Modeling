<text>57 In the ordinary case, an opportunity should be given to a person affected by a decision to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. While procedural fairness does not normally require the decision maker to disclose his or her thinking processes or proposed conclusions, it may be that an adverse conclusion of a type that could not reasonably be expected by a person affected by a decision ought to be brought to that person's attention, as a matter of fairness ( Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council [2002] NSWCA 288 ; 55 NSWLR 381 at [260] and [261]).</text>

<text>56 Where the requirements for procedural fairness apply, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision maker in support of an outcome that supports that person's interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify, by further information and comment, adverse material from other sources that are put before the decision maker. The decision maker is required to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision that is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision maker must advise of any adverse conclusion that has been arrived at that would not obviously be open on the known material. On the other hand, a decision maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views for comment by an affected person before making the decision in question ( Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd 127 ALR 699 at pp 714-715).</text>

<text>59 The content to be given to an obligation to accord procedural fairness must accommodate the particular provisions made in the enactment that regulates how the decision maker is to go about the task of decision making. The application of principles of procedural fairness in a particular case must always be moulded to the particular circumstances of that case ( Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; 225 CLR 88 at [10] and [25]).</text>

<tocase>South Australia v Slipper [2004] FCAFC 164 ; 136 FCR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/164.html</AustLII>
<text>54 When a statute confers a power on a public official, the exercise of which affects a person's rights, interests or expectations, that power must be exercised in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness unless the rules are excluded by express terms or by necessary implication. A legislative intention to exclude the rules will not be assumed or spelt out from indirect references, uncertain inferences or equivocal considerations. In particular, such an intention should not be inferred merely from the presence in the relevant statute of rights that are commensurate with some of the rules of procedural fairness. The rules may be excluded because the power in question is, of its nature, one that is to be exercised in circumstances of urgency or emergency. However, urgency will not of itself exclude the right to procedural fairness, although it may, in particular circumstances, reduce the content of the right to procedural fairness ( South Australia v Slipper [2004] FCAFC 164 ; 136 FCR 259 at [93] ).

55 The requirement for procedural fairness does not require a decision maker to disclose what the decision maker is minded to decide, so that parties affected may have a further opportunity of criticising the mental processes of the decision maker before a final decision is reached. A decision maker is generally not obliged to invite comment on the evaluation of the subject's case. On the other hand, procedural fairness requires that a party affected by a decision be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material. Thus, the subject of a decision is entitled to have his or her mind directed to the critical issues or factors on which the decision is likely to turn in order to have an opportunity of dealing with it and is entitled to respond to any adverse conclusion drawn by the decision maker on material supplied by or known to the subject that is not an obvious and natural evaluation of that material.</text>

<text>60 An executive or administrative decision of a kind that affects a person as a member of the public or a class of the public may properly be characterised as a " policy " or " political " decision. In such a case, there will be no entitlement to procedural fairness in relation to the making of the decision vested in a member of the public or a member of a class of the public affected by the decision ( Salemi v Mackellar No 2 [1977] HCA 26 ; 137 CLR 396 at 452). A minister is not bound to hear an individual before formulating or applying a general policy or exercising a discretion in a particular case by reference to the interests of the general public, even where the decision affects an individual's interests. A minister may determine general policy or the interests of the general public free of procedural constraints. A minister will be confined only by the limits otherwise expressed or implied by statute ( South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39 ; 163 CLR 378 at 411).</text>
