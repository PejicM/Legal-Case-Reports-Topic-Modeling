<tocase>Abela v Giew (1964) 81 WN (Part 1) (NSW) 344</tocase>
<text>The general approach is that where a party satisfies the Court that he or she generally desires to amend the pleadings so as to alter an existing claim or to introduce a new claim, leave should be granted unless the proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out if it had appeared in the original pleading or would cause substantial injustice which cannot be compensated for in the manner indicated in [14] above: Abela v Giew (1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 344 at 345.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The overriding concerns should be to ensure that all matters in issue upon which the parties seek adjudication are determined in the proceeding and to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings: Caruso Australia Pty Ltd v Portec Australia Pty Ltd [1986] FCA 40.

Order 13 rule 2(2) of the Rules makes explicit reference to this principle: 
 
 'All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding, or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings.'</text>

<text>The starting point is that all of such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided: Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146; Dresna Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1537. Although O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') confers a discretion on the Court as to whether to allow the amendments, it is well-established that an amendment will ordinarily be allowed provided it can be done without harm to the other party which cannot be compensated by an award of costs or an adjournment: The Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394; Londish v Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd (1993) 45 FCR 128.</text>

<tocase>Ketterman v Hansel Properties Ltd [1987] AC 189</tocase>
<text>It is recognised that the allowance of an amendment before a trial begins (when there is time for a proper defence to be filed) stands in a very different position from amendment towards the end of a trial: Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd [1987] AC 189 at 220 per Lord Griffiths.

The proposed amendments in or to paras 5A, 13, 33, 34 and 37 relate to Spirits' claim against Diageo based on alleged misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a beverage referred to as the Ruski RTD.

Diageo opposes Spirits' amendments to paras 13 and 33 (and related paras 34 and 37) of the proposed FASC on the basis that Spirits have not pleaded material facts in support of the allegations in paras 13 and 33 (and related paras 34 and 37).</text>

<tocase>North-Western Salt Company Ltd v Electrolytic Alkali Company Ltd [1913] 3 KB 422</tocase>
<text>Diageo claims that paras 47C, 47D and 48A to 48C plead the law relating to the implication of terms to give business efficacy to a contract in support of the allegation that there are certain implied terms in the First Agreement (when read together with or amended by the Supplementary Agreements, First SPI Assignment and Second SPI Assignment). However, Diageo submits that it is trite that a statement of claim must only plead material facts and not evidence or legal propositions: O 11 r 2; North-Western Salt Company Ltd v Electrolytic Alkali Company Ltd [1913] 3 KB 422 at 425.

Accordingly, Diageo submitted that leave should not be granted with respect to the amendments in paras 47C, 47D and 48A to 48C. They amount to statements of legal propositions and are embarrassing. For this reason, no leave should be given to amend paras 48 and 49 because Spirits have not pleaded any material facts in support of the amendments.

When pressed, Senior Counsel for Spirits submitted that the opening words of para 48: 'By reason of the matters pleaded above ...', is a reference to paras 38 to 47D of the proposed FASC, and that para 47D is a pleading of fact. I tend to agree with the latter submission although it might be more accurate to describe para 47D as a pleading of mixed fact and law, as it would be to describe a number of the other pleadings from para 38 onwards.</text>

<tocase>Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-633</tocase>
<text>The basis of Diageo's opposition to a grant of leave with respect to the proposed amendments in [3] is that Spirits have failed to plead material facts in support of their amended causes of action and that the proposed amendments are embarrassing because they do not enable Diageo to understand and plead to the new causes of action. Diageo submits that a pleading must state with particular clarity the factual basis upon which a foundation of a cause of action under Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth) ('the TPA') is based: Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-633 at 40,977.

I am not sure that I fully comprehend what lies behind the submission that the proposed amendments are embarrassing to Diageo. Diageo's submission that it is unable to understand and plead a response flies in the face of a plea in denial; such a pleading may turn out to be embarrassing, but any embarrassment in those circumstances will be at the feet of Spirits' articulation of their pleading and not at the feet of Diageo's response. I do not view such a prospect as a basis for necessarily withholding leave to amend; in certain circumstances it may be. The real issue on the motion is whether such circumstances exist in the present case.

Spirits plead no cause of action and make no claim for relief against Federal Treasury Enterprise (FKP) Sojuzplodoimport ('FKPS'), the party nominally titled 'the Second Respondent'. FKPS was joined as the second respondent to this proceeding by order of Gyles J in December 2004, for the purpose only of enabling FKPS to file and serve a cross-claim against Spirits.

This proceeding was commenced by Spirits against Diageo by way of application and statement of claim filed on 7 December 2004.

On 2 December 2005 Spirits filed an Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim ('ASC') with the leave of the Court. Diageo consented to the grant of leave in that instance.</text>
