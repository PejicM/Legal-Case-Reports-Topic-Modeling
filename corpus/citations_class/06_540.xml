<tocase>Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349 </tocase>
<text>210 Second, the applicant contends that a duty to act in good faith should also be implied into the Mentone BSA generally, or into the right to terminate specifically. The general duty is said to include an obligation of full and frank disclosure of all matters relevant to the implementation of the agreement. The applicant submits that the term is to be implied ad hoc, and as a matter of law. See Renard ; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151 at 190-98 per Finn J; Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349; Garry Rogers Motors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Subaru (Aust) Pty Ltd (1999) ATPR |P41-703; Central Exchange Ltd v Anaconda Nickel Ltd (2001) 24 WAR 382; GEC Marconi Systems v BHP-IT [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at [920] per Finn J; and Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [61] - [65] per Finkelstein J. I note that the latter case was the subject of a Full Court appeal in which judgment was given following the hearing of this proceeding.

<text>207 First, the applicant says that the Mentone BSA contained an implied term not to deprive a party of the benefit of that agreement. The applicant submits that this term should be implied by operation of law or, alternatively, on an ad hoc basis. I understand that latter category of implied term to refer to what is sometimes described as an "implication of fact", and to which the rules laid down in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Hastings Shire Council [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266 (" BP Refinery ") and Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 (" Codelfa ") apply.

212 The applicant also relies upon two implied terms it submits constitute part of the litigation agreement. The first term is the same term implied into the Mentone BSA, namely an obligation not to deprive a party of the benefit of an agreement. The second term is an implied term requiring each party to provide full and frank disclosure of any matter relevant to the Supreme Court proceedings. This term is said to be implied by operation of law as a concomitant of the duty to act faithfully or, alternatively, on an ad hoc basis. See BP Refinery and Codelfa .</text>

<tocase>Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In Liq) formerly Franklins Management Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1011</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1011.html</AustLII>
<text>16 In May 2005, the applicant settled its claims against Coles, and the Lessor. It did not, however, resolve its claims against Franklins. In June 2005, Franklins, somewhat belatedly, sought leave to bring cross-claims against Coles and the Lessor. Such leave was refused: Dresna Pty Ltd v Linknarf Management Services Pty Ltd (In Liq) formerly Franklins Management Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1011.

17 In its final incarnation, the application before me against the remaining respondents, the two Franklins parties, is an application for damages for breach of contract, breach of s 52 of the TPA, and breach of fiduciary duty.

18 The applicant's claims for breach of contract arise from two agreements. The first agreement is a business sale agreement dated 8 August 2001 between Franklins on the one hand, and the applicant and Mr Blake on the other. It will be convenient to describe this business sale agreement as "the Mentone BSA". The second agreement, which was said to be partially written, and partially oral, was entered into on or about 28 September 2001. That agreement, between Franklins and the applicant, involved them in jointly bringing proceedings, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, against the Lessor for unreasonably withholding consent to the assignment of the lease of the Mentone store to the applicant. For convenience sake, I will refer to this agreement as "the litigation agreement".</text>

<text>216 It is true that the parties in this case agreed to join together to procure the Lessor's consent to the assignment of the lease, including jointly commencing proceedings against the Lessor in the Supreme Court. However, the basis for those arrangements was a conditional , commercial, arms length agreement for the sale of a business from one party to another. While Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 per Mason J at 99-100 makes clear that commercial transactions do not "stand outside the fiduciary regime", it does not follow that such transactions necessarily give rise to fiduciary obligations.</text>

<text>165 The Turner document is important and, as such, I shall set it out in full. The email from Mr Rattray-Wood states:
 
 "From: Alan Rattray-Wood 
 Sent: Monday, 15 October 2001 9.59 
 To: Joanne Turner 
 Cc: Roger Stansfield; Jim Rush; Natalie Wilson 
 Subject: Mentone -Blake 
 
 Jo, 
 Could you please let me know when you have managed to get Coles to call Susan Herbert (Landlord Solicitor 03 92299999) about advising her client that Coles have no interest in this property. As advised on Friday, this looks like going full on legal if we don't quash their perceived options. 
 thanks, 
 Alan"

166 There is then a handwritten note on the print out of the email saying "John Kop please call". As previously mentioned, Mr Kop was the project manager for Project Lincoln within Coles.

167 Under this is another handwritten note which states as follows:
 
 "Alan, 
 Mary has spoken to Coles. Coles have done a deal in principle here, based on vacant possession. Mary has told Coles that Franklins is going to litigate &amp; hopefully scared them off with the threat of tortious interference , let alone jeopardising our deal with Coles on the whole . 
 Jo." (emphasis added)

195 Many of the documents upon which the applicant relied in support of its circumstantial case were prepared by people who would not have been directly involved in any negotiations that took place between Franklins and Coles, and may not have known what was happening at the level that counted. For example, the Turner document, though capable of having the sinister connotation that the applicant placed upon it, it also perfectly capable of being read in an innocent light. One interpretation of the document is that Ms Turner did not appreciate that the agreement to sell the first tranche of stores to Coles had already been finalised ten days earlier, and that was the "deal with Coles on the whole" to which she was referring. The fact that Ms Turner was not called to give evidence lends some support to the applicant's case regarding the interpretation to be given to this document. See generally Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. However, that does not, in my view, override the highly favourable impression that I formed of Mr Cornell as a witness in this proceeding.

196 It is arguable that the applicant has a stronger case in relation to its claim that the November 2001 dealings constituted a breach of Franklins' contractual obligations. The real substance of this claim is that Franklins "jumped the gun" in terms of seeking the ACCC's consent to sell the Mentone store to Coles, and in concluding an agreement with Coles to do so. It did both these things, according to the applicant, while it still owed obligations, both contractual and fiduciary, to the applicant.

197 The Mentone BSA and the litigation agreement were both still on foot on 23 November 2001. Notice to terminate these agreements was not served until 28 November 2001. The Mentone BSA required seven business days notice to be terminated. Accordingly, the Mentone BSA remained on foot until 7 December 2001. However, in relation to the litigation agreement, the applicant accepts that it came to an end on 28 November 2001.</text>

<tocase>Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234</tocase>
<text>208 In Renard Constructions (ME) Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works (1992) 26 NSWLR 234 (" Renard "), Priestley JA commented upon the notion of implications on an ad hoc basis. His Honour said, at 255-6:
 
 "Questions of construction and different kinds of implication tend to blur together. In recent years terms implied in contracts have been said to fall into two classes the first of which has come to be called, somewhat misleadingly, implication in fact, the second, implication by law. The so-called implication in fact is really implication by judge based on the judge's view of the actual intention of the parties drawn from the surrounding circumstances of the particular contract, its language, and its purposes, as they emerge from the language and in the circumstances. This has been called implication ad hoc (see Professor Lucke "Ad Hoc Implications in Written Contracts" (1973-1976) 5 Adelaide Law Review 32) a usage I will adopt."

210 Second, the applicant contends that a duty to act in good faith should also be implied into the Mentone BSA generally, or into the right to terminate specifically. The general duty is said to include an obligation of full and frank disclosure of all matters relevant to the implementation of the agreement. The applicant submits that the term is to be implied ad hoc, and as a matter of law. See Renard ; Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151 at 190-98 per Finn J; Alcatel Australia Ltd v Scarcella (1998) 44 NSWLR 349; Garry Rogers Motors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Subaru (Aust) Pty Ltd (1999) ATPR |P41-703; Central Exchange Ltd v Anaconda Nickel Ltd (2001) 24 WAR 382; GEC Marconi Systems v BHP-IT [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at [920] per Finn J; and Pacific Brands Sport &amp; Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 288 at [61] - [65] per Finkelstein J.

The applicant contends, by analogy, that the express promise of Franklins to use reasonable endeavours to satisfy the condition precedent necessarily includes an obligation not to hinder or prevent fulfilment of it.</text>

<tocase>United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/49.html</AustLII>
<text>217 The applicant relied upon the following passage in United Dominions Corporation Ltd v Brian Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ to support its case:
 
 "In particular, a fiduciary relationship with attendant fiduciary obligations may, and ordinarily will, exist between prospective partners who have embarked upon the conduct of the partnership business or venture before the precise terms of any partnership agreement have been settled. Indeed, in such circumstances, the mutual confidence and trust which underlie most consensual fiduciary relationships are likely to be more readily apparent than in the case where mutual rights and obligations have been expressly defined in some formal agreement. Likewise, the relationship between prospective partners or participants in a proposed partnership to carry out a single joint undertaking or endeavour will ordinarily be fiduciary if the prospective partners have reached an informal arrangement to assume such a relationship and have proceeded to take steps involved in its establishment or implementation."

218 The relationship between Franklins and the applicant was not one of "mutual trust and confidence". The arrangements between Franklins and the applicant concerning the efforts to obtain the consent of the Lessor to the assignment of the Mentone store lease had a singularly fragile quality. They could be terminated on short notice. At the first directions hearing in the Supreme Court proceedings on 19 October 2001, counsel then appearing for the applicant and Franklins submitted, in support of the application for expedition, that there was "nothing to stop the parties walking away". When counsel spoke of "the parties" he was referring to the applicant and Franklins. He also said that it was "a fair inference, given the nature of the commercial dealings between the parties, that the matter is quite fragile". That was an accurate statement of the parties' legal position vis-a-vis one another.
