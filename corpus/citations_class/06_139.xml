<text>8 This appeal essentially turns on the issue of whether the appellant has been able to establish a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. Unless a jurisdictional error is established, section 474(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') provides that, in effect, the decision of the Tribunal is final and conclusive and must not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in to question in any court. It is clear from the decisions of the High Court of Australia that the window for correction of errors in what the Tribunal did is narrow: see Abebe v Commonwealth Re Minister for Immigraiton [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at p 534 [50] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; Re Minister for Immigraiton and Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at p 409 [7] per McHugh J.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>9 In Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at p 506 [76] Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said that an administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is regarded in law as no decision at all. Thus, if there has been jurisdictional error due to, for example, a failure to discharge imperative duties or to observe inviolable limitations or restraints, the decision in question cannot properly be described in the terms used in section 474(2) as a " decision made under this Act ".

10 I have given anxious consideration to the material in the appeal papers and the submissions of the appellant for the purpose of seeing whether I can detect any arguable case of a jurisdictional error. I have also asked counsel for the Minister, pursuant to his duty to the Court, whether there is any basis, in the material before the court, on which an argument that there was a jurisdictional error might be raised other than the matters which I will discuss next. There was not identified by counsel or myself any such error which might be argued to exist. The judge below considered carefully and in detail each basis which the appellant put to him, many of which he also put to me.

11 Before turning to those issues, I should turn to a submission made at the outset of the appeal today by the appellant who said that the learned trial judge was biased because, in effect, he had upheld the appeal or I think, to use the appellant's words, supported what the Tribunal had done. I am not sure whether the appellant intended to connote anything more than he believed that the result was wrong and that the trial judge should not have found, as he did, that the Tribunal's decision revealed no error amenable to correction.</text>
