<text>Immediately after I made those orders and handed down the reasons for judgment, Mr Priestley made an application in each case pursuant to O 52 r 10 of the Federal Court Rules . He made no submissions as to why leave should be granted other than to repeat the fact that he invoked O 52 r 10 as was, he said, his right. In applying the test set out for the grant of leave to appeal in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 , I have concluded that neither decision was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of leave to appeal.

Further, no substantial injustice would be done if leave to appeal were not granted, even assuming that the decisions were wrong.

To the extent that it is relevant, the respondents say that, in each case, if the matters were to go to hearing, the same evidence would be adduced on their part although perhaps in a different form. This, however, is not conclusive of the matter.</text>

<text>After I formed the above view and informed the parties, Mr Priestley, in effect, sought leave to reopen his applications for leave to appeal in order to raise further matters as to why leave should be granted. He raised matters that were the subject of previous decisions by me in relation to the alleged invalidity of s 31A of the Federal Court Act and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ( Priestley v Godwin (No 3) [2008] FCA 1529 ; (2008) 172 FCR 139) and in relation to the applicability of the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ( Priestley v Godwin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1453 ; (2008) 171 FCR 493). He also raised allegations, unsupported by evidence, of what he termed bias and jurisdictional error. I dealt with Mr Priestley's allegations of bias in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179. Those allegations were also the subject of an application to the High Court and were described by French CJ as ' not tenable ' ( Priestley v Godwin (Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner) [2008] HCA 59 ; (2008) 251 ALR 612 at [31] ).</text>

<text>By applications filed on 3 January 2008, Mr Priestley sought orders pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') that the respondent(s) in each matter prepare and furnish a statement of reasons pursuant to s 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) for decisions that he characterised and which he said were made. In each case, the respondent(s) sought orders under s 31A of the Federal Court Act for summary dismissal. I concluded in each case that there was no decision as alleged by Mr Priestley. I dismissed each proceeding pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act ( Priestley v Godwin (No 4) [2009] FCA 560; Priestley v Hawker [2009] FCA 561). The applications for leave to appeal</text>
