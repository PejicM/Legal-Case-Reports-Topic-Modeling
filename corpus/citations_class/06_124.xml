<tocase>Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 241</tocase>
<text>22 It is appropriate and legitimate, in interpreting an award, to have regard to the "obvious intention of the maker of the award"; see Seymour v Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 241 at 259 and 260, per Gray J. At 244, in Seymour , Northrop J had regard to the transcript before the Commission on the making of the relevant award, but derived no assistance from it. Keely J, at 255 to 256, had regard to the transcript in arriving at his interpretation of the award.

23 Mr Burrows tended a document, before Blair C, on which the Commission relied in making sub-cl 24. The document was headed "Intent of the Variation". In its first paragraph it referred to full time employees. It stated that:
 
 "Full time employees who only work Monday-Friday as normal rostered hours will receive the public holiday benefit on the "substituted" days. This is exactly the same as currently exists." 

In this regard a reference to a substituted day is a day substituted by the award, formerly by sub-cl 22(b) of the 1992 award and now by sub-cl 24.2 of the current Award.

The "intent document" continued:
 
 "Full time employees who are not Monday-Friday workers will receive the public holiday benefits on the "actual" day, ie 25 December, 26 December and 1 January. This group includes employees who work either rotating rosters or fixed days other than Monday-Friday." 
 
 This definition includes the employees the subject of this proceeding.

24 The Commission, in making what became cl 24 of the current Award, intended to ensure that employees, who worked on Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Years Day, when those days fell on a weekend day, would receive the public holiday rate of pay for work performed on those days. There is no evidence that the Commission intended to expand the number of public holidays provided for by the award in respect of the Christmas-New Year period, thereby giving a nurse an entitlement to a paid public holiday as well as an additional public holiday declared by the State, in recognition of the fact that 25 and 26 December and 1 January were weekend days.</text>
