<text>The nature and history of the proceedings
 These two cases, heard together by the consent of the parties, raise the question whether the Refugee Review Tribunal considered all of the grounds on which each of the appellants claims to be entitled to a protection visa. Each appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia. The two cases were heard together in that court. The reasons for judgment of the learned federal magistrate in both cases are published as MZXQS v MIAC &amp; Anor and MZXQT v MIAC &amp; Anor [2008] FMCA 372. In each case, the federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"). In each case, the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (in both cases, "the Minister"), refusing to grant to the relevant appellant a protection visa.

The appellants are citizens of Sri Lanka, of Tamil ethnic origin. They are sisters. Because s 91X of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act ") requires that their names not be published, the older sister is identified in her proceeding as MZXQS and the younger as MZXQT. For the purposes of these reasons for judgment, when it is necessary to distinguish between the two appellants, I refer to them as "Appellant S" and "Appellant T" respectively. They arrived in Australia together, on 9 October 2006. Their applications for protection visas were both made on 20 November 2006. The initial decisions, rejecting their applications, were made on 9 January 2007. Their applications to the Tribunal for review of those decisions were both made on 25 January 2007. Both were represented by the same migration agents, one of whom is counsel who appeared for both appellants on the hearing of their appeals. On 22 February 2007, each appellant attended a Tribunal hearing. The member constituting the Tribunal was the same in both cases. That member signed each of the two decisions of the Tribunal on 30 April 2007, and they were sent to the respective appellants on 10 May 2007.

By s 36 of the Migration Act , there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to refer to these two documents, taken together, as the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who: 
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country

<text>Each of the appellants made two separate and distinct claims that were not considered by the Tribunal. They were claims based on imputed political opinion as a result of the appellants' sister's position, and claims based on the proposition that they would be members of a particular social group, being citizens returning to Sri Lanka after making unsuccessful claims to be refugees in other countries. It is well-established that the Tribunal is obliged to deal with each and every claim made by an applicant for review of a decision refusing to grant a protection visa. Failure to do so amounts to jurisdictional error. As Allsop J (with whom Spender J concurred) said in Htun v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42] : 
 The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the [ Migration ] Act requires the tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of the jurisdiction embarked on.
