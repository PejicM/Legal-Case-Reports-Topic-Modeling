<tocase>Wang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 151 ALR 717</tocase>
<text>7 It is accepted by counsel that there is authority for the proposition that the specified time limit of 28 days can go to the issue of jurisdiction. Reference is made to Wang v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 151 ALR 717 at 721, where Merkel J said that reference to the 28 day time limit in s 478 was not merely directory, but specified an absolute mandatory requirement.

8 Counsel for the applicants seeks to draw a distinction between Wang , which concerned s 478 as it previously stood, and the present case. It is submitted that the 84 day limitation on extension in s 477(2)(a) is not mandatory. Counsel has referred to a number of authorities: Yong Jun Qin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 144 ALR 695; NABM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 294 ; (2002) 70 ALD 64; Rishmawi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 611 ; Wickremsainghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 82 FCR 125 and Hamilton v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 53 FCR 349.</text>

9 In my view, these authorities do not assist the applicants in the present circumstances. In these matters, the instances of non-compliance did not go to jurisdiction and were of a non mandatory and non-essential nature. In Yong Jun Qin, for example, the applicant was allowed to amend an application and name the Minister as respondent in place of the Immigration Review Tribunal. In NABM, the applicant sought and was entitled to seek judicial review, although the application mistakenly referred to s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) rather than s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). In Rishmawi , an application for review of the Tribunal's decision was made in the form of a comprehensive letter. The letter did not strictly comply with the requirements of the Federal Court Rules but gave all the necessary information.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>14 In Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [7] , Gleeson CJ referred to privative clauses as those clauses which deprive, or purport to deprive, courts of jurisdiction to review the acts of public officials or tribunals in order to enforce compliance with the law, or which limit, or purport to limit, such jurisdiction. Section 477 is not a provision which makes a decision final and conclusive such that it may not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed or called into question in any court. It contemplates a challenge and provides a challenge to be made in a timely way. Section 474 , which was the subject of consideration in S157 , attempted to exclude a challenge in clear terms. It is evident that s 477 does not purport to preclude judicial review but imposes a limitation on the time for initiating that review. In these circumstances, I do not consider there is any substance in the submission that s 477 gives rise to a privative clause which is invalid or unconstitutional. In my view, it is appropriate to construe clauses fixing time limits with due regard to the necessity to ensure that courts are able to properly exercise their jurisdiction in a timely manner.

15 Further submissions were made by counsel for the applicants regarding the desirability of having uniform extendable time limits for appeal and review of administrative decisions, as referred to in the Second Reading Speech for the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 presented in March 2005. It is said that the purpose of s 477 is to avoid the potential unfairness of the strict 28 day time limit while ensuring timely handling of the application. In my view, the section does have the effect of extending the time limit and is a provision favourable to an applicant.

16 I do not consider that there is anything incongruous, capricious or unreasonable in the application of s 477 in the circumstances of the present case. Accordingly, I do not accept the submission that the clear language of s 477 can or should be read down on the basis that it produces such results.

17 Accordingly, for the above reasons, I am not persuaded that there has been any error demonstrated in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate and I dismiss this application with costs.
 I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.
