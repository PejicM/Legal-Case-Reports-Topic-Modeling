<text>59 The word 'label' as used in par (a) of the definition of 'accessory' in s 10(1) should be given a meaning distinct from that provided by other paragraphs of the definition, such as the 'written instruction, warranty or other information provided with the article' referred to in par (d): ASIC v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 'Other information' referred to in par (d) would include the descriptions on the navy-blue and silver embroidered internal labels on the articles in Exhibits A to P (including the scarf, where those labels appear on its exterior surface).

<tocase>Burge v Swarbrick [2007] HCA 17 ; (2007) 234 ALR 204</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/17.html</AustLII>
<text>71 In Burge v Swarbrick [2007] HCA 17 ; (2007) 234 ALR 204 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Heydon and Crennan JJ examined in detail the legislative history of the design/copyright overlap provisions of the Act and cognate legislation as they existed immediately prior to the enactment of the current version of Div 8. In 2003 the Designs Act 2003 (Cth) was passed and the former Div 8 of Pt 3 of the Copyright Act was replaced by the current provisions. The current expression of the Parliament's intention is found in the present provisions of the Copyright Act . The definition of 'corresponding design' in s 74(1) of the current Act is substantially different to that examined in Burge [2007] HCA 17 ; 234 ALR 204.

72 The amendments came about following concerns raised in the Australian Law Reform Commission's Report No. 74, Designs : see the revised explanatory memorandum accompanying the Designs ( Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 circulated by the authority of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in the Senate. The revised explanatory memorandum said: 
 
 'The broad policy is that artistic works commercially exploited as three-dimensional designs should generally be denied copyright protection. However, artistic works exploited as two-dimensional designs continue to receive copyright protection (and may have dual protection if registered as a design). The ALRC supported the policy underlying sections 74 to 77 and the level of protection but recommended amendments to give more clarity and legal certainty. 
 
 The amendments are to: 
 
 
 
 &#8226; clarify the meaning of the term "work of artistic craftsmanship"; 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#8226; amend the definition of "corresponding design" to deal with certain technical difficulties ...'

73 The revised explanatory memorandum also said that one purpose of the proposed amendment to the definition of 'corresponding design' was to remove the anomalous protection afforded to utilitarian three-dimensional articles such as pump parts. Those were not registrable as designs because they constituted a method or principle of construction, but the drawings for those pump parts were entitled to copyright protection. Another purpose of the amendments was to focus on the three-dimensional aspects of a design (see par 11 of the revised explanatory memorandum). The revised explanatory memorandum explained the reason for adding a new definition of 'embodied in' in s 74(2) was to address the previous exclusion of a design consisting solely of features of two-dimensional pattern or ornamentation applicable to the surface of an article (see par 13). It went on to say that the amendments to s 74 were intended to clarify that visual features could be embodied in a product by being woven into, impressed on or worked into the product. The revised explanatory memorandum continued (pars 15, 16):
 
 '... That is, a "corresponding design" can include artistic works exploited in products such as tapestries, knitted items and carpets. ... For example, artistic works will not have copyright protection (when used as a design) if a corresponding design is not registered but is industrially applied unless they are works of artistic craftsmanship, buildings or models of buildings. 
 
 Under the amended definition, artistic works exploited in two dimensions as visual features of pattern or ornamentation will remain excluded from the definition of "corresponding design" and therefore retain copyright protection'.</text>

<tocase>Cow ( PB) &amp; Co Ltd v Cannon Rubber Manufactures Ltd [1959] RPC 240</tocase>
<text>80 Polo/Lauren argued that, in essence, the embroidery of the polo player logo was part of a pattern or ornamentation on the surface of the garments. It contended that the embroidery was not an essential feature or characteristic of the appearance of the garments amounting to a visual feature of shape or configuration in the sense explained in cases such as Cow ( PB) &amp; Co Ltd v Cannon Rubber Manufactures Ltd [1959] RPC 240 at 244 per Lloyd-Jacob J. There, Lloyd-Jacob J said that a design of a hot-water bottle which had a ribbed appearance had to be '... considered on the footing that the particular ribbed appearance which it provides in articles to which it is applied is a characteristic feature of it'. In contrast, Polo/Lauren suggested that the subtlety of the embroidery as used on the various garments retained the essential two-dimensional character of the visual appearance of the polo player logo, so that it was to be regarded as a part of a pattern or ornamentation of the garment, and thus outside the definition of 'corresponding design'.

81 Embroidery, of its nature, affects the shape of the fabric on to which the stitching is applied. On each of the 15 exhibits (A to P) it is immediately apparent that the polo player logo is embroidered, not printed, and that the fabric surrounding the embroidery is subtly, but noticeably, differently woven to the distinct area embroidered.

82 One picture in the polo knit shirt catalogue showed six differently coloured polo knit shirts. They were in a pile folded one top of the other. Each polo knit shirt had an embroidered, but differently coloured, polo player logo visible on it. The embroidery is noticeably raised above the surface of the rest of each of those garments as depicted in the picture. The catalogue had stated:
 
 'For Ralph/Lauren, there was no better way to celebrate the spirit of the original Polo and the heritage of this gentlemen's sport than with the signature Polo Player logo fashioned any time from no less than 784 stitches.'</text>

<tocase>Interstate Parcel Express Co Pty Ltd v Time-Life International (Nederlands) BV [1977] HCA 52 ; (1977) 138 CLR 534</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/52.html</AustLII>
<text>5 Each of the articles imported by Ziliani was genuine, rather than counterfeit. It had been manufactured in the country of manufacture with the licence of the owner of the copyright in the polo player logo and then was lawfully imported into or displayed for sale in the United States of America where it was sold to Ziliani Holdings. The question here is whether the sales to and purchases by Ziliani Holdings in the United States of America entitled it to engage in 'parallel importing' of those goods into Australia: ie importing them without the licence of Polo/Lauren as the Australian licensee of the polo player logo. It is common ground that in the absence of a licence from Polo/Lauren and a defence under the Act, Ziliani would infringe any copyright in the polo player logo by importing the goods here or then trading with them: Interstate Parcel Express Co Pty Ltd v Time-Life International (Nederlands) BV [1977] HCA 52 ; (1977) 138 CLR 534.

6 Polo/Lauren claimed that Ziliani has infringed its copyright in the polo player logo here on two bases when it appeared embroidered on an article.

7 First, Polo/Lauren argued that Ziliani, from the time of their first act of importation, infringed its copyright in breach of s 37 of the Copyright Act by importing into Australia without Polo/Lauren's licence or consent each article of clothing on which the polo player logo was embroidered for the purpose of selling it by retail. Alternatively, it argued that, at least since the time Polo/Lauren or its predecessor made known to Ziliani its claim of infringement of its copyright in June 2006, Ziliani continued their importations and display for sale with knowledge of the breach of copyright. Ziliani accepted that if their defences failed they were liable on that latter basis.</text>

<tocase>R &amp; A Bailey &amp; Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 701</tocase>
<text>52 The 1998 amendment of the Act to provide an exception in s 44C so that a label in which copyright subsisted would not be able to control the use of the goods to which the label was attached was prompted by the decision of Young J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in R &amp; A Bailey &amp; Co Ltd v Boccaccio Pty Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 701; 77 ALR 177. There, a manufacturer produced a liqueur known as 'Baileys Original Irish Cream' in the Republic of Ireland and sold it to various distributors around the world. The Australian distributor did not sell the liqueur to the defendant, which had imported its supplies of the liqueur from Baileys' Dutch distributor. The manufacturer and Australian distributor sought to restrain the importer from further importations and sales in Australia. Young J found that the label was exempt from registration under the then provisions of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) ( Bailey 4 NSWLR at 711C). He also held that there was no infringement of Baileys' trade mark by the importation. There was no dispute that the sticker forming the label on the bottles of the liqueur imported via the Dutch distributor contained an artistic work, being a painting depicting a country scene, the copyright of which was vested in Baileys or its Australian distributor. There was no express licence by the copyright holder for the use by the importer of the artistic work depicted on the labels appearing on the bottles imported from Holland. Young J found that the importation into, and sale of the Dutch bottles in, Australia was a breach of the copyright in the labels. Thus, only because the plaintiffs controlled the copyright in the painting on the label, they could restrain the importation and sale of the liqueur in the bottles on which the label appeared.

53 Young J's decision led to recommendations for the reform of the law by the Copyright Law Review Committee. The Importation Provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (AGPS, Canberra, 1988) reported at p 224 [181]:
 
 
 '181. The Committee is strongly of opinion that distributors of goods should not be able to control the market for their products by resorting to the subterfuge of devising a label or a package in which copyright will subsist . The purpose of copyright is to protect articles which are truly copyright articles such as books, sound recordings or films. This purpose is achieved by conferring on authors of works and makers of subject matter a bundle of exclusive rights entitling them to restrain conduct antipathetical to their incorporeal property and to sue for damages where such conduct has already been committed. If the simple expedient of affixing or attaching a label in which copyright subsists to any goods at all entitles the owner of the goods to exclude others from marketing similar goods, the sooner the practice is stopped the better it will be. However imaginatively labelled or packaged a bottle of liquor may be, the product is liquor . The same may be said of cigarettes, perfume and cosmetics.' 
 
 
 (Emphasis added.)

54 The committee noted that abuses could be remedied by resort to causes of action for passing-off, breaches of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act or for infringement of the trade mark. In the present case, the product or article is the garment. In this regard, Polo/Lauren could not seek to prevent the garment being imported into Australia under the Copyright Act if the polo player logo were not embroidered onto its external surface.

55 In 1997 the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 (Cth) was introduced to amend the Act. It provided in the proposed s 44C for a new exception of a non-infringing accessory. The Attorney-General circulated an explanatory memorandum for these amendments. It recorded in its introduction that the Bill was proposed to amend the law to prevent the owner of copyright in packaging and labelling of goods, not themselves protected by copyright, from using that copyright to stop anyone from importing the goods (see p 3 of the explanatory memorandum for the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 , introduced into the House of Representatives on 18 June 1997).

56 The explanatory memorandum, when dealing with the amendments relating to labelling and packaging of imported goods, referred to the 1988 report of the Copyright Law Review Committee. It noted that the practice of controlling importation of goods through copyright in the artistic and/or literary works on the packaging or label was believed (in 1997) to have been quite widespread in industries such as the liquor and toy industries and continued: 
 
 '... [o]ther industries such as footwear and sunglasses also have reported incidences of this practice. Removal of the ability to use copyright in this way would eliminate one of the means by which exclusive market access is able to be provided to certain distributors of such goods and would implement a recommendation of the Copyright Law Review Committee.' 
 

After reviewing a range of options, the explanatory memorandum commented upon the proposed clauses of the bill (at [119]-[122]). Then having referred to the decision in Bailey 4 NSWLR 701, it said (at [122]):
 
 
 ' In essence the amendments will allow the importation of goods with copyright packaging or labelling without the permission of the copyright owner, if the owner of the copyright had agreed to the use of the copyright material with the goods. The amendments will not, however, affect the operation of the law governing trade marks, insofar as the packaging or labelling includes a trade mark. '

57 A non-infringing accessory, as defined in s 10(1), such as a label placed on an article in the country of manufacture with the consent of the person entitled to the copyright in that label or accessory, is removed from any exclusive right in the artistic work which, but for s 44C, would otherwise be conferred by the Act on the owner of the copyright. Thus s 44C(1) of the Act removes from the scope of the exclusive right protected by s 37(1), copyright in a work which falls within the meaning of a non-infringing accessory in s 10(1). And s 44C(2) modifies the operation of the exclusive right in s 38(1) in a similar way. The two exceptions in s 44C require relevantly that first, the artistic work (here, the polo player logo) must have been used in the country of manufacture with the licence of the person entitled there to the copyright by embroidering or weaving it onto an article (here, a garment) and, secondly, it be an accessory (as defined: here, a label) to the article which is imported into Australia.

58 The definition of an 'accessory' in s 10(1) recognises a distinction between the article as a functional item of commerce, and a subsidiary constituent part of the article such as a label embroidered on to it. The embroidered component is functionally accessorial to the article's use. The function which an accessory, as described in pars (a) (d) of the definition of 'accessory' in s 10(1), performs is incidental to the use of the article as an item of commerce. The article can be used for its intended purpose regardless of whether the s 10 'accessory' is present on it or as part of it. The Parliament intended that a non-infringing accessory, as defined in s 10(1), could be embroidered into an article even though, had the non-infringing accessory been sold by itself without the article, the owner of copyright in it would have been entitled to protection in Australia under the Copyright Act .

59 The word 'label' as used in par (a) of the definition of 'accessory' in s 10(1) should be given a meaning distinct from that provided by other paragraphs of the definition, such as the 'written instruction, warranty or other information provided with the article' referred to in par (d): ASIC v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 'Other information' referred to in par (d) would include the descriptions on the navy-blue and silver embroidered internal labels on the articles in Exhibits A to P (including the scarf, where those labels appear on its exterior surface). Likewise par (c) of that definition would catch the use of the copyright in the painting the subject of the decision in Bailey 4 NSWLR 701.

62 I am of opinion that the 1998 amendments to the Copyright Act were designed to prevent this inappropriate use of copyright. The Parliament had been informed, when making those amendments, that other industries including the footwear and sunglasses industries had developed similar practices to those in Bailey 4 NSWLR 701. The polo player logo, used in the way it is in the 15 exhibits, is affixed to or displayed on or incorporated into the surface of the accompanying article, within the meaning of par (a) of the definition of 'accessory' in s 10(1) of the Act. The polo player logo conveys to anyone who looks at the garment a message of its provenance: ie, it is a product of the Ralph Lauren design or fashion house or 'label'. The definitions of 'accessory' in s 10(1) recognise that such a use can take a variety of forms but is not confined simply to external packaging or internal marking. The polo player logo embroidered on an article of clothing is the 'label' of the design or fashion house, Ralph Lauren, on it. The embroidered polo player logo conveys at once that the article is authentic and is the 'label' of a Ralph Lauren garment. In this practical manner it 'labels' the garment as a product of that design or fashion house.

63 The embroidered polo player logo is not primarily a decorative feature, although it can be attractive to the eye in some of its manifestations. The polo player logo will usually remain covered by the wearer's outer clothing when it appears on the hem of an item of underwear, such as in Ex O. This may not always be the case, but this positioning of the polo player logo suggests that, at least on such a garment, its function is primarily to signify the manufacturer's identity, ie to act as a label.

64 The embroidered polo player logo on an article of clothing acts as a symbol to convey that the clothing was made by the Ralph Lauren design or fashion house. It is a 'signature' or label conveying that information of the garment's provenance. The purpose of s 44C was to prevent such a symbol being used to deny the article its ordinary use as clothing simply because the polo player logo is copyright. The owner of the trade mark and the person entitled to the goodwill of, or associated with, the polo player logo is adequately protected by the rights given under both under the Trade Marks Act and by the tort of passing off from wrongful exploitation by another person of that trade mark or symbol associating the goods with the provenance of the fashion or design house of Ralph Lauren.</text>

<tocase>Wrangler Apparel Corp v Classic Boots Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 19</tocase>
<text>75 Polo/Lauren argued that the visual features of the polo player logo cannot be described as features of 'shape or configuration' within the meaning of s 74. It argued that the polo player logo is basically two-dimensional and has an aesthetic, and not a functional, or utilitarian, purpose. Polo/Lauren contended that the polo player logo should properly be regarded as possessing features of pattern or ornamentation, referring to what Lehane J had said in Wrangler Apparel Corp v Classic Boots Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 19 at 25.

76 However, there his Honour made an obiter observation that 'W' shaped stitching on jeans was capable of being (but did not have to be) regarded as a feature of pattern or ornamentation, within the meaning of the definition in s 4 of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) . Equally, here, there is no dispute about the capacity of the polo player logo to fall within one or other of the characterisations 'shape or configuration' or 'feature of pattern or ornamentation'. The real issue is which is the proper characterisation.</text>
