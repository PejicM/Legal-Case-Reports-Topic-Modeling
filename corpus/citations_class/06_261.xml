<text>35 Clorox contended that the respondents' expert witnesses' evidence was inadmissible, at least to the extent that their opinions went to the construction of the claims. It was argued that in the absence of technical or scientific words or expressions requiring expert explanation, which was said not to be the case here, the task of construction of the claims was for the Court and, as such, this evidence was irrelevant and consequently inadmissible. See, for instance, the recent judgment in Breville Pty Ltd v The Warehouse Group (Australia) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1893 at [34] - [36] . Clorox also submitted that certain portions of the respondents' affidavit evidence were inadmissible, again on grounds of irrelevance, as it was not for a witness to rewrite or redraft the Patent. I should note that Clorox made further submissions in respect of the admissibility of the respondents' evidence in the context of infringement and I will consider those objections when addressing infringement.

36 The respondents submitted that the evidence to which Clorox raised an objection was admissible on the basis that it responded to the evidence of Clorox's own expert witness; was of assistance to the Court in construing the relevant claims of the Patent; and that the weight to be given to such evidence was a matter for submissions.</text>

20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142. Thus, the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning that the hypothetical addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor at 391; Photocure at [170].

25 A feature of a claim is considered essential if the hypothetical reader (that is, a reader skilled in the art before the priority date) would have understood from the language used in the claim, in the context of the specification as a whole, that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention: Catnic at 243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Populin at 476; Beltreco at [81].

55 Mr Hess for Clorox submitted that the use of the word, 'straight' in this context referred to the visual approximation of straight. While Mr Caine submitted on behalf of the respondents that 'straight' was used in its geometric sense, he accepted that the term would encompass joinder involving a slight degree of curvature. In this sense, Mr Caine seemed to be accepting and adopting a purposive construction similar to that applied by Lord Diplock in Catnic in relation to the term 'vertical'. On one level at least the dispute seemed to be about just how much deviation from geometric precision was consistent with the description, 'straight'. This aspect of the debate seems to be what is behind the characterisation of the straight sides requirement as an intermediate term; see [26]-[28] above.

56 As noted above, the Patent is addressed to the hypothetical non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. A patent is a public instrument designed to disclose the invention. As such, the term should be given a construction that is consistent with this role. The relevant claims require that the front and rear panels be joined along three straight sides. The claims do not require that these panels be joined along lines that appear to be straight or that the join is displayed as straight. In my view, in this context 'straight' must be construed to require that the joins, when the nominal bag is in the laid-flat form, are straight in the geometric sense but not so as to restrict the term to absolute or perfect geometric precision. It might, in my view, extend to encompass joinder along sides that display a slight or modest curvature. Ultimately, however, it is not necessary for me to be more precise on this point as, for reasons explained below, I have formed the view that the sides of the Hercules Bag are distinctly curved and do not fall within any possible meaning of straight as used in the Patent specification.

57 Section 13 of the Act relevantly provides that a patentee has the exclusive rights, during the term of the patent, to exploit the invention and to authorise another person to exploit the invention. The term 'exploit' is relevantly defined in Schedule 1 of the Act as follows:
 
 ' exploit , in relation to an invention, includes: 
 
 (a) where the invention is a product--make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of the product, offer to make, sell, hire or otherwise dispose of it, use or import it, or keep it for the purpose of doing any of those things; or 
 (b) ...'</text>

<tocase>D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385</tocase>
<text>15 The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]:
 
 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.'

16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75].

17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74].

18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67].

<tocase>EI Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemical Industries plc (2002) 54 IPR 304</tocase>
<text>38 As such, a court can have regard to evidence from experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see [21] above and EI Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co v Imperial Chemical Industries plc (2002) 54 IPR 304 at [41]-[60]. This is not to say that the court is thereby relinquishing its role as the ultimate arbitrator of the proper construction of the claims. The weight that a court gives to such evidence will vary from case to case.

39 In the present proceedings, the terms used in the relevant claims are unusual given the characteristics of plastic bags: see [32] [33] above. The use of particular terms, especially 'straight', must be understood by reference to what the hypothetical addressee would consider the terms to mean. Consequently, in my view the evidence adduced by the respondents provides evidence of the meaning that the notional addressee would ascribe to such terms and the evidence is admissible as relevant to the construction of the claims.

40 Counsel for Clorox accepted that in order to consider infringement a bag must be considered in the laid-flat form but contended that this could encompass a laid-flat three-dimensional form. In my view the concession as to the laid-flat form was correctly made. The language of the relevant claims, as set out above, is ambiguous when considered in isolation. The terms chosen by the patentee to describe the monopoly cannot be properly understood without reference to the specification as a whole. In particular, unless the bags are arranged in a laid-flat form, it is not sensible to refer to the front and rear panels of the bag or to the sides of the bag (whether straight or otherwise) or even to discuss the shape of the fourth side of the bag. To consider the bags in any other form or arrangement would be to deprive the essential integers of the invention of any content. While, as previously mentioned, a clear and unambiguous claim must not be varied or qualified by statements in the remainder of the specification, in the present context the language chosen is difficult to comprehend without reference to the description of the invention contained in the body of the specification. Thus, in my opinion the relevant claims each import a requirement that the language used is to be understood in light of the invention being in the laid-flat form. This does no more than give effect to the language chosen by the patentee and does not expand or narrow the relevant claims.</text>

If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74].

19 As a general rule, the terms used in a specification should be accorded their ordinary English meaning. Put another way, the terms must be understood in a practical, commonsense manner: Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Elconnex Pty Ltd v Gerard Industries Pty Ltd (1991) 32 FCR 491 at 512-513; Interlego at 478; Minnesota Mining at 270; Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56 at 95; Martin Engineering Co v Trison Holdings Pty Ltd (1989) 14 IPR 330 at 338.

22 Ultimately, however, the construction of the specification is for the court, not for the expert witness. Insofar as a view expressed by an expert depends upon a reading of the patent, it cannot carry the day unless the court reads the patent in the same way: Allsop Inc v Bintang Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 686, 697. See also Glaverbel SA v British Coal Corp [1994] RPC 443 at 486; Sartas at 485-486; Patent Gesellschaft at 455. Further, if the evidence before the court does not establish that a technical meaning is to be given to a term, it is to be given its ordinary meaning: Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 226; Minnesota Mining at 279; Patent Gesellschaft at 455; Photocure at [170].</text>

<tocase>Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331</tocase>
<text>14 The parties are not in dispute as to the applicable principles which have been the subject of frequent discussion in the decisions of this Court: see, for instance, Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 (' Beltreco '); PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 64 IPR 314 (' Photocure '); Sachtler GMBH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 (' Sachtler '). While it may be useful for me to set out some of the relevant principles I shall do so only briefly.

15 The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]:
 
 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.'

16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75].

17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74].

18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67]. It is inappropriate, however, to approach construction of the specification with a view to being 'fair' to the patentee; Kirin-Amgen at [33]; Sachtler at [60]. The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised: Beltreco at [70]. Indeed, the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that 'is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding': Martin at 59. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited: British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell &amp; Sons Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 631 at 650-651. The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims: Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc [1895] 24 RPC 705 at 720.

20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142.

25 A feature of a claim is considered essential if the hypothetical reader (that is, a reader skilled in the art before the priority date) would have understood from the language used in the claim, in the context of the specification as a whole, that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention: Catnic at 243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Populin at 476; Beltreco at [81].</text>

29 I also respectfully agree with Bennett J's assessment of the assistance provided by the questions in Improver , which Mr Hess referred to in his submissions. In particular her Honour said at [67]:
 
 '...I do not consider that utilisation of those questions is helpful other than, perhaps, as a "check" on the conclusion reached as to the characterisation of essential or inessential integers present in the allegedly infringing article. They are no substitute for construction of the claim to ascertain the essential and inessential integers and a determination regarding the presence of those integers for infringement.'

30 While the shape of the fourth side might accurately be described as the novel feature of the invention claimed, the patentee has chosen by the language of the claims to make the requirement that the front and rear panels be joined along straight sides an essential feature.

31 In my view, these two issues, both of which involve construction of the claims and the specification as a whole, are necessarily connected. Mr Caine's threshold question about the form in which the refuse bag of the invention is to be arranged in order to understand its features, cannot be addressed properly without considering the context in which there is a requirement that the panels be joined along three straight sides. Similarly, the meaning of 'along three straight sides' cannot be determined without reference to the appropriate arrangement.</text>

37 In my view, the evidence objected to by Clorox is admissible as relevant in the present proceedings in relation to the proper construction of the Patent's claims. While terms used in a claim are to be given their ordinary English meaning, the hypothetical addressee is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: see [20] above. This is made plain by Lord Hoffman in Kirin-Amgen at [32] where his Lordship stated:
 
 'Construction, whether of a patent or any other document, is of course not directly concerned with what the author meant to say. There is no window into the mind of the patentee or the author of any other document. Construction is objective in the sense that it is concerned with what a reasonable person to whom the utterance was addressed would have understood the author to be using the words to mean. Notice, however, that it is not, as is sometimes said, "the meaning of the words the author used", but rather what the notional addressee would have understood the author to mean by using those words. The meaning of words is a matter of convention, governed by rules, which can be found in dictionaries and grammars. What the author would have been understood to mean by using those words is not simply a matter of rules. It is highly sensitive to the context of, and background to, the particular utterance . It depends not only upon the words the author has chosen but also upon the identity of the audience he is taken to have been addressing and the knowledge and assumptions which one attributes to that audience.

<tocase>Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519</tocase>
<text>15 The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]:
 
 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.'</text>

<tocase>Pinefair Pty Ltd v Bedford Industries Rehabilitation Association Inc (1998) 42 IPR 330</tocase>
<text>59 The Hercules Bag is manufactured, like other such bags (as detailed in the specification of the Patent), from an extruded tube of plastic. Initially therefore, there is no bag, merely a plastic tube. For this reason, Clorox did not claim that this was a case where infringement occurred during the manufacturing process: see, for instance, Pinefair Pty Ltd v Bedford Industries Rehabilitation Association Inc (1998) 42 IPR 330. After the plastic is blown through the extruder, the resulting tube is flattened. The longitudinal sides are 'gusseted', by effectively folding the longitudinal sides towards each other, so that they meet in the centre of the inside of the tube. This 'four-layered form' is then folded in half again resulting in an eight-layered form; that is one-quarter the size of the flattened extruded plastic tube. The tube's base (the third side) is then heat welded forming a 'star-shaped' weld. This feature marks, in essence, the practical difference between the plastic bag described in the Patent's specification and the Hercules Bag.

60 The gusseting of the longitudinal sides and the star-shaped welding of the base have both advantages and disadvantages in comparison to the bag described in the specification. For instance, the Hercules Bag has less capacity and uses more plastic material because of the way in which the base is welded. However, an advantage is that the Hercules Bag is able to be sold in packaging that is narrower than would otherwise be the case. This was said by Mr Caine to be attractive to retailers as the package fits in a supermarket basket and occupies less shelf space. It is also the case that the base weld is stronger and the Hercules Bag has greater tear strength. Dr Pullum also gave evidence that fewer manufacturing difficulties arose when cutting and/or serrating across a narrower portion of plastic. In other words, to cut or serrate across a portion one-eighth the width of the tube is less likely to involve manufacturing difficulties than performing the same action across the entire width of the extruded tube. Dr Pullum also stated that the Hercules Bag could be manufactured in multiple streams.

61 It is also important to note that the Hercules Bag is in an eight-layered form when sold. Consequently, in order to be used in the manner envisaged, the bag must; first, be torn from the other bags to which it is attached along the base and top sides; and secondly, 'opened' up such that refuse or garbage can be placed in the bag through the open top side. This latter action will necessarily mean that, except for the base weld, the bag will no longer be in an eight-layered form.</text>

While it may be useful for me to set out some of the relevant principles I shall do so only briefly.

18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67]. It is inappropriate, however, to approach construction of the specification with a view to being 'fair' to the patentee; Kirin-Amgen at [33]; Sachtler at [60]. The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised: Beltreco at [70]. Indeed, the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that 'is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding': Martin at 59. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited: British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell &amp; Sons Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 631 at 650-651. The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims: Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc [1895] 24 RPC 705 at 720.

28 I do not accept the applicant's attempt to introduce the concept of an 'intermediate' feature. Either the feature is necessary for an article to infringe the Patent or it is not. Mr Hess' submissions qualifying his concession go to the proper construction of the relevant claims (and in particular the meaning of 'straight' in this context) rather than to whether this requirement is essential. The construction of the requirement found in the specifications that these sides be 'straight' is a separate question and is discussed below. In my view the requirement that the front and rear panels be joined along three straight sides is an essential integer of the relevant claims and the Hercules Bag must possess this element in order for infringement to be demonstrated. On this issue I respectfully agree with Bennett J in Sachtler at [55] where her Honour said:
 
 'To the extent that recent judgments of this court have suggested that there may be infringement by taking what is determined to be the substantial idea disclosed by the specification but not the essential integers of the claim, I must respectfully disagree.'</text>

<text>16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75].

17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74].

20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142. Thus, the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning that the hypothetical addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor at 391; Photocure at [170].</text>
