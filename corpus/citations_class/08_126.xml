<tocase>Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 507</tocase>
<text>1 These reasons arise from an application by the applicants ("Brother") for an order for costs on an indemnity basis, having been substantially successful in proceedings against the respondent ("Dynamic Supplies") concerning infringement of trade marks and other matters: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 507. The application for indemnity costs relies not only on Dynamic Supplies' rejection of several offers of compromise made by Brother before the hearing but also on the manner in which the litigation was conducted by Dynamic Supplies.

2 Three offers of compromise were made by Brother to Dynamic Supplies before the hearing on trade mark infringement. The first and second offers were in virtually identical terms, so it is convenient and sufficient for the purposes of O 23 r 11(4) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) simply to look at the first and third offers, which are substantially different, and compare them with the relief ultimately granted in the orders of the Court. O 23 r 11(4) provides that if an offer is made by an applicant and not accepted by a respondent, and the applicant obtains a judgment on the claim to which the offer relates which is not less favourable than the terms of the offer, then, unless the Court otherwise orders, the applicant is entitled to an order against the respondent for costs incurred in respect of the claim up to the day when the offer was made taxed on a party-party basis and after that day taxed on an indemnity basis. The objective of this provision is clearly to encourage settlement of litigation.

3 When considering the application of the above provision, the task of the Court is to consider the relevant offer of compromise, compare it with the orders actually made by the Court and determine whether the offer made is less favourable to the offeree than the final relief in the proceeding. If it is, then indemnity costs will not be awarded, subject to the discretion of the Court.</text>

<text>4 Under s 43(2) of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth), the Court has a discretion as to costs orders. As a general principle, costs are awarded on a party-party basis unless there are special or unusual circumstances. Some of the broad classes of circumstances in which the exercise of discretion to award indemnity costs may be appropriate are set out in the judgment of Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 233-234. These include the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions, an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise and the making of allegations which ought never to have been made. Another relevant consideration for the award of indemnity costs is where the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he or she had no chance of success: see Fountain Selected Meals (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401.</text>

<text>5 The authorities establish that, where an applicant's offer of compromise is not accepted by the respondent and the applicant subsequently obtains a more favourable result from the Court, an order for payment for costs on an indemnity basis does not automatically follow: see Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Limited [2003] FCAFC 1 at [7] . Where the requirements of O 23 r 11(4) are satisfied, the entitlement to an order for costs on an indemnity basis in respect of costs incurred after the date of the offer is subject to the discretion of the Court. When considering the exercise of this discretion, it is necessary to take into account whether it was imprudent or unreasonable to expect the offeree to accept the offer of compromise, having regard to the context and circumstances in which it was given: see Seven Network Ltd News Ltd [2007] FCA 1489 at [39] .</text>
