<tocase>Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/210.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The notice of appeal filed on 2 May 2008 contains four grounds of appeal. As was the case in the court below, the grounds of appeal do not appear to relate to the Tribunal's decision. The grounds are cast in very general terms and lack particulars. Moreover, apart from the first ground, they fail to identify any error in the judgment of his Honour below which is properly the subject of the appeal. Instead, they invite this Court to re-consider the reasons of the Tribunal: Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210 at [10] .

14 The Minister filed written submissions dealing with each of the grounds of appeal in the terms set out in [15] [20] below.

15 The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour erred in failing to find that the Tribunal erred when it 'wrongly applied the law to the facts as found in relation to the seriousness of harm that constitutes persecution as a member of a particular social group or religious persecution'. As his Honour noted, this allegation appeared to relate to another case, as the appellant did not make claims to fear persecution on the basis of his religion or membership of a particular social group. Further, the Tribunal did not make any findings as to the seriousness of the harm the appellant claimed to fear, because it could not be satisfied, on the limited evidence before it that the claimed harm had in fact occurred. The Minister submitted that it was for the appellant to make out his case to the Tribunal, but he failed to do so.

16 The second ground of appeal appears to raise three complaints. First, the appellant claims that the Tribunal failed to provide 'more opportunity to respond'. The appellants did not appear at the scheduled Tribunal hearing on 17 August 2007 and did not request that the hearing be adjourned or re-scheduled. In any event, the Tribunal complied with the statutory requirements and was entitled to determine the matter pursuant to s 426A of the Act.

17 The second ground of appeal also alleges that the Tribunal generalised the appellant's claims and failed to carry out the 'real chance' test. The essential basis of the Tribunal's decision was the inability of the Tribunal to reach the state of satisfaction to grant the appellant a protection visa as required by s 36(2) and s 65(1) of the Act. The Minister submitted that the Tribunal clearly set out and considered the claims advanced by the appellant and ultimately rejected them because it was unable to reach the requisite state of satisfaction required by the Act.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>18 The second ground could also be seen as an allegation that the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of s 424A of the Act. As was the case before his Honour below, the Minister submitted that the appellant has failed to identify any 'information' for the purposes of s 424A. The reason for the Tribunal's decision was simply the general nature of the appellant's claims and lack of details identifying that the appellant had suffered any harassment, persecution or harm for a Convention related reason. Such matters are thought processes and not within the scope of s 424A(l): SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ; SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78 at [23] per Bennett J and cases there cited.</text>
