<tocase>Oceanic Life Ltd v Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1999] NSWCA 416 ; (1999) 168 ALR 211</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/1999/416.html</AustLII>
<text>38 No criminal proceeding has been commenced against either applicant arising out of Operation Wickenby. It was, therefore, necessary for an "investigation relating to a criminal matter" to be underway before a valid request for assistance of the Swiss authorities could be made under s 14 of the Mutual Assistance Act. The word "investigation" is not defined in the Act. Section 3 does, however, define a "criminal investigation" to mean "an investigation into an offence (whether the offence is believed to have been committed, to be being committed or to be likely to be committed)." The use of the phrase "investigation relating to a criminal matter" in s 14(1) comprehends a wider range of activities than those falling within the defined concept of a "criminal investigation". An investigation "relating to" a criminal matter has the potential to apply to a far broader range of activities: cf Oceanic Life Ltd v Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1999] NSWCA 416 ; (1999) 168 ALR 211 at 224-225 and the cases there referred to. It is not necessary, for present purposes, to determine the extent of the differences. This is because the evidence clearly establishes that the mutual assistance request was made to assist in the conduct of a criminal investigation known as Operation Wickenby. The evidence was given by Mr Outram, the ACC Executive Director, Operational Strategies. He deposed (and I accept) that Operation Wickenby began as a result of information contained in documentary material obtained after the execution of a search warrant in February 2004 on a hotel room occupied by Mr Phillip Egglishaw. That material suggested that a significant number of Australians had committed criminal offences involving taxation fraud. From July 2004 the ACC and the Australian Taxation Office ("the ATO") examined the material to determine which matters should be the subject of criminal investigation by the ACC and which matters should be the subject of civil investigation by the ATO. The ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the ACC was known as "Operation Wickenby". The civil investigations conducted by the ATO did not form part of Operation Wickenby. Operation Wickenby was conducted by the ACC pursuant to the Australia Crime Commission Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) Determination 2003. It involved the investigation of whether certain individuals had committed offences against Commonwealth criminal laws. Operation Wickenby is to be distinguished from Project Wickenby which was the title assigned to the separate investigations being overseen by the ATO.

39 Even if it be assumed that Article 1 of the Treaty imposes a positive obligation on Requesting States to identify with precision the offences to which the relevant investigation relates, there is no substance in the applicants' complaint that the request did not allege the commission of particular offences against Australian law. The request did contain references to a number of offences against Australian criminal law which it was alleged Mr Dunn had committed. The Treaty does not require the Requesting State to provide evidence that particular offences against its laws have been committed. As already noted, all that is required is that there be in existence a bona fide investigation which is designed to determine whether or not such offences have been committed.

40 The power to make an application for assistance which is conferred by s 14 of the Mutual Assistance Act is conditioned on there being "reasonable grounds to believe that a thing relevant to the ... investigation may be located in a foreign country." The request for mutual assistance which was sent to the Swiss authorities under cover of Ms Gibbins' 17 March 2005 letter, contained a good deal of information which suggested that material relevant to the investigation might be found in Switzerland. This information was largely derived from documents found on the personal computer of Mr Phillip Egglishaw and from responses by him to questions asked during a hearing conducted by the ACC. Strachans SA was based in Geneva. Mr Egglishaw was one of the principals of Strachans SA. He resides in Geneva. The Swiss Central Office was advised that "Australian authorities are investigating a number of Australian residents for using companies, trusts and bank accounts administered by Strachans S.A., an accounting services firm in Switzerland, to disguise their involvement in tax fraud schemes and money laundering" (paragraph 7). The Swiss authorities were also advised that the ACC believed that services provided by Strachans SA enabled Australian residents to obtain access to their funds "from anywhere in the world by the use of debit or credit cards linked to bank accounts opened and operated for them by Strachans outside Australia, including at Corner Banca, SA in Lugarno, Switzerland" (paragraph 9(c)).</text>

<tocase>George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/26.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The phrase "reasonable grounds to believe" (or variants of it) has a well understood and well settled meaning. In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 the High Court said that:
 
 "When a statute prescribes that there must be "reasonable grounds" for a state of mind including suspicion and belief it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person." 

Later in its joint judgment the Court continued (at 116):
 
 "The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture."</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273</tocase>
<text>47 There are, in addition, other obstacles in the path of the applicants' argument. The first is that the Treaty does not form part of Australian domestic law and, therefore, save in an immaterial respect, does not impose binding obligations on the Attorney-General: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 286-7, 304 and 315.</text>

<tocase>Bollag v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 79 FCR 198</tocase>
<text>48 Relevantly, s 7(2) of the Mutual Assistance Act provides that regulations may provide that the Act applies to a foreign country subject to any mutual assistance Treaty between that country and Australia. By s 7(3) of the Act it is provided that, if regulations have been made in accordance with s 7(2), then "this Act applies subject to the limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that are necessary to give effect to the treaty in relation to that country." Regulation 4(1) of the Regulations provides that the Act applies to Switzerland "subject to such limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications as are necessary to give effect to the Treaty...." These provisions do not have the effect of incorporating the Treaty into Australian domestic law: see Bollag v Attorney-General (Cth) (1997) 79 FCR 198 at 214-6. As the respondents submit, in the absence of inconsistency between the Mutual Assistance Act and the Treaty, the Act applies and the Treaty does not.</text>

<text>52 It may also be the case, as the respondents argued, that the fact that scope exists for the Requested State to seek elaboration of a request for assistance before making a decision as to whether or not comply, renders the request immune from successful attack unless it be established that the pleaded omissions had occurred by reason of fraud or bad faith: cf Lego Australia Pty Ltd v Paraggio [1994] FCA 1286 ; (1994) 52 FCR 542 at 555-556; Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority (1997) 148 ALR 393 at 400.

<tocase>Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1987) 7 NSWLR 588</tocase>
<text>61 Although s 6(1)(n) of the DPP Act , in terms, identifies a 'function' of the DPP, it has been construed as being an empowering provision. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1987) 7 NSWLR 588 the NSW Court of Appeal held that s 6(1)(n) of the DPP Act conferred a special power on the DPP: see at 597. A similar approach to the construction of s 6(1)(n) of the DPP Act was adopted by a Full Court of this Court in Health Insurance Commission v Freeman (1998) 88 FCR 544 (" Freeman "). Whilst rejecting the notion that s 6(1)(n) empowered the DPP to give legal advice on request to Commonwealth authorities merely because they happened to be investigating the commission of offences under Commonwealth law, it held that such advice might be given in certain circumstances. Merkel J (with whom von Doussa and Carr JJ agreed) held (at 564-5) that:
 
 "... in any particular case, the function to which the legal advice is incidental or conducive must be identified. Contrary to the view held within the DPP's office, the DPP is not empowered under the DPP Act to give legal advice, if and when sought, to any Commonwealth authority merely because it is investigating the possible commission of offences under Commonwealth law. Before the precondition in s 6(1)(n) is met there must be some nexus between the investigation being conducted by the authority and a statutory function of the DPP. The nexus must be something more than a mere theoretical possibility that the DPP might institute, carry on or take over a prosecution at some future date. The facts of the particular case or the nature of the alleged offence must, at the very least, establish that the possibility of the DPP becoming involved in a prosecutorial function is a real one. A course of conduct of past referrals of similar matters to the DPP or evidence of an intention to refer the particular matter to the DPP for prosecution may suffice. Ultimately, each case will depend on its own facts." 

His Honour had earlier (at 561) expressed the view that:
 
 " ... it would seem to be incidental or conducive to the DPP's function of prosecuting, carrying on or taking over proceedings, including considering prosecuting, carrying on or taking over proceedings, to give legal advice to any Commonwealth authorities or agencies involved in the investigation of matters which are likely to be the subject of such proceedings, irrespective of whether the proceedings are prospective, imminent or actual. ... For example, it would clearly be "conducive" for the better fulfilment of the prosecutorial functions of the DPP, for advice to be given to an investigative agency to ensure evidential material being gathered by it for the purpose of a prosecution which it is intended to be carried on by the DPP, is being gathered lawfully."</text>

<tocase>Health Insurance Commission v Freeman (1998) 88 FCR 544</tocase>
<text>61 Although s 6(1)(n) of the DPP Act , in terms, identifies a 'function' of the DPP, it has been construed as being an empowering provision. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1987) 7 NSWLR 588 the NSW Court of Appeal held that s 6(1)(n) of the DPP Act conferred a special power on the DPP: see at 597.

64 An additional source of power is to be found by a reading of s 6(1)(n) with s 6(2)(b) of the DPP Act . In Freeman Merkel J observed (at 566) that "[i]f it is regarded as desirable that the DPP have a general entitlement to give legal advice to Commonwealth authorities investigating the commission of offences under Commonwealth law, then that is a matter for Parliament." The DPP Act had, since its inception, contained s 6(2)(b) which empowered the executive, by regulation, to confer additional functions on the DPP. The power was not exercised, so as to confer power on the DPP to give general advice, until after the decision in Freeman was handed down. By regulation 3(1)(f) and (g) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1984 (as amended by the Director of Public Prosecutions Amendment Regulations 1998 (No 1) which commenced on 22 December 1998) it was provided that it was a function of the DPP to provide legal advice to Commonwealth, State or Territory authorities "whether or not the advice is for the purposes of a particular investigation." It was plainly incidental and conducive to the performance of this function that the advice proffered by the DPP to the ACC and the Attorney-General's Department was given.

65 I note in conclusion that no argument was developed by the applicants to explain how and why, if the DPP had acted ultra vires, his involvement with the making of the request by the delegate of the Attorney-General, would render that request "invalid".

66 The applicants allege that the ACC did not act lawfully in providing to the DPP the information and advice sent in February 2005 by Mr Considine to Mr Adsett and in providing the information contained in the letters from the ACC to the Attorney-General's Department in May 2005 and November 2005.</text>

<text>72 The DPP was a "law enforcement agency" for the purposes of s 59(7) of the Act. In AA Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2005] FCA 1178 at [19] Finkelstein J held that a Director of Public Prosecutions or an Attorney-General were persons who had general responsibility for the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth and were, therefore, law enforcement agencies for the purposes of s 59(7) of the ACC Act . Although his decision was overturned on other grounds by a Full Court (see Australian Crime Commission v AA Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 30 ; (2006) 149 FCR 540) , this aspect of his Honour's reasons remained undisturbed.

<tocase>O'Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1983] HCA 47 ; (1982) 153 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1983/47.html</AustLII>
<text>76 In O'Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria [1983] HCA 47 ; (1982) 153 CLR 1 the High Court was called upon to determine the validity of certain notices given under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). The Commissioner of Taxation had power to give the notices and he had delegated that power to Deputy Commissioners. Notices were given which bore a facsimile of the signature of a Deputy Commissioner which was stamped on the notices by the Chief Investigation Officer who had been authorised, by the Deputy Commissioner, to do so. The majority held that the notices were valid. Gibbs CJ (with whom Murphy J agreed) considered (at 12-13) that the Deputy Commissioner's delegated powers could be exercised through "a properly authorized officer". The Chief Investigation Officer was properly authorised notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy Commissioner had no personal knowledge that the officer intended to issue the particular notices. Wilson J (at 30-31) held that delegated power could be exercised through servants or agents. Mason J, in a dissenting judgment, was prepared to countenance the performance of ministerial acts by an agent of a delegate. His Honour said (at 18-19):
 
 "Apart from any exercise of his powers of delegation the Commissioner may appoint agents to act on his behalf and in his name. But, having regard to the statutory provisions here, I do not think that the Commissioner can appoint an agent to act on his behalf in exercising a statutory discretion or a statutory power which involves the formation of an opinion, except perhaps on the footing that the Commissioner retains to himself the substantial exercise of discretion or the substantial formation of the opinion, or the exercise of substantial control over the exercise of the discretion or the formation of the opinion, leaving to the agent the ministerial act of communicating the decision or issuing the notice." 

See generally, Campbell, "The Carltona Doctrine", (2007) 18 PLR 251.

77 The power conferred, by ss 59(7) and 59(9) on the CEO of the ACC or his delegate, Mr Outram, was conferred to facilitate departures from the general rule that information in the possession of the ACC should not be disseminated outside that body. The exercise of the power was conditional on the forming of value judgments as to the appropriateness or desirability or such dissemination. Information could only be communicated to a limited number of agencies. The significance which the legislature attached to the formation of the value judgments is indicated by the fact that, in each case, the judgment was to be formed by the CEO or a delegate drawn from the senior ranks (SES level) of the ACC. There was no evidence to suggest that the occasion for the exercise of power under s 59(7) or 59(9) was so frequent as to give rise to an assumption that the legislature could not have expected the CEO or a delegate personally to exercise the power. The exercise of the power had no direct effect on the rights of third parties but might, indirectly, have such an affect if the agency to whom the information was provided acted on it to the detriment of the third party.

78 These considerations suggest that the CEO or his delegate could not authorise other ACC officers to exercise the powers conferred by s 59(7) and s 59(9). Had Mr Outram purported to authorise Mr Considine or Mr Hellings to form the value judgments which lie at the heart of these statutory discretions, I would have been disposed to hold that the relevant disclosures had been made ultra vires. That is not, however, what occurred.</text>
