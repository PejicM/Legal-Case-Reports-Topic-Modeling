<text>8 Before the Magistrate, the appellant contended that she had in fact changed her mind after completing the form on 28 January 2005 and that she had decided that she did wish to appear at a hearing. She said that she had contacted the Tribunal on 4 February 2005 and advised a male person of that fact. She asserted that the Tribunal erred in proceeding without affording her a hearing and that that error was a jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 198 ALR 293.

9 Under s 425(1) of the Migration Act , the Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. Section 425(2) provides that subsection (1) does not apply if, inter alia, the applicant consents to the Tribunal deciding the review without the applicant appearing before it.

10 Before the Magistrate, the assertion that the appellant contacted the Tribunal on or about 4 February 2005 was in dispute. He decided that the appellant did not contact the Tribunal on or about that date and that by reason of her response of 28 January 2005 the Tribunal was entitled to proceed without hearing from the appellant in terms of s 425(1) of the Migration Act . In view of his finding of fact, the Magistrate did not need to consider whether, had he accepted the appellant's version of events, the Tribunal had committed an error going to jurisdiction. The only remaining question for the Magistrate was whether the Tribunal had otherwise committed a jurisdictional error and he had decided that it had not.</text>
