<tocase>Cotterell v Stratton (1872) LR 8 Ch App 295</tocase>
<text>67 Cotton and Bowen LJJ came to the same conclusion (see 31 Ch D at 593). Cotton LJ said that the costs which a mortgagee could recover as an incident of the ordinary relationship with a mortgagor and surety included costs of proceedings, whether by action or otherwise, to recover the mortgage debt or any part of it. These, he said '... are costs relating to the mortgage debt, though not to the mortgage security ...'. Earlier, in Cotterell v Stratton (1872) LR 8 Ch App 295 at 302 Lord Selborne LC had treated a mortgage as having an implied contractual term entitling the mortgagee to those costs (see the explanation by the English Court of Appeal in Gomba Holdings (UK) Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd (No 2) [1993] Ch 171 at 184-F).</text>

<tocase>Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 675</tocase>
<text>82 The costs which BP properly incurred in respect of its position as a party to the POSA ought be recoverable by it. That includes costs incurred by BP to the extent it acted reasonably in ascertaining or defending its rights under the POSA (cp: National Provincial Bank of England v Games (1886) 31 Ch D 582 at 592 per Cotton LJ applying Lord Cottenham LC in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 675 [40 ER 1084 at 1086]). Thus, as Lord Cottenham LC pointed out in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 676 [40 ER 1084 at 1087] if a mortgagee asserts a right to which the Court finds it was not entitled, those costs are not necessarily nor properly incurred in asserting a right which the mortgage gave the mortgagee. In other words, the mortgagee cannot recover costs arising from a mistake as to its rights or from an attempt to obtain something to which it is not entitled. Nor can a trustee recover costs incurred in fighting a doubtful case when he or she ought first to have sought the direction of the Court before continuing: Dagnell v Freedman &amp; Co [1993] 1 WLR 388 at 396E-H per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. And, in determining whether costs have been reasonably and properly incurred, it is relevant to consider whether they bear a reasonable relationship to the value and importance of the subject matter in issue ( Skalkos v T&amp;S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 281 ; (2004) 65 NSWLR 151 at 153 [8] per Ipp JA).</text>

<tocase>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage and Motor Co Ltd [1915] AC 79</tocase>
<text>64 In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage and Motor Co Ltd [1915] AC 79 at 86-87 Lord Dunedin said that the question as to whether a term is a penalty is one of construction of the contract, judged at the time of its formation and not at the time of breach. The High Court regarded this as expressing the current law (222 ALR at 308-309 [10]-[12]). Therefore the argument as to whether the deed of option was a penalty, as a matter of law, had nothing to do with whether Ringrow was in default under or in breach of the POSA.

65 The issue concerning whether the deed of option was a penalty and the construction of the arrangements between BP and the applicants did not arise out of or from any default or breach. It arose as a question of law, being the construction of the arrangements at the time they were made. It follows that BP cannot recover the costs of that issue under cll A14.2(f) or A16.9(a) of the POSA.</text>

<text>81 A Full Court of this Court, in Elders Trustee &amp; Executor Co Ltd v EG Reeves Pty Ltd (1998) 84 ALR 734 (see at 735 cl 5), construed a standard form clause in a mortgage entitling a mortgagee to all its costs and expenses including costs between solicitor and own client incurred by the mortgagee in consequence of or on account of any default on the part of the mortgagor or incurred by the mortgagee for the preservation or in any manner in reference to the security. The Full Court followed what Street J had said (see 84 ALR at 741). Sheppard and Foster JJ noted that whatever might be the ambit of the rule, the question there was the proper construction of an express clause in the mortgage contract (84 ALR at 742).</text>

<tocase>Elders Trustees &amp; Executor to Ltd v Eagle Star Nominees Ltd (1986) 4 BPR 9205</tocase>
<text>40 It has never been suggested that a contractual right to costs in mortgages or trust instruments is affected by an estoppel of this kind. There would be obvious inconvenience were that to be the case. And, as McLelland J said in Elders Trustees &amp; Executors Co Ltd v Eagle Star Nominees Ltd (1986) 4 BPR 9205 at 9209:
 
 'A contractual stipulation as to how costs of future litigation are to be borne as between the parties is not vitiated by an inconsistent order for costs in that litigation.'

86 Again, cases involving costs under mortgages and trusts provide analogical assistance in characterizing the nature and extent of BP's contractual entitlement to its costs under cll A14.2(f) and 16.9(a) of the POSA. In Elders Trustees &amp; Executor to Ltd v Eagle Star Nominees Ltd (1986) 4 BPR 9205 at 9208-9209 McLelland J said that '... "properly" means reasonably and in good faith'. As he said, the analogy with a trustee cannot be pressed too far. That is because equity allows a trustee more than party/party costs to exonerate him or her from expenses incurred in administering the estate (cf: Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 at 246 [49] and In re Beddoe; Downes v Cottam [1893] 1 Ch 547 at 555, 558, 562; Gomba Holdings (UK) Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd (No 2) [1993] Ch 171 at 184-185).</text>

80 Again, in Gomba Holdings (UK) Ltd v Minories Finance Ltd (No 2) [1993] Ch 171, the English Court of Appeal gave a wide construction to a clause in a mortgage which entitled the mortgagee to recover costs which would not be allowable on a party and party or solicitor own client taxation by the court: see also In re Adelphi Hotel (Brighton) Ltd; District Bank Ltd v Adelphi Hotel (Brighton) Ltd [1953] 1 WLR 955 per Vaisey J.

<tocase>Maher v Network Finance Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 694</tocase>
<text>74 In Maher v Network Finance Ltd (1986) 4 NSWLR 694 at 697G-698A, McHugh JA (with whom Kirby P and Priestley JA agreed) said that a mortgagee who had succeeded in obtaining a curial order for costs had an independent right of action under the mortgage contract to require the mortgagor to pay its costs of taking the proceedings. McHugh JA pointed out that a person may be answerable for legal costs as a result of contractual or statutory obligations as well as by a curial order.

75 Thus, the making of the costs orders created a curial obligation to pay costs in Ringrow and the guarantors. In addition, the POSA created a contractual liability which was separate and apart from that adjudicated by Hely J, the Full Court and the High Court, except for the pre-litigation costs which were agreed and fixed by Hely J in the final orders which he made.</text>

<tocase>National Provincial Bank of England v Games (1886) 31 Ch D 582</tocase>
<text>66 Although the POSA did not create the relation of mortgagor, mortgagee and surety between Ringrow, BP, and the guarantors, the following observation by Fry LJ in National Provincial Bank of England v Games (1886) 31 Ch D 582 at 595 is apposite to the operation of cl A16.9(a). He held that an equitable mortgagee was entitled to recover, as money chargeable against the mortgaged property, its costs of seeking to enforce a promissory note given by a surety. Fry LJ said:
 
 'A mortgagee is a creditor, he has also a security for the debt, and whether he is trying to get his money from the mortgagor, or from a surety, or out of the mortgaged property, he is trying to enforce his rights as mortgagee .' (emphasis added)

82 The costs which BP properly incurred in respect of its position as a party to the POSA ought be recoverable by it. That includes costs incurred by BP to the extent it acted reasonably in ascertaining or defending its rights under the POSA (cp: National Provincial Bank of England v Games (1886) 31 Ch D 582 at 592 per Cotton LJ applying Lord Cottenham LC in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 675 [40 ER 1084 at 1086]). Thus, as Lord Cottenham LC pointed out in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 676 [40 ER 1084 at 1087] if a mortgagee asserts a right to which the Court finds it was not entitled, those costs are not necessarily nor properly incurred in asserting a right which the mortgage gave the mortgagee. In other words, the mortgagee cannot recover costs arising from a mistake as to its rights or from an attempt to obtain something to which it is not entitled. Nor can a trustee recover costs incurred in fighting a doubtful case when he or she ought first to have sought the direction of the Court before continuing: Dagnell v Freedman &amp; Co [1993] 1 WLR 388 at 396E-H per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1112.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' (No 2) [2006] FCA 1112 at [102] - [113] I examined the authorities on the meaning of the expressions 'arising out of' and 'arising from' in arbitration clauses in the context of whether disputes arose out of or from the relevant contract. As Lord Sumner observed in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Coke Co Ltd [1916] 1 AC 314 at 328 the words are less precise than they look. He said that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract. But, he said that the jurisdiction which the submission to arbitration confers is wide.

56 In contrast, here, the words 'arising out of' and 'arising from' in cll A14.2(f) and A16.9(a) are used with reference to an event so as to fix a liability on Ringrow. The event, of course, is a default under or breach of the POSA. Many costs could arise out of defaults by Ringrow under the POSA within cl A14.2(f). However, the POSA expressly recognized that the deed of option would be entered into by Ringrow and BP, yet, cl A14.2(f) does not refer to that deed.

57 I do not derive much assistance from the cases which were cited on the meanings of 'arising out of' or 'arising from'. Words in any particular contract, other than in standard form contracts used in, for example, international transactions, when construed by one court cannot be determinative of the construction of other words used in other contracts. It has not been suggested that the words employed in the POSA, the subject of cll A14.2 and A16.9, have been the subject of other judicial consideration.</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>39 In Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Limited [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ held that an estoppel arose to prevent a party claiming under a contractual indemnity after it had sought indemnity or contribution from a joint tortfeasor based on a statutory right and recovered only a proportion of its loss by way of contribution. The reason why the estoppel arose in that case was because the party who relied upon the contractual right could not obtain a judgment which was inconsistent with the partial recovery allowed under the statutory cause of action in the earlier proceedings.

41 Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ said (at 147 CLR at 602-603) that there would be no estoppel unless it appeared that the matter relied upon as a defence in the second action was so relevant to the subject matter of the first action that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it. They said that generally speaking it would be unreasonable not to plead a defence, if, having regard to the nature of the plaintiff's claim, and its subject matter it would be expected that the defendant would raise the defence and thereby enable the relevant issues to be determined in the one proceedings. But they said that in that respect, there are a variety of circumstances, some referred to in earlier cases, why a party may justifiably refrain from litigating an issue in one proceeding when it wished to litigate that issue in other proceedings. They gave as examples the expense, importance of the particular issue, and motives extraneous to the actual litigation and referred to illustrations given by the Supreme Court of the United States in Cromwell v County of Sac 94 US 351 (1876) at 356-357.

42 In a case like the present, a judgment given on BP's contractual claim for costs would not be capable of conflicting with the Court orders for costs. The curial entitlement for costs is, as the authorities considered in answering question 6 show, a different right to that provided by a contract. And, the contractual right is conditioned by the implied qualification in those authorities that what is recoverable are costs 'properly incurred'. Nor is there any inconsistency likely to arise between a curial award of costs, either on a party/party basis, and a contractual entitlement on a higher scale. Of course, had BP been denied an order for costs or been ordered to pay Ringrow's costs, a claim under the POSA by BP would be met by a defence that the costs claimed had not been 'properly incurred'.

43 For these reasons, no estoppel operates to prevent BP making the contractual claim.</text>

He said that it included:
 
 '... all the necessary expenses of a party in establishing his case. When we speak of costs between solicitor and client, another distinction comes in between profit costs and out of pocket costs. As far as the client is concerned they are all out-of-pocket costs, but he will only be allowed to recover from the other party the proper charges incurred in establishing his case.'</text>

<tocase>Re Shanahan (1941) 58 WN (NSW) 132</tocase>
<text>77 In Re Shanahan (1941) 58 WN (NSW) 132 at 134 Street J said that the general rule was that, without any express stipulation or agreement, a mortgagee is entitled to recover from the mortgagor all costs reasonably and properly incurred by him in relation to its security. He said that that right accrued to the mortgagee as a legal incident annexed to the relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee and was available for the protection of the latter both in its personal capacity as a creditor and also in respect of its proprietary rights over the secured property. He held that only those costs which were recoverable by a mortgagee which were 'properly payable on a party and party taxation, and this is the general rule where litigation is undertaken by the mortgagee for the protection of his security: In re Queen's Hotel Co Cardiff Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 793 (see 58 WN (NSW) at 135).

78 Justice Street went on to hold that the relevant contractual provision in Re Shanahan (1941) 58 WN (NSW) 132 provided a wider entitlement to the mortgagee than the position at general law. The contract gave the mortgagee an entitlement to all costs and expenses in addition to those for which the mortgagor might have been liable at law or in equity to pay to the mortgagee.

79 Accordingly, Street J held that the mortgagor had undertaken to indemnify the mortgagee in respect of any expenditure which the latter might have incurred in their capacity as mortgagee and in relation to the secured debt. This, he said, imposed an obligation on the mortgagor 'to pay all costs which would be payable by the mortgagees to their own solicitor, and such costs, if properly payable on 'a solicitor and his own client taxation'. Thus costs which were unjustifiably or vexatiously incurred by the mortgagee so as to impose an unwarrantable burden on the mortgagor would not fall under the clause. And the taxing officer had a discretion to disallow some costs even though they might be payable by the mortgagees to their own solicitors, but the relevant clauses were to be construed widely (58 WN (NSW) at 136).</text>

<text>22 An appeal by the dealers and guarantors to the Full Court of this Court (Beaumont, Conti and Crennan JJ) was dismissed with costs ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 209 ALR 32) as was their further appeal to the High Court ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 71 ; (2005) 222 ALR 306). The Lansvale site was reconveyed by Ringrow to BP earlier this year.

52 But, once the validity of the termination was established, as Hely J found, the deed of option was not a means of providing BP with any form of compensation monetary or otherwise in respect of a breach of the POSA (203 ALR at 305 [109]) applying Forestry Commission (NSW) v Steffanetto [1976] HCA 3 ; (1976) 133 CLR 507 at 515 per Barwick CJ, 519 per Mason J, see too Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 71 ; (2005) 222 ALR 306 at 311 [21] . When Ringrow and the other applicants brought their appeals, the sole issue was whether the deed of option was unenforceable by BP because it was a penalty. The cumulative imposition of the option on the liquidated damages clause in the POSA was also alleged to be penal (222 ALR at 312 [25]).

53 Justice Hely did not make an order for specific performance of the option. He said that was because that might have had an unintended effect of preventing Ringrow from challenging the valuation process which the option provided for fixing the price payable by BP on its exercise (203 ALR at 317 [159]; 222 ALR at 308 [6]). I was informed by the parties that BP did not press for such an order at the final hearing. However, his Honour's observations highlighted that enforcement of rights under the option was not the same as enforcement of other rights under the POSA.

54 Even so, BP contended that but for Ringrow's defaults and breaches of the POSA, it would not have been involved in the need to litigate the issue of penalties on the two appeals. BP argued that Ringrow's defaults under and breaches of the POSA were a cause of its costs on the penalties issue before not just Hely J but also in the appeals.</text>

<tocase>Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1466</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1466.html</AustLII>
<text>20 After delivering the principal judgment, Hely J required the parties to make submissions as to the form of relief. He delivered a further judgment on the form of final orders ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1466). At that time, the only issue was how the quantum of the order for costs should be determined in default of agreement, between the parties. BP had sought orders that the applicant in each proceeding pay its costs (including those incurred in the Supreme Court of New South Wales before the matters were transferred to this Court) either in an amount to be agreed, or in default of an agreement in an amount to be determined by a suitably qualified costs assessor. Alternatively, BP sought a direction under O 62 r 12 of the Federal Court Rules and that the costs be assessed by the taxing officer in accordance with ss 208F and 208G of the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) and alternatively an order pursuant to O 62 r 5 that the costs of the Supreme Court proceedings be determined by the Supreme Court ([2003] FCA 1466 [2]-[3]).

21 Justice Hely rejected BP's applications for the assessment of costs on anything other than the ordinary operation of the rules of this Court in respect of both the Supreme Court part of the proceedings and the balance conducted in this Court. He held that in the interests of efficiency there should be only one quantification exercise and that BP was entitled to receive its taxed costs of the proceedings pursuant to O 62 r 4 ([2003] FCA 1466 at [13]-[14]). Hely J referred to evidence that BP's actual costs of the proceedings were nearly $1 million and that it could expect, if its costs were taxed pursuant to this Court's rules, to recover about $500,000 but would be likely to recover about $750,000 if an assessment were made pursuant to the Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW) ([2003] FCA 1466 at [11]).

23 The critical issue in the proceedings before Hely J (apart from the issue of the validity of the termination of the POSA which was later conceded before Hely J), and the proceedings on appeal, was whether the dealers and guarantors were correct in their claims that the liquidated damages clause and the rights which BP had under the deed of option amounted to penalties and were therefore unenforceable.

24 In the argument before me, the substantial issue was whether costs involved in proceedings before Hely J and the appeals concerning the legal characteristics of the option could be said to arise out of any default by Ringrow under the POSA (cl A14.2(f)) or to be costs or expenses incurred by BP in exercising or enforcing any of BP's powers, rights or remedies under the POSA or otherwise arising from a breach of the POSA by Ringrow (cl A16.9(a)).

25 Justice Hely had held that while there were separate agreements, including the deed of option, between BP and each dealer and the respective guarantors, there was one overall arrangement between the respective groups of parties for the sale of the relevant service station site and the exclusive supply and sale of BP petroleum products to the dealer on that site. Justice Hely considered the totality of the transaction indicated that each option to repurchase the service station site was restitutionary in nature and was given as part of the vendor and purchaser arrangements:
 
 '... rather than as a price to be paid in terrorem in the event of a breach of the POSA .... The determination of a POSA provides an occasion for the exercise by BP of the options, but the options are not themselves "the result of the default or the price to be paid for it". 
 ... 
 Of course, the entitlement to exercise the option was dependent upon termination of the POSA rather than upon commission of a breach of the POSA.' (203 ALR at 304 [107]-[108]) (his Honour's emphasis)

26 He held that the deed of option was not a means of providing BP with any form of compensation in respect of a breach of the POSA (203 ALR at 305 [109]). Hely J went on to find that the dealers' breaches of the POSA relied on by BP to justify the termination, were deliberate, calculated, constant and secretive and such as to disentitle them to any equitable relief (203 ALR at 316 [152]-[156]).

27 In the Full Court, the dealers and guarantors argued that the provisions of the option requiring a retransfer of the Lansvale and other service station sites amounted to a penalty (see e.g. 209 ALR at 36 [18], 38-43 [21]-[24] where Beaumont J set out the summary of the argument). The joint judgment of the High Court said that the case before Hely J '... turned upon the law concerning penalties' (222 ALR at 308 [9]). The dealers and guarantors had argued that the word ' terminated' in cl 1.2(a) of the option deed referred only to termination for breach (222 ALR at 310 [17]) and that that could occur for trivial matters as well as substantial ones so that, in effect, the option constituted a penalty. The High Court rejected all arguments that the option deed was a penalty (222 ALR at 311 [20]). The High Court did not need to consider whether cl 1.2(a) of the option deed could enable the option to be exercised if the POSA were terminated for breach under cl A13.2.1 or that the option could be exercised and the POSA were terminated on grounds other than breach under cl A13.2.2. And, their Honours said it was not necessary to deal with various contentions of BP to the effect that the doctrine of penalties was incapable of applying to the circumstances of the case, for example, on the basis (which Hely J used as set out above) that the breach was not the cause, but merely the occasion, for the option to be triggered (222 ALR at 315 [36]).

28 Ringrow argued that the word 'default' in cl A14.2(f) was used in the context of a breach which was capable of rectification by the dealer. It said that this followed from a consideration of the right of termination given under cl A13, to which the reasons of the High Court also referred. Thus, in cl A13.1, if either a dealer or BP failed to pay money due to the other under the POSA and that default were not totally rectified within 30 days after written notice of the default were given by the dealer or BP (as the case required), the party giving notice was entitled to terminate the POSA immediately or at any time after that by giving written notice of termination to the party in default. Clause A13.2 which Hely J held BP had validly utilized, provided that if the dealer breached certain provisions of the POSA, including cl A4.16 (which dealt with sale of non BP petroleum products), and the default were capable of rectification but was not totally rectified within 30 days after written notice of both the default and what was needed to remedy it were given to the dealer, BP was entitled to terminate the POSA at any time thereafter by giving a written notice of termination to the dealer. BP also had a right to terminate the POSA if it reasonably believed for any reason, the existence of certain matters, and this was so whether or not the dealer had breached any provision of the POSA (cl A13.2.2). For example, BP could terminate the POSA under cl A13.2.2 by giving not less than 30 days written notice of termination to the dealer if the site were no longer suitable as a retail fuel outlet operated under BP's trademarks.

29 Ringrow argued that these differing provisions for termination affected the construction of the term 'default' in cl A14.2(f). It said that construction which Hely J had arrived at (which the High Court found it not necessary to consider) that the rights to exercise the options were not themselves the result of the default or the price to be paid for it (203 ALR at 304 [107]) showed that the litigation concerning the validity of the deed of option was not capable of being characterized as 'arising out of ... any default by [Ringrow] under [the POSA]' (cl A14.2(f)). Ringrow argued that the same reasoning applied to cl A16.9(a) so that so much of the costs incurred by BP involved in dealing with the validity of the option deed which it now seeks to recover did not arise from a breach of the POSA by Ringrow.

32 Ringrow points to the fact that under its written demand, BP recited that it had incurred legal costs on account of the proceedings before Hely J and the appeals 'and its exercise of the [deed of] Option. Those costs arose out of Ringrow's default under the POSAs'. BP has not segregated the costs it claims into categories so as to identify the discrete costs of enforcing:
 
 
 &#8226; its rights under the option;
 &#8226; the individual proceedings and appeals (and the costs in each referable to the option) .

33 BP argued that because Ringrow put in issue whether the deed of option constituted a penalty for breach of the POSA and connected that argument to BP's rights under SC 1.2(b) and (e), BP's costs of enforcement of the deed of option or its rights thereunder were caught by either cll A14.2(f) or A16.9(a). Significantly, SC 1.2(e) identifies the deed of option as a separate agreement and provides that if the POSA is terminated and BP has exercised its right to acquire the Lansvale site under the deed of option, then liquidated damages would not be payable to BP under the POSA.

34 BP argued that the breaches of the POSA committed by Ringrow led directly to the termination of the POSA and the triggering of the option. It argued that but for those breaches the POSA would not have been terminated and BP would not have attempted to exercise the option because of the defaults. BP identified the defaults as the effective cause of the sequence of events it put in motion, including its attempt to exercise and enforce the option. It argued that it had no choice but to defend the proceedings at each level of trial and appeal if it wished to exercise and enforce the rights which had accrued to it as a consequence of the breach by Ringrow of the POSA.

38 Ringrow argued that an estoppel arose because Hely J, on BP's application, made orders under cll A14.2(f) and A16.9(a) for the payment of costs and expenses incurred by BP prior to the commencement of the proceedings before him. Ringrow also said an estoppel arose from the making of the costs orders pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) as part of the final orders made by Hely J and in each appeal.

46 The proceedings before Hely J necessarily required his Honour to determine the validity of BP's termination of the POSA. Until his Honour made final orders on 15 December 2003 which declared that the termination of the POSA was valid, BP was entitled to prosecute the proceedings before Hely J in aid of enforcing, by a curial decision, the legal efficacy of its act of termination. Moreover, that termination, on his findings, indisputably arose out of or from a default by Ringrow under the POSA and a breach of the POSA by it within the meaning of both cll A14.2(f) and A16.9(a).

47 But once Hely J made the final orders declaring BP's termination of the POSA valid and effective, Ringrow accepted that position and withdrew it from the controversy which it pursued on appeal to the Full Court and the High Court. That issue was whether the deed of option or its enforcement amounted to a penalty.

48 Leaving aside any unperformed obligations under the POSA, such as the payment by Ringrow and the guarantors of any amounts due to BP, including for costs, once Hely J made the final orders, BP and Ringrow were not contesting issues to do with Ringrow's defaults under or breaches of the POSA. The rights in contest in the two appeals were solely to do with the deed of option and whether BP's exercise of its rights under that option amounted to a penalty imposed on Ringrow for its established defaults under or breaches of the POSA.

49 Critically, however, no order made in either of the appeals was sought or could have affected the provisions of, or powers, rights or remedies of the parties contained in the POSA. The POSA had been terminated and the termination was never the subject of the appellate contests. What was then at issue was whether the objective fact of the termination of the POSA gave BP enforceable rights under the separate and independent deed of option. Ringrow's resistance to BP's exercise of the option was a breach of the deed of option.

50 BP argued the costs of it enforcing the option arose indirectly from, and were caused by, Ringrow's defaults under and breaches of the POSA which led to its termination so that its rights to costs under cll A14.2(f) and or A16.9(a) were enlivened. As I have found, that argument should be accepted in respect of the proceedings before Hely J, where the issue of the validity of BP's termination of the POSA required resolution. Ringrow's case before his Honour combined an attack on the validity of the termination (until the belated and qualified concession) and the enforceability of the option. BP had to establish the validity of the termination which it did by Hely J making of the final orders. Hely J made detailed findings of Ringrow's and the other dealer's defaults under and breaches of the POSAs. He had to do so to dispose of Ringrow's qualification to its concession about the validity of the termination of the POSAs. That qualification referred to the possible operation of s 16 of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 (Cth) (203 ALR at 298 [80]) which Hely J found did not avail Ringrow or the other dealers (203 ALR at 317-318 [161]-[171]. That finding was integral to his Honour's decision to make the final declarations of the validity of the termination of the POSAs (203 ALR at 318 [171]).

51 Ringrow and the other applicants contested the validity and enforceability of the termination of the POSAs throughout the trial before Hely J. Because of that BP must be entitled to recover its costs of those proceedings under cll A14.2(f) and A16.9(a). There was no bright line between the argument on the issue of penalty and the other issues before Hely J which would allow, as a matter of common sense or law, some division of the costs payable under the clauses by reference to issues. A critical reason why Ringrow argued that the option was not enforceable before Hely J was that the POSA had not been terminated.</text>

<tocase>Sandtara Pty Ltd v Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 82</tocase>
<text>76 In Sandtara Pty Ltd v Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 82 at 97B-C, Cole J held at general law a mortgagee is only entitled to recover party/party costs under its mortgage contract in the absence of a contractual basis which had the effect of widening the entitlement. He followed Hodgson J in AGC (Advances) Ltd v West (1984) 5 NSWLR 301 at 304, as a matter of comity, in coming to that conclusion.

87 In other contexts, such as a right of a trustee in bankruptcy to recover costs, the word 'properly' has been held to mean work reasonably and bona fide undertaken for the purpose of administering the estate or performing any public duty imposed by the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) conformably with the trustee's duty to perform the work with reasonable care and skill and in an efficient and economical way ( Adsett v Berlouis (1992) 37 FCR 201 at 212 per Northrop, Wilcox and Cooper JJ). But the limits on what a trustee may recover as 'properly' incurred have become somewhat unsettled in recent years as Ormiston JA demonstrated in Nolan v Collie [2003] VSCA 39 ; (2003) 7 VR 287 at 303-308 [44] - [53] . However, it is unnecessary to explore this question further because I agree with the view expressed by Cole J in Sandtara Pty Ltd v Australian European Finance Corporation Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 82 at 96E-97A. He said that while the discussion in the cases was helpful, the question in a case like the present is one of the construction of a particular contract, in this case, in the form of the POSA. As he said, a mortgagee does not enter into a mortgage assuming that default will occur. However, it takes steps to protect itself against the possibility that default will occur. If it does, a mortgagee will, or may, incur additional costs, charges and expenses both internally and to third parties. It is to guard against the exposure to such costs that a mortgagee, or in a case such as the present, BP, provides contractually for the payment of costs. Justice Cole held that if as a result of default, the lender incurs such costs they would fall within an expression such as 'all other costs of the lender' arising 'from default' under the securities and would also amount to being 'costs and expenses of default'. Obviously, the contract there was in different words and was entered into in different circumstances from the POSA in the present dispute.</text>

<text>82 The costs which BP properly incurred in respect of its position as a party to the POSA ought be recoverable by it. That includes costs incurred by BP to the extent it acted reasonably in ascertaining or defending its rights under the POSA (cp: National Provincial Bank of England v Games (1886) 31 Ch D 582 at 592 per Cotton LJ applying Lord Cottenham LC in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 675 [40 ER 1084 at 1086]). Thus, as Lord Cottenham LC pointed out in Dryden v Frost (1838) 3 My &amp; Cr 670 at 676 [40 ER 1084 at 1087] if a mortgagee asserts a right to which the Court finds it was not entitled, those costs are not necessarily nor properly incurred in asserting a right which the mortgage gave the mortgagee. In other words, the mortgagee cannot recover costs arising from a mistake as to its rights or from an attempt to obtain something to which it is not entitled. Nor can a trustee recover costs incurred in fighting a doubtful case when he or she ought first to have sought the direction of the Court before continuing: Dagnell v Freedman &amp; Co [1993] 1 WLR 388 at 396E-H per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. And, in determining whether costs have been reasonably and properly incurred, it is relevant to consider whether they bear a reasonable relationship to the value and importance of the subject matter in issue ( Skalkos v T&amp;S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 281 ; (2004) 65 NSWLR 151 at 153 [8] per Ipp JA).</text>
