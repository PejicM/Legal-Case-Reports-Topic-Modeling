<text>10 Like the Federal Magistrate, I can see no error in the Tribunal having reached such a view. Whether or not I would have come to such a view is completely irrelevant. Again, like the Federal Magistrate, I can see no other procedural fairness defect in the course adopted by the Tribunal. Indeed, in so far as one can glean the nature of the hearing from the summary in the reasons, it seems that the Tribunal went beyond the strict requirements of s 424A of the Migration Act as they have been explained by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , and in that Court's earlier decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 1009.</text>
