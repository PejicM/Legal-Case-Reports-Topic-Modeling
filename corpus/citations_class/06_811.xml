<tocase>Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (1977) 48 ALD 1</tocase>
<text>27 The Tribunal referred to the reasons for judgment of Branson J (with whom Beaumont and Merkel JJ agreed) in Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (1977) 48 ALD 1, where her Honour said that s 24(1)(c) of the Act raised four questions:
 
 
 1 What was the relevant 'remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking' within the meaning of s 24(1)(c) of the Act?
 2 Is the veteran, by reason of war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, prevented from continuing to undertake that work?
 3 If the answer to question 2 is yes, is the war-caused injury or war-caused disease, or both, the only factor or factors preventing the veteran from continuing to undertake that work?
 4 If the answers to questions 2 and 3 are, in each case, yes, is the veteran by reason of being prevented from continuing to undertake that work, suffering a loss of salary, wages or earnings on his own account that he would not be suffering if he were free of that incapacity?

28 The appellant submits that the line of reasoning adopted by the Tribunal involved the following steps.

29 First, as stated previously, the Tribunal found that the remunerative work that the respondent was undertaking within the terms of s 24(1)(c) was that as a truck driver, fork-lift driver, driver, storeman, process worker, labourer and general hand.

37 First, it is not a matter of focusing only on the last job the veteran had, or indeed on any particular job; rather, the phrase 'remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking' refers to the type of work the veteran was undertaking or his field of remunerative activity: Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305 at 402; Starcevich v Repatriation Commission (1987) 18 FCR 221 at 225 per Fox J; Doig v Repatriation Commission (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Lindgren J, 18 December 1996); Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (supra) at 4.</text>

<text>37 First, it is not a matter of focusing only on the last job the veteran had, or indeed on any particular job; rather, the phrase 'remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking' refers to the type of work the veteran was undertaking or his field of remunerative activity: Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305 at 402; Starcevich v Repatriation Commission (1987) 18 FCR 221 at 225 per Fox J; Doig v Repatriation Commission (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Lindgren J, 18 December 1996); Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (supra) at 4.

39 In view of the last point, some general matters about the scope and operation of s 24(1)(c) should be noted. First, under s 24(1)(c), the veteran must, by reason of the incapacity from the war-caused injuries alone, be prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work. It is clear from the authorities that other words should not be substituted for the word 'alone', and the issue is to be approached in a practical, common-sense, fashion. In Cavell v Repatriation Commission (1988) 9 AAR 534, Burchett J said (at 538-539):
 
 'I was referred to the Tribunal decision of Davies J, then President of the Tribunal, in Re Easton and Repatriation Commission (1987) 6 AAR 558 at 570-571. Davies J there cited passages from Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 113, Lucas v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 122, and Re Apthorpe and Repatriation Commission (1986) 9 ALN N157, a Tribunal decision, each of which emphasises that what must prevent the veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work, in order to satisfy par (c), must be the war-related incapacity, and that incapacity alone. As was pointed out in Lucas 's case (supra), that means it must be relevant to determine whether the applicant would, in any event, have been debarred from work because of a factor such as age. But Davies J went on to say: 
 
 
 
 "I would not, however, substitute for the word "alone" the description "sole, unique and absolute cause" as stated in Re Repatriation Commission and Cavell (unreported, No 2891, 19 September 1986) ... . In the absence of ambiguity, other words should not be used in place of the words used by the legislation."
 
 
 
 With respect, I entirely concur in the comment made by Davies J. This is not to say, of course, that a paraphrase may not throw light into a dark corner of a statutory prescription. But the phrase used by the Tribunal to which objection is taken, involves an almost scholastic insistence upon analysis of the concept of singularity. The tendency of that is to distract the Tribunal from its true task to make a practical decision whether the veteran's loss of remunerative work is attributable to his service-related incapacities, and not to something else as well. It is a decision that should not be made upon nice philosophical distinctions, but with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide.'</text>

38 Secondly (and this is perhaps no more than the development of the first point), the issue requires the decision maker to identify the 'substantive remunerative work' that the veteran has undertaken in the past: Repatriation Commission v Hendy (2002) 76 ALD 47 at [36], or the 'substantial remunerative work that he has undertaken in the past': Starevich v Repatriation Commission (supra) per Fox J at 225. Thirdly, in Doig v Repatriation Commission (supra), Lindgren J said that the appropriateness of any particular description of work that has been undertaken is governed by the purpose of the description, and in cases under s 24(1)(c), that purpose is one related to capacity to work.</text>

40 Secondly, factors other than war-caused injuries may be relevant, even if they are not of themselves sufficient to prevent the veteran undertaking remunerative work he or she was undertaking: Repatriation Commission v Hendy (supra) at 54 [37].

41 Of course, in addition to showing that the war-caused injuries alone prevented the veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work, the veteran must show that, by reason of being prevented from undertaking remunerative work, he or she is suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account that the veteran would not be suffering if the veteran were free of that incapacity.

42 It seems to me that the determination of the type of work the veteran was undertaking, or his or her field of remunerative activity, involves a consideration of the veteran's qualifications and the work which he or she has in fact undertaken in the past. On occasions, the decision will be a relatively straightforward one, where, for example, the veteran has specialised qualifications and has only ever worked in one field of employment. In other cases, of which this is one, the decision will involve a process of characterisation and is not necessarily resolved by simply characterising the field of remunerative activity as involving all of the particular types of employment which the veteran has undertaken. Nor will it necessarily be appropriate to include in the field of remunerative activity a particular type of employment performed some time in the past for a short period of time.</text>
