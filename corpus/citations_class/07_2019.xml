<tocase>Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 160</tocase>
<text>81 In Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Ltd (1997) 74 FCR 160, Emmett J had held that a provision in the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) analogous to s 17C(2) of the Act did not lay down a condition precedent to the existence of jurisdiction in the Federal Court to confirm a scheme. In Re Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 ; (2000) 104 FCR 37, Katz J adopted the same approach because his Honour did not think that Emmett J had been plainly wrong. In Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450, although with some doubt, I adopted the same approach, namely, of following Emmett J because I did not think his Honour was plainly wrong (at [63]). A similar approach was subsequently taken by Bennett J in Re MLC Lifetime Company Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1367 at [11] . Perhaps predictably, I took the same approach in the present case in relation to the question of jurisdiction.</text>
