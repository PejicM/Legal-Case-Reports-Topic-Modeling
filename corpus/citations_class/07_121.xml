<text>7 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2006] NSWSC 643 ; (2006) 201 FLR 207 at [9] , Austin J said that in his opinion s 26 of the Evidence Act is subject to s 192. As his Honour observed, s 192 provides that in granting leave or making a direction, the Court is to take into account, amongst other things, the powers which it has to make another order or to give directions in relation to evidence; see s 192(2)(e) of the Evidence Act . Austin J was of the view that the Court could not make a determination under s 26 of the Evidence Act as sought in that case because it was premature; see Rich at [15]. His Honour was of the view that the Court was not yet in a position to identify or assess all of the matters which must be taken into account in deciding whether to give a direction.

8 That seems to me to be the position in the present case. I will have, at the trial, power to make orders under a number of sections of the Evidence Act , including s 38 which deals with unfavourable witnesses, s 41 which deals with improper questions and, in particular, s 42 which deals with the power of the Court to limit or disallow the use of leading questions where, for example, a witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner or where the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination. It is unnecessary to address in these reasons the triggers for the operation of the powers conferred by those sections.</text>

<tocase>GPI Leisure Corp Ltd v Herdsman Investments Pty Ltd (No 3) (1990) 20 NSWLR 15</tocase>
<text>9 It does seem to me as Young J said in GPI Leisure Corp Ltd v Herdsman Investments Pty Ltd (No 3) (1990) 20 NSWLR 15 at 17 that the course of trials in NSW has always been for a party calling the witness to examine the witness in chief and for all other parties to test the evidence by cross-examination, and then for the person calling the witness to re-examine the witness.

10 I do not see that anything that has been put to me this morning justifies me, at present, in departing from the ordinary course. Whilst there appears to be power to do so under s 26 , as I have said, it is in my view premature for any such order to be made. I think that the appropriate course is for the trial to take place in the ordinary way with objections to evidence being taken as and when they arise.

11 If the jurisdictional triggers set forth in s 38 are enlivened, then no doubt ASIC will make an appropriate application in the course of the hearing. I am, of course, anxious for the trial to proceed in the most efficient and expeditious manner as possible but I am unable to see any reason, at this stage, for making the orders sought in the notice of motion either in the form as filed or in the way in which it was confined by Mr Stevenson during argument.</text>
