<text>But even were FKP and FGUP to file evidence capable of establishing a prima facie case in relation to their claims for final relief, Spirits submits that their application in relation to the Existing Applications and the Further Applications would nevertheless fail. An interlocutory injunction is granted to preserve the status quo pending the determination at trial of the rights of the parties to final relief: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199. The interlocutory relief sought is in respect of trade mark applications which are not the subject of the cross-claim or any present application for relief by FKP and FGUP. Spirits submits that there is insufficient connection between the orders sought and the preservation of the status quo in relation to the subject matter of the cross-claim to support the present application, even if the Court had before it evidence of a prima facie case.

But even assuming to the contrary against Spirits, Spirits submits that there would nevertheless be insufficient grounds for the making of the proposed orders. The orders sought are not proper orders with respect to the conduct of these proceedings, but relate to trade mark applications filed by Spirits in good faith and in the ordinary course of its business. Spirits submits that they are not orders that the Court will make lightly, and in the absence of compelling reasons, the Court should not, in Spirits' submission, intervene to impose conditions and obligations upon Spirits in the ordinary conduct of its business with respect to its trade marks, especially trade marks that not presently in issue in the proceedings.

For the reasons outlined below, Spirits submits that even if the present application was to be dealt with as falling outside the class of an ordinary application for interlocutory relief, there is insufficient basis for the making of the proposed orders, including on 'case management grounds'.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>FKP and FGUP submit that the proposed orders are not in the nature of substantive interlocutory relief on the cross-claim (such as rectification of the Register); the orders are procedural rather than substantive. In these circumstances, there is no cause for any rigid application of the principles relating to the grant of interlocutory injunctions discussed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 229 ALR 457 at [19] , [65] [72] and Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618. In particular, there is no need for FKP and FGUP to demonstrate a prima facie case or a serious question to be tried on the cross-claim as a condition of the grant of the relief set out in the draft short minutes of order. Proposed orders 1 and 2 do no more than facilitate the recordal by the Registrar of particulars of claims which are in fact made by FKP and FGUP, and which, for the reasons given above, will have a direct bearing on the fate of the Existing and Further Applications.

According to Spirits, it is essential, when considering any application for interlocutory injunctive relief, to examine the nature of the rights asserted, the probability of ultimate success in enforcing them and the practical consequences that would flow from the grant of the interlocutory relief: : Australian Broadcasting Corp v O'Neill at [71] [72].

Spirits rhetorically asks: What is the right asserted here? Presumably it is not a right to force Spirits, at the end of a final hearing on the application of Part 11 of the Act, to submit involuntarily to the recordal of the alleged 'interest'. Nor is it a right asserted in the present proceedings, as the Existing Applications and the Further Applications are not the subject-matter of the cross-claim and FKP and FGUP presently claim no relief with respect to those applications. In truth, FKP and FGUP do not identify perhaps unsurprisingly, given that they are of the view (wrongly in Spirits' submission) that their present application is merely for 'case management purposes' this essential first ingredient of an application for mandatory interlocutory relief.

Given their terms, the orders sought here by FKP and FGUP cannot be regarded as being purely procedural in nature or justified simply by principles of case management.

Accordingly, Spirits submits that the ordinary principles relevant to the grant of interlocutory relief must apply to the grant of relief presently sought by FKP and FGUP. These principles are well-settled. To succeed in their application, FKP and FGUP bear the onus of establishing to the satisfaction of the Court that: 
 
 (a) The applicant for relief has a prima facie case in relation to its application for final relief; and
 (b) the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interlocutory relief that is sought; and
 (c) damages would not be an adequate remedy. 

See Australian Broadcasting Corp v O'Neill .

Spirits submits that it is now well-established that an applicant for interlocutory relief must, as a threshold issue, prove that it has a 'prima facie case' for final relief. The test is sometimes expressed as, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is, there is a probability that at the trial of the action the applicant will be held to be entitled to the final relief claimed.

<text>In the cross-claim, FKP and FGUP assert rights in relation to a number of registered trade marks which include or comprise one or more of the words STOLI, STOLICHNAYA and MOSKOVSKAYA, and seek relief to give effect to those rights. The Existing Applications all relate to trade marks which include or comprise one or more of the same words, as would any Further Applications, and are in respect of the same or similar goods. In these circumstances, FKP and FGUP say that the Existing and Further Applications are, or would be, derivative of the prior registrations which are the subject of the cross-claim. According to FKP and FGUP the use of a trade mark the subject of an Existing or Further Application would infringe one or more of the prior registrations on the basis that the respective trade marks are substantially identical or deceptively similar: see s 120 of the Act; the words STOLI, STOLICHNAYA and MOSKOVSKAYA are plainly central, distinctive elements of each mark; for those marks which incorporate label devices, the device elements are also similar in many cases. Moreover, the use of additional words or elements (such as a person's name) in conjunction with a registered trade mark does not avoid infringement of the trade mark, provided that it is being used for a trade mark purpose: see Mark Foys Ltd v Davies Coop &amp; Co Ltd [1956] HCA 41 ; (1956) 95 CLR 190 at 205. According to FKP and FGUP, this would necessarily be so in the case of the trade marks the subject of the Existing and Further Applications.

Put another way, the determination of the claims made by FKP and FGUP in the cross-claim will have a direct bearing on the validity or acceptability for registration of the Existing and Further Applications, given the similarity of the marks and the fact that the latter fall later in the 'queue'. The claims articulated in respect of the former therefore disclose an interest in respect of the latter.</text>
