<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559</tocase>

<text>6 It is, as McHugh J observed in Solomons at [37], a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State (or Territory) is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State (or Territory). Statutory provisions can be "picked up" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J). There may also be statutory provisions couched in terms which make it impossible for them to be "picked up" ( Edensor at [72]-[74] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Solomons at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).

7 A court exercising federal jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to apply an Act which, upon its proper construction, applies only to State matters ( Solomons at [33] per McHugh J). Justice McHugh commented in Edensor at [141] and affirmed in Solomons at [59] that it is not the literal interpretation of a State Act that determines whether it is applied in Federal Courts but the substance of the Act. The nature of some State and Territory statutes may make them inapplicable to proceedings in the federal jurisdiction.

17 In neither the constitutional challenge nor the substantive proceedings is the Court called upon to interpret or apply a Territory law, but laws of the Commonwealth. Section 79 of the Judiciary Act does not change the meaning of the State or Territory Act that is "picked up", nor does it operate to give a State or Territory law a new or extended meaning when it is made applicable in federal jurisdiction ( Edensor at [134] per McHugh J; Solomons at [60] per McHugh J). For these reasons, s 79 of the Judiciary Act does not operate to make s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act applicable to the present proceedings, which involve the application and interpretation of Commonwealth, not Territory, laws.</text>

<text>19 I have already dealt with various applications by Mr Priestley that I disqualify myself on the grounds of reasonable apprehension of bias and an asserted lack of independence and impartiality because, he says, neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. In doing so, I applied the common law test as described in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 ( Priestley at [24]). In Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] HCA 44 ; (2006) 228 CLR 45 at [66] , Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ described the requirements as discussed by the High Court in Ebner in terms that included the requirement that a court or tribunal must be "independent" and "impartial". Those are the same terms as used in s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . Section 21(1) does not relevantly change or add to the test as laid out in Ebner and Forge . It is the same test that I applied in Priestley .</text>

<tocase>Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1179.html</AustLII>
<text>3 As set out in Priestley v Godwin [2008] FCA 1179 , Mr Priestley made a number of applications for me to disqualify myself from determining the constitutional challenge. I refused to disqualify myself on three of the grounds advanced by Mr Priestley. I reserved my decision in respect of a fourth ground based on the contention that, by s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act '), the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) ('the Human Rights Act ') applies to these proceedings, being heard in the Australian Capital Territory ('the ACT') ('the fourth ground').

4 Section 79 of the Judiciary Act relevantly provides:
 State or Territory laws to govern where applicable 
 
 (1) The laws of each State or Territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State or Territory in all cases to which they are applicable . 
 
 (emphasis added) ... 
 
 (3) This subsection covers a law of a State or Territory that would be applicable to the suit if it did not involve federal jurisdiction, including, for example, a law doing any of the following: 
 
 (a) limiting the period for bringing the suit to recover the amount; 
 
 
 (b) requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount.

19 I have already dealt with various applications by Mr Priestley that I disqualify myself on the grounds of reasonable apprehension of bias and an asserted lack of independence and impartiality because, he says, neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. In doing so, I applied the common law test as described in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 ( Priestley at [24]). In Forge v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2006] HCA 44 ; (2006) 228 CLR 45 at [66] , Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ described the requirements as discussed by the High Court in Ebner in terms that included the requirement that a court or tribunal must be "independent" and "impartial". Those are the same terms as used in s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . Section 21(1) does not relevantly change or add to the test as laid out in Ebner and Forge . It is the same test that I applied in Priestley .

21 Mr Priestley has not advanced any arguments as to my competence or independence, or the appearance of independence, or of impartiality, that were not advanced in his previous applications. His submission remains based on his contention that neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge. That has been dealt with in Priestley . The result is the same under the common law and, if it applied, under s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act . In his submission that the requirements in Article 14.1 of the ICCPR must be considered separately by reason of s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act , Mr Priestley has not added to the substance of the grounds for disqualification or recusal that he made previously.

22 It follows that the application that I disqualify myself from determining these proceedings on the fourth ground should be dismissed.

<tocase>Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/47.html</AustLII>
<text>5 As was pointed out in Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47 ; (2002) 211 CLR 119 at [22] , s 79 is couched in mandatory terms. The section is addressed to courts exercising federal jurisdiction and is limited to cases to which the State or Territory laws in question are applicable ( Solomons at [23]).

6 It is, as McHugh J observed in Solomons at [37], a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State (or Territory) is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State (or Territory). Statutory provisions can be "picked up" by s 79 even though they are expressed in terms applying specifically to State or Territory courts ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559 at [72] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ citing Kruger v The Commonwealth [1997] HCA 27 ; (1997) 190 CLR 1 at 140 per Gaudron J; Solomons at [58] per McHugh J). There may also be statutory provisions couched in terms which make it impossible for them to be "picked up" ( Edensor at [72]-[74] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Solomons at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).

7 A court exercising federal jurisdiction has no jurisdiction to apply an Act which, upon its proper construction, applies only to State matters ( Solomons at [33] per McHugh J). Justice McHugh commented in Edensor at [141] and affirmed in Solomons at [59] that it is not the literal interpretation of a State Act that determines whether it is applied in Federal Courts but the substance of the Act. The nature of some State and Territory statutes may make them inapplicable to proceedings in the federal jurisdiction.

17 In neither the constitutional challenge nor the substantive proceedings is the Court called upon to interpret or apply a Territory law, but laws of the Commonwealth. Section 79 of the Judiciary Act does not change the meaning of the State or Territory Act that is "picked up", nor does it operate to give a State or Territory law a new or extended meaning when it is made applicable in federal jurisdiction ( Edensor at [134] per McHugh J; Solomons at [60] per McHugh J). For these reasons, s 79 of the Judiciary Act does not operate to make s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act applicable to the present proceedings, which involve the application and interpretation of Commonwealth, not Territory, laws.</text>
