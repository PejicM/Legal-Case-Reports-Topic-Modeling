<text>13 There are perhaps greater difficulties in relation to the questions of bias and discrimination. There is little doubt that a denial of procedural fairness can amount to an error of law on the part of the Tribunal, and that the Court can receive evidence and make findings of fact in relation to such a denial. See Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [3] - [13] per Gray ACJ and North J. There is also little doubt that the Tribunal is bound by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ("the Racial Discrimination Act ") and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). Under the latter, of course, before a proceeding is taken in Court in respect of a complaint of discrimination, including a complaint of discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act , it is necessary to make that complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and to have the certificate of the Commission before the proceeding can be commenced in the Court. To the extent, therefore, that the applicant seeks to rely on those Acts, there is nothing to show that the proceeding is properly within the jurisdiction of this Court.

14 The orders that the applicant seeks in the notice of appeal, with the exception of the awarding of costs to the applicant for the proceeding in this Court if he should succeed, are manifestly orders that the Court could not make. The question whether the Social Security Appeals Tribunal decision should be set aside is a question entirely for the Tribunal and would not activate this Court's jurisdiction at all. For the Court to order that the Tribunal set aside the earlier decision would be for the Court itself to engage in merits review in a proceeding which can only be on a question of law. An order that the Tribunal apologise for racial discrimination would also be beyond the power of the Court, at least without a complaint having been lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a preliminary to the proceeding in this Court. An order that the Tribunal award costs of the proceeding in the Tribunal to the applicant is likewise beyond the power of the Court.

15 The end result, it seems to me, is that if the applicant wishes to raise any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal, his obligation is to await the conclusion of the proceeding in the Tribunal. If he were to be successful in that proceeding, of course, he would have no right of appeal on the question of bias, and would be bound in any event to fail. If he were to fail in that proceeding, it would then be open to him to pursue, by way of appeal to this Court, any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal. In my view, I am bound by the authorities that say that, with limited exceptions, a decision for the purposes of s 44(1) of the AAT Act is only a final decision.</text>

<text>3 There is authority, some of it binding on me, establishing that, with minor exceptions, the phrase "any decision" in s 44(1) must be construed to mean a final decision constituting the effective determination of an application to the Tribunal for review of an administrative decision. In other words, it is not permissible to appeal under s 44(1) in respect of any decision at any interlocutory stage of a proceeding before the Tribunal. See Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 31 ALR 571 at 593, per Deane J, with whom Fisher J concurred, and Lowth v Comcare [1999] FCA 1692 at [3] - [5] .</text>

4 I am advised by the solicitor appearing for the respondent that, on Friday 30 November, he sent by email to the applicant a brief letter, enclosing the notice of appearance of the respondent, as well as another letter dated 30 November 2007 and a copy of the judgment in Lowth v Comcare . The substantive letter notified the applicant that the respondent would argue at this directions hearing that the proceeding should be struck out, on the basis that it relates to an intermediate decision and not a final decision of the Tribunal.

5 The nature of the decision that the Tribunal is said to have made can be discerned in part from the notice of appeal itself. That commences with the words:
 
 TAKE NOTICE that the applicant appeals from the decision or determination of ( Administraive [sic] Appeals Tribunal ) constituted by ( Mr JR Handley, Senior Member ) given on ( 15 October 2007 ) at ( Melbourne ) by which the Tribunal decided or determined ( Adjournment of hearing and vexatious and frivolous and selective and racial discrimination ).

6 The questions of law are specified as follows:
 
 Judicial Bias: 


 
 a. Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 : whether the AAT has the jurisdiction to seek evidence not presented to the Social Security Tribunal (SSAT) and outside the scope of the Appeals from SSAT; 


 
 b. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act (Cth) 1986 and the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) 1975: Whether the AAT can racially discriminate against the Applicant by running the case for the Respondent after the Applicant sought that the Respondent call witnesses to prove their case; frivolous and vexatious and racially discriminatory abuse of powers to waste Tribunal time and money as well as the witnesses' time and money; whether the affidavits and worn [sic] statements of Australian Citizen with South-East Asian descent is less valid than the lies and fabricated documents of the Commonwealth of Australia and its Departments;</text>
