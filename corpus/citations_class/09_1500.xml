<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1352.html</AustLII>
<text>The critical words of s 31A(1), when applied to the present case, require me to be satisfied that the respondents have "... no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding ...". The following principles may be extracted from the authorities: 
(a) The moving party does not have to demonstrate that the defence is hopeless or unarguable;
 
(b) The Court must consider the pleadings and the evidence with a "critical eye" in order to see whether the respondent party has evidence of sufficient quality and weight to be able to succeed at trial ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 at [23] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J));
 
(c) The respondent party is not obliged to present its whole case in order to defeat the summary judgment applicant but must at least present a sufficient outline of the evidence in order to enable the Court to come to a preliminary view about the merits for the purpose of considering the statutory test in s 31A(1)(b) ( Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 at [22] (p 382) (per Finkelstein J)); and 
 
(d) The test may require greater scrutiny of the pleadings and evidence in some cases than in others. In my judgment, the words of s 31A(1) compel a flexible approach. The real question in every case is not so much whether there is any issue that could arguably go to trial but rather whether there is any issue that should be permitted to go to trial. This seems to be the approach of Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; 167 FCR 372 and of Gordon J in the same case (as to which see [123] [134] (pp 406 409)), although Rares J in that case at [73] [74] (p 394) and in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 esp at [45] (p 731) favoured a test which is much closer to the older test articulated in authorities decided under Rules of Court expressed in terms different from the language of s 31A(1)).

I agree with the helpful summary of the relevant principles given by Gilmour J in Dandaven v Harbeth Holdings Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 955 where, at [5] and [6] of his Honour's Reasons, his Honour said: 
 
 Section 31A of the Act 
 
 Section 31A lowers the bar for obtaining summary judgment: White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. The second reading speech of the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 which introduced s 31A stated that its purpose was to strengthen "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases": Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45] ; Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 at [124] . Success under s 31A does not require a demonstration that the case is hopeless or bound to fail. The following principles are of general application to an application under s 31A: 
 
 
 (a) the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings;
 (b) the Court ought not dismiss a claim based on a predictive assessment of prospects, where it is possible that if the claim went to trial, it may succeed; 
 (c) in a case where evidence can give colour and content to allegations, and where questions of fact and degree are important, the Court should be more reluctant to dismiss a proceeding on the face of a pleading; 
 (d) it is not Parliament's intention to require the Court to engage in lengthy and elaborate trials on an interlocutory basis for the purposes of determining whether or not a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success. It may be necessary for the opposing party to provide no more than an outline of evidence, sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute, to prevent the summary application becoming a trial;
 (e) if there is a real issue of fact or law to be decided, and the rights of the parties depend upon it, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial. It cannot be said that where there is a real factual dispute and that factual dispute must be resolved to determine whether the claim succeeds that there is 'no reasonable prospect of success'; 
 (g) it ought not be used to shut out proceedings where, on a proposition of law, there may be room for doubt. On questions of law, an inquiry as to their merit should not be for the purpose of resolving them and also not simply to determine whether the argument is hopeless, but in order to decide if it is sufficiently strong to warrant a trial;
 (h) evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects; 
 (i) in determining if there are real issues of fact in issue so as to preclude summary judgment the courts must draw all reasonable inferences in favour of the non-moving party.

<tocase>Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/100.html</AustLII>
<text>In Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 100 ; (2008) 75 IPR 478 , Jacobson J said (at [117] [121] (p 493 494)): 
 
 Aggrieved person 
 
 In order for s 88(1) to be enlivened, so as to enable Health World to invoke the grounds of opposition under ss 42 , 59 and 60 , Health World must be an aggrieved person. The expression "an aggrieved person" is to be given a wide interpretation: see In the Matter of Powell's Trade Mark (1893) 10 RPC 195 at 201 (CA UK); (1894) 11 RPC 4 at 7 8 (HL); see also Continental Liqueurs Pty Ltd v G F Heublein &amp; Bro Inc [1960] HCA 37 ; (1960) 103 CLR 422 at 427. An aggrieved person is one who has a real interest in having a trade mark removed from the register, or one who would be appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense if the trade mark remained on the register: Continental Liqueurs at 427; Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193 4 ; 95 FLR 418 at 451; 88 ALR 217 at 254; 12 IPR 417 at 454; Kraft Foods Inc v Gaines Pet Foods Corporation (1996) 65 FCR 104 at 112 13; 136 ALR 68 at 77; 34 IPR 198 at 207. It is not sufficient that an applicant for rectification of the register is in the same trade as the registered owner of the mark; what is required is that the applicant have a desire to use the mark, or be likely to be hampered in some other way by the registration of the mark that the applicant seeks to have expunged: Shanahan at [14.90]. I do not consider that Health World has any genuine desire to use the HEALTH PLUS mark. It is true that Health World has filed an application No 1121282 for the series trade mark HEALTH PLUS including a number of variations. That application was filed on 28 June 2006, approximately 6 months after Health World commenced the rectification proceeding, and 3 days after it commenced the Health World non-use proceeding.

Applying the test explained by Jacobson J, Anying Auburn appears to me at the moment to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of s 88(1) of the Trade Marks Act . Andrew Chen may also be such a person, as may An Ying NZ.

I am not prepared to hold for the purposes of the applicants' summary judgment application that none of the respondents is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s 88(1) of the Trade Marks Act . In my opinion, there is every reason to think that, at the conclusion of a trial, each of Anying Auburn, Andrew Chen and probably An Ying NZ will be held to be aggrieved persons within the meaning of that section.

That being so, it seems to me that the respondents have some prospect of having the Registered Trade Mark cancelled pursuant to s 88 by reason of the operation of s 58 (Harry Wang not being the true owner), s 62(b) (registration procured upon the basis of false representations), s 62A (application for registration made in bad faith) and s 88(2)(e) (entry made as a result of false suggestion or misrepresentation). It is apparent from the brief summary of the respondents' case at which I have given at [17] [40] above, that there is material before me at the moment which suggests that Harry Wang applied for and procured the registration of the Registered Trade Mark in circumstances where he well understood that the owner of that mark was either An Ying NZ or Andrew Chen and that he did so in breach of duties owed to them or one or other of them and in breach of duties owed to An Ying Melbourne.</text>

<tocase>James North (Aust) Pty Ltd v Blundstone Pty Ltd (1978) 48 AOJP 2419 , (1978) 1b IPR 596</tocase>
<text>But the respondents challenge Harry Wang's entitlement to be and to remain the registered proprietor of the Registered Trade Mark. As I have already mentioned in [52] and [53] above, the gateway to that challenge is s 88(1) and s 88(2)(a) of the Trade Marks Act . In order to bring themselves within that section, the respondents, or one or more of them, must be an aggrieved person within the meaning of that expression as used in s 88. The respondents seemed to suggest that the owner at common law of the Anying mark was An Ying NZ although, at times, they seemed to be submitting that the owner was either An Ying NZ or Andrew Chen personally. An Ying NZ is not a party to the proceedings at the present time. The argument at trial, no doubt, will be that Andrew Chen is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s 88(1) as is Anying Auburn. This argument will focus on Andrew Chen's involvement in the creation of the Anying mark and its use in New Zealand and arguably in Australia for some years prior to February 2006 and contentions on the part of Anying Auburn that, because it is using the Anying mark currently and has done so for almost two years, Anying Auburn itself is an aggrieved person within the meaning of s 88(1) (see Radio &amp; Records Inc v Dahlke (2005) 67 IPR 187). A person who is not the true owner of a trade mark may yet be aggrieved by the false claim to ownership of another ( James North (Aust) Pty Ltd v Blundstone Pty Ltd (1978) 48 AOJP 2419 at 2423, (1978) 1b IPR 596 at 604).</text>

<tocase>Sebel Furniture Ltd v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6 ; (2009) 80 IPR 244</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/6.html</AustLII>
<text>On that assumption, I will now consider the questions of whether damages would be an adequate remedy, the balance of convenience and the balance of justice. In Sebel Furniture Ltd v Acoustic &amp; Felts Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 6 ; (2009) 80 IPR 244 at [25] [31] (pp 250 251), I explained these concepts as follows: The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine require Sebel to show that: 
 
 
 (a) it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and
 (b) the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction. 
 
 
 The first of these matters involves an assessment by the court as to whether the claimant would, in all material respects, be in as good a position if he were confined to his damages remedy, as he would be in if an injunction were granted: see the discussion of this aspect in ICF Spry, The principles of equitable remedies: specific performance, injunctions, rectification and equitable damages, 7th ed, Lawbook, Pyrmont, 2007, pp 383 9; 397 9 and 457 62. The second of these matters requires the court to exercise a discretion. In exercising that discretion, the court is required to assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by the defendant, third persons and the public generally if an injunction is granted, with that which is likely to be suffered by the claimant if no injunction is granted. In determining this question, the court must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief (if granted) will adequately compensate the claimant for the continuing breaches which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted. In order to address the irreparable injury question, the balance of convenience and the balance of justice in the present case, it is necessary to consider the nature and strength of Sebel's case and the circumstances in which the respondent decided to compete with Sebel by importing the Titan chair into Australia and by promoting and selling that chair in this country. It is also necessary to consider and evaluate the impact that the grant or refusal of an injunction will have or is likely to have on third persons and the public generally. In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) (1998) 195 CLR 1 ; 153 ALR 643 ; 27 ACSR 535 ; [1998] HCA 30 at [65] and [66], Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, 1997, pp 402 3, which may be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 (a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances;
 (b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and
 (c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive.

I propose to apply those principles here.

The applicants first learned of the existence and trading activities of Anying Auburn in December 2007. They made their initial demand for a cessation of those activities by email dated 22 January 2008. A more formal demand was sent on 23 January 2008. These demands were answered in detail by the respondents on 27 January 2008 and again on 17 February 2008. The respondents refused to give the undertakings sought by the applicants and asserted their rights to use the Anying mark.</text>
