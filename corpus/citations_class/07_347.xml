<tocase>EFG Australia Ltd v Kennedy (unreported, NSESC, Bryson J, 2 August 1995)</tocase>
<text>10 Finally, I accept the submissions of Mr O'Brien for the applicant that, given what appear to be the deliberate actions of the first, second and third respondents in selling counterfeit GHD products as well as genuine GHD products, and the active concealment of that conduct as alleged by the applicant, there is a real possibility that the respondents will destroy the incriminating products and documents if the order is not made: EFG Australia Ltd v Kennedy (unreported, NSWSC, Bryson J, 2 August 1995).

11 Accordingly, I am prepared to make the search order in the terms sought by the applicant in the claim for interim relief as set out in the application, subject to the provision of a properly executed undertaking by Mr Wetzig, solicitor for the applicant, and the filing with the Court of undertakings by independent solicitors in New South Wales.
 
 
 I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.
