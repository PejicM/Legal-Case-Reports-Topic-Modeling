<tocase>Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511</tocase>
<text>7 However, there is no Commonwealth legislation conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine criminal matters of the kind purportedly instituted by Mr Vescio. The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the criminal prosecutions initiated by him: cf Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth), s 4(2) (confined to civil matters); Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511 (holding s 4(2) to be unconstitutional).

8 In these circumstances, the appropriate order is that the proceedings be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Mr Vescio must pay the costs of the Defendants.

 I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville.
