<text>42 Masu referred to Shipley v Masu Financial Services Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 252 , but that case is distinguishable for two reasons. The first reason is that Hammerschlag J noted (at [49]) that the argument before him appeared to proceed on the basis that Masu was a "responsible person" in relation to the Westpoint Products because it was within the notion of "either the issuer of the financial product or the person making the offer to sell the financial product". In the present case, however, Mr Stoyef relies exclusively on s 1012A on the basis that Masu provided financial product advice to Mr Stoyef and the group members, that consisted of or included a recommendation that they acquire the Westpoint Products. Accordingly, the only "responsible person" in the present case was the issuer of the Westpoint Product relevant to the particular investor, being either Westpoint or a Westpoint entity. The second reason is that the statement of claim in that case pleaded what a "proper" PDS of the kind that the defendant or its authorised representatives was required to give to the plaintiffs would have contained. In the present case, the relevant paragraphs of the further amended statement of claim do not use the word "proper" to qualify the PDS that was required to be given.

43 .There are, however, in my opinion, two pleading defects which Masu has identified. First, the words "at least" in para 42A are objectionable. Mr Curtin of counsel for Masu, submitted that his client is entitled to know now, rather than at trial, what is all of the particular information that Mr Stoyef says would have been included in the PDS which would have altered his and the group members' minds, because his client would like to investigate, or at least may choose to investigate, the question whether that information was known to "the responsible person" referred to in s 1013C(2)(a).

44 I agree. The proposed further amended statement of claim should omit the words "at least". If Mr Stoyef later wishes to allege that the hypothetical PDS would have contained further information that would have caused him and the group members not to invest, he will need to seek leave to amend further at that time.</text>
