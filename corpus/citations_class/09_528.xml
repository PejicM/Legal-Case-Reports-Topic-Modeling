<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/514.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Toro Martinez argued that Direction No 21 had not overcome the criticism of its predecessor, Direction No 17, made by Dowsett J in Aksu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2001] FCA 514 ; (2001) 65 ALD 667 at 674-675 [21] - [24] . There, his Honour said that while the direction invited a balancing exercise which would normally involve an assessment of all the relevant factors having regard to their significance in the case in question, in fact that direction fettered that process. This was because it prescribed that some factors could never have more weight than others. His Honour pointed out that direction No 17 set out primary considerations which amounted to direct outcomes resultant from a person's bad character so that its effect was that ( Aksu 65 ALD at 674 [23]): 
 "... once he or she fails the character test, there is virtually a prescription in favour of refusal or revocation of a visa. That is inconsistent with the unfettered discretion conferred by s 501."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>Flick J referred to the principle, also relied on by Mr Toro Martinez here, that in the ordinary case, where no problem of confidentiality arises, an opportunity should be given to a person affected to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to a decision to be made. The decision-maker must determine what such information is before arriving at the final decision and give an opportunity to the person affected to deal with it: Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 95 [15] and 96 [17] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ. Information that could not be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision was "credible, relevant and significant".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/184.html</AustLII>
<text>The tribunal is not required to address every piece of evidence before it, provided that it considers the intergers of the claim: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 342 [79] per Allsop J with whom Heerey J agreed. But as French, Sackville and Hely JJ observed in Applicant WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630 at 641 [47] "the inference that the tribunal had failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure expressly to deal with that issue in its reasons." However, they said that where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue at least has been identified at some point the inference will not be drawn too readily and continued: 
 "It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked."</text>

<tocase>Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427</tocase>
<text>In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 ; (2007) 163 FCR 414 at 442-444 [105] - [113] , Black CJ, French and Weinberg JJ discussed the construction of s 501 and applied the principles identified in the following passage in Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437. There Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 
 "The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights (see Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at p 12, per Mason CJ)."

They said that application of this principle by the Courts would be likely to enhance the Parliamentary process by securing a greater measure of attention to the impact of legislative proposals on fundamental rights: Coco 179 CLR at 437-438. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Sciascia (1991) 31 FCR 364 at 370-372 Burchett and Lee JJ discussed (in passages approved in Haneef 163 FCR at 443 [108] and [111]) a statutory predecessor of s 501 that provided that an illegal immigrant was liable to deportation if that person had been convicted of offences and been sentenced to imprisonment for at least one year. They said that the section deprived the persons "caught by it of one of their most precious rights, their right of community". Burchett and Lee JJ said that the making of a deportation order was a plain infringement of liberty and was more so if the law authorising it was retroactive. They said ( Sciascia 31 FCR at 372): 
 "Both retrospectivity and curtailment of liberty, when found in any statute, are strong pointers towards a construction strictly confining its operation."</text>

<tocase>Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1979/21.html</AustLII>
<text>A long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J.</text>

<tocase>Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/58.html</AustLII>
<text>It is a jurisdictional error for an administrative tribunal to ignore relevant material: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The tribunal must give its reasons for its decision pursuant to s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act . The reasons must include the tribunal's findings on material questions of fact together with a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based: s 43(2B). As McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 346 [68] , in respect of the analogous provision in s 430 of the Migration Act , the tribunal need not make findings on any and every matter of fact objectively material to its decision. They said that s 430: 
 "... requires no more than that the tribunal set out the findings which it did make. Neither expressly nor impliedly does this section require the tribunal to make , and then set out, some findings additional to those which it actually made." (original emphasis)

The assessment was considered by the tribunal in relation to Mr Toro Martinez's return to Columbia and the position of his fianc&eacute;e. But, the tribunal assessed his relationship with his daughter only on the basis of the 15 April 2008 letter. The tribunal did not expressly consider the assessment's conclusion that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to travel to Columbia, no doubt, because of its finding as to the nature of the relationship between her and her father. Since I have found that the tribunal ignored and thus, failed to have regard to the strongly corroborative and relevant material in the daughter's 2001 interview and 2007 letter, I am satisfied that it committed a jurisdictional error: Craig 184 CLR at 179. Ground 3

Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that it was reasonable for it to conclude that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia. The tribunal noted that he had claimed that he might face personal danger in "certain regions" but that he had not asserted that Cordoba was one of them. It said he had no knowledge of any particular problems, of the nature he feared, in the town in which his sole surviving uncle lived.

The tribunal had relied upon the conclusion of the departmental officer who had compiled the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that there was a mere possibility that Mr Toro Martinez might suffer serious harm as a result of indiscriminate generalised or random violence were he to return to Columbia. He complained that the tenor of the assessment was replete with references to instability, human rights abuses at every level of government and society in Columbia, and the insurgency of guerilla groups who also indulged in substantial and repeated violations of human rights. He claimed that country information also supported a very pessimistic assessment of the state of civil society in Columbia.</text>

<tocase>Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585</tocase>
<text>The Minister, on the other hand, relied upon the words in item 7(1) "... is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permanent) visa ... were a visa that had been granted". He contended that this retrospectively deemed the delegate's decision always to have been valid and that, as a result, the tribunal's decision affirming that decision was unimpeachable. The Minister argued that to affirm the decision under review had the effect of leaving the delegate's decision as the only operative decision. He contended that an affirmation by the tribunal of a decision of a delegate has the effect that the original decision of the delegate continues to operate and the later decision of the tribunal does not operate in substitution: Kim v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 73 ; (2008) 167 FCR 578 at 583 [23] per Tamberlin J, with whom Besanko J agreed at 586 [42]; see also Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587F-588B per North J.

However, as French, O'Loughlin and Whitlam JJ pointed out in Madafferi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 220 ; (2002) 118 FCR 326 at 346 [68] the source of the tribunal's power to give the correct or preferable decision on a review is s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act . They said: 
 "It does not exercise afresh the power conferred by the enactment under which the decision was made. A fortiori, when it affirms a decision or sets it aside and remits it for reconsideration, it does not exercise a power conferred by the enactment under which the primary decision-maker has made his or her decision ... Analogous reasoning in Daher v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 70 FCR 585 at 587 led North J to conclude that a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of the Minister to refuse a visa was not itself a decision to refuse the grant of the visa."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/5.html</AustLII>
<text>Fact finding is the province of the tribunal. Ordinarily, an error of fact by the tribunal will not constitute a jurisdictional error, let alone an error of law. There is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact: Enfield City v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5 ; (2000) 199 CLR 135 at 154 [44] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. However, he argued that the tribunal's conclusion that he would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia was not a finding that the tribunal could make on any fair reading of the totality of the material on which it was based. He relied on the principle that if a decision-maker made a finding that was a critical step in arriving at its ultimate conclusion, but had no evidence to support it, the finding may well constitute a jurisdictional error: SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 at 407 [19] per Mansfield, Selway and Bennett JJ; SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 at [32] per Greenwood J; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 at 12 [42] per Flick J.</text>

<text>Deeming provisions that do create fictions must be carefully construed.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2106.html</AustLII>
<text>In my opinion Direction No 21 does not have that vice. The Minister asserted that it created a rebuttable presumption about the weight to be given to primary considerations that should guide the exercise of decision-makers' discretions in a uniform manner. I agree with Emmett J who said that the terms of Direction No 21 do not contain a requirement that any decision-maker, whether the Minister, a delegate or the tribunal, reach a conclusion that particular conduct of the visa holder is abhorrent: Lesuma v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2007] FCA 2106 ; (2007) 99 ALD 514 at 517 [11] .

I am not satisfied that Direction No 21 exceeded the ambit of the Minister's power to give it under s 499(1). Often decision-makers will be required to take into account or to have regard to, or to give weight to, numerous, sometimes conflicting factors in arriving at decisions by force of legislation. Similarly, in general, the description of a factor as a "primary consideration" or the attribution of weight to be given to a factor will provide an effective guide to decision-makers but will not require them to arrive at a predetermined conclusion. Because par 2.2 requires an overall balancing process to be undertaken by the decision-maker, he or she will be able to address the necessities and circumstances of the individual case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, Mason J explained that in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it was generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters that are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance. Mason J cautioned that the preferred ground on which that judicial power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". I discussed the principles applicable to a statutory duty of, or requirement for, a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to factors in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . When the expression "regard must be had to" or like expressions are used in a statute in respect of a particular criterion or factor to be considered by a decision-maker, he or she is bound to treat such a factor as a central or fundamental element in the making of the relevant decision: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2009] FCAFC 23 at [267] per Jacobson, Lander and Foster JJ applying Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] .</text>

<text>In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 ; (2007) 163 FCR 414 at 442-444 [105] - [113] , Black CJ, French and Weinberg JJ discussed the construction of s 501 and applied the principles identified in the following passage in Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437. There Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said: 
 "The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights (see Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at p 12, per Mason CJ)."

They said that application of this principle by the Courts would be likely to enhance the Parliamentary process by securing a greater measure of attention to the impact of legislative proposals on fundamental rights: Coco 179 CLR at 437-438. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Sciascia (1991) 31 FCR 364 at 370-372 Burchett and Lee JJ discussed (in passages approved in Haneef 163 FCR at 443 [108] and [111]) a statutory predecessor of s 501 that provided that an illegal immigrant was liable to deportation if that person had been convicted of offences and been sentenced to imprisonment for at least one year. They said that the section deprived the persons "caught by it of one of their most precious rights, their right of community". Burchett and Lee JJ said that the making of a deportation order was a plain infringement of liberty and was more so if the law authorising it was retroactive. They said ( Sciascia 31 FCR at 372): 
 "Both retrospectivity and curtailment of liberty, when found in any statute, are strong pointers towards a construction strictly confining its operation."</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>I am not satisfied that the tribunal committed any error in the way in which it expressed itself. Decision-makers are allowed considerable latitude in their choice of expression of the reasons they had for determining the matter as they did: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. I reject this ground. Ground 6

Mr Toro Martinez claimed that he had been denied procedural fairness because the tribunal referred to two documents in forming its conclusion that: 
 'Without more detailed evidence and submissions, one could not draw conclusions about the practical standard of health care that would be available to the applicant in [two named towns], but it seems safe to say that Columbia is not totally devoid of medical services."

The two documents were material from the Pan American Health Organisation as to Columbia's health system, the number of public hospitals, doctors and nurses and pages in Volume 2 of a publication "Health in the Americas 2007" which dealt with the State's subsidised health insurance system. It is common ground that those documents were not drawn to Mr Toro Martinez's attention before the tribunal made its decision and he had no opportunity to inspect them, or to make submissions in relation to them. Under s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , the tribunal was required to: 
 "... ensure that every party to a proceeding before the tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case and, in particular, to inspect any documents to which the tribunal proposes to have regard in reaching a decision in the proceeding and to make submissions in relation to those documents."</text>

<text>It is a jurisdictional error for an administrative tribunal to ignore relevant material: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. The tribunal must give its reasons for its decision pursuant to s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act . The reasons must include the tribunal's findings on material questions of fact together with a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based: s 43(2B). As McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 346 [68] , in respect of the analogous provision in s 430 of the Migration Act , the tribunal need not make findings on any and every matter of fact objectively material to its decision. They said that s 430: 
 "... requires no more than that the tribunal set out the findings which it did make. Neither expressly nor impliedly does this section require the tribunal to make , and then set out, some findings additional to those which it actually made." (original emphasis)</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/17.html</AustLII>
<text>The Courts have developed guidelines or principles from time to time that are used in the exercise of discretions in judicial decision-making. As Mason and Deane JJ pointed out in Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 519 it does not follow that, because a discretion is expressed in legislation in general terms, the legislature intends that the Court should refrain from developing rules or guidelines affecting its exercise. They said that such rules can promote consistency in decision-making and diminish the risks of arbitrary and capricious adjudication. I am of opinion that similar considerations inform the giving and content of directions under powers such as s 499(1).

It is a feature of parliamentary democracy that government policy should be carried out through the exercise of the executive power which, in turn, is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The structure of our system of government is that the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General by s 61 of the Constitution . However, in practice and as a matter of convention that power is exercised by the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth who administer departments of State pursuant to s 64 of the Constitution . And, s 64 also requires that a Minister may not hold office for longer than three months unless he or she becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the exercise of the executive power under Ch II of the Constitution is confided to Ministers who are answerable for their conduct of the executive power in the Parliament. One purpose of the Parliament enacting legislation with broad discretions, such as are found in s 501(2) of the Migration Act , is to accommodate changing government policies over the years.

The constitutional scheme of responsible government would be defeated if departmental decision-makers were entirely free to arrive at their own idiosyncratic views, unfettered by the control of the Minister who, by s 64 of the Constitution , is the person who administers a department of State and answers for that administration in the Parliament. Hence, the power to give a written direction under s 499 is a valuable means of the Minister ensuring that officers of his or her department will have appropriate regard to the objectives or policies of the government of the day in the exercise of their powers and functions. I am of opinion that the power in s 501(2) to cancel a visa is capable of being made the subject of a direction made under s 499(1).</text>

And, there is a general rule that where the legislature alters the rights of persons retrospectively unless the Act clearly so operates, the Court will not construe it to affect rights: cf: Bawn Pty Ltd v Metropolitan Meat Industries Board (1970) 72 SR (NSW) 466 at 486C-D per Mason JA: see too NSW Food Authority v Nutricia Australia Pty Ltd (2008) 253 ALR 133 at 161-162 [130]-[132] per Spigelman CJ, with whom Hidden and Latham JJ agreed.

The Minister also argued that retrospective legislation may affect existing proceedings. That, of course, is correct. But the result is affected by the principle that the legislation will be read down so as not to have such an operation in the absence of clear words of a contrary statutory intention: see Nutricia 253 ALR at 162 [132] per Spigelman CJ.</text>

However, they said that where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue at least has been identified at some point the inference will not be drawn too readily and continued: 
 "It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked."</text>

 GROUNDS OF REVIEW 
 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases: 
 (1) The only correct or preferable decision at which it could have arrived was that the decision should be set aside because the visa had not been granted or taken to be granted for the purposes of s 501 having regard to the law later laid down in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. 
 
 (2) The tribunal ignored relevant considerations by failing to have regard to:
 
 (a) the impact on Mr Toro Martinez's daughter as revealed in her interview with the Department in June 2001, and her letter to the Department in July 2007 because it referred only to a letter she had written on 15 April 2008 in concluding that she would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal; and
 
 (b) the conclusion of the Department's International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment that, because of the poor overall security situation in Columbia, it would be unreasonable to expect Mr Toro Martinez's fianc&eacute;e or his daughter to leave the relative safety of Australian society and accompany him to Columbia. 
 
 (3) The tribunal reached a conclusion not open on the evidence before it, namely that Mr Toro Martinez would face no serious danger of personal harm by returning to Columbia because, first, the International Obligations and Humanitarian Concerns Assessment had identified that other States were choosing not to return persons involuntarily to Columbia and, secondly, there were multiple human rights violations there.
 
 (4) Direction No 21 made by the Minister under s 499 of the Act was invalid because it went beyond the giving of directions or interfered with the unfettered discretion of a decision-maker under s 501(2).
 
 (5) The tribunal applied Direction No 21 by obeying its requirements to give prominence or weight to matters as primary considerations and thus failed to have regard to all of the relevant circumstances, according them appropriate weight as it saw fit.
 
 (6) The tribunal failed to accord procedural fairness because it did not give Mr Toro Martinez any opportunity, let alone a reasonable opportunity, to inspect documents to which it proposed to have regard in reaching its decision in contravention of s 39(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) or alternatively its common law obligation to accord him procedural fairness.
 Ground 1

Mr Toro Martinez argued that item 7 expressly referred to two classes of decision, first, those by the Minster made under identified sections of the Act (item 7(1)(a)) and secondly, by a delegate of the Minister made under only s 501 (item 7(1)(b)). He pointed out that in the 2008 amendment there was no reference to decisions made by the tribunal. He argued that if the Minister wished now to cancel a visa that previously had not been cancelled validly, he could do so under the new s 501HA. But, the Minister wished to have the legislation construed so as to make valid a decision of the tribunal which, at the time it was given, was not a decision at all because of its jurisdictional error in affirming a decision that could not have been made under s 501 ( Plaintiff S157 211 CLR at 506 [76]). Mr Toro Martinez argued that for this result to ensue clear words of necessary intendment were required, and the Parliament had not used them. He argued that all item 7(1) did was to restore validity to the delegate's decision. But, he contended, this did not affect the legal status of the tribunal's invalid decision. He argued that regardless of whether the decision of the delegate was valid or invalid, in reviewing that decision the tribunal was exercising an independent function under s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act .</text>

<tocase>Re Brian Lawlor Automotive and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167</tocase>
<text>In the contrasting position, that has actually occurred, the tribunal decided that the correct and preferable decision was the one arrived at by the delegate. It would be an odd result if item 7 operated to validate the latter decision but had no effect on the former. The natural and ordinary meaning of item 7 is that it validates certain decisions of the Minister and his delegates. If it cannot, and in its terms does not, undo other decisions, such as those of the tribunal, I am of opinion that item 7 should not be read to validate other decisions to which it is not expressly directed. However as Brennan J said in Re Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167 at 175-176 in a passage approved by Hayne and Heydon JJ in Shi 235 CLR 315 [100]. 
 "A decision by the Tribunal pursuant to s 43(1)(a) to affirm the original decision leaves the original decision intact, and this is the only decision which takes effect under the enactment: the original powers are not drawn upon by the Tribunal's order. Equally, a decision to set aside the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration pursuant to s 43(1)(c)(ii) requires the original repository of the powers and discretions to exercise them afresh: they are not exercised by the Tribunal. Section 43(1) grants the original powers and discretions to the Tribunal, but it does not require the Tribunal to exercise them unless the Tribunal is making a fresh order the effectiveness of which depends upon their exercise."</text>

<tocase>Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/132.html</AustLII>
<text>Nonetheless, as a result of the subsequent decision of the Full Court of this Court in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 132 ; (2008) 171 FCR 56 , it is common ground that Mr Toro Martinez's visa was in a class of visa that was not then capable of cancellation under s 501(2). This was because the visa did not meet the description in s 501(2) of a visa "... that has been granted to a person". The Full Court held that the legislative scheme providing for the conversion of Mr Toro Martinez's permanent entry permit into a transitional (permanent) visa did not involve any grant of that visa to him. If a person was the holder of a permanent entry permit immediately before 1 September 1994 then reg (4)(1) of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1994 provided that "... that entry permit continues in effect on and after 1 September 1994 as a transitional (permanent) visa that permits the holder to remain indefinitely in Australia". The source of Mr Toro Martinez's visa was his permanent entry permit which was continued in effect as a visa by force of reg 4. Accordingly, it is common ground that the decision of the delegate of the Minister made on 10 March 2008 to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa under s 501(2) was invalid since the Minister had no power to cancel a visa that had not, in fact, been granted.

The consequence of the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 was that the only correct and preferable decision which the tribunal could have made at the time it acted was to set aside the decision under review, because there was no power to make it in the first place. Mr Toro Martinez applied promptly to this Court to review the decision of the tribunal. Before any hearing of the application to the Court, the Minister accepted that the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied equally to Mr Toro Martinez, because the original decision to cancel his visa had no force or effect. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship wrote to Mr Toro Martinez and informed him of this outcome. The letter warned him that the legislative position may change. He was released from immigration detention. Consequently, on 26 August 2008 Mr Toro Martinez filed a notice of discontinuance of his application in the Court.

Next, the Parliament enacted the Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2008 which inserted s 501HA into the Act. The purpose of that provision was to reverse Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 as it applied to decisions taken after the day on which the amendment commenced, being 19 September 2008 (see Schedule 4, items 5 and 6(iii)). In item 7 of Schedule 4 of the 2008 amendment the Parliament provided that any decision to cancel a transitional permanent visa made or purporting to have been made by the Minister or a delegate before 19 September 2008 was deemed to be valid. Mr Toro Martinez was then returned to immigration detention and filed a fresh application challenging the tribunal's decision. On 5 December 2008 Emmett J dismissed that application as incompetent ( Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 1995) but his Honour granted leave to Mr Toro Martinez to withdraw his notice of discontinuance in these proceedings since the Minister did not oppose this course. His Honour also made directions in these proceedings: Martinez v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1994.

What the 2008 amendment meant in the context of a person in Mr Toro Martinez's position is the principal ground of the present amended application. It is necessary to set out the relevant items of the Schedule in the 2008 amendment in order to understand the argument: 
 " 5 After section 501H 
 Insert: 

 
 501HA Application of sections 501 to 501H to transitional (permanent) visas and transitional (temporary) visas 

 
 If, under the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations, a person:

 (b) held a temporary entry permit or temporary visa that continues in effect as a transitional (temporary) visa; or
 (c) is taken to hold a transitional (permanent) visa;

 (b) by a delegate of the Minister under section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (as in force at any time on or after 1 September 1994 and before the day on which this item commences) before the day on which item 5 of this Schedule commences;
 to cancel a transitional (permanent) visa or a transitional (temporary) visa is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permanent) visa or transitional (temporary) visa were a visa that had been granted.

 transitional (permanent) visa means a transitional (permanent) visa referred to in the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations.

 GROUNDS OF REVIEW 
 Mr Toro Martinez argued that the decision of the tribunal involved a jurisdictional error and therefore was to be regarded as no decision at all ( Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506 [76] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) on the following bases:

 Ground 1

Do the words in item 7 "... is taken always to have been as valid" have a retrospective operation so as to deny that the tribunal made any jurisdictional error? Mr Toro Martinez filed his notice of discontinuance in this Court on 26 August 2008, more than three weeks before item 7 came into operation as a law of the Commonwealth. Thus, it could not be said that the enactment of item 7 affected these proceedings at the time as pending or current litigation. The evident intention of the 2008 amendment was to validate earlier decisions to cancel visas that had not been "granted" but were nonetheless operative. Those visas were in the category that the judgment in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 had revealed could not fall within the then statutory powers of cancellation.

Item 7 in the 2008 amendment is capable of operating in a manner that infringes the liberty of persons whose visas had been purportedly cancelled under decisions of the Minister or a delegate that were invalid for reasons given in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56. The item is intended to restore the legal force of those decisions.

The Minister argued that because item 7 has the effect of validating the delegate's decision retrospectively, the necessary consequence is that the tribunal's decision is also validated. That followed, he contended, because the tribunal's affirmation of the delegate's decision never operated (unlike the case prior to the 2008 amendment) on a valid decision of the delegate to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa even though it was not a visa that had been granted. In effect, the Minister argued that the words in item 7 "... is as valid, and is taken always to have been as valid, as it would have been" not only validated the delegate's decision that had previously been invalid, but changed the status in law of the tribunal's decision.

Here, the decision of the tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error at the time it was made on 19 June 2008. In my opinion the decision of the tribunal was no decision at all. The Tribunal had not made a decision in accordance with s 43 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , because the only correct and preferable decision to which it could have arrived on 19 June 2008 was to set aside the decision to cancel the visa as not having been a decision made in accordance with s 501. The visa had never been grated to Mr Toro Martinez and was therefore outside the reach of s 501(2): Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56.

The 2008 amendment did not deal in item 7 with a purported decision of the tribunal. The language of item 7 addressed two of the three possible categories of decision to which Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 applied, namely a decision by, first, the minister under identified sections of the Act and, secondly, the delegate under s 501 alone. That raises the question whether the words "... is as valid, as it would have been if the transitional (permenant) visa ... were a visa that had been granted" operate to change the nature of the tribunal's decision because they transformed the earlier invalid decision of the delegate into a valid decision.

Although there is no evidence as to the number of potentially affected decisions, it is safe to infer that a considerable number of visas in the affected category had been cancelled over the previous years. Challenges to the cancellation of those visas, like Mr Toro Martinez's, would have been made to, first, the tribunal and then to this Court and the High Court. The consequence of giving item 7 a narrow construction is that persons who left Australia either voluntarily or involuntarily, based on failed challenges to the purported cancellation of their visas could now assert rights of re-entry and residence on the ground that the tribunal's decisions to affirm the cancellations were affected by the above jurisdictional error. It is unlikely that the Parliament intended that consequence. That may be why it chose the opening words of the chapeau to item 7(1): 
 "To avoid doubt, any decision made or purported to have been made."

The doubt referred to was, clearly enough, whether those two classes of decision were valid. The language of the Parliament does not suggest that it sought to create a distinction between those who had accepted a decision by the Minister or a delegate to cancel their visas without challenge and those who had applied unsuccessfully to the tribunal or the Courts to set aside the decision to cancel. Such a distinction would create, not avoid, doubt. The anomalous result would ensure that a person who had taken proceedings to reverse the cancellation but failed would be in a better position than someone who had accepted the decision in the first place. It would certainly give a new and unattractive twist to the aphorism that "it is better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all".

If the tribunal had arrived at the conclusion, subsequently established by the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , that it had no power to cancel the visa under s 501, it would have set aside the decision of the delegate (see: s 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ). Had the tribunal done that, item 7 would not have had any effect on the tribunal's decision because the delegate's decision would no longer be operative. As Hayne and Heydon JJ identified in Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 235 CLR 286 at 314 315 [96]-[98], the tribunal's task here was to decide on the material before it whether to exercise the Minister's power under s 501(2) (if it existed).

That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law. By applying to the tribunal before the 2008 amendment came into force, a person who then invoked a challenge to the Minister's or delegate's decision under s 501(2) elected to treat that decision as valid, though erroneous, and to have the tribunal exercise the power, in preference to challenging the decision in judicial review proceedings: Twist 136 CLR at 116 per Mason J. And the tribunal could have "cured" the defect in the delegate's decision by setting it aside: cf Zubair 139 FCR at 354. But the decision of the tribunal in respect of Mr Toro Martinez was given in respect of a different legal and factual scenario from that considered by the delegate and, because of Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , was no decision at all, being infected by jurisdictional error.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1931/21.html</AustLII>
<text>The Minister also sought to draw an analogy with stamp duty legislation that prohibited the admission into evidence of an unstamped instrument but gave the instrument, once duly stamped, its full force and effect, relying on Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Ltd [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359 at 383 per Dixon J. I reject this argument. First, stamp duty legislation, ordinarily, does not affect liberty of individuals or fundamental human rights. Secondly, that legislation suspends, conditionally, the operation of an existing instrument only when it is sought to be put into evidence. I do not consider that generalised references to stamp duty legislation assist in construing item 7.

The Parliament enacted the 2008 amendments knowing that both the tribunal and the Courts would have made decisions affecting visas purportedly cancelled by one of the two classes of decision for which item 7 provided. Yet, the 2008 amendments did not address curing any error made by the tribunal in arriving at its decision. Nor did the 2008 amendments validate any decision of the tribunal. The liberty of an individual is at stake. The Parliament did not express, in unambiguous and clear language, its intention to remove the accrued right of persons in the position of Mr Toro Martinez to treat the decision of the tribunal as no decision at all. I am of opinion that the tribunal's decision should be quashed and a writ of mandamus issued to command it to perform its function of review according to law. Ground 2

The essence of the second ground is that the tribunal failed to have regard to or consider the evidence of Mr Toro Martinez's daughter and a departmental assessment relating to conditions in Columbia concerning the effect on her, were the visa to be cancelled. The tribunal did not make any reference in its reasons to an interview given by the daughter to the Department in June 2001 or to her letter of July 2007. The only evidence of the daughter to which the tribunal referred was her letter of 15 April 2008. The tribunal used the latter letter and her failure to refer to significant matters in it (which the daughter however had said in the 2001 interview and 2007 letter) in arriving at two important findings. Nor did the tribunal refer in its decision to the international obligations and humanitarian concerns assessment that it would be unreasonable to expect the daughter to depart the relative safety of Australian society and accompany her father to Columbia.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/31.html</AustLII>
<text>If the tribunal had arrived at the conclusion, subsequently established by the decision in Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , that it had no power to cancel the visa under s 501, it would have set aside the decision of the delegate (see: s 43 (1)(c) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ). Had the tribunal done that, item 7 would not have had any effect on the tribunal's decision because the delegate's decision would no longer be operative. As Hayne and Heydon JJ identified in Shi v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2008] HCA 31 ; (2008) 235 CLR 286 at 314 315 [96]-[98], the tribunal's task here was to decide on the material before it whether to exercise the Minister's power under s 501(2) (if it existed).

In the contrasting position, that has actually occurred, the tribunal decided that the correct and preferable decision was the one arrived at by the delegate. It would be an odd result if item 7 operated to validate the latter decision but had no effect on the former. The natural and ordinary meaning of item 7 is that it validates certain decisions of the Minister and his delegates. If it cannot, and in its terms does not, undo other decisions, such as those of the tribunal, I am of opinion that item 7 should not be read to validate other decisions to which it is not expressly directed. However as Brennan J said in Re Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167 at 175-176 in a passage approved by Hayne and Heydon JJ in Shi 235 CLR 315 [100]. 
 "A decision by the Tribunal pursuant to s 43(1)(a) to affirm the original decision leaves the original decision intact, and this is the only decision which takes effect under the enactment: the original powers are not drawn upon by the Tribunal's order. Equally, a decision to set aside the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration pursuant to s 43(1)(c)(ii) requires the original repository of the powers and discretions to exercise them afresh: they are not exercised by the Tribunal. Section 43(1) grants the original powers and discretions to the Tribunal, but it does not require the Tribunal to exercise them unless the Tribunal is making a fresh order the effectiveness of which depends upon their exercise."

Even though the delegate's original decision to cancel Mr Toro Martinez's visa was left intact, the tribunal decided that this was the correct and preferable decision on the material before it. That is, the function which the tribunal performed was a review on the merits of the delegate's decision using all of the material available up to the time that the tribunal made its decision: Shi 235 CLR at 298-299 [34]-[38] per Kirby J, 314-316 [96]-[101] per Hayne and Heydon JJ, 324-325 [134], 326 [137], 327-328 [140]-[144] per Kiefel J, with whom Crennan J agreed on this issue at 319 [117]. As Kiefel J observed, s 43(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act gives the tribunal powers in s 43(1)(a) to (c) for the purpose of reviewing a decision. She said that the purpose of the powers was "... to permit the Tribunal to consider for itself what the decision should be": Shi 235 CLR at 326 [137]. It is in that task that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error and thus failed to complete its review in accordance with law.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1758.html</AustLII>
<text>In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, Mason J explained that in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it was generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters that are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. But he said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no importance. Mason J cautioned that the preferred ground on which that judicial power was to be exercised was that the decision was "manifestly unreasonable". I discussed the principles applicable to a statutory duty of, or requirement for, a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to factors in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] . When the expression "regard must be had to" or like expressions are used in a statute in respect of a particular criterion or factor to be considered by a decision-maker, he or she is bound to treat such a factor as a central or fundamental element in the making of the relevant decision: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2009] FCAFC 23 at [267] per Jacobson, Lander and Foster JJ applying Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] .

Often the three primary considerations in Direction No 21 will tend in different directions. The best interests of a visa holder's child may often be to remain with his or her parent, while the protection of the Australian community or its expectations may tend in the other direction. As I said in Telstra [2008] FCA 1758 at [110] , in the context of ordinary principles of administrative decision-making, where fundamental weight must be given to a particular factor or factors, the requirement is that the decision-maker treat consideration of the factors, as opposed to the factors themselves, is a central element in the deliberative process. It will be in this manner that he or she will give appropriate weight to those factors. I am of opinion that par 2.17 permits the decision-maker to accommodate such an interpretation. It refers to other 11 factors that, where relevant, it may be appropriate for the decision-maker to take into account, but as par 2.17 continued, it was the government's view that: 
 "... generally they be given less individual weight than that given to the primary considerations."

In my opinion the requirements of Direction No 21 do not dictate any particular outcome. Rather, they reflect factors which must be considered by a decision-maker together with others which may be considered. Merely because two of the factors require that the protection of the Australian community and its expectations are to be given weight as primary considerations, does not mean that they necessarily and in every case will outweigh one or more other considerations, even if they are not primary considerations. However, by identifying some primary considerations and requiring the decision-maker to give weight to them, the direction emphasises that the decision-maker must have regard to those matters as a fundamental part of his or her deliberation. That does not preclude the decision-maker determining that some other factor is more important in particular circumstances. Ground 5

Mr Toro Martinez argued that the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in applying Direction No 21 in the manner in which it did. He contended that this was because at the conclusion of its reasoning it stated that par 2.17 stipulated that other considerations were to receive less individual weight than the primary ones and that notwithstanding the well prepared and well argued case for Mr Toro Martinez, after considering all the evidence, the tribunal said: 
 "I must conclude that the primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case."

Earlier in its reasoning it had noted that par 2.6(a) of the direction gave "special and unique prominence and emphasis to offences involving the ... importation ... of illicit drugs". Mr Toro Martinez had been convicted of two offences committed in November 1996. He had pleaded guilty to the first, under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of being knowingly concerned in the importation of 655 grams of pure cocaine, which exceeded the trafficable quantity. The maximum penalty for that offence was 25 years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000. Following a Crown appeal, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a three year non-parole period. He was also convicted in February 2002 of a second offence after a jury trial in respect of being the principal behind an importation of 4.492 kilograms of cocaine into Australia in December 1996. He was sentenced to 12 years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period that expired on 8 June 2008. In that context, the tribunal was entitled to have regard to the very serious conduct involved in Mr Toro Martinez's offending.

The tribunal gave detailed consideration to Mr Toro Martinez's present situation. It concluded that although the evidence of his rehabilitation suggested that the risk of recidivism might be low, it was nevertheless real and, if it occurred, could have serious consequences for the community. The tribunal had regard to these factors and the expectations of the Australian community. It concluded that the seriousness of the offences and their planned and calculated nature would ultimately lead most community members to the conclusion that the appropriate course was to cancel the visa. The tribunal then turned to considering other matters in accordance with par 2.17 of Direction No 21. It found that, as I have discussed above, the daughter would suffer some emotional hardship from his removal. It also found that there was a genuine relationship between Mr Toro Martinez and his fianc&eacute;e and that she would suffer hardship both emotionally and in terms of her business, were he to have his visa cancelled. The tribunal was evidently sympathetic towards the fianc&eacute;e. It found her to be an honest and deserving woman, making the observation that "any decision-maker would wish to avoid occasioning her any hardship, but she knew the facts and must have realised there were risks involved in continuing with the relationship".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1976/58.html</AustLII>
<text>A long line of authority in this Court has held that the tribunal has jurisdiction to review a purported decision, even where it is clear that the decision of the original decision-maker was affected by a jurisdictional error: Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Limited [1979] FCA 21 ; (1979) 41 FLR 338 at 342 344 per Bowen CJ, 370 per Smithers J; Zubair v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] per Finn, Mansfield and Gyles JJ. The tribunal has power to cure a defect in the delegate's decision once the tribunal's jurisdiction has been invoked by an application for review: Zubair 139 FCR at 354. A party affected will elect to treat an administrative decision as valid, though erroneous, by exercising the right to have it reviewed by a second administrative body, in preference to exercising a right to have a court compel proper performance by the original authority of its duty. Such an outcome promotes administrative efficiency, provided that the party applying for the review subsequently receives a fair hearing by the second body. In that way, any defects in the process by which the original decision was reached are cured by the later determination on the administrative review or administrative appeal: Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116 per Mason J.

That being so, although the Minister's delegate's decision has been validated by item 7, the tribunal is yet to perform its function of review of that decision in accordance with law. By applying to the tribunal before the 2008 amendment came into force, a person who then invoked a challenge to the Minister's or delegate's decision under s 501(2) elected to treat that decision as valid, though erroneous, and to have the tribunal exercise the power, in preference to challenging the decision in judicial review proceedings: Twist 136 CLR at 116 per Mason J. And the tribunal could have "cured" the defect in the delegate's decision by setting it aside: cf Zubair 139 FCR at 354. But the decision of the tribunal in respect of Mr Toro Martinez was given in respect of a different legal and factual scenario from that considered by the delegate and, because of Sales [2008] FCAFC 132 ; 171 FCR 56 , was no decision at all, being infected by jurisdictional error.</text>

<tocase>WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 ; (2004) 80 ALD 568</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/74.html</AustLII>
<text>In WAIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 74 ; (2004) 80 ALD 568 at 573-574 [22] Lee and Moore JJ noted the principle that observance of the requirement that the review procedure be carried out according to law was an irreducible duty. They said that the tribunal only obtained power to make a determination under the Act where its decision was based on findings or inferences of the facts grounded on probative material and logical grounds. It followed that a decision based on illogical or irrational findings or inferences of fact is a decision not supported by reason and is therefore invalid.</text>

<text>In reviewing an administrative decision the tribunal has to give the decision it considers to be the correct or preferable decision. That function must be performed independently of any instruction, advice or wish of the executive government, including in cases where government policy is a relevant factor for consideration and the powers of the tribunal are limited to affirming or recommending the reconsideration of the decisions of a Minister: Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs [1996] HCA 18 ; (1996) 189 CLR 1 at 17-18 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ, approving Re Becker and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1977) 1 ALD 58 at 163 per Brennan J as President of the Tribunal. The decision of the tribunal in the particular circumstances of each case must be arrived at according to its opinion as to the merits of that case.</text>

<text>Deeming provisions that do create fictions must be carefully construed. The purpose for which the legislature introduced the fiction must be identified by the Court: Muller v Dalgety &amp; Co Ltd [1909] HCA 67 ; (1909) 9 CLR 693 at 696 per Griffith CJ; Hunter Douglas Australia Pty Ltd v Perma Blinds (1970) 122 CLR 49 at 65 per Windeyer J; see too Redland Shire Council v Stradbroke Rutile Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 4 ; (1974) 133 CLR 641 at 655 per Gibbs J. The curative effect of legislative provisions using the statutory fictions created by phrases such as those used in item 7 will usually operate only on the source of invalidity identified in the enactment: cf: Yougarla v Western Australia [2001] HCA 47 ; (2001) 207 CLR 344 at 368 [60] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.</text>
