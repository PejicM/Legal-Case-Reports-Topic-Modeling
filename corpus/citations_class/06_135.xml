<tocase>Re Chilia Properties Pty Ltd, (admin apptd) (1997) 154 ALR 179</tocase>
<text>20 Senior counsel also submitted that there was no real conflict between the roles which Mr Herbert and Mr Read might have to perform as liquidators of the company and as provisional liquidators of Westpoint Management Pty Ltd. He submitted that the authorities are to the effect that it is desirable that where companies in a group go into liquidation, to the extent that it is possible to do so without there being a real conflict of interest, one liquidator should be appointed to the companies in liquidation. Mr Colvin SC relied upon the following observations of Lehane J in the case of Re Chilia Properties Pty Ltd, (admin apptd) (1997) 154 ALR 179 at 180 ('Chilia') :
 
 '...it is well established that in the absence of any real, as opposed to theoretical, conflict of interest it is generally desirable that the external administration of a group of companies should be placed in the hands of one administrator.'

21 Mr Colvin SC further submitted that, where there were dealings within a group of companies between companies that were under the effective control of the same persons, in assessing real conflict, a distinction should be drawn between dealings which affected the interests of external creditors and other external interests, and those which did not. Mr Colvin SC also submitted that it is well accepted that the courts would appoint a single liquidator to a group of companies, notwithstanding that there might be some possible theoretical conflict, on the basis that if a real conflict emerged during the course of the administration, that the liquidator could then make alternative arrangements as to how to deal with the real conflict. The fact that there might be a theoretical conflict should not be an inhibition on the appointment of a single liquidator.

22 Further, senior counsel for ASIC, submitted that a relevant consideration to be taken into account is the expressed position of the creditors. He said that the secured creditor, represented by the receivers and managers of the company and the Australian Taxation Office both supported the appointment of Mr Herbert and Mr Read as liquidators.

32 Firstly, I agree that the observations made by Lehane J in Chilia , referred to above, state the principles to be applied in this case. The principles are also reflected in the following observations by Hoffmann J (as he then was) in Re Arrows Ltd [1992] BCC 121, which were cited with approval by Warren J in Sisu Capital :
 
 '...It is by no means uncommon in the case of the insolvency of a substantial group of companies for cross-claims and conflicts of interest to arise between companies within the group. That does not usually deflect the court from appointing a single firm of insolvency practitioners in the first instance to deal with the whole insolvency of the group, leaving the question of potential conflict of interests to be dealt with if and when it arises.'</text>

<tocase>Sisu Capital Fund Ltd v Tucker [2005] EWHC 2170 (Ch)</tocase>
<text>26 Mr Thomson also referred to Sisu Capital Fund Ltd v Tucker [2005] EWHC 2170 (Ch) ('Sisu Capital') particularly at pars 103-115, of the judgment of Warren J, in support of the proposition that courts are not inhibited by the fact that there might be theoretical conflicts, where considering whether to appoint a single liquidator to a number of companies within a group of companies.

27 Mr Thomson made the similar arguments to those advanced by Mr Colvin SC against the proposition that because Mr Francis and Mr Ryan had already undertaken work in investigating the affairs of the company, it would be more efficient if they were appointed as the liquidators. He also submitted that if Mr Francis and Mr Ryan were appointed there might be some suspicion that they were not sufficiently independent of Mr Carey, because Mr Carey had appointed them to the position of administrators.

28 Mr Shaw, for North Sydney Finance and Emu Brewery Mezzanine, made submissions in support of the appointment of Mr Francis and Mr Ryan as liquidators.
