<text>The nature and history of the proceeding
 In a judgment delivered on 4 October 2007, Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd v Hahnheuser [2007] FCA 1535 (2007) 243 ALR 356 , I dismissed the application of both applicants in this proceeding. Each of the applicants claimed relief of a declaratory and injunctive nature, as well as damages, in respect of an alleged contravention by the respondent, Mr Hahnheuser, of s 45DB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Trade Practices Act "). When the proceeding was instituted, there was a second respondent, Animal Liberation SA Inc. I also dismissed by consent claims by both applicants against the second respondent, leaving Mr Hahnheuser as the only respondent. Both applicants' claims were in respect of a delay in the export of a shipment of live sheep from the Port of Portland aboard the MV Al Shuwaikh , destined for the Middle East. The delay occurred because Mr Hahnheuser, in concert with other people, entered a feedlot in which the sheep were held prior to being loaded on the vessel, and placed shredded ham in food and water containers, from which the sheep were intended to feed and drink. This caused a delay in the grant of a permit for the export of the sheep.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/156.html</AustLII>
<text>The Full Court in Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd v Hahnheuser [2008] FCAFC 156 (2008) 169 FCR 583 allowed an appeal from my judgment. The Full Court substituted for my orders dismissing the application with costs orders in the following terms: 
 (a) it be declared that on or about 18 and 19 November 2003 at Portland, Victoria, the first respondent, in concert with another person or persons, engaged in conduct for the purpose and which had the effect of preventing and substantially hindering the second applicant from engaging in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods on the vessel MV Al Shuwaikh, being a cargo of live sheep, between Australia and places outside Australia in the Middle East, in contravention of s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ; 

 
 (b) the first respondent pay the second applicant's costs. 

 
The Full Court also remitted the matter to me for further hearing "in accordance with these reasons."

In my reasons for judgment of 4 October 2007, at [37]-[45], I concluded that I was unable to say that the trade or commerce of the first applicant, Rural Export &amp; Trading (WA) Pty Ltd ("Rural Export") was hindered, whether substantially or otherwise. At [46]-[57], I came to the conclusion that the trade or commerce of Rural Export, particularly that of supplying feed to the sheep whilst they were in the feedlot, which ceased when the sheep were loaded onto trucks for carriage to the wharf, was not protected by s 45DB(1) of the Trade Practices Act . The appeal was conducted on the basis that, as I had found, the second applicant, Samex Australian Meat Co Pty Ltd ("Samex") was engaged in trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia, within the meaning of s 45DB(1). Rural Export did not press any separate argument. It therefore did not challenge my conclusions that its trade or commerce had not been hindered, and was not itself trade or commerce involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia. The Full Court did not find that my conclusions in those respects were in error. The terms of the declaration made by the Full Court are specific as to the trade or commerce that was hindered or prevented, namely the trade or commerce of the second applicant. At [5] of the Full Court's reasons for judgment, the Full Court said that, if Samex's appeal were to succeed, it would be necessary for me to consider Rural Export's claim under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act , for damages. At [43], the Full Court said: 
 Rural Export and Samex asked that if Samex succeeded the matter be remitted to the primary judge for determination of the questions of damages. The appeal should be allowed, a declaration should be made reflecting the fact that Mr Hahnheuser contravened s 45DB(1) and he should be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings below and on appeal.

I therefore act on the basis that the Full Court's order, remitting the case to me "for further hearing in accordance with these reasons" is an order remitting to me questions of damages in respect of the claims of both Rural Export and Samex.</text>

<tocase>Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 (1998) 196 CLR 494</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/69.html</AustLII>
<text>In Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 (1998) 196 CLR 494 at [95] Gummow J said: 
 Section 82 has at least five discrete elements. First, it identifies the legal norms for contravention of which the action under the section is given. Secondly, it identifies those by and against whom that action lies. Thirdly, the section specifies the injury for which the action lies as the suffering of loss or damage. Fourthly, it stipulates a causal requirement that the plaintiff's injury must be sustained "by" the contravention. Finally, the measure of compensation is "the amount of" the loss or damage sustained.

For present purposes, the crucial one of those five elements is the second, particularly the identification of the person by whom the claim for damages can be brought. That is a question on which there is remarkably little authority, except in the case of one application of the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act , found in s 52 and the following sections. In relation to the various provisions of Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act , which include s 45DB , I have been unable to find any case in which a person not directly affected by the proscribed conduct, but only affected by reason of conducting dealings with a person directly affected, has made a claim for damages, much less succeeded in one. Further, the principal authorities in which the High Court of Australia has pronounced upon the meaning and effect of s 82 of the Trade Practices Act have been concerned with questions of causation and the measure of damages, the fourth and fifth elements identified by Gummow J. That description applies to Marks itself, as well as to Wardley Australia Limited v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 , Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 (2001) 206 CLR 459 , I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 (2002) 210 CLR 109 and HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 (2004) 217 CLR 640. Care must be taken in applying statements made in the judgments in those cases, concerning the fourth or fifth elements identified by Gummow J, to a case concerning the second element, the identification of the person who is entitled to claim.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Milfull [2002] FCAFC 442</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/442.html</AustLII>
<text>The great majority of cases concerning claims for damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act have been cases brought in reliance on the provisions relating to misleading and deceptive conduct, particularly s 52 , which is found in Pt V of the Trade Practices Act . Those cases fall into two classes. The first class concerns claims by people to whom representations amounting to misleading and deceptive conduct have been made. In such cases, the principal issue is often that of reliance. The question is whether the recipient of the representations relied on the truth of them in acting to his or her detriment, and suffered damage. In the second class of cases, the person claiming is not the person to whom the representations have been made, but a competitor of the person making the representations. This class of cases appears to have developed by analogy with the tort of passing off. A competitor of the person engaging in the misleading and deceptive conduct is permitted to claim profits lost by reason of sales of the competitor's products being diverted to those who have relied on the representations, and been misled by them into purchasing the first person's products instead of the competitor's. The existence of this class of cases might be said to be consistent with the proposition that, in determining who is entitled to claim damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act , that section is to be construed literally, so that no limit is to be imposed on the classes of persons who can trace loss and damage to some contravention by the person they sue of any of the provisions of Pt IV or Pt V of the Trade Practices Act . This is not necessarily the case. There do not appear to have been cases in which the net has been cast any wider than the class of competitors in the quasi-passing off situation. For instance, there appears to be no case in which a supplier of materials to the competitor has claimed for diminution of profits on the basis that, because the competitor lost sales, it ordered from the supplier less by way of materials to manufacture its products than it would have otherwise have done. In addition, it appears from Harris v Milfull [2002] FCAFC 442 that the principles relating to claims by shareholders that are derivative of those by the corporation in which they hold shares apply in relation to claims in respect of misleading and deceptive conduct. If it were the case that s 82 of the Trade Practices Act should be read as placing no limits on the classes of persons who can claim, it would surely be read as permitting claims by the shareholders, without regard to the principles barring derivative claims.

With the single exception of the competitor category, relating to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and other related sections, I have been unable to find any case in which a party whose interest is not protected directly by a provision of Pt IV or Pt V of the Trade Practices Act has been held to be entitled to claim damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act as a result of a contravention of a provision in relation to another party's protected interest. With the possible exception of Harris v Milfull (referred to in [10] above), I have not been able to find a case in which such a party has attempted to claim. The category of competitors in relation to misleading and deceptive conduct can be regarded as exceptional, because of the analogy with the tort of passing off, rather than as representative of any principle that s 82 applies to entitle any person who can trace loss or damage to a contravention of one of the relevant provisions to claim damages. To hold that s 82 , in conjunction with a provision of Pt IV , has such a broad reach would be a pioneering step. Before taking it, careful consideration of a number of factors would be necessary. I did not have the benefit of full argument about those factors.</text>

<tocase>Janssen-Gilag Pty Limited v Pfizer Pty Limited [1992] FCA 437 ; (1992) 37 FCR 526</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/437.html</AustLII>
<text>One of the earliest cases in which a competitor of the person engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct was successful in claiming damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act is Janssen-Gilag Pty Limited v Pfizer Pty Limited [1992] FCA 437 ; (1992) 37 FCR 526. In dealing with s 82 , Lockhart J said at 529-530: 
 Section 82 is the vehicle for the recovery of loss or damage for multifarious forms of contravention of the provisions of Pts IV and V of the Act. It is important that rules laid down by the courts to govern entitlement to damages under s 82 are not unduly rigid, since the ambit of activities that may cause contraventions of the diverse provisions of Pts IV and V is large and the circumstances in which damage therefrom may arise will vary considerably from case to case. 

 
 What emerges from an analysis of the cases (and there are many of them) is that they do not impose some general requirement that damage can be recovered only where the applicant himself relies upon the conduct of the respondent constituting the contravention of the relevant provision. 

 
 Also, a perusal of the provisions of Pts IV and V, the contravention of which gives rise to an entitlement to an applicant for compensation for loss or damage, points to the conclusion that applicants may claim compensation when the contravener's conduct caused other persons to act in a way that led to loss or damage to the applicant. Examples are s 46 which concerns the misuse of market power by corporations; s 47 relating to the practice of exclusive dealing; also s 48 which is concerned with resale price maintenance. As to s 47(1) and (6) relating to third line forcing see Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams and Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 72 ; (1986) 162 CLR 395 (High Court) and (1985) 7 FCR 509 (Full Federal Court). See Hubbards Pty Ltd v Simpson Ltd [1982] FCA 57 ; (1982) 60 FLR 430 and [1982] FCA 210 ; (1983) 69 FLR 392 (on appeal) with respect to s 48. See also Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1987) 18 IR 355 where contraventions of s 45 of the Act were involved and they concerned contracts, arrangements or understandings or restrictive dealings which adversely affected competition.</text>

As to s 47(1) and (6) relating to third line forcing see Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams and Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 72 ; (1986) 162 CLR 395 (High Court) and (1985) 7 FCR 509 (Full Federal Court). See Hubbards Pty Ltd v Simpson Ltd [1982] FCA 57 ; (1982) 60 FLR 430 and [1982] FCA 210 ; (1983) 69 FLR 392 (on appeal) with respect to s 48. See also Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1987) 18 IR 355 where contraventions of s 45 of the Act were involved and they concerned contracts, arrangements or understandings or restrictive dealings which adversely affected competition.

It is by no means clear that the cases to which his Honour referred support the proposition that an applicant may claim compensation when the contravener's conduct caused other persons to act in a way that led to loss or damage to the applicant. Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams &amp; Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 72 ; (1986) 162 CLR 395 , to which his Honour referred, was a claim in respect of alleged exclusive dealing, because a brewery insisted on deliveries to the premises of its retail customers being conducted by its nominated carrier. As the report of the case in the Full Court of this Court in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams &amp; Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 509 demonstrates, the party claiming damages was itself a transport company, ie one of the very parties excluded by the alleged exclusive dealing requirement. (On appeal in Castlemaine Tooheys , the High Court held that no contravention of s 47 of the Trade Practices Act occurred.) The case did not test, for instance, whether a retailer of beer who insisted on using an excluded transport company for its deliveries would be entitled to claim damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act . Hubbards Pty Ltd v Simpson Ltd [1982] FCA 57 ; (1982) 60 FLR 430 and Simpson Ltd v Hubbard Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 210 ; (1982) 69 FLR 392 involved a claim in respect of resale price maintenance, brought by the very dealer whose resale prices the contravening party had attempted to maintain. It did not test the question whether, for instance, a customer of a dealer whose prices had been forced up by a third party engaging in resale price maintenance could sue the contravener directly for loss suffered by the customer. Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1987) 18 IR 355 was a case in which the applicant was the party against whom the primary boycott was mounted, in contravention of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act . That case did not test the question whether a customer of the party boycotted would have been entitled to claim damages from the boycotting parties in respect of its loss of profits through being unable to obtain supplies from the boycotted party.</text>

Hubbards Pty Ltd v Simpson Ltd [1982] FCA 57 ; (1982) 60 FLR 430 and Simpson Ltd v Hubbard Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 210 ; (1982) 69 FLR 392 involved a claim in respect of resale price maintenance, brought by the very dealer whose resale prices the contravening party had attempted to maintain. It did not test the question whether, for instance, a customer of a dealer whose prices had been forced up by a third party engaging in resale price maintenance could sue the contravener directly for loss suffered by the customer. Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1987) 18 IR 355 was a case in which the applicant was the party against whom the primary boycott was mounted, in contravention of s 45 of the Trade Practices Act . That case did not test the question whether a customer of the party boycotted would have been entitled to claim damages from the boycotting parties in respect of its loss of profits through being unable to obtain supplies from the boycotted party.</text>

<text>One of the earliest cases in which a competitor of the person engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct was successful in claiming damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act is Janssen-Gilag Pty Limited v Pfizer Pty Limited [1992] FCA 437 ; (1992) 37 FCR 526. In dealing with s 82 , Lockhart J said at 529-530: 
 Section 82 is the vehicle for the recovery of loss or damage for multifarious forms of contravention of the provisions of Pts IV and V of the Act. It is important that rules laid down by the courts to govern entitlement to damages under s 82 are not unduly rigid, since the ambit of activities that may cause contraventions of the diverse provisions of Pts IV and V is large and the circumstances in which damage therefrom may arise will vary considerably from case to case. 

 
 What emerges from an analysis of the cases (and there are many of them) is that they do not impose some general requirement that damage can be recovered only where the applicant himself relies upon the conduct of the respondent constituting the contravention of the relevant provision. 

 
 Also, a perusal of the provisions of Pts IV and V, the contravention of which gives rise to an entitlement to an applicant for compensation for loss or damage, points to the conclusion that applicants may claim compensation when the contravener's conduct caused other persons to act in a way that led to loss or damage to the applicant. Examples are s 46 which concerns the misuse of market power by corporations; s 47 relating to the practice of exclusive dealing; also s 48 which is concerned with resale price maintenance. As to s 47(1) and (6) relating to third line forcing see Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams and Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 72 ; (1986) 162 CLR 395 (High Court) and (1985) 7 FCR 509 (Full Federal Court). See Hubbards Pty Ltd v Simpson Ltd [1982] FCA 57 ; (1982) 60 FLR 430 and [1982] FCA 210 ; (1983) 69 FLR 392 (on appeal) with respect to s 48. See also Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1987) 18 IR 355 where contraventions of s 45 of the Act were involved and they concerned contracts, arrangements or understandings or restrictive dealings which adversely affected competition.

It is by no means clear that the cases to which his Honour referred support the proposition that an applicant may claim compensation when the contravener's conduct caused other persons to act in a way that led to loss or damage to the applicant. Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams &amp; Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 72 ; (1986) 162 CLR 395 , to which his Honour referred, was a claim in respect of alleged exclusive dealing, because a brewery insisted on deliveries to the premises of its retail customers being conducted by its nominated carrier. As the report of the case in the Full Court of this Court in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v Williams &amp; Hodgson Transport Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 509 demonstrates, the party claiming damages was itself a transport company, ie one of the very parties excluded by the alleged exclusive dealing requirement. (On appeal in Castlemaine Tooheys , the High Court held that no contravention of s 47 of the Trade Practices Act occurred.)

<tocase>Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk (No. 2) [2005] FCA 1307</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1307.html</AustLII>
<text>One of the important factors must be the purpose of the legislation. In my reasons for judgment published on 4 October 2007, at [46]-[57], I discussed the question whether the trade and commerce of Rural Export was trade and commerce "involving the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia". I reached the conclusion that it was not. In doing so, I followed the views expressed by Hely J in Australian Wool Innovation Ltd v Newkirk (No. 2) [2005] FCA 1307 , and relied on the passages from the parliamentary debates, on which his Honour relied at [60]-[61]. It is unnecessary to set out again the passages from the parliamentary debates. They lead to the conclusion, which Hely J adopted and I followed, that s 45DB of the Trade Practices Act is directed very specifically at the protection of a narrow form of trade or commerce, namely that of which the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia is a part. On appeal in the present case, the Full Court did not say anything to suggest that this view is incorrect. If Rural Export, whose trade and commerce does not involve the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia, were entitled to recover damages, the result would be to expand dramatically the nature of the trade or commerce protected by s 45DB. This would be beyond the purpose of the legislation, as discerned by Hely J and by me, based on the relevant extrinsic materials. Such an extension would mean that trade or commerce not involving the relevant movement of goods would be protected, simply by reason of the existence of another party in respect of whom a contravention had occurred, and whose trade and commerce did involve the movement of goods between Australia and places outside Australia. Such an extension of protection is not warranted by the terms of s 82(1) of the Trade Practices Act , given the limited protection afforded by s 45DB.

For these reasons, Rural Export is not entitled to recover damages in the present proceeding, because its trade or commerce is not itself protected by s 45DB of the Trade Practices Act . It is unnecessary to deal with the question whether the finding that Rural Export's trade or commerce was not hindered or prevented (a finding also not overturned by the Full Court) would also lead to the conclusion that Rural Export is not entitled to damages. Rural Export's claimed loss and damage

In case I am wrong in the conclusion I have expressed in [15] above, I turn to the evidence in relation to loss and damage suffered by Rural Export.</text>
