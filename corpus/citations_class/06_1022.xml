<tocase>NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184</tocase>

<text>Secondly, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal failed to invite him to appear before it, and, therefore, proceeded in breach of s 425(1) of the Act. As I have said, the Tribunal forwarded the letter dated 24 August 2005 containing the invitation to a hearing to the appellant's address for service. However, the Magistrate appears to have accepted the appellant's evidence to the effect that he had used a friend's address as his address for service. The friend had moved from that address and did not tell the appellant or the Tribunal. By the time the appellant found out about this and went to collect his mail, it was too late. The Magistrate held that the Tribunal had complied with s 441A of the Act and that there could be no jurisdictional error based merely on the appellant's failure to receive a notice. He referred to NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184.

The Magistrate's conclusion was that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision within s 474 of the Act and that there was no jurisdictional error. He therefore dismissed the application.

In essence, other than an impermissible challenge to the merits of the decision made by the delegate and then the Tribunal, the appellant submitted on appeal that the Magistrate had erred in rejecting the two grounds upon which he challenged the Tribunal's decision.

As to the second ground of challenge, that also must fail. The evidence establishes that the Tribunal complied with the service provisions in s 441A(4) of the Act and therefore the provisions of ss 425 and 425A. The fact that the arrangement between the appellant and his friend broke down and the appellant did not receive the letter from the Tribunal dated 24 August 2004 until it was too late is of no consequence in terms of the Tribunal's obligation and the question whether there had been a failure to comply with the Act which vitiates the decision: NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra) per Tamberlin, Sackville and Hely JJ at [16]. The Tribunal complied with the provisions of the Act and was entitled to proceed to make a decision on the review: VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407.</text>

<text>As to the first ground of challenge, I see no error in the reasoning of the Magistrate. What the Tribunal member emphasised was the lack of information. On the authorities, that is not information within the terms of s 424A(1)(a): VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (supra) per Finn and Stone JJ at [24]; SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238. It is no more than the Tribunal's subjective appraisal of the material before it.</text>

<text>The appellant lodged an application with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia under s 476 of the Act. He challenged the Tribunal's decision on two grounds. First, he submitted that the Tribunal had not given to him particulars of information that it considered would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that was under review within the provisions of s 424A(1) of the Act. The Magistrate rejected that submission on the ground that the reason for the Tribunal's decision was the inadequacy of the material provided to the Tribunal, and inadequacy of a claim is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the Act. The Magistrate said that inadequacy of information is no more than a subjective appraisal by the Tribunal about the material provided and a subjective appraisal of the material does not constitute information for the purpose of s 424A. The Magistrate referred to VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 and SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195.</text>
