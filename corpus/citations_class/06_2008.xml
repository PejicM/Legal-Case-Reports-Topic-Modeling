<tocase>Croker v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 127 ; (2005) 145 FCR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/127.html</AustLII>
<text>2 The Commissioner issued three bankruptcy notices against Mr Croker. Mr Croker challenged these notices in the Federal Court and was successful in having each set aside. One such notice was set aside by the Full Federal Court because it was founded upon an award of costs by the High Court of Australia, for which a judgment debt could not be validly registered in a local court: see Croker v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 226. The second notice was set aside because the amount claimed was greater than the original award of costs against Mr Croker, since it included costs of registration of the judgment and interest: see Croker v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 127 ; (2005) 145 FCR 150. The third notice was set aside by consent because it included two judgments in the same notice, contrary to legislative requirements.

11. The Respondent well knew or should have well known that the commissions of bankruptcy and affidavit's [sic] in support of those commissions of bankruptcy therefore were made, falsely and maliciously and without reason and probable cause. 
 
 

7 Mr Croker also alleges that the Commissioner has violated the Constitution (see pars 12 and 13), that the Commissioner has violated Mr Croker's constitutional right to procedural fairness (see pars 14-17), and that this involves a tortious interference with Mr Croker's constitutional rights (pars 19-21). Mr Croker says that he has exhausted his extra-judicial remedies in relation to the conduct of the Commissioner and asks the Court to provide redress for the tortious interference with his constitutional rights.
 THE COMMISSIONER'S SUBMISSIONS 
 
8 The Commissioner submits that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear Mr Croker's claims. Whilst the Mr Croker alleges Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and the Constitution , the Commissioner submits that these statutes do not confer jurisdiction upon the Federal Court to grant the relief sought. 
 
9 Alternatively, the Commissioner submits that the proceedings should be struck out on the basis that they constitute an abuse of process, that they fail to disclose any reasonable cause of action, and have a tendency to cause embarrassment. The Commissioner submits that these proceedings re-agitate issues which were raised in the earlier proceedings relating to the bankruptcy notices, namely the entitlement of the Commissioner to issue the bankruptcy notices and a claim by Mr Croker for damages in relation to defective administration: see Croker v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 127 ; (2005) 145 FCR 150 at [19] - [20] . The Commissioner submits these proceedings are accordingly an abuse of process.
 
10 The Commissioner submits that no cause of action is contained in Mr Croker's application. In particular, no duty of care is identified, nor are details of the content of any such duty provided, nor is there any assertion of a breach of duty or details of damage sustained by Mr Croker. The Commissioner refers to the two possible causes of action which are suggested the Mr Croker's application, namely the tort of malicious prosecution and the tort of misfeasance in public office. The Commissioner states that a tort of malicious prosecution could not be made out because there have been no proceedings instituted by the Commissioner against Mr Croker. In relation to any tort of misfeasance in public office, the statement of claim and affidavits of the applicant do not contain the material facts upon which such a suit must be founded.
 
11 In respect of embarrassment, the Commissioner submits that the entire pleading is embarrassing and confusing. The Commissioner refers to the terminology contained in the statement of claim such as "violation of the Constitution ", "violation of right to procedural due process protected by the Constitution " and "exhaustion of administrative remedies".</text>

<tocase>Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/48.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The Federal Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. Pursuant to s 19 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , the Court only has jurisdiction where the Parliament has specifically conferred jurisdiction upon the Court (see Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150) or where the accrued or associated jurisdiction of the Court arises.

21 Mr Croker's claim against the Commissioner is based in tort. He has variously relied upon the Constitution , the Bankruptcy Act , the Judiciary Act and the common law as the basis of the Court's jurisdiction.

22 Section 56 of the Judiciary Act , on which Mr Croker relied, provides as follows:
 
 
 '(1) A person making a claim against the Commonwealth, whether in contract or in tort, may in respect of the claim bring a suit against the Commonwealth: 
 (a) in the High Court; 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the claim arose in a State or Territory--in the Supreme Court of that State or Territory or in any other court of competent jurisdiction of that State or Territory; or 
 (c) if the claim did not arise in a State or Territory--in the Supreme Court of any State or Territory or in any other court of competent jurisdiction of any State or Territory. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last preceding subsection: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) any court exercising jurisdiction at any place in the capital city of a State, or in the principal or only city or town of a Territory, that would be competent to hear the suit if the Commonwealth were, or had at any time been, resident in that city or town, or in a particular area in that city or town, is a court of competent jurisdiction; and 
 (b) any other court is not a court of competent jurisdiction if its competence to hear the suit would depend upon the place where the Commonwealth resides or carries on business or at any time resided or carried on business.'</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1985) 7 FCR 109</tocase>
<text>28 Further, the Court considers that Mr Croker's application and statement of claim do not disclose any reasonable cause of action. The elements of a cause of action in tort, either of malicious prosecution or of misfeasance in public office, are not pleaded in his application. Pleadings must contain a statement of the material facts relied upon to support the cause of action: O 11 r 2 FCR. In Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd &amp; Ors (1985) 7 FCR 109, Fisher J considered a motion for strike out of a statement of claim. His Honour said at 114:
 
 Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim does not state any material facts. It is merely a statement of a conclusion drawn from facts which are not in the statement of claim. Standing alone, par 15 does not disclose a reasonable cause of action against the respondents. Furthermore all of the authorities abovementioned very clearly indicate that material facts set out in the particulars can not be used to make good the deficiencies in the statement of claim.</text>

<tocase>Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/12.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In my opinion, Mr Croker's application and statement of claim in the present case are in a similar position. Although it sets out conclusions, for example with respect to the motivation of the Commissioner of Taxation in issuing the bankruptcy notices, it does not state the facts upon which those conclusions are based. The application and statement of claim do not contain the material facts on which the claim is made, and therefore do not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The application as pleaded could not be sustained. In Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378, the majority of the High Court observed:
 
 '... it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail.'

30 Accordingly, even if the Court did have jurisdiction to hear these claims, the Court would strike out the pleadings under O 11 r 16 of the FCR.

31 For the reasons set out above, the Court will dismiss Mr Croker's application on the basis that the Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. In the circumstances, costs of the application and of the Commissioner's motion should be awarded in favour of the Commissioner.</text>
