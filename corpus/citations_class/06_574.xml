<text>13 In The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, the joint judgment of Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ cited with approval (at 152-153) a passage from the judgment of Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700, at 710, as follows:
 
 'Now, I think it is a well established principle that the object of Courts is to decide the rights of the parties, and not to punish them for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. Speaking for myself, and in conformity with what I have heard laid down by the other division of the Court of Appeal and by myself as a member of it, I know of no kind of error or mistake which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the Court ought not to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding matters in controversy, and I do not regard such amendment as a matter of favour or of grace.'

14 The joint judgment in J L Holdings emphasised (at 154) that the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice and that no principle of case management can supplant that aim. The latter comment reflected the fact that in J L Holdings itself, the application for leave to amend pleadings had been refused by the trial Judge some six months before the hearing was due to commence. The application to amend in the present case has been made towards the end of the hearing in an extraordinarily long and complex case.

15 If leave could be granted to Seven to amend para 222 without causing significant prejudice to Optus and the other respondents, I would grant the necessary leave, even at this late stage of the proceedings. I would do so notwithstanding the absence of an explanation on affidavit as to the reason for Seven's failure until now to plead the retail minus formula. The critical question, therefore, is whether the amendment, if made, will occasion significant prejudice to the respondents in the conduct of the trial.

16 Mr Sheahan submitted that the amendment would cause no significant prejudice to the respondents because they have in fact addressed the question of whether Optus was an effective competitor on price and quality, both in relation to the period before and the period after the CSA. According to Mr Sheahan, there is no further factual inquiry that the respondents could make that has not already arisen on the pleadings. He pointed out, for example, that Optus' expert, Professor Hausman, adverted in his report to the fact that Foxtel and Optus now offer 'essentially the same product for which Optus pays a licence fee determined by reference to Foxtel's retail price'. Mr Sheahan also directed attention to the fact that one of Seven's competition experts, Professor Noll, referred in his report to the retail minus formula as eliminating the possibility of price competition between Foxtel and Optus where their services overlap.</text>
