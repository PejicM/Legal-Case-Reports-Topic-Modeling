<text>The concept of authorisation was discussed in Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 ; (2006) 156 FCR 380 at [20] (p 385) (per Branson J) and at [136] [147] (pp 408 411) (per Kenny J).

After reviewing a number of authorities which, by 2006, were largely of historical significance, Kenny J approached the question of authorisation by applying the terms of s 101(1A) construed in light of the historical position. Her Honour held that it is usually not a straightforward matter for the Court to determine what degree of control can constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of authorisation ( Cooper [2006] FCAFC 187 ; 156 FCR 380 at [142] (p 410)). Her Honour said that it will always be a question of fact and degree in each case. Even mere inactivity or indifference might be sufficient if those things are coupled with other factors.

There is not a great deal of evidence directed to the position of the second respondent. However, he has not appeared to defend himself against the allegations made against him. His involvement with the first and fourth respondents cannot be denied (as to which see [43] [45] above). It is reasonable, I think, in the circumstances, for me to conclude that he played a significant role in the conduct of the fourth respondent which resulted in the unlawful transmission of Episode 5 of Twin of Brothers . He seems to be the most senior executive active in the business of the fourth respondent. In the circumstances, I am prepared to infer that the second respondent authorised the infringement by the fourth respondent which I have found. I do so bearing in mind the terms of s 101(1A) and the observations of the Full Court in Cooper [2006] FCAFC 187 ; 156 FCR 380.

It also seems to me that the second respondent participated in a common design with others whereby TVBO's copyright in the Twin of Brothers films was infringed.

For the above reasons, I am prepared to make the orders sought as against the second and fourth respondents. There will be orders accordingly.
 I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Foster.
