<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216</tocase>
<text>The definition of the scheme is important, since any tax benefit identified must be related to the scheme, as must any conclusion of dominant purpose and the ultimate determination by the Commissioner ( Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216 at [5]). The definition in s 177A is wide, but it must be related to the tax benefit obtained ( Hart at [9]). On the other hand, scheme is defined in s 177A(1) in terms that may not always permit the precise identification of what are said to be all of the integers of a particular scheme. The definition encompasses not only a series of steps that together can be said to constitute a scheme or a plan but also the taking of but one step. The very breadth of the definition is consistent with the objective nature of the enquiries that are to be made under Part IVA ( Hart at [43]). The bare fact that a taxpayer pays less tax, if one form of transaction rather than another is made, or simply to show that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit does not demonstrate that Part IVA applies. Thus, it is necessary to read Part IVA in a way that will not bring ordinary transactions to tax. Of course, the significance of such a proposition depends upon what is meant by ordinary ( Hart at [53]).

The question is whether that which the Commissioner has identified as the scheme falls within the definition in s 177A. That is to say, it is necessary to determine whether all of the steps leading to and the entering into and the implementation of the disposal of the 9 Wills Brands by the Taxpayer to Rothmans can be understood as together constituting a scheme. The question is whether those steps constituted a scheme, plan or course of action ( Hart at [55]).

The essence of the scheme identified by the Commissioner is the disposal of the 9 Wills Brands by the Taxpayer to Rothmans and their subsequent disposal by Rothmans to the Imperial Group, coupled with the exercise of the rollover choice by the Taxpayer and Rothmans, and the utilisation by Rothmans of losses in the Rothmans Group. That is to be contrasted with the counterfactual hypothesis, of a disposal of the 9 Wills Brands by the Taxpayer directly to the Imperial Group with the consequence that the Taxpayer's capital gain would be the income of the Taxpayer.

The negotiations between BAT UK and Imperial culminated in the execution of the Term Sheet on 30 April 1999. The arrangements covered by the Term Sheet included the disposal of the 9 Wills Brands. Although the arrangement was conditional upon, inter alia , the completion of the merger and took account of the possibility of changes in the identity of the relevant vendors and purchasers, there was no legal or commercial reason why the 9 Wills Brands could not have been disposed of by the Taxpayer directly to Imperial's subsidiaries rather than being disposed of to Rothmans and then disposed of by Rothmans to Imperial's subsidiaries, as happened.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Limited [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404</tocase>

<text>The first factor contemplated by s 177D(b) is the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out. This factor examines the way in which and the method or procedure by which the scheme was established, entered into and carried out (see Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Limited [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 420). The factor invites consideration of surrounding circumstances. The Taxpayer says that the lack of control that the Taxpayer and other relevant entities had over the disposition of the Australian brands is illustrated by the fact that Imperial could have selected predominantly Rothmans brands. In such a case, there would have been no suggestion of a tax benefit. However, as I have said, once Imperial had chosen the 9 Wills Brands, there is no reason why the Taxpayer could not have transferred or disposed of those brands direct to Imperial or its subsidiaries.

The second factor is the form and substance of the scheme. The Taxpayer asserts that the form and substance of the scheme as identified do not diverge. Rather, both are squarely aimed at achieving the merger through the re-organisation of the two groups and the disposal of Australian brands to Imperial. Again, however, the Taxpayer's contentions ignore the basic proposition that the merger and the disposition could have been achieved in a different fashion and there was no commercial imperative that required the disposal of the 9 Wills Brands to Imperial subsidiaries to be effected through Rothmans.

The third factor is the time at which the scheme was entered into and the length of the period during which the scheme was carried out. The Taxpayer contends that the timing of the scheme was dictated entirely by the requirements of the global and Australian merger, particularly the timing of regulatory, shareholder and court approvals. It says that the timing and duration point towards the purpose of achieving the merger. That must be so in so far as the object of disposition to Imperial was to facilitate the merger. However, the timing of the disposition by the Taxpayer to Rothmans was critical to achieving the tax benefit.</text>
