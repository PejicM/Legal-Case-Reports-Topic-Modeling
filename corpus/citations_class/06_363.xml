 RESPONDENT 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 31 MARCH 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

6 The prime ground on which senior counsel for Darrell Lea argued against the admissibility of the affidavits was that much of Dr Gibbs' opinions were based on market research reports and the like which had not been proved in evidence and were not likely to be proved. Reliance was placed on the well known passage from the judgment of Heydon JA in Makita Australia Pty Ltd v Sprowles Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 305 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [85] which includes the following:
 
 "...so far as the opinion is based on facts 'observed' by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on 'assumed' or 'accepted' facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way."

7 However, I accept the submission of senior counsel for Cadbury that this aspect of Makita has not been followed in the Federal Court. The lack of proof of a substantial part of the factual basis of Dr Gibbs' opinions does not of itself render his evidence inadmissible under s 79. Such lack of proof merely goes to the weight which may be given to the opinion: Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [16] (Branson J) and at [87] (Weinberg and Dowsett JJ), Neowarra v Western Australia (No 1) (2006) FCR 208 at [16],[21]-[27] (Sundberg J), Jango v Northern Territory (No 4) (2004) 214 ALR 608 at [19] (Sackville J). This line of authority is consistent with the earlier High Court common law decision in Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649.</text>

 APPLICANT AND: DARRELL LEA CHOCOLATE SHOPS PTY LTD 
 RESPONDENT 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 31 MARCH 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

8 Nonetheless, Dr Gibbs' evidence is inadmissible because, in the words of Lawton LJ in R v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841, 
 
 "An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury."

11 In other words, the Turner rule, adopted in Murphy, is a separate requirement. Even if a proffered opinion is that of a person suitably qualified within an organized area of knowledge, if that area is not outside the experience of ordinary persons, the opinion will not be admissible. As will be seen, there are good policy reasons for this distinction.</text>

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

10 As Ligertwood says ( Australian Evidence , 4 th ed, 2004, at 494) s 79 has been construed in a way "very close to the common law approach". The learned author cites a statement of Gaudron J in Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4 ; (2002) 187 ALR 233, a case governed by the New South Wales equivalent of s 79 , where her Honour said (emphasis added):
 
 "The concept of 'specialised knowledge' imports knowledge of matters which are outside the knowledge or experience of ordinary persons and which 'is sufficiently organized or recognized to be accepted as a reliable body of knowledge'".</text>

1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

13 A similar conclusion has been reached in England ( Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527) and Ireland ( Symonds Cider &amp; English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] IEHC 1 at [20] ). In the words of Blackburne J in Dalgety, opinion evidence will not be admissible where "...the experience which a judge must be taken to possess as an ordinary shopper or consumer will enable him, just as well as any other, to assess the likelihood of confusion."</text>

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

13 A similar conclusion has been reached in England ( Dalgety Spillers Foods Ltd v Food Brokers Ltd [1994] FSR 504 at 527) and Ireland ( Symonds Cider &amp; English Wine Company Ltd v Showerings (Ireland) Ltd [1997] IEHC 1 at [20] ). In the words of Blackburne J in Dalgety, opinion evidence will not be admissible where "...the experience which a judge must be taken to possess as an ordinary shopper or consumer will enable him, just as well as any other, to assess the likelihood of confusion."</text>

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

14 The same conclusion is also reached by another route. In Transport Publishing Co Pty Ltd v The Literature Board of Review [1956] HCA 73 ; (1956) 99 CLR 111 at 119 Dixon CJ, Kitto and Taylor JJ said
 
 "...it may be said at once that ordinary human nature, that of people at large, is not a subject of proof by evidence, whether supposedly expert or not."

15 As to this, senior counsel for Cadbury submitted:
 
 "We are certainly not intending to lead evidence of ordinary human nature but the field of expertise or the area of science which is described as behavioural science is certainly a field of expertise and not a matter of proving ordinary human nature."

16 But with respect, the whole raison d'&ecirc;tre of Dr Gibbs' evidence is to attempt to persuade the Court what ordinary human nature will lead people to do when making purchasing decisions about Darrell Lea chocolates, given the respective packaging, advertising etc of that firm and Cadbury. As the very name of Dr Gibbs' discipline conveys, he is concerned with the science of human behaviour. That is without doubt an area of specialized knowledge. But Transport Publishing says that ordinary human behaviour is not a matter to be proved in courts by opinion evidence, whether expert or otherwise.

17 In Transport Publishing (loc cit) their Honours go on to say that "particular descriptions of persons may conceivably form the subject of study and special knowledge". Examples given are persons who are "abnormal in mentality or abnormal in behaviour as a result of circumstances peculiar to their history or situation". Likewise, the manner in which people pursuing a special vocation would reason about a matter of business may be the subject of evidence. An example is that of persons skilled in marine insurance who can give evidence as to the materiality of a non-disclosure. Their Honours then say:
 
 "But before opinion evidence may be given upon the characteristics, responses or behaviour of any special category of persons, it must be shown they form a subject of special study or knowledge and only the opinions of one qualified by special training or experience may be received."

18 The second part of that passage of course is echoed in s 79. However, it is clear that this second condition of admissibility assumes that the first has been satisfied, that is to say that the evidence concerns a "special category of persons".

22 The present case is concerned with the brand names, colours and get-up of rival manufacturers of chocolate, and the likely effect of those features on retail purchasing decisions by consumers. Chocolate is an inexpensive, everyday product sold in hundreds of thousands of retail outlets throughout this country. Virtually the whole of the Australian population over the age of about eight years are purchasers or potential purchasers. In no way can consumers of chocolate be considered as a "special category of persons" within the meaning of the Transport Publishing rule. The questions thrown up by this case are quintessentially questions of fact within the experience and knowledge of a trier of fact.</text>

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

19 In Cat Media Pty Ltd v Opti-Healthcare Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 133 at [55] in the context of a s 52 and passing off case, Branson J, after noting that both sides had called evidence of marketing consultants which was received without objection, said
 
 "However, I consider it appropriate to record that in the particular circumstances of this case, which is concerned with the packaging of a product intended to appeal to a wide segment of the general public, I have found the expert evidence of no real assistance. This is not only because there is, as is common in cases of this kind, conflict between the evidence of the two experts. It seems to me that evidence of opinions based on market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour will rarely be of assistance in litigation where the Court's primary concern is with the behaviour to be expected of, and the judgments likely to be made by, ordinary (even if it might be thought, somewhat credulous) members of the community intent on making a relatively modest purchase in a conventional way. I endorse the comment of Beaumont J in Pacific Publications Pty Ltd v IPC Media Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 104 at [92] that where a claim is essentially a matter for the Court's impression, expert views which are merely `impressionistic' can be given no more than nominal weight. These observations are not intended in any way to belittle the importance of market research and expert appreciation of consumer behaviour in other types of cases and for other purposes."

23 Senior counsel for Cadbury referred to the assistance he said I could receive from Dr Gibbs' evidence and how it could be helpful. Without wishing to seem ungrateful, or disrespectful to Dr Gibbs, I think the evidence would not be helpful at all. Rather, it would create many areas of disputation with opposing experts and greatly complicate and lengthen the trial of this proceeding. The observations of Branson J in Cat Media are very much in point.

24 I rule that the affidavits of Dr Gibbs are not admissible. Were they admissible, I would exercise the discretion under s 135 to refuse to admit them.

25 Much of the factual material relied on by Dr Gibbs is not in evidence, or likely to be in evidence, or is vague, tendentious and of little weight. As acknowledged above, such matters go to weight rather than admissibility, but by the same token are relevant in considering probative value for the purposes of s 135.</text>

 RULING 
 

 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging contravention of ss 52 , 53 (c) and 53 (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off constituted by Darrell Lea's use in its chocolate confectionary business of "the colour Cadbury purple or any colour bearing a striking and obvious likeness to the colour Cadbury purple".

20 In Domain Names Australia Pty Ltd v .au Domain Administration Ltd [2004] FCAFC 247 ; (2004) 139 FCR 215 at [21] , a Full Court of this Court cited the above passage with approval and continued:
 
 "22 Consideration of these difficulties shows the practical wisdom of the firm rule that the likelihood of conduct being misleading or deceptive is a question for the tribunal of fact and not for any witness to decide: General Electric Co v General Electric Co Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 729 at 738 per Lord Diplock, applied in a s 52 context by Gummow J, with whom Black CJ and Lockhart J agreed, in Interlego AG v Croner Trader Pty Ltd (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 387. 
 
 23 Lord Diplock points out (ibid) that a different rule applies in the case of sales not to the general public but in specialised markets concerning persons engaged in a particular trade. In the present case the relevant market is that in which the consumers are business users of domain names. Such users constitute large sections of the public and are not participants in a specialised market in the sense discussed by Lord Diplock."

21 In JD Heydon's Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) the learned author says at 930:
 
 "If the court comes to the conclusion that the subject of investigation does not require a sufficient degree of specialised knowledge to call for the testimony of an expert, evidence of opinion will generally be excluded, especially where the witness is produced merely to present in a cogent and vivid form the case of the party calling that witness. The danger of this evidence is that it dresses up matters which are within the ordinary experience of the tribunal of fact in a beguiling scientific garb which may conceal the blemishes within."</text>
