<tocase>Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>16 In SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 which applied the decision of the Full Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 the Court held that a Tribunal is not obliged to put to an applicant its own appraisals of the applicant's evidence unless they are not an obvious and natural appraisal of such material. The meaning of natural and obvious in this context has been considered in numerous decisions: see Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1991) 31 FCR 100 at 108. In Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Affairs); Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [86] Kirby J said:
 
 The extent of the duty to indicate a relevant piece of apparently adverse evidence for comment obviously depends upon the importance that may be attached to that evidence and whether the importance was so obvious that it did not need to be underlined. In a body proceeding by inquisitorial methods, procedural fairness may require bringing the attention of the applicant to critical facts that appear to contradict, or cast doubt on, his or her claim. Where an observation about an applicant's case is one that is obvious and natural to the circumstances that evoked it, it is usually unnecessary for it to be specifically called to notice. 

 For similar observations, see Pilbara Aboriginal Land Council Aboriginal Corporation Inc v Minister for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Affairs [2000] FCA 1113 ; (2000) 103 FCR 539 at 557 and Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 633. Further the Tribunal is not required to give the appellant a running commentary of its reasons: see SZBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 834 at [11] .</text>

<text>26 The findings of the Tribunal in relation to the summons and verdict documents were available to it on the basis of the comprehensive findings it had made concerning its lack of satisfaction of the appellant's credibility and the truthfulness of his claims. The High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [12] per Gleeson CJ said:
 
 It is not necessarily irrational, or illogical, for a finder of fact, who is convinced that a principal witness is fabricating a story, which is considered to be inherently implausible, to reject corroborative evidence, even though there is no separate or independent ground for its rejection, apart from the reasons given for disbelieving the principal witness.

27 The fact that the Tribunal stated that it did not give weight to the documents ' based on the findings above ', that is, the Tribunal's findings as to the lack of credibility of the appellant, does not constitute jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. Accordingly the Court dismisses this submission.

28 The Court can find no error in the decision of the Tribunal nor of Turner FM and accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</text>

20 In SZBEL [2006] HCA 63 ; 231 ALR 592, the High Court observed of s 425 of the Act (at [36]):
 
 It is also important to recognise that the invitation to an applicant to appear before the tribunal to give evidence and make submissions is an invitation that need not be extended if the tribunal considers that it should decide the review in the applicant's favour. Ordinarily then, as was the case here, the tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the tribunal's invitation to appear, knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant's favour. That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it; it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material. But unless the tribunal tells the applicant something different, the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision.

21 The appellant was put on notice of the issues for determination at the Tribunal hearing as demonstrated, inter alia, by the following passages from the Tribunal's decision:
 
 I told him that I understood that it was easy to get official looking documents in China which were not genuine so that I would have regard to that when I was considering whether to accept that these documents were what they were purported to be.

22 The Tribunal's decision also reveals that the appellant did not experience difficulties in understanding the interpreter at the Tribunal hearing and it specifically noted that the appellant:
 
 ... gave oral evidence with the assistance of a suitably accredited interpreter. He said that he had no difficulty understanding the interpreter and no objection to using her services during the hearing. 

Later, referring to the appellant's claim that his assistant in running the underground church was arrested, the Tribunal said:
 
 I told him that I was finding his evidence about her role very vague and asked him again what precisely she did when she took over the management of the orders for the paper. He responded that she was also a leader. He added nothing more.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/9.html</AustLII>
<text>13 In his written submissions, the appellant referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZCOQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCAFC 9 in support of his contention that the Tribunal had disregarded the summons and verdict documents that he had provided to the Tribunal, and that the Tribunal had not provided the appellant with an opportunity to comment on issues arising from the documentary evidence he had provided, in breach of s 424A(1) of the Act.

14 Turner FM dismissed the appellant's claim that the Tribunal had breached s 424A(1) of the Act for two reasons. Firstly, the Tribunal had relied on its own subjective appraisals of the claims and evidence advanced by the appellant and this did not constitute ' information' within the meaning of the Act. Secondly the independent country information relied upon by the Tribunal in its finding that the supporting documents provided by the appellant were not a reliable source of evidence, fell within the exception to s 424A(1) in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.

15 It is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that it had relied on its subjective appraisal of the evidence given by the appellant in its finding that the appellant's claims were not credible. The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence to be vague, lacking in detail and cogency and that his claims were implausible. It concluded that the appellant was not being truthful with respect to his claims.</text>
