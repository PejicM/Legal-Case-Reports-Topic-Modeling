<text>44 Lundbeck referred to the following authorities for the proposition that, generally speaking, a power to make regulations is not construed so as to authorise the making of regulations which widen, vary or depart from positive provisions of the enabling Act, extend the scope and general operation of that Act, or operate in a way that is otherwise than strictly ancillary: Shanahan v Scott [1957] HCA 4 ; (1957) 96 CLR 245 at 250, 254; Utah Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Pataky [1966] AC 629 at 640; Willocks v Anderson [1971] HCA 28 ; (1970) 124 CLR 293 at 298-9; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 380; Carbines v Powell [1925] HCA 16 ; (1925) 36 CLR 88 at 92; Morton v Union Steamship Co of New Zealand Ltd [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402 at 410. However, the starting point in each case is the empowering section. In the present case, s 228(1)(b) does not stand alone: there is s 228(2)(e) to be considered.</text>
