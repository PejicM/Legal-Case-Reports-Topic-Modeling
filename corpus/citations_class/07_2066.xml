<tocase>Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1998) 76 FCR 513</tocase>
<text>2 There are several difficulties in the matter. The first is that the Commission wishes to submit to such order as the Court might make save for costs based upon the comments of the Full Court in Peacock v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2005] FCAFC 45 at [38] [40] which in turn referred to the case of Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1998) 76 FCR 513. That case in turn referred to Commonwealth v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (1995) 63 FCR 74. The fountainhead of this jurisprudence, at least in modern times for Australia, is R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13. It is suggested that the role that the Commission has in this case is no different to the role that it had in the other cases in which its participation has been heavily criticized. I will come back to that point in a moment. The application on the part of the Commonwealth was, in effect, sparked by that problem, bearing in mind again the rather trenchant criticism by the Full Court of the lack of the Commonwealth's participation in Peacock [2005] FCAFC 45.</text>

6 Leave is not granted to the solicitor for the Commission to withdraw at this stage. The application of Peacock [2005] FCAFC 45 to this case was questioned by me in argument and can be discussed more fully when the matter comes back.

7 The orders I make are those that I have indicated, namely, that the Commonwealth will be added as a respondent on the terms which I have announced. There will be no order for costs of this application.

 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
