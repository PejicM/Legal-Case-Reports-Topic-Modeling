<text>In determining whether 'substantial grounds' exist for believing that there is an 'extradition objection in relation to the offence' , French J (as he then was) in Cabal and Another v United Mexican States and Others (No 2) [2000] FCA 445 ; (2000) 172 ALR 743 (' Cabal (2000)') at 748-49 said: 
 
 The requirement that the grounds for believing there to be an extradition objection should be substantial is evaluative in character. It must be applied having regard to the legislative purpose. In relation to the political objections in s 7(b) and (c) material which demonstrates a real or substantial risk that the circumstances described in those paragraphs exist or will exist may be sufficient to satisfy the condition in s 19(2)(d).

His Honour's observations were cited with approval by the Full Court in Cabal and Another v United Mexican States and Others [2001] FCA 427 ; (2001) 108 FCR 311 (' Cabal (2001)') at [137]-[138].

The extent of the phrase 'material that was before the magistrate' was considered by French J in Cabal (2000) at 749 where his Honour said: 
 
 Upon review by this court under s 21 the material proffered to the magistrate by the parties and received in evidence is plainly material that was before the magistrate for the purposes of s 21(6)(d). So too, in my opinion, is material that was proffered to the magistrate and was rejected by her.

At 751 French J said: 
 
 In summary, I have come to the following conclusions in relation to the materials before the magistrate which may be considered by the court upon review under s 21. It is not suggested that these are exhaustive propositions, but they are reached in the light of the particular debate in this case: 
 (1) The materials before the magistrate comprise the testimony, documents and things which were received by the magistrate in evidence and those which were tendered to the magistrate but not accepted in evidence. 
 (2) The court upon review is not limited to consideration of material received by the magistrate in evidence but may have regard to other material tendered to the magistrate but not received in evidence.

On appeal to the Full Court in Cabal (2001) there was no issue between the parties that the material which could be considered by the reviewing court comprised material which had been rejected by the Magistrate. Accordingly, this question was not determined by the Full Court. However, their Honours expressed concern at some of the difficulties that may arise from French J's interpretation, stating at [73]: 
 
 Both at first instance and on appeal the parties proceeded on the basis that the review required to be heard by the Court or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory was in the nature of a rehearing, but subject to the provisions of s 21(6)(d) of the Act which confine the Court hearing the review to the material which was before the magistrate. Likewise the parties agreed that when s 21(6)(d) referred to the material "that was before the magistrate" that included not only material which the magistrate had admitted into evidence, but also material tendered by either the extradition country or the person in respect of whom the extradition application was made, which, for whatever reasons, was rejected by the magistrate and accordingly not taken into account by her. At least the latter of these propositions is not self-evident, if only because it would permit the judge conducting the review to consider material not capable of being tested by cross-examination or which might, had it been admitted, have led to the calling of other evidence. Clearly s 21(6)(d) would not permit any cross-examination on that evidence to take place or further evidence to be considered. However, as the parties proceeded on that basis before us we are content to accept for the purposes of the appeal the correctness of this construction of s 21(6)(d).

In Cabal (2000) at 751 French J was not constrained by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Evidence Act ') in determining what material was admissible in a review under s 21 of the Extradition Act . His Honour said: 
 
 In considering whether there are substantial grounds for believing that an extradition objection is made out for the purposes of s 19 , neither the court nor the magistrate is limited to evidence admissible, according to the rules of evidence, to demonstrate that the fact constituting the objection exists.

The Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal (2000) at 749 where his Honour said: 
 
 The very nature of those objections [the objections are referred to in s 7(b) and (c) of the Extradition Act ] is such that the evidence relied upon to make them out or to show substantial grounds for believing that they exist may be indirect or circumstantial in character. 
 

French J's observations must be read in the context of his finding at [23], namely that this Court is not bound by the rules of evidence in conducting a s 21 review. As discussed above, the Full Court decisions in Cabal (2001) and Dutton v O'Shane have established that this Court is bound to apply the provisions of the Evidence Act when conducting the review.

Although the evidence essentially relates to the applicant's apprehension rather than to any facts, the Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal (2000) at 749. The Court considers that such evidence should be admitted given the nature of the application before the Court. The Court admits those portions of paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 18 which were before the Magistrate subject to the deletion from paragraph 4 of the section commencing 'Gotovina has been indicted...' and concluding '...in the Milosevic trial' which is not relied upon by the applicant. Statement of Savo Strbac

Paragraphs 1 to 5 and 13 (except for the last sentence) of the statement of Savo Strbac are relied upon by the applicant. Mr Strbac is a former Magistrate in the Local Court in Benkovac and a former Judge of the District Court in Zadar. In 1993 Mr Strbac founded Veritas, a non-government organisation which monitors the treatment of Serbians by Croatian authorities in the territory of the Republic of Croatia and the former Republic of Serbian Krajina.

The respondent objects to the admission of the above paragraphs on the grounds of opinion and relevance.</text>

<tocase>Damir Travica v The Government of Croatia [2004] EWHC 2747 (Admin)</tocase>
<text>The Court also notes the decision of the High Court of Justice in Damir Travica v The Government of Croatia [2004] EWHC 2747 (Admin) in which Lord Justice Laws considered an issue under s 6(1)(d) of the Extradition Act 1989 (UK), which is in substantially the same terms as s 7(c) of the Extradition Act. In such decision Laws LJ observed at [38] that the Extradition Act 1989 (UK) could not be construed as conferring such a wide power of judgment over the practices of a foreign state as to warrant refusal of an extradition where an applicant will face a fair trial but complains that members of other groups would not have to face trial at all.

Accordingly, any discrepancy between the number of Croatians and Serbians prosecuted in the Republic of Croatia is irrelevant in this Court's consideration of whether the applicant would suffer prejudice at his trial by virtue of his race, nationality or political opinion. The applicant's contention does not lead to the conclusion that he would not be afforded a fair trial in the Republic of Croatia.

As to the alleged disparity in convictions between Serbians and Croatians, the Court observes that such alleged disparity may be a consequence of the disproportionate number of prosecutions against Serbians compared to Croatians. It is not possible to infer prejudice by the Croatian judiciary based upon the conviction data provided by Mr Strbac since the judiciary has not been involved in the prosecution process which has resulted in the disproportionate number of Serbian convictions. As considered above, discrepancy in the number of prosecutions is irrelevant to the review before the Court. Similarly, any discrepancy in convictions which results from discrepancy in prosecutions is also irrelevant. The Court would need to have before it evidence that the disproportionate number of convictions arose independently of the number of prosecutions before it could be satisfied that there might be a basis for finding prejudice by the judiciary. Reversal of convictions

In Travica Laws LJ observed at [34] that the conflict between Serbia and the Republic of Croatia and its after-effects have been 'especially acute In the Krajina region' . However, Laws LJ also observed at [35] that such circumstance did not by itself constitute a claim of prejudice 'not least when set against the signs of improvement in the conduct of prosecutions which I have surveyed, and which cannot have failed altogether to touch the Krajina region' . At [30] Laws LJ also made comment of the 'signal progress made in Croatia towards a justice system which meets international standards' . His Lordship's observations are consistent with the evidence contained in the reports referred to above. Ground 1 - Conclusion

The Court has considered the applicant's evidence and finds that there is no specific evidence of pre-trial bias against the applicant, nor is there a nexus established between the applicant's apprehension and the question of whether he would be prejudiced at his trial. Further, the evidence before the Court establishes that the Croatian judiciary is capable of providing a fair trial to the applicant.

The Court is not satisfied that the evidence establishes that there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant may be prejudiced at his trial or otherwise prejudiced as provided by s 7(c) of the Extradition Act. Ground 2 Abuse of process</text>

<text>The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process was traditionally exercised to prevent its jurisdiction being used 'for a purpose other than that for which the proceedings are properly designed and exist' : see Spautz v Williams [1983] 2 NSWLR 506 at 539 per Hunt J. In Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another [1988] FCA 450 ; (1988) 23 FCR 472 , Burchett J at 486-487 quoted his decision in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Edelsten (unreported, Burchett J, 10 March 1988) where his Honour, having reviewed the authorities said:

<tocase>Dutton v O'Shane and Another [2003] FCAFC 195 ; (2003) 200 ALR 710</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/195.html</AustLII>
<text>In Dutton v O'Shane and Another [2003] FCAFC 195 ; (2003) 200 ALR 710 the Full Court considered whether the Magistrate's rulings as to the admissibility of documentary evidence were reviewable by the Court. Finn and Dowsett JJ at [162] said: 
 
 As we understand it in light of the second respondent's additional submissions, the magistrate's rulings (which cover about 70 pages of transcript) were made in light of her consideration of the contents of the documents themselves and of the character of the material in question (that is, "relevance", "unqualified opinion", "unfairly prejudicial", etc). Though finding the "excluded" material not to have utility in the resolution of the question before her, the magistrate nonetheless engaged in "an active intellectual process" in relation to that material (cf Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462; Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277ff; 142 ALR 1 at 13) in and for the purposes of the s 19 determination. In light of her rulings, the magistrate may not have regarded the material as "admissible evidence" on the issue she had to determine. However, those rulings did not rob that material of the character of "material that was before the magistrate" for s 21(6)(d) purposes. They merely made it material that was disregarded.

In view of the above authorities, it is now established that the Court may take into account as constituting 'material that was before the magistrate' any material that was admitted by the Magistrate as well as any material that was rejected by the Magistrate provided that in the course of rejecting the material the Magistrate had engaged in 'an active intellectual process' in relation to that material. The Evidence Act

However, in Cabal (2001) the Full Court found that although the magistrate is not bound by the Evidence Act , the reviewing court is. At [189] the Full Court said: 
 
 Proceedings for review brought in this Court under s 21 of the [Extradition Act] are subject to the operation of the provisions of the [Evidence Act] notwithstanding the fact that those provisions are not applicable to the initial proceedings brought before a magistrate under s 19 of the [Extradition Act]. 
 

The Court observes that the Full Court in Dutton v O'Shane at [147] confirmed that the reviewing court is bound to apply the Evidence Act .

A review under s 21 of the Extradition Act is in essence a rehearing subject to the limitation posed by s 21(6)(d) of the Extradition Act : see Cabal (2001) at [100]; Dutton v O'Shane at [148]. However, if a magistrate and the reviewing court are subject to different legislative regimes governing admissibility, and in particular if the reviewing court is subject to the regime of the Evidence Act , the ability of that court to consider material that was before a magistrate may be significantly restricted.

An extradition objection framed under s 7(c) of the Extradition Act requires an applicant to demonstrate, inter alia, that there are substantial grounds for believing that the extradition country's judiciary may be prejudiced against that applicant. Given the nature of such a task, it is possible that the evidence available to an applicant would be scarce. It seems incongruous that sections of that applicant's evidence should be excised in a court that is ostensibly conducting a rehearing based on the material that was before the magistrate.

The Court is mindful of the observations of French J in Cabal (2000) at 749 where his Honour said: 
 
 The very nature of those objections [the objections are referred to in s 7(b) and (c) of the Extradition Act ] is such that the evidence relied upon to make them out or to show substantial grounds for believing that they exist may be indirect or circumstantial in character. 
 

French J's observations must be read in the context of his finding at [23], namely that this Court is not bound by the rules of evidence in conducting a s 21 review. As discussed above, the Full Court decisions in Cabal (2001) and Dutton v O'Shane have established that this Court is bound to apply the provisions of the Evidence Act when conducting the review.

French J in Cabal (2000) held that material that was accepted by the magistrate constituted material that was before the magistrate. As the Magistrate did not reject the reports it is accordingly not necessary to consider whether he engaged in an 'active intellectual process' in relation to such reports: see Dutton v O'Shane at [162]. In these circumstances, the Court accepts the submission of the applicant that such reports constituted material which was 'before the magistrate' .

The respondent also objects to the tender of the Amnesty Report on the basis that such report contains remote hearsay. Such report is relied upon by the applicant as 'background' to the Serbian and Croatian dispute.

The Court finds that the Amnesty Report contains hearsay and anecdotal material and therefore does not comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act . Accordingly the Amnesty Report is not admitted.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant relies upon the judgment of Mason CJ in Jago v The District Court of New South Wales and Others [1989] HCA 46 ; (1989) 168 CLR 23. In those proceedings the question arose whether a permanent stay should be granted in view of a delay in the prosecution of six years after the defendant had been charged with certain offences. The High Court of Australia held that the Court's power to prevent abuse of process in criminal proceedings extends to a power to prevent unfairness to the accused. At 30-31 Mason CJ stated: 
 
 The continuation of processes which will culminate in an unfair trial can be seen as a "misuse of the Court process" which will constitute an abuse of process because the public interest in holding a trial does not warrant the holding of an unfair trial.

Finally, it should be observed that the applicant's reliance upon Jago is misplaced as the current proceedings do not relate to a criminal trial: see Vasiljkovic v The Commonwealth of Australia and Others [2006] HCA 40 ; (2006) 227 CLR 614 at 629. Jago was concerned with the power of the High Court to prevent abuses of process in criminal proceedings. This Court is only concerned to determine whether the order of the Magistrate that the applicant is eligible for surrender to the Republic of Croatia in relation to the extradition offences should be upheld.</text>

<text>No claim of an abuse of process can be sustained under Chapter III of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1901 (Cth) ('the Constitution ') since at no earlier stage prior to the institution of these proceedings has the judicial power of the Commonwealth been invoked: see Pasini v United Mexican States and Others [2002] HCA 3 ; (2002) 209 CLR 246 at 253 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.

The Court observes that even if a stay of proceedings could have been warranted of the present proceedings before this Court on the ground of delay, it would not affect the determination of the Magistrate that the applicant was eligible for surrender pursuant to s 19(1) of the Extradition Act, nor would it affect the order under s 19(9) that the applicant be committed to prison to await surrender: see Pasini at 279 per Kirby J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/43.html</AustLII>
<text>The extradition offences with which the applicant is charged cannot be characterised as offences against a Commonwealth law since the offences do not arise under a law made by the Commonwealth Parliament. In Sankey v Whitlam and Others [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 , the High Court confirmed the need for an exercise of power by the Commonwealth Parliament in enacting legislation before a law can be said to be a Commonwealth law: see Gibbs ACJ at 30-1, Stephen J at 73, Aickin J at 104.

Any similarity between the offences with which the applicant is charged in the Republic of Croatia and the possibility of the existence of an equivalent criminal offence in Australia is irrelevant. Section 80 of the Constitution does not apply because the applicant has not been charged with a Commonwealth criminal offence.

It follows from the above finding, namely that s 80 of the Constitution does not apply, that there is no requirement under Australian law that the applicant be tried by jury. Accordingly the submission that the applicant has the right to be tried by jury, and that such right will be lost to him if he is tried in the Republic of Croatia, is rejected. It follows that the submission of the applicant that there is no evidence that the Republic of Croatia has the facilities to accommodate a jury trial is irrelevant.</text>
