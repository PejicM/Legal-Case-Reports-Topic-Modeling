<tocase>Sun Valley Dried Fruit Pty Ltd v Toea &amp; Rosenlund (BS 9418/2004) </tocase>
<text>112 Mr Rosenlund considered that it would have been difficult or impossible for Toea to comply with the clauses relating to the expulsion of stallholders who infringed trademarks. He also considered that employees did not have the experience or expertise necessary in order to recognize counterfeit products or to confirm that a product was counterfeit even if a representative of the applicant so asserted. Mr Rosenlund was also concerned that the deed might oblige him to expel a tenant who had been a good tenant for many years and whose livelihood was at stake. The decision of White J in Sun Valley Dried Fruit Pty Ltd v Toea &amp; Rosenlund (BS 9418/2004) caused at least part of Mr Rosenlund's concern. In that case, Sun Valley had sought to restrain Toea from terminating a licence to occupy and applied for an interlocutory injunction pending trial. The decision concerned only the application for interlocutory relief and is not authority for any particular view of the nature of the relationship between Toea and stallholders. Nonetheless it demonstrates the difficulties inherent in terminating such an arrangement. One can well understand that Mr Rosenlund might feel that it would be unwise to commit Toea to immediate expulsion of a stallholder if he was not sure that it would be able to honour such a commitment. It might also be thought somewhat harsh that Toea should be obliged to act upon the applicant's opinion as to whether there had been an infringement, rather than upon its own view of the matter, and that it should retain no discretion to consider other circumstances in deciding how to deal with a particular infringement.

113 On Saturday 26 February and Sunday 27 February 2005, Mr Rosenlund and two members of his staff walked around the Market in order to see whether any Louis Vuitton products were being sold. They found none. On 3 March 2005 Mr Rosenlund wrote to the solicitors, saying that he would not sign the deed of co-operation and outlining the steps which he had taken on the previous weekend to detect any further infringements. He indicated that he would continue to take these steps.

114 On 5 May 2005 the solicitors for the applicant again wrote to Mr Rosenlund. They set out the previous history of dealings between the parties and asserted that Ms Gallop and Mr Alcock had again, on 11 February 2004, 17 February 2004 and 24 April 2005, been found selling infringing goods. The solicitors indicated that they considered that Mr Rosenlund was not co-operating with the applicant and continued:
 
 'Your company's conduct in allowing stall-holders at Carrara Market to deal in Infringing Goods is likely to constitute an involvement by your company, and its officers, as joint tortfeasor with those stall-holders of infringement of the Louis Vuitton trademark. 
 
 Our client has previously indicated in our letter dated 15 January 2004, and in a Deed of Co-operation that was sent to you on 10 February 2005, that it is more than willing to work with your company to prevent the unlawful sale of Infringing Goods that is being carried on at Carrara Market. However, in your letter dated 3 March 2005, your company declined to sign our Deed of Co-operation. 
 
 We understand from your letter dated 3 March 2005, that so-called " permanent stalls" may have been bought for $50,000, while the Carrara website states that casual stall-holders pay $38.50 to hire for a stall for one day. Clearly, your company is obtaining significant financial benefits from stall-holders at Carrara Market. In our client's view, given your company's control over the Carrara Market, it appears that your company is sanctioning and also benefiting financially from stall-holders that sell Infringing Goods. 
 
 Our client considers that the only measures that will be adequate to prevent the ongoing infringements at Carrara Market are to take appropriate action against the stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G. Accordingly, our client demands that your company: 
 
 
 
 (a) expel any casual stall-holders identified in Schedule C to G from the Carrara Market by 4 pm on Sunday 8 May 2005 and prohibit them from hiring casual stalls at Carrara Market in the future; 
 
 (b) take whatever steps that you are legally able to in order to stop "permanent stall-holders" identified in Schedule C to G from selling Infringing Goods at the Carrara Market, which may mean giving reasonable notice to them that you will evict them within one month for breach of the terms on which they hold a permanent stall; and 
 
 (c) inform us by 4.00 pm on Friday 12 May of compliance with the demands contained in this letter. 
 
 
 
 If these demands are not fully satisfied by the dates referred to, we expect that our client will commence Federal Court proceedings against your company and any relevant officers of your company (including but not limited to directors and employees personally involved) without further notice. In any such Federal Court proceedings our client will seek both interlocutory and permanent injunctions against your company, damages or an account of profits, and its costs.'</text>

<tocase>The "Koursk" [1924] P 140</tocase>
<text>142 In the course of oral submissions counsel put the case in this way (at TS 200 ll 25-30):
 
 'Our starting point is very simple, your Honour. When one goes to The Koursk ([1924] P 140) which has been adopted as the foundation of the principle of joint tortfeasorship by the High Court in Thompson's case, [ Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 ] and we've set it out in paragraph 18 of our outline, Scrutton LJ spoke of two persons who agree on a common action in the course of, and to further which one of them commits a tort. 
 
 And that's the foundation of what are joint tortfeasors. In this case, in our respectful submission, the evidence is clear that Toea, as landlord or land owner, and the stallholders, who are two or more persons, agree on a common action, the common action being the promotion of their joint businesses at the market.'

148 I have previously referred to the applicant's reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeal in The "Koursk" (supra). However I suspect that it has misconceived that decision. The case arose out of a collision at sea involving the "Clan Chisholm", The "Koursk" and the "Itria" , leading to the loss of the "Itria" . The owners of the "Itria" sued the owners of the other vessels, alleging separate and independent acts of negligence against each of them. The question was whether judgment recovered against the owners of the "Clan Chisholm" barred a further action by the owners of the "Itria" against the owners of The "Koursk" . This depended upon whether the two ship owners (of the "Clan Chisholm" and The "Koursk" ) were joint or several tortfeasors. Bankes LJ adopted the following proposition from Clerk and Lindsell on Torts , 7th ed at p 59:
 
 'Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design.'

149 Scrutton LJ said at 155:
 
 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by "joint tortfeasors"? and one way of answering it is: "Is the cause of action against them the same?" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be "joint tortfeasors": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasor; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with another.'

150 The applicant fastens on the proposition concerning two persons who agree on common action in the course of which one commits a tort, submitting that the present case fits that description. However that observation by Scrutton LJ must be read in the context of his Lordship's later remarks at 156 where he referred with approval to the statement in Clerk and Lindsall (to which Bankes LJ had referred), that:
 
 ' "Persons are said to be joint tortfeasors when their respective shares in the commission of the tort are done in furtherance of a common design" ... "But mere similarity of design on the part of independent actors, causing independent damage, is not enough; there must be concerted action to a common end." Still more so when there is not even similarity of design, but independent negligence accidentally resulting in one damage.'

151 At 159 Sargant LJ adopted the same passage.

152 The applicant points to the reference by Scrutton LJ to 'common action' and asserts that in this case, the common action agreed upon between the respondents and each stallholder was 'the function of their joint businesses at the Market' . No doubt the respondents desired that the Market be successful and took steps to achieve that aim. No doubt, too, each stallholder desired that his or her stall be successful and took steps to achieve that aim. However that does not lead to the conclusion that the respondents and each stallholder had agreed on common action. Aims are not actions. The term 'common action' must surely mean 'steps to be taken' . At p 155 of The "Koursk" , Scrutton LJ was identifying common relationships in which joint torts generally occur, rather than the underlying principle which defines the relationship of joint tortfeasors. At 156, his Lordship addressed that principle, holding that each party must share in the commission of the tort in furtherance of a common design, not merely in furtherance of similar designs.

157 At 580-581, the majority (Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ) said:
 
 'The difference between joint tortfeasors and several tortfeasors is that the former are responsible for the same tort whereas the latter are responsible only for the same damage ... . As was said in The "Koursk" ..., for there to be joint tortfeasors "there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a co-incidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage". Principal and agent may be joint tortfeasors where the agent commits a tort on behalf of the principal, as master and servant may be where the servant commits a tort in the course of employment. Persons who breach a joint duty may also be joint tortfeasors. Otherwise, to constitute joint tortfeasors two or more persons must act in concert in committing the tort.'

158 At 600, Gummow J (Gaudron J concurring) also identified the decision in The "Koursk" as defining joint liability for the purposes of Australian law. At 601 602, his Honour distinguished the decision in CBS Songs on its fact but did not doubt its correctness.

160 His Honour referred to the The "Koursk" and another case, and then observed that Lord Justice Mustill, in Unilever PLC v Gillette (UK) Ltd [1989] RPC 583:
 
 '... stated the common law rule that two persons were joint tortfeasors 
 
 ... where the two were concerned in a joint act done in pursuance of a common purpose. 
 
 After reviewing the patent cases and the speech of Lord Templeman in CBS Songs Ltd v Armstrad ... Lord Justice Mustill said at p 609 that the relevant question is whether: 
 
 
 
 (a) there was a common design between B and G to do acts which, if the patent is upheld, amounted to infringements, and (b) B had acted in furtherance of that design. I use the word "common design" because they are readily to hand, but there are other expressions in the cases, such as "concerted action" or "agreed or common action" which will serve just as well.'

162 Hobhouse LJ subsequently referred to The "Koursk" , CBS Songs and Unilever , concluding (at 46) that these cases established that:
 
 'It is only conduct which comes into the first or the third of the categories I have set out above which constitute the commission of a tort. The criminal law for obvious policy reasons goes further than the civil law. Acts which knowingly facilitate the commission of a crime amount to the crime of aiding and abetting but they do not amount to a tort or make the aider liable as a joint tortfeasor.'

164 In Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names 14 th ed at par 19-044, the learned authors observe, in connection with trademarks, that:
 
 'For the general principles applicable in relation to joint liability based on procurement or common design see CBS v Armstrad and Credit Lyonnais v Export Credit Guarantee Department '. 
 

Those decisions are based on that in The "Koursk" . The High Court's view of that case appears from the decision in Thompson v Australian Capital Television and is the relevant test for present purposes.

168 There will be cases in which the relationship between the person who commits a tort and another person may be such as to amount to both authorization (in the case of copyright) and also to satisfy the test for joint tortfeasors laid down in The "Koursk" and Thompson v Australian Capital Television. However to prove authorization is not necessarily to prove infringement. As the present case demonstrates, control does not, itself, imply a common purpose. However the extent of control may be relevant evidence in determining whether such a common purpose existed at the relevant time.</text>

<tocase>CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013 </tocase>
<text>153 I turn to the decision of the House of Lords in CBS Songs Limited v Amstrad Consumer Electronics PLC [1988] 1 AC 1013. The facts appear sufficiently from the head note as follows:
 
 'The plaintiffs, suing on behalf of themselves and other copyright owners in the music trade, claimed that the defendants, by manufacturing, advertising and offering for sale hi-fi systems with facilities for, inter alia, recording at high speed from pre-recorded cassettes onto blank tapes, had authorised and incited members of the public to infringe their copyrights, were joint infringers with such members of the public and were in breach of a duty of care owed to the copyright owners not to supply the machines without taking such precautions as would reasonably ensure that the copyrights would not be infringed by their use. They sought an injunction to retrain the defendants from parting with possession of the machines, or any like machines, without taking such precautions.'

158 At 600, Gummow J (Gaudron J concurring) also identified the decision in The "Koursk" as defining joint liability for the purposes of Australian law. At 601 602, his Honour distinguished the decision in CBS Songs on its fact but did not doubt its correctness.

162 Hobhouse LJ subsequently referred to The "Koursk" , CBS Songs and Unilever , concluding (at 46) that these cases established that:
 
 'It is only conduct which comes into the first or the third of the categories I have set out above which constitute the commission of a tort. The criminal law for obvious policy reasons goes further than the civil law. Acts which knowingly facilitate the commission of a crime amount to the crime of aiding and abetting but they do not amount to a tort or make the aider liable as a joint tortfeasor.'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/38.html</AustLII>
<text>142 In the course of oral submissions counsel put the case in this way (at TS 200 ll 25-30):
 
 'Our starting point is very simple, your Honour. When one goes to The Koursk ([1924] P 140) which has been adopted as the foundation of the principle of joint tortfeasorship by the High Court in Thompson's case, [ Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 186 CLR 574 ] and we've set it out in paragraph 18 of our outline, Scrutton LJ spoke of two persons who agree on a common action in the course of, and to further which one of them commits a tort.

156 In Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd (supra) the facts, according to the head note, were as follows:
 
 'A television station broadcast live to viewers in the Australian Capital Territory a current affairs programme produced by another station. The licence to broadcast was granted by PBL which was a related entity of the producer. The content of the broadcast was defamatory of T. T settled with the producer and gave it a release. T sued the broadcaster in the Supreme Court of the Territory. The broadcaster joined the producer and PBL as third parties, seeking contribution and also damages for breach of an implied condition of the licence agreement that they would exercise reasonable care to ensure that the relayed programme would not include defamatory material. 
 
 Although the broadcaster took no part in the production of the programme, it acted in its own right and had the ability to control and supervise the material it televised. The broadcaster voluntarily decided to broadcast live. It sought to defend the proceedings on the grounds that it and the producer were joint tortfeasors and that the release granted to the producer by T also released it.'

164 In Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names 14 th ed at par 19-044, the learned authors observe, in connection with trademarks, that:
 
 'For the general principles applicable in relation to joint liability based on procurement or common design see CBS v Armstrad and Credit Lyonnais v Export Credit Guarantee Department '. 
 

Those decisions are based on that in The "Koursk" . The High Court's view of that case appears from the decision in Thompson v Australian Capital Television and is the relevant test for present purposes.

168 There will be cases in which the relationship between the person who commits a tort and another person may be such as to amount to both authorization (in the case of copyright) and also to satisfy the test for joint tortfeasors laid down in The "Koursk" and Thompson v Australian Capital Television. However to prove authorization is not necessarily to prove infringement. As the present case demonstrates, control does not, itself, imply a common purpose. However the extent of control may be relevant evidence in determining whether such a common purpose existed at the relevant time.

170 In the course of argument the applicant referred to three American cases concerning 'secondary' liability for trademark infringements. Given the clear statement of principle in connection with tortious liability in Thompson v Australian Capital Television, I see no point in discussing those cases in this judgment.

171 I proceed upon the basis that, in order to hold the respondents liable for the stallholders' infringements, '... there must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage', and that in order to satisfy that test in the present case, it is necessary to show that the respondents acted in concert with each stallholder in 'committing the tort' .

172 In my view it is simply impossible to reach that conclusion. I accept Mr Rosenlund's evidence that he wished to deter stallholders from infringing trademarks and took steps to do so. The primary infringing stallholders all understood that this was his position and therefore that of Toea. The applicant's case hangs upon the assertion that he did not do enough, or could have done more, to deter infringement. It is said that from this, I should infer that he was really encouraging the stallholders in their illegal activities. In other words, it is submitted that although there was no duty on the respondents to take steps to prevent infringement, the failure to do so evidenced an intention to encourage infringement. That approach fails to take account of the fact that there may have been other reasons for not taking more draconian measures to prevent infringement. In any event, I am unpersuaded that either of the respondents acted in common with any of the stallholders in the actions which constituted infringement of the applicant's copyrights. I am also satisfied that such infringements were not committed in the execution of any common purpose shared with the respondents. As I have said, the respondents' purpose was to conduct an efficient and profitable Market. The purpose of each stallholder was the successful conduct of his or her stall. There was no common purpose.

173 It follows that the application must be dismissed. I will hear submissions as to costs and any requests for further findings of fact.

 I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.

<tocase>Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep 19 </tocase>
<text>159 Finally, I should refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Export Credit Guarantee Department [1998] 1 Lloyd's Rep 19. It is not necessary to set out the rather complex facts of the case, but I will include two extended extracts from the reasons for judgment of Stuart-Smith and Hobhouse LLJJ. Stuart-Smith LJ said at 35:
 
 'Be that as it may, it seems to me to be well established that a person who acts with another to commit a tort in furtherance of a common design will be liable as a joint tortfeasor. It is not enough that he merely facilitates the commission of the tort unless his assistance is given in pursuance and furtherance of the common design.'

164 In Kerly's Law of Trademarks and Trade Names 14 th ed at par 19-044, the learned authors observe, in connection with trademarks, that:
 
 'For the general principles applicable in relation to joint liability based on procurement or common design see CBS v Armstrad and Credit Lyonnais v Export Credit Guarantee Department '.

<tocase>University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1974-1975) 133 CLR 1 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1975/26.html</AustLII>
<text>165 The applicant puts some emphasis upon Toea's legal capacity to control use of the Market premises. It implicitly asserts that the respondents failed to prevent infringement notwithstanding that power, and that such failure is a basis for inferring their 'concurrence' in the infringement. The question of control has arisen frequently in connection with breach of copyright. Subsection 36(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the " Copyright Act ") provides that a person infringes a copyright if he or she 'not being the owner of the copyright, and without the licence of the owner of the copyright, does in Australia, or authorises the doing in Australia, any act comprised in the copyright.' In University of New South Wales v Moorhouse [1975] HCA 26 ; (1974-1975) 133 CLR 1, the High Court considered the case of a university library which had provided photocopying machines on its premises, one of which had been used to make an unauthorized copy of a literary work. The question was whether the university had infringed by authorization. At 20-21, Jacobs J, with whom McTiernan J agreed, said concerning the word 'authorises' :
 
 'It is established that word is not limited to the authorising of an agent by a principal. Where there is such an authority the act of the agent is the act of the principal and thus the principal himself may be said to do the act comprised in the copyright. But authorisation is wider than authority. It has, in relation to a similar use in previous copyright legislation, been given the meaning, taken from the Oxford Dictionary, of "sanction, approve, countenance". ...I have no doubt that the word is used in the same sense in section 36(1). It is a wide meaning which in cases of permission or invitation is apt to apply both where an express permission or invitation is extended to do the act comprising the copyright and where such a permission or invitation may be implied. Where a general permission or invitation may be implied it is clearly unnecessary that the authorising party have knowledge that a particular act comprised in the copyright will be done. 
 
 The acts and omissions of the alleged authorising party must be looked at in the circumstances in which the act comprised in the copyright is done. The circumstances will include the likelihood that such an act will be done. "... (t)he Court may infer an authorisation or permission from acts which fall short of being direct and positive; ... indifference, exhibited by acts of commission or omission, may reach a degree from which authorisation or permission may be inferred. It is a question of fact in each case what is the true inference to be drawn from the conduct of the person who is said to have authorised ..." '</text>
