<tocase>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490</tocase>
<text>In the Earlier Reasons, I referred (at [86]) to State Bank of New South Wales v Brown 38 ACSR 715 and Household Financial Services Pty Ltd v Chase Medical Centre Pty Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 294. In The Australian Steel Co (Operations) Pty Ltd t/as Welded Mesh v EPS Group Pty Ltd (2007) 59 ACSR 602 Austin J referred to these cases and to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490 ( TJF EBC ) and identified in the following passage (at [70]) considerations to which regard should be had under s 564: 
 
 As those cases point out, s 564 itself draws attention to the risk assumed by the funding creditor. It is therefore necessary to address the extent and nature of the risk that the funded recovery action will fail, and the extent of any consequent risk that the funds made available for the litigation might be irrecoverable. It appears from Spigelman CJ's judgment in the Brown case, at [40], and Brownie J's observations in the Household Financial Services case (at 296 7), that one has regard to factors including: whether the amounts involved are small; the value recovered; the size of the funding creditor's debt compared with other debts; the proportion that the funding creditor's expenditure bears to the amount recovered; whether the money advanced by the funding creditor has been refunded; whether other unsecured creditors oppose the distribution proposed to the funding creditor; whether other creditors have been given the opportunity to join in the funding and have failed to do so; and the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide indemnities so as to enable assets to be recovered. ...

In TJF EBC , Barrett J gave the funding creditor an advantage by stipulating that it should receive in priority to all other creditors 80% of the funds remaining for distribution to creditors in the winding up after allowing for priority claims under s 556(1) , with the remaining 20% being paid to other creditors.</text>

<tocase>Re Read and Another [2007] FCA 1985 ; (2007) 164 FCR 237</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1985.html</AustLII>
<text>There has been a difference of judicial opinion as to whether it is appropriate to extend time in a case such as the present. Orders extending time were made by Warren J (as the Chief Justice then was) in Empire (Aust) Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) v Vince (2000) 35 ACSR 167 (see [15]-[16]) and by Gordon J in Stewart, in the matter of Newtronics Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1375 (see [30]). However, in Re Read and Another [2007] FCA 1985 ; (2007) 164 FCR 237 ( Read ), French J (as the Chief Justice then was) expressed disagreement with the approach taken in those two cases. His Honour was of the opinion (at [32]-[39]) that s 1322(4)(d) of the Act could not be relied upon to extend time under s 477(2B). French J's reason was that s 477(2B) did not specify a "period for" the making of an application for approval under s 477(2B).

I prefer not to embark on any further discussion of the two lines of authority or the making of a choice between them, and will simply make an order that if and to the extent that an extension of time is required, time is extended. For more abundant precaution, I will also give a direction under s 479(3) of the Act, as French J did in Read , that Mr Chamberlain may act on the Indemnities as if he had entered into them with the Court's prior approval. No doubt in giving approval nunc pro tunc and extending time under s 1322(4)(d) and giving a direction under s 479(3) and making a declaration under s 1322(4)(a) , I am being excessively cautious, but this does no harm. The application under s 564 of the Act

Annexed to the Earlier Reasons was a summary of the receipts and payments of Mr Chamberlain as liquidator of the Company as at 15 June 2009.

One day after the Earlier Reasons were delivered, the Supreme Court of New South Wales made orders by consent in the Construction List Proceeding and the Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding. These included an order that RGH be admitted to prove as an unsecured creditor in the winding up of the Company in the sum of $700,000.00, and that the Company pay RGH's costs of the Construction List Proceeding agreed in the sum of $25,000.00 as an expense of the winding up. Otherwise, orders were made to the effect that the Construction List Proceeding and the Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding were dismissed, all costs orders made in them were vacated, and, subject to the costs order just noted, the parties were ordered to bear their own costs of both proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) [2004] NSWSC 28 ; (2004) 208 ALR 242</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/28.html</AustLII>
<text>In Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) [2004] NSWSC 28 ; (2004) 208 ALR 242 , Campbell J noted (at 104) that an alternative approach is to give the indemnifying creditor an advantage calculated as a percentage of the investment that that creditor made in funding the litigation. His Honour noted that in assessing that percentage, one would need to take into account that the indemnifying creditor had not only a risk of losing the investment made, but also a risk of being liable to pay other expenses of the liquidator and the liquidator's solicitors, and possibly the costs of the other side. Campbell J noted (at [107]) that the funding creditor's entitlement could be compared, as a rough check, to the premium that would have been demanded by a litigation funder.

RGH submits that the Transactions Proceeding, although apparently complex, was not risky. RGH submits that there is no evidence before the Court that it was considered to be risky, although I note that in para 54(b) of Mr Chamberlain's affidavit of 7 August 2009, he claims there was a significant exposure to the risk of an adverse costs order. RGH submits that the Court should infer that if evidence to that effect was available, Mr Chamberlain would have adduced it.

RGH also makes the following submissions:

At paras 32-37 of his written submission, Mr Docker, counsel for RGH, makes the following helpful submissions: Taking the first approach set out in [10] above [a percentage of the funds remaining after payment of priority debts and claims], an appropriate percentage of the net funds available for distribution which should be allocated for advantage to the DCT is 1/3 rd . ... The effect of this approach would be as follows: the DCT would be entitled to 1/3 rd of the total amount available, $2,027,938.06, being $675,979.35 by way of priority; the balance of the DCT's debt, being $624,294.28 ($1,300,273.63 [sic] - $675,979.35) will rank with the other unsecured debts; the total of the non priority unsecured debts will be $1,699,294.28 ($700,000 + $375,000 + $624,294.28); the total available for distribution to the non priority unsecured debts will be $1,351,958.71 ($2,027,938.06 - $675,979.35); the percentage recovery on unsecured debts will be 79.5% ($1,351,958.71/$1,699,294.28 x 100) this means that: the DCT will get a total of $1,172,293.30 ($675,979.35 + $496,313.95) which is 90.1% of its debt; RG&amp;H will get $556,500.00, which is 79.5% of its debt; and Hardys' [sic] will get $298,125.00, which is 79.5% of their debt.
 If the alternative method referred to in [10] above is used [a percentage of the investment made by the indemnifying creditor in providing funding] and the priority is calculated by reference to the amount invested by the DCT, $266,286.77, the above approach is supported. That is, the DCT will be receiving in priority an amount ($675,979.35) which is more than 2&#189; times the amount it invested as well as being reimbursed for the amount it invested.
 A third way of checking the approach is by reference to what a litigation funder would have received. If the figure of 40% of the amount recovered is used (although the examples in Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd ... suggest the figure is often lower) the amount the DCT would receive ($1,172,293.30) exceeds 40% of the recovery of $2,600,000.
 The above figures do not take account of when the distributions will be made. The instalment payments add a level of complexity to the exercise. In short, the DCT should share the burden of the late payments with the other unsecured creditors. Presumably, the DCT was consulted about the settlement which resulted in the instalment regime. However, if the DCT seeks to be paid immediately, it should receive less.
 Assuming the creditors all share in the delay, this would mean that the current amount available for distribution would be treated as one distribution and so would each instalment payment. For example, if $1,200,000 was available for distribution now: DCT would get 1/3 rd , being $400,000, as a priority; and the other $800,000 would be distributed rateably amongst the 3 unsecured creditors in accordance with their non priority debts.
 In an example with $60,000, the DCT would get $20,000 as a priority and the remaining $40,000 would be distributed rateably amongst the 3 unsecured creditors in accordance with their non priority debts.

Mr Dawson, counsel for Mr Chamberlain, submits that the merits based standing of the DCT as funding creditor outweighs that of RGH and the Hardys in the following respects in particular: RGH elected not to lodge a proof of debt until the settlement of the Transactions Proceeding in November 2008, immediately prior to the scheduled hearing. The DCT entered into the Indemnities in circumstances in which it was the only creditor who had lodged a proof of debt in the winding up, and it is not "just" for the purposes of s 564 to recognise the interests of RGH asserted at such a late stage over those of the DCT; as noted above, there is no evidence that RGH would have funded the Transactions Proceeding; and the Hardys, being the only other creditor, do not oppose the DCT's application.

In my opinion, RGH's submissions understate the risk that was associated with the Transactions Proceeding. The pleadings are in evidence. They include a second further amended statement of claim and the separate defences of the first to sixth defendants and the seventh to twelfth defendants. The plaintiffs were the Company and Mr Chamberlain as its liquidator. The first to sixth defendants were the Hardy interests and the seventh to twelfth were the Company's accountants.</text>
