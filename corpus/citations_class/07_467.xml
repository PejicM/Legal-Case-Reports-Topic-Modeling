14 In Mobil Oil at 38, Hayne JA pointed out that ordinarily, the fact that documents are confidential is not a bar to inspection by the other party. He said, however, that where the parties are trade rivals, different considerations arise.

15 What underlies Hayne JA's analysis is his statement that the principles of a trade rival cannot forget the secret information once it is revealed. Thus, the value of the commercially sensitive information will be lost unless it is protected by an appropriate access regime. The implied obligation not to use the documents other than for the purpose of the proceedings is thought to be insufficient, as between trade rivals, to permit unrestricted access.

16 The balancing exercise to which Hayne JA referred in Mobil Oil at 39-40 involves weighing the needs of a party to litigation against the "legitimate concern" of a trade rival.

17 The principal factors which inform the exercise of the discretion have been stated in the authorities. A party to litigation is entitled to know the case it has to meet and to properly instruct solicitors and counsel. The nature and content of the documents, the degree of confidentiality of the information and the risk that the rival will use it to the detriment of the other party are important factors to be weighed in the balance; Mobil Oil at 39-40; Reebok at [43]; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 70 FCR 403 at 410-411.</text>
