<text>2 Mr Kunc, who appears for the Department, then foreshadowed a notice of motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and, in the alternative, an order that the Department be removed as a party to the proceedings pursuant to s 25(2B)(a) of the Act. A single judge of the Court has power under those sections to make the orders sought (s 25 ; Zegarac v Dellios [2007] FCA 566 at [12] ; Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 at [4] ; Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923). The notice of motion for summary judgment was filed on 24 May 2007 ('the motion').</text>

<text>23 In Zambini , Mansfield J considered an application for summary dismissal in respect of an appeal from a judge of the Court who had held that there was no error of law in a decision of the Tribunal. As his Honour observed at [5], an appeal should not be summarily dismissed if there are some identified or identifiable grounds capable of supporting an argument that the appeal might succeed. In this matter, as in Zambini , there is no ground of appeal which might be arguable. Mr Druett has been unable to articulate a ground of appeal with prospects of success and none is apparent. This is so whether one applies s 31A of the Act or the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. The appeal should be summarily dismissed.</text>
