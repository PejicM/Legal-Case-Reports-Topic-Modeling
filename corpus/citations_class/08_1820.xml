<tocase>Termination Change and Redundancy Case (1984) 8 IR 34</tocase>
<text>7 The provision of severance pay in industrial instruments may be traced back to the Termination Change and Redundancy Cases (1984) 8 IR 34 and (1984) 9 IR 115, in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Those decisions illustrate that severance pay is designed to compensate employees for loss of transferable employment credits, loss of security in employment, loss of seniority and the hardship associated with redundancy for longer serving and older employees. See especially 8 IR 34 at 72-75 and see also the Redundancy Case (2004) 129 IR 155 at [133] - [142]. Those decisions further stress that severance pay is not designed to compensate employees for a period of unemployment.</text>

<tocase>McLennan v Surveillance Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 46 ; (2005) 142 FCR 105</tocase>

<text>10 An AWA is an industrial instrument and a creature of statute. AWAs are "a species of agreement which derive their legal effect from the [Workplace Relations] Act": McLennan v Surveillance Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 46 ; (2005) 142 FCR 105 at [25] . As an industrial instrument created by the Act, an AWA should be interpreted in the same way as one would interpret an award made by an industrial tribunal. One looks to the particular language of the provision in light of its context and purpose: see Amcor Limited v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union [2005] HCA 10 ; (2005) 222 CLR 241 at [2] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, at [30] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, at [66] per Kirby J, and at [129] and [130] per Callinan J.</text>

<tocase>Clothing Trades Award 1982(1) (Derole Case) (1990) 140 IR 123</tocase>
<text>12 The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has discussed the meaning of "obtains acceptable alternative employment" in the context of the redundancy test case standard. In Clothing Trades Award 1982(1) (Derole Case) (1990) 140 IR 123, a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission referred to "obtains" at 127 and said:
 ...the creation of the legal relationship of master and servant [between the outgoing employer's employee and the incoming employer] depends on a mutuality being arrived at between the individual and the incoming employer. Therefore, the pursuit of alternative employment by the outgoing employer cannot be expected, by reason of itself alone, to produce the new employment; there will usually...remain the opportunity for the incoming employer, and the employee, to disagree as to matters such as terms of employment, suitability of the job to the employee and vice versa so that alternative employment may not eventuate.

13 The Full Bench went on at 127 to consider "obtain" in context to signify that:
 ...the employer by purpose and effort may establish an opportunity which suits the employee and which crystallises as alternative employment of an acceptable kind. 
Later, at 128, the Full Bench said:
 The employer must be a strong, moving force towards the creation of the available opportunity.

14 In the relevant AWAs of the employee applicants, the applicable sub-clause refers to the employer being "able to arrange alternative employment." There is no material difference between obtaining alternative employment and being able to arrange it. If an employer who is about to make an employee redundant said to the employee, "I have obtained alternative employment for you" or said "I have been able to arrange alternative employment for you", the employee would understand the employer on each occasion to be saying that it has found another job for the employee. The employee may not choose to take up the job, but it must be one that is there for the taking if the employee chooses to take it.</text>
