<text>In ACE Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 Weinberg J set out a number of principles which he considered to be relevant on an application of this nature. His Honour said: 
 
 'The authorities which govern the operation of s 459G of the Corporations Law seem to me to establish the following propositions: 
 
 
 &#61863; The respondent is presumed to be insolvent and as such bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C(2) and (3); Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 235 per Spender J; Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd . (1997) 15 ACLC 477 per Mansfield J. 
 &#61863; In order to discharge that onus the Court should ordinarily be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of the respondent: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1081 per Hayne J. 
 &#61863; Unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency. Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared: Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd ( supra); Re Citic Commodity Trading Pty Ltd v JBL Enterprises (WA) Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 232 per Heerey J; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 459 at 463 per Sackville J. 
 &#61863; There is a distinction between solvency and a surplus of assets. A company may be at the same time insolvent and wealthy. The nature of a company's assets, and its ability to convert those assets into cash within a relatively short time, at least to the extent of meeting all its debts as and when they fall due, must be considered in determining solvency: Rees v Bank of New South Wales [1964] HCA 47 ; (1964) 111 CLR 210; Re Tweeds Garages Ltd [1962] Ch 406 at 410 per Plowman J; Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (supra); Melbase Corporation Pty Ltd v Segenhoe Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 823 at 832 per Lindgren J; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 465-466. 
 &#61863; The adoption of a cash flow test for solvency does not mean that the extent of the company's assets is irrelevant to the inquiry. The credit resources available to the company must also be taken into account: Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 671 per Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed); Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 466; Taylor v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 808 at 812 per McGarvie J. 
 &#61863; The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing. However, this does not mean that future events are to be ignored: Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (supra) at 466-467. 
 &#61863; It is no abuse of process for an applicant to seek to wind up a company presumed to be insolvent by reason of its failure to comply with a statutory demand merely because that company contends that it is solvent, or because there may be alternative means available to the applicant to vindicate its rights : Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (supra).'</text>

<text>In Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Paliflex Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 889 ; (1999) 47 NSWLR 382 at [49] Austin J identified three matters relevant to whether leave should be granted under s 459S. They are as follows: 
 
 
 
 '(i) a preliminary consideration of the defendant's basis for disputing the debt which was the subject of the demand; 
 (ii) an examination of the reason why the issue of indebtedness was not raised in an application to set aside the demand, and the reasonableness of the party's conduct at that time; and 
 (iii) an investigation of whether the dispute about the debt is material to proving that the company is solvent.'</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACLC 1075</tocase>
<text>There are three aspects to this topic. The first aspect is the evidence that relates to Helimount's profit and loss and trading performance. The second aspect is the quality of the evidence put forward by Helimount and, in particular, whether it was the 'fullest and best' evidence: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1085 per Hayne J. The third aspect is the evidence as to the assets and liabilities of Helimount and this is relevant for the purposes of considering its ability to borrow funds to overcome any temporary cashflow or liquidity problems.

I start with Helimount's profit and loss and trading performance.

The liquidator has deposed to Helimount's profit and loss and trading performance over certain years. His evidence is to the effect that in 2003 Helimount earned $78,916 from the sale of wine grapes and made a profit of $1,510. In 2004 the company earned $105,000 from the sale of wine grapes and $124,228 as a profit on the sale of property and made a profit of $150,623. In 2005 Helimount made sales of $472,015 and made a profit of $159,247. In 2006 Helimount could not sell its wine grapes. The liquidator states that no financial statements have been prepared for the last year, which I assume to be the financial year ended 30 June 2006. The liquidator does not reveal the source of these figures.

In ACE Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 Weinberg J set out a number of principles which he considered to be relevant on an application of this nature. His Honour said:

<tocase>Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2003) 45 ACSR 711</tocase>
<text>The above principles were recognised as the relevant principles by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2003) 45 ACSR 711 per Santow JA (with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed) at 718 [16].

It is to be presumed until the contrary is proved that Helimount is not able to pay all its debts as and when they become due and payable.

Helimount submits that it has discharged the onus of proving that it is solvent. It submits that it has at most only a couple of creditors and a substantial excess of assets over liabilities. It points to three matters in particular. First, it submits that three of the valuations of the land it has produced are more reliable than the liquidator's estimates and should be preferred to the liquidator's estimates. It seems to me that the answer to this submission is that it is a matter of small consequence because even if it is correct it increases the upper limit of the liquidator's estimates by no more than $40,000. Secondly, Helimount submits the debt owed by it to Mr Callipari (which on Helimount's case is now in the order of $1,000,000) is not presently due and owing. The answer to this submission is that even if it is correct, on the liquidator's figures there is still an excess of liabilities over assets. In saying this I am assuming as liabilities the full debt to the ANZ and the principal amount of the debt claimed by Web Wealth. Thirdly, Helimount refers to the values placed on properties owned by Helimount in a letter from NFFA Finance Warehouse Pty Ltd to it dated 31 August 2006. It is said that the letter embodies an offer of finance to Helimount. I do not place any weight on the values referred to in the letter first, because I do not know who is putting forward the values and secondly, because the letter specifically states that 'the properties are being revalued and values may change'. Furthermore, I note that the figures put forward in the letter suggest that in some cases there have been very significant increases in what Helimount said were the value of various properties in early 2005.</text>

<tocase>HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd (2002) 44 ACSR 169</tocase>
<text>In this case Mr Callipari has caused the company to make an application for review under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). For the purposes of the application of s 471A(1), I do not think that any distinction should be drawn between an application for review and an appeal although in the case of an application for review what French J called the 'constitutional imperative' in HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd (2002) 44 ACSR 169 may be relevant to whether approval to cause a company to bring an application for review should be granted. That consideration would not be relevant in the case of an appeal.

In HVAC Construction (Qld) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd (supra) at 184 [53] French J was inclined to agree with that approach saying that s 459S should be given a strict construction in order that the purpose of the legislative scheme could best be served.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2002/118.html</AustLII>
<text>An application for approval can be made before a proceeding is commenced or sought nunc pro tunc after the proceeding has been commenced but before the substantive proceeding (be it an application for review or an appeal) is heard. A key consideration when an application is made at either of these stages is the preservation of the company's assets and the importance of avoiding a situation whereby the company's assets are diminished by an unsuccessful appeal ( Lane Cove Council v Geebung Polo Club Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] NSWSC 118 ; (2002) 167 FLR 175. Therefore, in deciding whether to grant approval a court will consider the solvency of the company and whether the director offers to undertake to pay the costs if the appeal is unsuccessful (see Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd (supra) at [24]-[33]).</text>

<tocase>Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd (2003) 226 LSJS 61</tocase>
<text>Mr Callipari caused Helimount to bring the application for review. At the time the application was made Helimount was subject to a winding up order and, by reason of s 471A(1) of the Corporations Act , Mr Callipari did not have the power to cause the company to bring the application. For the reasons I gave in Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd (2003) 226 LSJS 61 at [24] there is no longer a residual power at common law in directors to cause a company to appeal against a winding up order. In my opinion, the same applies in the case of an application for review under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). However, the Court is able to grant approval under s 471A(1A) of the Corporations Act nunc pro tunc for Mr Callipari to cause the company to bring the application. The first question before me is whether approval under s 471A(1A) should be granted.

As I have said, Helimount did not make an application to set aside the statutory demand under s 459G of the Corporations Act . However, it disputes the debt, or at least the quantum of the debt, it is said to owe to Web Wealth. By reason of s 459S of the Corporations Act Helimount may not, without the leave of the Court, oppose the application for it to be wound up in insolvency on a ground that it could have relied on but did not so rely on for the purposes of an application by it for the statutory demand to be set aside. The second question before me is whether Helimount should be granted leave under s 459S.

By reason of Helimount's failure to comply with the statutory demand it is presumed to be insolvent: s 459C(2) of the Corporations Act . It seeks to establish that it is not insolvent and whether it has discharged the onus of proving that it is not insolvent is the third question before me.

An application for approval can be made before a proceeding is commenced or sought nunc pro tunc after the proceeding has been commenced but before the substantive proceeding (be it an application for review or an appeal) is heard. A key consideration when an application is made at either of these stages is the preservation of the company's assets and the importance of avoiding a situation whereby the company's assets are diminished by an unsuccessful appeal ( Lane Cove Council v Geebung Polo Club Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] NSWSC 118 ; (2002) 167 FLR 175. Therefore, in deciding whether to grant approval a court will consider the solvency of the company and whether the director offers to undertake to pay the costs if the appeal is unsuccessful (see Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd (supra) at [24]-[33]).</text>

<tocase>Shakespeares Pie Co Australia Pty Ltd v Multipye Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1338</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/1338.html</AustLII>
<text>Applying these principles to the facts, I do not think that leave under s 459S should be granted. I have divided the grounds upon which the debt might be disputed into those which relate to the principal amount and those which relate to interest. Leave should not be granted in relation to the grounds which bear on the principal amount because even on a preliminary consideration there is no genuine dispute in relation to the principal amount and, furthermore, Helimount's explanation for not applying to set aside the statutory demand is unsatisfactory. Leave should not be granted in relation to the grounds which bear upon the interest because the explanation for not applying to set aside the statutory demand is unsatisfactory and, more importantly, it is not clear to me (and in terms of s 459S(2) I am not satisfied: see Shakespeares Pie Co Australia Pty Ltd v Multipye Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1338 per Barrett J at [10]) that grounds bearing upon the interest are material in proving Helimount is solvent. In other words, it is not clear to me that Helimount is not saying that it is solvent irrespective of Web Wealth's claim for interest.

I decline to grant leave under s 459S.

Section 95A of the Corporations Act provides: 
 
 
 
 '95A(1) A person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable. 
 
 
 
 95A(2) A person who is not solvent is insolvent.'</text>

<tocase>Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCA 37 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 661</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2000/37.html</AustLII>
<text>The matter referred to in (iii) is an express limit on the power to grant leave (s 459S(2)) and its scope and operation have been considered in later cases. The issue which has arisen is whether s 459S(2) means that the debt must on the company's case make the difference between a finding of solvency and a finding of insolvency, or is it sufficient that depending on what other findings are made it may be relevant to the question of solvency? The New South Wales Court of Appeal in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCA 37 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 661 favoured the former interpretation. Spigelman CJ (with whom Handley and Giles JJA agreed) said (at 674 [53]-[54]): 
 
 'By the time an application under s 459s is made, the company will be presumed to be insolvent and will have the burden of proving that it is not. In my opinion s 459s(2) directs attention, in part, to what it is that the company intends to prove and how it intends to prove it. If the company is not prepared to contemplate the possibility that its assertion of solvency is subject to qualification, then the Court cannot be "satisfied" of the mandatory precondition in s 459s(2). An objective element is introduced by the word "material" but that can only be determined after identifying the company's contentions. 


 
 If, as here, the company intends to prove that it is solvent whether or not a debt is payable, then with respect to a ground based on dispute about the debt, the test of materiality to it "proving" its solvency, cannot be satisfied.'</text>
