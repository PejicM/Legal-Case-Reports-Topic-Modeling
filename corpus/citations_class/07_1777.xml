<text>34 All the individual respondents were knowingly concerned in such contraventions and thus are liable by virtue of s 75B. They were aware of the essential facts which constituted the contraventions indeed it was the individuals themselves who engaged in the relevant conduct. That they were not aware that the conduct was unlawful is relevant to the fixing of penalty but does not avoid liability: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661.

35 The original 1992 Agreement and its amendments and successive agreements were conceived by the orthodontists with extensive and ongoing legal advice. There seems to have been a widespread misunderstanding amongst the lawyers involved (and possibly many other lawyers) that professions were not subject to the Trade Practices Act . The assumption of legality was reinforced when Dr Gupta, prior to becoming a signatory to the Agreement in 2000, furnished the then existing contracts to a separate solicitor for perusal and that solicitor similarly failed to raise any competition law issues. The same occurred when Dr Stankevicius joined the arrangements.

36 While of course ignorance of the law is not an excuse, the Commission, properly in my view, accepts that the failure of lawyers in separate firms to properly advise their clients is a matter that goes some way towards explaining and mitigating the conduct of the orthodontists.</text>
