<text>11 The Tribunal Member referred to the discussion of the Tribunal's jurisdiction by the Full Court in Lees v Comcare (1999) 56 ALD 84, which contained the observation (at [39]) that although the Tribunal has the powers of the original decision-maker under s 43(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), they are:
 
 'powers "[f]or the purpose of reviewing" the reviewable decision, not powers that may be exercised at large. Further, the powers and discretions that the [Tribunal] may exercise under s 43(1) are the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the determining authority for the purposes of reconsidering a determination under s 62 of the Act. The [Tribunal] will not be authorised on review of a reviewable decision to exercise any powers and decisions which would not have been available to the determining authority at the second tier decision-making stage, albeit that such powers and discretions might have been available to the determining authority at the first tier decision-making stage. '

17 There is no form of notice of injury legally prescribed. What is a 'notice of injury' complying with s 53 is, as Whitlam J noted in Frosch v Comcare [2004] FCA 1642 at [8] , a matter of law.

18 The original decision-maker might conceivably have had many powers, the exercise of which may have been prompted by what he or she knew of the applicant's claim, without those powers being powers or discretions relevant to the exercise of the decision to be made. However, it seems to me that the Tribunal Member did not adequately appreciate or apply the following legal propositions, which I think are correct:
 
 
 1. In construing a document purporting to be a notice of injury under the Act, a broad, generous and practical interpretation should be made, consistent with both the beneficial purposes of the Act and the likelihood that laypeople of differing levels of education, differing levels of medical advice and differing levels of legal advice (indeed in most cases they would not have any) will be giving the notice.
 2. In deciding what injury it is, as to which a claimant has given notice, the purposes of giving notice must be borne in mind. These are to enable Comcare, with the aid of the relevant employing agency, to determine whether the claim should be met.
 3. The powers of an original decision-maker would extend to regarding informal notice as having been given in amplification of a notice formally given. 
 4. Those powers would further extend to enabling a consideration of a claim better explaining, or better justifying, a claim in respect of an injury in respect of which notice had been fairly given.
 5. There is not always a bright dividing line available to assist in the decision whether powers of the kinds mentioned are being exercised in aid of a better understanding of a claim made in respect of an injury of which notice has been given, or whether the changed notice is sufficiently fundamental as to indicate that a different injury is being asserted, which will require a different decision from a decision in respect of the originally claimed injury under consideration. In determining that matter, considerations of the purpose of giving notice of injury, and more generally of enabling the decision-maker to have a fair opportunity to investigate the claim properly, are paramount.

19 While no legal criticism can be made of the Tribunal for declining to accept counsel's invitation to reconsider the matter entirely, since something new in 2002 was being propounded as the injury, it seems to me to have been over-technical, and to have been a legally impermissible mode of interpretation, to hold the applicant irretrievably to the use of what was plainly the then medical diagnosis which he had received.</text>
