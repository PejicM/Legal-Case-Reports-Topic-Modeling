<tocase>VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1334</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2005/1334.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The appellant is a citizen of India and a Christian. He applied for a protection visa alleging a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground that the Indian authorities would be unable to provide him with effective protection against Hindu extremists. His application was refused by a delegate of the Minister and on review by the Refugee Review Tribunal. An application for review to the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed by Hartnett FM: VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1334.

2 The appellant submits that the Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error because:
 
&#8226; there was no evidence to support a critical finding of fact by the Tribunal; and
 
&#8226; having expressed doubt about some of its findings, the Tribunal did not proceed to consider the consequences if it were wrong.

3 The appellant also sought leave to raise grounds which were not argued before the Magistrate namely: 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth); and
 
&#8226; failed to deal with essential integers of the appellant's claims.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>17 To succeed on the "no evidence" ground the appellant would have to show that there was no evidence at all upon which the finding could have been based: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 356. Thus the question is not whether the court on judicial review would have reached the same finding on conflicting evidence. There was in the present case some evidence to support the finding, as properly understood.

18 The finding complained of must be identified accurately. In the present case the appellant's argument rests upon a misreading of the finding in question. India is a vast country. The Tribunal could not be reasonably taken as saying that it was satisfied that literally in every instance of attacks against religious minorities police across India have always taken action to respond. Viewed in context, the point the Tribunal is making is that while there is some protection generally in India against attacks against religious minorities, the position in Tamil Nadu, where the appellant comes from, is more favourable.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/609.html</AustLII>
<text>23 First there is question whether leave should be granted to raise this point, which was not argued before the Magistrate. For the reasons given in SZCJD [2006] FCA 609 at [19] , I think the appellant should have leave. The operation of s 424A has been the subject of a recent Full Court decision handed down on 24 February 2006, SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2. In that case there crystallised for the first time at Full Court level what Weinberg J at [121] described as the "unanticipated but potent combination" of the Full Court's decision in Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 and the High Court's decision in SAAP [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162. It may be true, as counsel for the Minister in the present case pointed out, that there were single judge decisions in June and July 2005 which considered this point, and the hearing before the Magistrate took place on 7 September 2005. Nevertheless some reasonable allowance should be made for the blizzard of cases concerning the Act that descend upon the profession and some time allowed before they can be taken as absorbed into the general understanding, even of those specialising in this area.

45 In SZCJD [2006] FCA 609 I rejected a s 424A argument primarily because the protection visa application and its characterisation as vague and general were not the Tribunal's reason or part of its reason for its decision. I held (at [42]) that in any event s 424A(3)(b) applied as the applicant had given the information in the course of answering the question put by the Tribunal.</text>

35 In SZEEU [2006] FCAFC 2 a Full Court dealt with five cases raising s 424A points. In one of these cases, the appeal in SZBMI , the appellant had said in his protection visa application that he had fled from Bangladesh (referred to in the case as "the flight information"). This was drawn to the appellant's attention by the Tribunal but no particulars in writing were given. The Tribunal recorded that the appellant had confirmed at the hearing that he had read his protection visa application statement before signing it and that it was true and correct.</text>

25 However, subs (3) provides that the section does not apply to certain sorts of information, including information "(b) that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application". In Al Shamry the Full Court held that "the application" means the application for review by the Tribunal and does not include the information given by the applicant for the purposes of the initial visa application to the Department. In SAAP a majority of the High Court held that if s 424A(1) applies, the obligation is not satisfied by putting the information orally to the applicant in the course of the Tribunal hearing.

32 In NAZY [2005] FCA 744 the appellant had made a certain statement in answer to a question in his protection visa application form. The Tribunal in the course of the hearing referred to an inconsistency between the answer to that question and the appellant's oral evidence before the Tribunal as one of the reasons for rejecting his claim. The inconsistency was put orally to the appellant in the course of the hearing. Jacobson J held that s 424A(1) was not complied with. It was put to his Honour that Al Shamry was distinguishable because the appellant had referred to the protection visa application form when asked about it by the Tribunal and said that the information in it was true and correct. Counsel for the Minister relied on Gray J's decision in M55.</text>

30 I therefore accept that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A(1). The critical question then becomes whether the information in question fell within the exception created by s 424A(3)(b).

<tocase>M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [24] , [25]</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/131.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In M55 [2005] FCA 131 Gray J had to deal, amongst other things, with an argument that the Tribunal had wrongly relied on the use by the applicant of his Sri Lankan passport on several occasions in leaving that country, the inference being that because the Sri Lankan authorities had not confiscated it they had no interest in him. His Honour held (at [24]) that the Magistrate was wrong in finding that the provision of the passport as part of the original application for a protection visa was sufficient to exclude the operation of s 424A(1). However, in his Honour's view that was not the end of the matter. He held (at [25]) that because, by means of the written submission of his counsel to the Tribunal, the appellant replied expressly on the terms of his protection visa application he thereby invited reference to the copy passport which was attached to his application form. There could be little doubt that the appellant intended that the Tribunal should look at this material. His Honour said:
 
 "In my view, he thereby provided the passport, and the information to be derived from it, to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application for review. This was sufficient for the appellant to have been taken to give the information contained in the copy passport to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application for review, and therefore for that information to fall within s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act ."

32 In NAZY [2005] FCA 744 the appellant had made a certain statement in answer to a question in his protection visa application form. The Tribunal in the course of the hearing referred to an inconsistency between the answer to that question and the appellant's oral evidence before the Tribunal as one of the reasons for rejecting his claim. The inconsistency was put orally to the appellant in the course of the hearing. Jacobson J held that s 424A(1) was not complied with. It was put to his Honour that Al Shamry was distinguishable because the appellant had referred to the protection visa application form when asked about it by the Tribunal and said that the information in it was true and correct. Counsel for the Minister relied on Gray J's decision in M55.

34 It would seem that Jacobson J did not regard Gray J's decision in M55 as wrong. Rather, that case was to be distinguished on the basis that there the appellant had expressly adopted and put forward as part of his application to the Tribunal the earlier information whereas in NAZY the appellant had adopted the earlier information in answer to a question from the Tribunal.

39 M55 was not mentioned in SZEEU . Implicitly the members of the Full Court accepted that Jacobson J was correct in treating M55 rightly decided, but distinguishable.

40 In another of the cases dealt with in SZEEU , the case of SZDXA , the relevant information was that the appellant had entered Australia on a business visa. The Tribunal originally came to know this from another source but as Moore J said at [91]:
 
 "... it is tolerably clear from the Tribunal's reasons that it discussed this fact ... with the appellant and he affirmed he had. Thus it was information comprehended by s 424A(3)(b) even though it was information also derived from an alternative source."

41 The distinction between this case and SZBMI (see [35]-[37] above) was not explained.

42 In dealing with the same case Weinberg J said at [179]: 
 
 "... if an applicant makes a statement during the course of an airport interview that is inconsistent with later evidence given at a hearing, s 424A(1) requires that written notice be given of the possible use of that statement to draw inferences against the applicant. If, however, the applicant repeats the earlier statement at some stage during the course of the hearing, and adopts it as true, and then subsequently resiles from that statement, the Tribunal is not obliged to afford the applicant an opportunity to comment upon the discrepancy: see generally SZEFM [2006] FCA 78 per Bennett J. This is because the adoption of the earlier statement brings it within the scope of the s 424A(3)(b) exception. If, however, the Tribunal proposes to use the earlier statement as the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review rather than the later adoption, it must comply with s 424A(1)."</text>

<text>32 In NAZY [2005] FCA 744 the appellant had made a certain statement in answer to a question in his protection visa application form. The Tribunal in the course of the hearing referred to an inconsistency between the answer to that question and the appellant's oral evidence before the Tribunal as one of the reasons for rejecting his claim. The inconsistency was put orally to the appellant in the course of the hearing. Jacobson J held that s 424A(1) was not complied with. It was put to his Honour that Al Shamry was distinguishable because the appellant had referred to the protection visa application form when asked about it by the Tribunal and said that the information in it was true and correct. Counsel for the Minister relied on Gray J's decision in M55.

34 It would seem that Jacobson J did not regard Gray J's decision in M55 as wrong. Rather, that case was to be distinguished on the basis that there the appellant had expressly adopted and put forward as part of his application to the Tribunal the earlier information whereas in NAZY the appellant had adopted the earlier information in answer to a question from the Tribunal.

36 Moore J (at [20]) did not accept that "by adopting the statement at the hearing before the Tribunal the flight information was transformed into information provided by the appellant in his application review". His Honour went on to say:
 
 "If the Tribunal comes to know of what was said by an applicant at a point before any application for review was made, and views what was said at that time as material to its assessment of what was later said by an applicant, then the mere adoption of the earlier statement during the review process would not result in the knowledge (and relevantly information in the present appeal) being comprehended by s 424A(3)(b). Different considerations could arise if it was clear the Tribunal treated only the adoption of the earlier statement as the fact relevant to its consideration of the application in the review. In those circumstances the fact of adoption would almost certainly constitute information provided by the applicant in the application on which the exclusion would operate. However, it cannot be said, in this case, that the Tribunal acted in such a way." 


His Honour said that NAZY was correct. His Honour did not further explain the distinction between mere adoption and the fact of the adoption. I am not sure that I understand it.

37 Weinberg J said (at [157]):
 
 "The adoption of the earlier statement by the appellant during the hearing before the Tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review."

38 Allsop J (at [219]) agreed with Moore J that the flight information was "information" within the meaning of s 424A(1) but held, contrary to Moore and Weinberg JJ, that such information was part of the reason for affirming the decision. His Honour did not deal expressly with the subs (3) point.</text>

<tocase>SZCKD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 451 at [34] , [37]</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/451.html</AustLII>
<text>43 In SZCKD [2006] FCA 451 the Tribunal relied in part on the absence of certain information from the applicant's protection visa application, which was referred to before the Tribunal. Graham J noted that the appellant's migration agent sent to the Tribunal a 31 page fax which included a statutory declaration made by him in the course of his application for a protection visa. His Honour said at [34] that the "inescapable conclusion" was that all of the information contained in the fax, which constituted the application for review as submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant's agent, constituted information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the meaning of s 424A(3)(b). His Honour referred to the statements already mentioned from SZEEU and (at [37]) distinguished the case before him saying:
 
 "This case is quite different from one where in the course of a hearing before a Tribunal member an earlier statement was adopted. In this instance the information to which the Tribunal referred in its reasons was information derived from the documents which the appellant gave to the Tribunal for the purpose of the review application." (Emphasis in original)

44 In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 , a decision handed down on the same day as SZCKD , the Tribunal had stated in its reasons that it had the Department's file before it and had considered its contents. In his letter in support of the application for review to the Tribunal the appellant, dealing with the reasons he had left China, said "As I explained before" and "I gave full explanations in my previous statement". Rares J rejected the Minister's argument that the incorporation by this reference was of everything which the appellant had put before the delegate, and not just so much of the material as related to the events surrounding his leaving China. His Honour said (at [36]) that when it is sought to say that a person "republished" something which had been provided at a different time, an objective assessment is called for. After reference to the concept of objective assessment in the law of defamation, contract, trade practices and passing off, his Honour concluded that a subjective criterion could not have been intended by Parliament in the case of s 424A. His Honour noted the earlier decision of SZDMJ [2005] FCA 1034 where Gyles J held that there was a "clear republication of original claims made in a declaration by the applicant as part of his application for review".</text>

His Honour said (at [36]) that when it is sought to say that a person "republished" something which had been provided at a different time, an objective assessment is called for. After reference to the concept of objective assessment in the law of defamation, contract, trade practices and passing off, his Honour concluded that a subjective criterion could not have been intended by Parliament in the case of s 424A. His Honour noted the earlier decision of SZDMJ [2005] FCA 1034 where Gyles J held that there was a "clear republication of original claims made in a declaration by the applicant as part of his application for review".</text>

<text>44 In SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 , a decision handed down on the same day as SZCKD , the Tribunal had stated in its reasons that it had the Department's file before it and had considered its contents. In his letter in support of the application for review to the Tribunal the appellant, dealing with the reasons he had left China, said "As I explained before" and "I gave full explanations in my previous statement". Rares J rejected the Minister's argument that the incorporation by this reference was of everything which the appellant had put before the delegate, and not just so much of the material as related to the events surrounding his leaving China.

<tocase>SZDPY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 627 at [35] , [36]</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/627.html</AustLII>
<text>46 In SZDPY [2006] FCA 627 the Tribunal had relied on the appellant's educational history in India and in Australia as a basis for its finding as to the reasonableness of relocation within India. The appellant conceded that at the hearing before the Tribunal he had done more than simply adopt information concerning his education in Australia; in response to the Tribunal's questioning he had actively given details of his education in this country. However, he argued that answers regarding his education in India were in response to leading questions from the Tribunal where in effect he was asked to do no more than confirm the details in his original visa application.

47 Kenny J found that the appellant specifically provided the Tribunal with his Indian education details. Her Honour (at [35]) rejected the submission that the information did not fall within s 424A(3)(b) because it was given in response to questions in the nature of cross-examination. The Tribunal's questions "were specific and arose, naturally enough, from the appellant's visa application". Her Honour considered that SZEEU supported the proposition that where an applicant affirms a specific fact before the Tribunal that information will be covered by s 424A(3)(b) , even if it came from another source. Her Honour found (at [36]) that the appellant did not "merely adopt" the education information in his visa application. At the Tribunal hearing he "separately and specifically" gave detailed information about his Indian education.

48 For no apparent reason, almost all the discussion of s 424A(3)(b) in the cases proceeds on the basis that the provision uses the word "provide". The subsection in fact uses the verb "to give", which simply conveys the notion of delivering or handing over (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). If this matter were free from authority, there would be much to be said for the view that an applicant "gave" information for the purpose of the Tribunal review application if the information was delivered to the Tribunal by the applicant, whether in answer to a question asked by the Tribunal or whether volunteered. Either way, the information is conveyed from applicant to Tribunal. If we were to read or hear "At the trial, A gave information about fact X to the court", we would take that as equally comprehending the possibility of A giving evidence about X in chief, or in cross-examination, or in answer to a question from the judge.

49 Likewise, if an applicant says to the Tribunal "What I said in my visa application is true" and that application contains fact X, the normal meaning conveyed would be that the applicant is giving the information constituted by fact X to the Tribunal, as well as the further fact that fact X had been asserted by the applicant when he made the visa application.

51 In any event, in the present case, the information in question was positively advanced on behalf of the appellant in the letter of 9 December 2002. The reasoning in M55, SZCKD, SZCJD and SZDPY applies.

52 Counsel submitted that the Tribunal had to determine "substantive issues which arise on the evidence and material before it". He referred to a number of instances where the Tribunal had used expressions such as "The evidence ... has led me to be unable to accept that the essential and significant reason for the assault was his religious practice", "Aspects of the applicant's account have led me to doubt that he has provided accurate accounts of what occurred", and "I am unable to accept the accounts he has provided of what occurred in June and December 1999 are accurate" etc.</text>

<text>50 Such a reading of s 424A(1) and (3)(b) would be consistent with common law concepts of natural justice which require the decision-maker to give the person affected notice of relevant information obtained from another source but not, generally speaking, to invite comment on the evaluation of material submitted by the person himself: see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592 and the cases there cited.</text>

<text>53 I would not grant leave to raise this argument. There is no explanation for it not being raised before the Magistrate. In any event, it has no reasonable prospects of success. The Act imposes no obligation to make positive findings in accepting or rejecting claims: VSAF [2005] FCAFC 73 at [16] - [17] . In a situation like the present one where the Tribunal expresses doubts about the appellant's account of specific events, it is unreal to expect the Tribunal to go on and make positive findings as to what in fact did happen.

54 The appeal will be dismissed with costs.
