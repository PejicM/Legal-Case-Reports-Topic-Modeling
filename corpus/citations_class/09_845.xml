<tocase>Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd (2000) 48 NSWLR 661</tocase>
<text>Section 459S(2) of the Corporations Act provides that leave is not to be granted unless the Court is satisfied that the ground relied upon is material to proving that the company is solvent. The primary judge concluded that a challenge to the debt will be material to proving that the company is solvent if the company is able to demonstrate that if the debt does not exist, then the company will be solvent. That approach is conventionally understood as the "narrow approach" to s 459S of the Corporations Act . In adopting that approach, the primary judge applied the reasoning of Spigelman CJ in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd (2000) 48 NSWLR 661 at 674 and particularly at [56]. The observations of the Chief Justice are consistent with the views expressed by Perram J in Grant Thornton Services (NSW) Pty Limited v St George Wholesale Distributors Pty Limited [2008] FCA 1777 at [19] to [22].</text>

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129</tocase>
<text>In addition to the question of construction of the relevant provision of the Act, his Honour also turned to some of the affidavit material and the facts reflected in those affidavits. At [10] of the primary judge's reasons in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 129 on 12 February 2009, the primary judge said this: 
 The evidence lead on behalf of Neo Rock on the application is noteworthy for its absence of reference to the overall financial position of that company. There is no evidence which touches upon the assets and liabilities of the company generally, its profit and loss, its balance sheet, or its solvency, either having regard to the debt as it presently stands (which has its origins in that which supported the statutory demand) or otherwise howsoever. The focus of the affidavit material which has been read is on dealings as between Neo Rock and the Australian Taxation Office (the ATO) in the context of an as yet unresolved audit of that company's taxation affairs by the ATO.

The primary judge noted that the company had engaged a chartered accountant, Mr Vicca, to assist the company with the task of bringing its business activity statements up to date. Mr Vicca expressed certain opinions about the balance debt due to the Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner in response filed affidavit material which suggested that the present indebtedness of the company to the Deputy Commissioner and therefore payable as a debt due to the Commonwealth was $24,132.01. The company contests aspects of that assertion and did so before the primary judge. The primary judge also noted at [13] that the company had failed to lodge income tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.

The primary judge concluded at [14]: 
 It is not a satisfactory state of affairs for a company, faced with an application for its winding up in respect of a debt which it has not contested in the way provided for when a statutory demand was issued, to seek an indefinite adjournment of a winding up application on the strength of what is, in substance, an assertion unfocussed on the subject of proof of the solvency of the company.</text>
