<tocase>Hill v Evans (1862) 31 LJ Ch 457</tocase>
<text>65 With a prior paper anticipation as alleged here, and applying the reverse infringement test, with assistance from the words of Lord Westbury LC in Hill v Evans (1862) 31 LJ Ch 457 at 463, the following can be stated:
 
 "...The antecedent statement [here the Euro-patent] must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive, understand and be able practically to apply the discovery [the disclosure in the Euro-patent] without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful. If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the careful application of the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid patent."

66 Mr Ben-Meir propounded a disclosure analysis of the Euro-patent which saw all the integers of the patent in suit disclosed. Dr Clarke agreed with the "technical substance" of Mr Ben-Meir's disclosure analysis, but he expressed the view that the disclosure was not such as to amount to instruction in that he did not think that the Euro-patent provided a person skilled in the art with sufficient information to implement a system contemplated by the patent in suit.

67 Thus the parties were apart on the degree or quality of the exemplification or disclosure in the Euro-patent. Before turning to that question, it is important to appreciate the significance to this aspect of the case of my view of integer (d)(v) for claim 1 and integer (g) for claim 13. My disagreement with the applicants' construction of the aspect of claims 1 and 13 about the means for processing data operating to apply the promotional program rules to user personal data, means that it is necessary for the Euro-patent to reveal in the relevant sense a system and a method whereby that element is disclosed not merely a system of a card "belonging to" or "identified with" one person or a unique number which has points updated after purchasing pursuant to some algorithm, as in the Sushi Train system. My views on the construction of integer (d)(v) of claim 1 and integer (g) of claim 13 make it possible for me to express my views about the question of anticipation fairly shortly.</text>
