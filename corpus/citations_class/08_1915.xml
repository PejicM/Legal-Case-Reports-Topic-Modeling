<tocase>Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 1071</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1071.html</AustLII>
<text>39 There is no general rule that parties having knowledge of a prior contract between different parties may not subsequently enter into a contract with fundamentally inconsistent terms. As I explained in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 4) [2008] FCA 1071 at [98] - [100] , the lack of any such rule is the inevitable consequence of the efficient breach theory of contract, which, although it has occasionally been criticised, remains the controlling theory of contract damages under Australian law: Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157 at [159] .</text>

<tocase>Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68</tocase>
<text>51 The respondents admit they breached an implied term of the Offer Letter, namely that the respondents would not seek to prevent performance of the Offer Letter or withhold its benefits: Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68, 70-71 cited and referred to in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investment Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 , 607; Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228 and CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680. The event which the respondents said gave rise to the breach was the execution of the Woolworths' Letter of Offer on 18 March 2008. However, despite the generous admission of the respondents, I cannot accept that execution of the 18 March 2008 letter constituted a breach of the Butt v M'Donald term.

52 As noted earlier, there is no obligation in contract not to enter a later agreement containing terms inconsistent with a prior contract. Butt v M'Donald does not hold otherwise because it states only that a party will be in breach if it withholds benefits or frustrates the performance of another. In other words, the implied term will be breached only when the party does something that: (1) positively impairs or frustrates another party's ability to perform its obligations; or (2) actually deprives (not just possibly will deprive) the other of a contractual benefit. Entering into an inconsistent contract such as the Woolworths' deal here in itself does neither where, as here, the party subjecting itself to the conflicting obligations is still free to choose which it will perform (confer the benefit) and the date for performance has not yet come due. For example, the respondents could have changed their minds on 19 March 2008 and decided that it would be better to give the lease to Coles and instead breach their agreement with Woolworths. Then they could have changed their minds again on 20 March 2008 and so on. Thus, there was no breach on 18 March of which I can be independently satisfied, notwithstanding the respondents' admission.

53 For its part, Coles submitted that the respondents breached the Offer Letter on 27 March 2008 (see [37 (17)] above) when they informed Coles that they had ceased negotiations but that that breach "was the intended culmination and inevitable consequence of earlier breaches of terms of the Offer Letter" - namely: 
 
1. clause 26 which obliged FKP to enter into an AFL;
 
2. an implied obligation to act in good faith to do all things necessary to grant Coles a lease ("the good faith breach");
 
3. the clause of the Offer Letter which obliged FKP to keep the terms of the Offer Letter confidential.

55 Whether an implied obligation of good faith independently exists and to what extent it might differ from the Butt v M'Donald term are complicated and hotly debated issues in contract law. Moreover, it would not be a simple matter to determine the extent of the respondents' obligation under cl 26 to negotiate and accept an AFL and Lease. (Indeed, that is always a problem in Masters v Cameron heads-of-agreement type cases where later negotiations break down.) For example, at what point could Coles throw its hands up and say that the respondents were unreasonably refusing to negotiate or accept an AFL or Lease such that the default terms ought to apply?

56 Fortunately, it is not necessary to resolve the issues between the parties by reference to the admitted Butt v M'Donald breach or the first two breaches alleged by Coles because I am satisfied on the evidence that more straightforward breaches exist. First, the evidence that the respondents did not and could not obtain the necessary development approvals by 1 October 2008 necessarily implies that those approvals were not obtained by the 1 March 2008 date specified in the Offer Letter. Accordingly, I find that the respondents breached cl 14(b)(5) on 1 March 2008.

57 Secondly, the respondents breached the confidentiality clause of the Offer Letter on 26 February 2008. At the end of the Offer Letter, a clause headed "Confidentiality" provided, in part, as follows:
 
 
 The terms and conditions of this offer are strictly confidential ( Confidential Information ). The Lessor must:
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) not disclose any of the Confidential Information to any person, firm or body corporate;
 
 (ii) not directly or indirectly use, reproduce or deal with the Confidential Information for any purpose without the prior written consent of the Lessee, except on a confidential basis to professional consultants of the Lessor;
 
 ...
 
 
 
 
 
 In any case, where the Lessor must obtain the Lessee's prior written consent, the Lessee is entitled to withhold the giving of its consent for any reason in its discretion, or to give its consent subject to such conditions as the Lessee imposed in its discretion.

58 The respondents admit that they breached this clause when, on 26 February 2008, they disclosed to Woolworths terms of the offer that Coles had agreed (1) to enter into a 20 year lease with an option to take a lease for two further 10 year terms (cll 4 and 5), (2) to pay a percentage at 2% of annual gross sales (excluding GST) in excess of $37,000,000 (cl 7(b)) and (3) to participate in base rent reviews every five years during the term and options to the average of total base and percentage rents payable in the preceding three years (cl 7(d)). That they would admit this is not surprising because during the course of the trial Mr McCoy gave evidence during cross-examination, corroborated by certain of his emails which were tendered as exhibits, that he did in fact disclose this information to a representative of Woolworths on or about 26 February 2008.</text>

<tocase>Carminco Gold &amp; Resources Ltd v Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Ltd (2007) 243 ALR 472</tocase>
<text>4 My present view is that the proper party to the Offer Letter, objectively considered, was and remains Lifestyle, primarily because it is the owner of the Tarneit Property and thus the only party directly capable of conveying a leasehold interest in the property to Coles: see Carminco Gold &amp; Resources Ltd v Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Ltd (2007) 243 ALR 472 at [22] (stating that the identity of the parties is a "simple question as to who, objectively considered, were intended to be the parties to the contract"). Another reason for this view is that the negotiations resulting in the Offer Letter were carried over from a period when FKP was not even in the picture (ie when Lifestyle was still Wilbow and was not owned by FKP), objectively suggesting that for Coles it was never a question of doing a deal with FKP but was rather a question of doing a deal with the owner of the Tarneit Property, whoever that was.

5 There is of course room to take the opposing view. For example, cl 14(b)(3) of the Offer Letter permits Coles to terminate the agreement if the "Lessor" does not own all of the land comprising the Centre by 1 March 2008. From this, one might reasonably infer that the parties contemplated that, whether or not FKP at the time of the execution of the Offer Letter owned the land, it was taking steps to purchase or otherwise acquire that land (whether from Lifestyle or otherwise). No doubt if it were Coles on the other side of the proceeding, Coles would claim that FKP was the lessor, FKP did not own all the land by the specified date and therefore it was entitled to terminate.

6 Ultimately, this issue is not one to which I have given extended consideration for several reasons. For one thing, the respective positions of each side on this issue were never properly developed or addressed in oral submissions. For another, the issue seems like one that the parties ought to be able to come to some kind of agreement about, especially because it is not clear that the question has any practical significance in light of these facts and circumstances (ie where Coles is the complaining party). FKP is the 100% owner of Lifestyle and there does not seem to be any concern that one FKP entity or the other is lacking in resources; regardless of which entity might be made the subject of an order to pay a money judgment. Even if there is an order for specific performance compelling the respondents to grant a lease, which Coles seeks, Lifestyle would not necessarily have to be the party against whom it was directed; it could be crafted as an order directing FKP to cause Lifestyle, as its wholly-owned subsidiary and owner of the property, to grant a lease.

43 I reject those contentions. As the history of the negotiations records, it was just that, negotiations. No concluded AFL or Lease was ever prepared or executed. Moreover, there was also no informal agreement (whether by 8 January 2008 or otherwise) evidenced by the chain of drafts in respect of major points objectively demonstrating a present intent of the parties to be bound so as to fall within the so-called fourth category of Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353: see Carminco Gold (2007) 243 ALR 472 and Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 at [25] - [29] .</text>

However, despite the generous admission of the respondents, I cannot accept that execution of the 18 March 2008 letter constituted a breach of the Butt v M'Donald term.

54 The respondents disputed that they had breached cl 26 on the basis that unless and until Coles proffered an AFL that they wanted to execute, there could be no breach and that no such AFL was proffered by Coles until 23 June 2008. The respondents also disputed that they breached the implied obligation to act in good faith on the basis that no such term exists: Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228 and CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680 at [131]-[143].</text>

<text>63 The question of the equitable breach of confidentiality alleged by Coles is in a different category. The conduct relied upon by Coles to make out this claim is the same conduct that I have found constitutes a breach of the confidentiality term in the Offer Letter. Coles argues that equitable and legal obligations of confidence can co-exist. I disagree. In my view, no equitable duty of confidence arises where there is a contractual duty: see Del Casale v Artedomus (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 172 ; (2007) 73 IPR 326 at [118] . The fundamental rule is that equity will not intervene where there is an adequate remedy at law. This was recognised by Fullagar J in Deta Nominees Pty Ltd v Viscount Plastic Products Pty Ltd [1979] VR 167 , 195, where his Honour considered that equity would withhold further remedies for breach of confidence where adequate remedies were available at law.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/12.html</AustLII>
<text>59 Finally, I am of the view that when the respondents informed Coles on 27 March 2008 (see [37 (17)] above) that they were ceasing negotiations with it, that conduct constituted anticipatory breach of the Offer Letter which, in the circumstances which followed, was also a repudiation of that contract: DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423. The relevant circumstances include the fact that the respondents refused to sign the eleventh draft of the AFL sent by Coles to FKP on 23 June 2008 which by then included the resolution of the three outstanding issues in the manner proposed by FKP on 31 January 2008 (see [21 (15)] above) which had initially been rejected by Coles. If that were not enough, by the time these proceedings were commenced in July 2008, it was clear from the manner in which the respondents have defended these proceedings that they have not and do not intend to further perform the Offer Letter, however construed: see DTR Nominees 138 CLR at 434.

60 I should note that my review of the Offer Letter in light of the evidence suggests that the respondents probably committed additional breaches of it. For example, cl 21 of the Offer Letter required the respondents to retain ownership of the premises at least until the Lease was executed. The clause also stated that the Lessor would be liable for "loss, expense or damage" caused by disposal of all or part of its interest in the Centre prior to execution of the Lease. If the respondents conveyed a leasehold interest over the Tarneit Property to Woolworths (there was no evidence of an executed or registered Lease between Woolworths and the respondents, only a letter of offer and an admission of an executed AFL), it would appear to be a breach of cl 21. However, as this and other potential additional breaches were neither pleaded nor squarely raised by the evidence or submissions, I will not address them further.</text>

It is sufficient for present purposes to note that some authorities suggest that anticipatory breach entitles Coles to damages only if it terminates the Offer Letter: see Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 , 48 and Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 , 416-417, 441-442).

<tocase>Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217</tocase>
<text>67 The interaction between the TPA and the law of contract is interesting and has been the subject of previous consideration: see by way of example Concrete Constructions Group v Litevale Pty Ltd (2002) 170 FLR 290; Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217; Mander Forklift Pty Ltd v Dairy Farmers Co-operative (1990) ATPR (Digest) 46-061.

68 In Futuretronics at 239, Ormiston J "expressed [his] doubts whether a contractual promise of itself carries with it any representation as to fact or conduct" actionable by reason of s 51A. His Honour explained the issue (at 238-39) in the following terms:
 
 
 It is hard to believe that normally any promisee with ordinary contractual rights would ... describe himself as having been deceived or misled [based on the mere acceptance of a promise] . It is only when it becomes apparent that the promise cannot be enforced, because, for example, it is either unenforceable or the promisee's rights are valueless or diminished, that one may return to the original promise to inquire whether that promise was of so little substance that it can be concluded that the promisee was indeed misled or deceived in the first place, at the time of his acceptance of the promise. Thus it may then be seen that the promisor originally had no intention to perform his promise or that he originally had no capacity or ability to perform it.
 
 ... 
 


 
 
 It would seem on the authorities that, at the least, a contractual promise would amount to an implied representation that the promisor then had an intention to carry out that promise. If it can be shown that he had no such intention, he would be guilty of misleading or deceptive conduct. Likewise it would seem that such a representation connotes a present ability to fulfil that promise which, if shown to be untrue at the time of making, would likewise characterise the implied representation as misleading or deceptive.

69 As this passage reveals, an express contractual promise or representation will constitute an actionable implied representation under s 52 of the TPA only if the party making the promise or representation had no intention or capability of carrying it out at the time it was made (ie the promisor had no reasonable grounds for making the promise). The questions which then arise are (1) what is the contractual promise in this case and (2) did the respondents have the intention and ability to carry it out at the time it was made?

70 In the present case, the specific promise relied on by Coles is the promise to grant a lease. It cannot be doubted that, on the evidence before the Court, the respondents had both the ability and intent to fulfil that promise at the time it was made. More broadly, the respondents admit that they impliedly represented to Coles that they would perform all obligations under the Offer Letter including an obligation to execute an AFL. Despite extensive cross-examination of the respondents' witnesses, Coles failed to establish that the respondents did not have such an intention or capability at the time the representations were made and at all times prior to 26 February 2008 when Lifestyle commenced negotiations with Woolworths to lease part of the Tarneit property to Woolworths. In my view, the evidence establishes that the respondents had reasonable grounds for making representations and promises of the kind contained in the Offer Letter and thus those representations and promises were not misleading or deceptive within the meaning of ss 51A and 52 of the TPA.

71 The question which then arises is whether the respondents' conduct in the period from 27 February 2008 to 27 March 2008, said to constitute representations by silence and implication, was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive Coles? The answer to that question is no as well.</text>

<tocase>Golden Sands Pty Ltd v Excel Quarries Pty Ltd [2008] VSC 276</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/2008/276.html</AustLII>
<text>73 This view has been consistently followed over the years, most recently in Golden Sands Pty Ltd v Excel Quarries Pty Ltd [2008] VSC 276 at [302] n 41. Again, however, even if it were not a matter of settled authority, I would apply such a rule as a matter of logic and basic principle. As a matter of basic contract law, a term will not be implied except in very limited circumstances (primarily where it is obvious, reasonable and necessary to make the contract work): Golden Sands at [223] and authorities there cited. In this case, Coles' alleged representation by silence and implication effectively amounts to a claim that there was an implied term of exclusivity - that is, that the respondents would negotiate exclusively with Coles - in circumstances where such a term could not be implied under contract law because it is not necessary to make the contract work. Thus not only would the rule that s 52 imposes a duty to advise as to the subjective interpretation of the contract destroy objective contract theory, it would also provide a means around the limitations on the implication of terms under the law of contract.

74 So radical a position cannot be accepted. In my view, the failure of the respondents to disclose their subjective view that the Offer Letter (or a particular clause therein) was not binding, that they would not adhere to a particular interpretation of a clause, or that they considered themselves free to take on or pursue agreements containing obligations inconsistent with those arising under the Offer Letter is not actionable under s 52 of the TPA.

75 Further, I should note that even if, contrary to the view I have formed, the representations alleged by Coles were actionable under s 52 , there would be a real question as to whether Coles is entitled to any relief over and above what it might get in contract, given that Coles seeks only damages under s 82 of the TPA.</text>

72 In Mander Forklift , Cole J stated the rule regarding representations by silence or implication as bearing on the interpretation or performance of a contract:
 
 
 Silence concerning a view of the proper interpretation of a contract, or that a mutually known term of a contract will be enforced can rarely, if ever, constitute conduct within s 4(2) of the Trade Practices Act 197[4] (generally see Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v IUM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 ; Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 79 ALR 83. To construe s 52 as imposing an obligation upon a party to a contract to advise the other party both of its interpretation of clauses in the contract, and that the clauses in the contract will be enforced or adhered to destroys the very basis of objective interpretation of contracts to which Mason J referred in Codelfa [ Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337] , 352).</text>

Moreover, there was also no informal agreement (whether by 8 January 2008 or otherwise) evidenced by the chain of drafts in respect of major points objectively demonstrating a present intent of the parties to be bound so as to fall within the so-called fourth category of Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353: see Carminco Gold (2007) 243 ALR 472 and Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 at [25] - [29] .

55 Whether an implied obligation of good faith independently exists and to what extent it might differ from the Butt v M'Donald term are complicated and hotly debated issues in contract law. Moreover, it would not be a simple matter to determine the extent of the respondents' obligation under cl 26 to negotiate and accept an AFL and Lease. (Indeed, that is always a problem in Masters v Cameron heads-of-agreement type cases where later negotiations break down.) For example, at what point could Coles throw its hands up and say that the respondents were unreasonably refusing to negotiate or accept an AFL or Lease such that the default terms ought to apply?</text>

<text>61 The relief to which Coles is entitled as a consequence of these breaches is a matter to be addressed in subsequent proceedings. With respect to the third breach (the anticipatory breach), for example, there is a question as to whether a plaintiff's election to hold the party to the agreement rather than rescind means that it cannot claim damages. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that some authorities suggest that anticipatory breach entitles Coles to damages only if it terminates the Offer Letter: see Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 , 48 and Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 , 416-417, 441-442). Of course any issue in that regard may be moot in light of the actual breaches: see Ogle v Comboyuro Investments Pty Ltd [1976] HCA 21 ; (1976) 136 CLR 444 , 450; Huppert v Stock Options of Australia Pty Ltd [1965] HCA 30 ; (1965) 112 CLR 414 , 422-423, 426 and 431.</text>

<text>51 The respondents admit they breached an implied term of the Offer Letter, namely that the respondents would not seek to prevent performance of the Offer Letter or withhold its benefits: Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68, 70-71 cited and referred to in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investment Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 , 607; Esso Australia Resources Pty Ltd v Southern Pacific Petroleum NL [2005] VSCA 228 and CGU Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v Garcia (2007) 69 NSWLR 680. The event which the respondents said gave rise to the breach was the execution of the Woolworths' Letter of Offer on 18 March 2008. However, despite the generous admission of the respondents, I cannot accept that execution of the 18 March 2008 letter constituted a breach of the Butt v M'Donald term.</text>
