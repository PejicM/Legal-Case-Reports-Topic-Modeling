<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/88.html</AustLII>
<text>1 These reasons relate to orders sought in a Notice of Motion filed by the applicant ("Jarra Creek") on 6 February 2008 seeking leave for the parties and their respective solicitors and counsel to disclose and use for any purpose related to this proceeding any documents and/or information created, disclosed or obtained in two other proceedings before the Court concerning related issues, namely, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (VID 1650 of 2005) ("the ACCC proceeding") and Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Amcor Limited (VID 1377 of 2006) ("the Cadbury proceeding"). Other orders relating to the form of Opt Out Notice proposed by Jarra Creek and general directions were made on the day of the hearing. In addition, the hearing of questions of privilege and confidentiality was stood over until 7 April 2008.

2 The motion is opposed by the fourth to sixth respondents ("the Visy parties") and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC"), which is not a party to this proceeding but has made submissions on the basis that its interests are affected by the orders sought. The first to third respondents ("the Amcor parties") do not object to the orders sought, nor does Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited, which is not a party to this proceeding.

3 The ACCC's position (and the reason it claims its interests are affected by the orders sought) is that to allow disclosure of proofs of evidence and other materials served on the Visy parties in the ACCC proceeding is premature because the implied undertaking which applies to those proofs of evidence are presently the subject of a reserved decision by Gordon J in the Cadbury proceeding. The implied undertaking, which arises from the production of documents under compulsion of a court order, is that the documents may not be used for purposes other than use in the proceeding in which they were required to be disclosed.

4 On 19 February 2008, Gordon J published reasons for decision (see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88) in which her Honour invited further submissions from the Amcor parties, the Visy parties and the ACCC as to whether the Visy parties are bound by an implied undertaking given in the ACCC proceeding "not to produce the 111 documents enumerated in the Lists of Witnesses Statements filed and served by Visy dated 16 November 2007 and 21 November 2007". These submissions have been filed with the Court, but to date there has been no ruling by her Honour.

5 In these circumstances, I consider that I should await the ruling of her Honour in relation to the documents referred to by the ACCC rather than make a ruling without the benefit of her Honour's reasons in circumstances where there are common legal and factual issues.

6 In relation to the other documents which are not the subject of submissions by the ACCC, there are two questions for decision:
 
&#8226; whether previous orders for discovery made in this proceeding have the effect of overriding the implied undertaking attaching to the documents so that the documents in question must be discovered by the Visy parties; and
 
&#8226; whether the Court should grant leave to disclose the documents notwithstanding any implied undertaking.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/19.html</AustLII>
<text>7 In relation to the first question it is settled law that where documents are required to be produced under compulsion of a court order, an implied undertaking arises that the party who secures access will not make the contents of the documents public, communicate them to any stranger to the litigation, or use them for any purposes other than those related to the litigation in the course and for the purposes of which they were disclosed. Such an undertaking, however, must give way to any inconsistent statutory provision and to orders of a court in other proceedings for discovery and inspection: see Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman [1995] HCA 19 ; (1995) 183 CLR 10 at 32-33 (per Mason CJ).

8 In this case I have made orders for discovery, but the relevance of an implied undertaking arising out of other proceedings was not raised or considered in the making of those orders. I do not regard the discovery orders granted to date as having the effect of automatically overriding any implied undertaking given by the Visy parties in relation to the documents now sought to be inspected. Accordingly, I reject this basis of Jarra Creek's application.

9 The second and more substantial question before me is whether I ought now to grant discovery and inspection of the documents in respect of which the implied undertaking applies, leaving aside for the moment the documents in respect of which the ACCC objects to production at this stage.</text>

<text>12 In Holpitt Pty Ltd v Varimu Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 269 ; (1991) 29 FCR 576 at 579, Burchett J held that the requirement of "special circumstances" when considering an application for release from an implied undertaking meant that the applicant for release must show "some circumstance which takes the matter out of the ordinary course", and that the Court should consider whether the exercise of its discretion would be "in the interests of justice". His Honour also accepted that one relevant circumstance was whether a release from the undertaking could occasion injustice to the person who was required to give discovery.</text>

<tocase>Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Ltd (1992) 38 FCR 217</tocase>
<text>10 Helpful guidance is found in the reasoning in Springfield Nominees Pty Limited v Bridgelands Securities Ltd (1992) 38 FCR 217 at 225, where Wilcox J, after noting that release from such an implied undertaking may be only given in special circumstances (having regard to the onerous nature of a compulsory order of a court to disclose documents), sets out a number of relevant considerations, including:
 
&#8226; the nature of the document;
 
&#8226; the circumstances under which the document came into existence; 
 
&#8226; the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain;
 
&#8226; whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain;
 
&#8226; the nature of the information in the document (and in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information);
 
&#8226; the circumstances in which the documents came into the hands of the applicant; and
 
&#8226; most importantly of all, the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in other proceedings.

13 The reasoning in Springfield 38 FCR 217 was also applied by Jacobson J in Lombe v Pollak [2004] FCA 593 at [19] , where his Honour referred in particular to the question of whether any prejudice may be suffered by the owner of the document.

16 The Visy parties submit that there should be no blanket release from the implied undertaking in this case, and that an opportunity should be provided to non-parties to the litigation whose documents may be disclosed to make submissions as to why any such documents should not be released on discovery in this proceeding. This, it is said, will provide the Court with a chance to consider both the relevant documents and any submissions of non-parties, and then determine whether any prejudice or detriment may accrue to the person providing the information: see the remarks of Wilcox J in Springfield 38 FCR at 225.

17 The Visy parties also refer to s 155AAA(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") which prohibits an official of the ACCC from disclosing "protected information". This expression covers information given to the ACCC in confidence or which was obtained under the search and seizure provisions in Part XID of the Act (which includes information obtained under s 155). These provisions, it is said, justify the expectation of a person producing documents in either the ACCC proceeding or the Cadbury proceeding that the information will not be disclosed in this proceeding, a matter which is said to be a relevant consideration for the Court in its exercise of discretion whether to grant the release.

18 On this point relating to the provisions of the Act , the ACCC also refers to the public interest in enforcement of the Act , the need for transparency in the Act 's application and the interests of judicial decisions being fully informed in the light of all relevant material.

20 Having regard to the formulation of the relevant considerations by Wilcox J in Springfield 38 FCR at 225, in this case it appears that it is necessary to consider granting the release in respect of particular documents, rather than simply granting release in respect of a broad class of documents. Accordingly, in this case, I do not think that an order should be made in the unqualified terms sought by Jarra Creek at this stage. Although I accept that cogent reasons have been advanced by Jarra Creek for the grant of a release in the present case, I am not satisfied that I should grant that release on the global basis sought without first investigating the question of prejudice to non-parties.

21 The position taken by the Visy parties on this application is to oppose the grant of a general release until an opportunity has been given to investigate the position of non-parties. The Visy parties suggest that a practical way forward is for them to prepare a list of those documents in their possession which they consider could reasonably be seen to adversely impact non-parties if disclosed, so that the position of such parties could be investigated if necessary. While I agree that a release from the implied undertaking should not be granted until the issue of prejudice has been canvassed, in my view, all other documents which will not either appear on the list prepared by the Visy parties or be the subject of claims for privilege or confidentiality, should be disclosed immediately so that the matter may progress.

22 An opportunity might be given, if appropriate and necessary, to non-parties who may be affected to submit to the Court what prejudice, if any, might arise if a release from the implied undertaking is granted. Clearly such an exercise may be both expensive and time consuming. In the event that there proves to be a great number of such documents which will require investigation, a suitable modus operandi should be agreed upon to deal in a timely and efficient manner with such investigations. However, it may well be that there are only a few (or even no) documents which would give rise to any arguable prejudice. In this way, the discovery process can move forward.</text>
