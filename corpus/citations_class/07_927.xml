<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/1999/214.html</AustLII>
<text>9 I said in those reasons that it was arguably unconscionable within the meaning of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') for ONGC to threaten to call, or to call, on the performance guarantees, to take advantage of the Banks' propensity to pay, despite, arguably there being no right to call on the performance guarantees. Clough also says that, ONGC is in breach of an implied negative stipulation in the Construction Contract to the effect that it will not, except where Clough is in such breach, call on the performance guarantees or any of them.

<text>10 Clough continues to contend that it would be unconscionable for ONGC to exercise or purport to exercise its apparent legal rights. It points to several equitable norms falling within the "unwritten law" for the purposes of s 51AA of the Act:
 
 
 (a) There is equitable relief analogous to relief against forfeiture even absent waiver or estoppel, where the first party's breach has effectively contributed to the second party's breach, equity may regard it as unconscionable for the first party to exercise its legal rights arising from the second party's breach: Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406. See also Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi [2003] HCA 57 ; (2003) 217 CLR 315, [40], [58]. 
 


 
 
 (b) Equity may restrain the exercise of legal right if it is sought to be used unconscionably in the sense of it being used unreasonably or arbitrarily: Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer [1973] HCA 13 ; (1973) 130 CLR 575.
 
 (c) Equity may relieve against one party's insistence upon rights in circumstances which make that harsh or oppressive. ACCC v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 62 ; (2002) 117 FCR 301.

<text>47 The Banks contend that even if ONGC has incorrectly drawn down on the performance guarantees there are remedies available between Clough and ONGC, for example, by suing the beneficiary for an account and payment of any overpayment under a performance bond: Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar &amp; Food Corporation [1996] 2 Lloyd's LR 524 at 530.

<tocase>Bachmann Pty Ltd v BHP Power New Zealand Ltd [1998] VSCA 40 ; [1999] 1 VR 420</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/1998/40.html</AustLII>
<text>16 The Banks submit that there is no serious question to be tried. At a general level what is said on behalf of the Banks as to the well established independence or autonomy of irrevocable letters of credit, is uncontroversial. A standby letter of credit is a letter of credit which performs the function of providing security against the danger that a party to a contract will fail to perform it: Bachmann Pty Ltd v BHP Power New Zealand Ltd [1998] VSCA 40 ; [1999] 1 VR 420 at 428 [26] . The purpose of a standby letter of credit is "to provide the beneficiary with an unfettered, immediate remedy upon the triggering event on the letter of credit, pending resolution of any dispute on the underlying contract": Ideas Plus Investments Ltd v NAB Ltd (2006) 32 WAR 467 at 478 [34]. A standby letter of credit is not simply a mere method of payment but creates a direct liability upon the banker independent of the underlying contract; Ideas Plus at 477, 497, [33], [99], Bachmann at 429-430 [28]-[29]. The contractual promise between the banker and the beneficiary is unaffected by the terms of any underlying contract between the beneficiary and the applicant for the letter of credit. However the applicant for the letter of credit might be able to apply to prevent the beneficiary from claiming against the banker due to the terms of an underlying contract: Bachmann at 429-430 [28]-[29]. These principles apply equally to the performance guarantees the subject of this application.

19 I now turn to consider a number of relevant authorities. In Bachmann the appellant agreed to design, manufacture, supply and commission steel manufacturing equipment for the respondent. A clause in the Supply Contract required the supplier to provide security for the performance of its obligations, which it did by an irrevocable standby letter of credit in favour of the purchaser. The letter of credit required the purchaser to provide the bank with a statement that the supplier had failed to comply with the contract and a sight draft, which the bank undertook to honour. The relevant clause provided: 
 
 "A party shall not convert into money security that does not consist of money until the party becomes entitled to exercise a right under the contract in respect of the security."

20 Brooking JA with whom Tadgell JA and Ormiston JA agreed said: 
 
 'It is also plain that it is competent to the holder of security provided by the other contracting party to promise as part of the contract under which the security is provided the underlying contract not to do some act in relation to the security except in a certain event. Such a contractual promise is efficacious, not in the sense, of when the security is constituted by the obligation of a third person, that the third person can rely by way of defence as against the security holder on a term of the underlying contract, to which he was not a party, but in the sense that relief can be afforded to the person who procured the security in an action brought against the security holder on the promise contained in the underlying contract. No principle or rule of law would deny that a promise forming part of the underlying contract is in this sense efficacious, and the cases recognise this.' [28]

22 The supplier in Bachmann did not seek to establish any case of fraud on the purchaser's part but relied only on the contractual qualification upon the purchaser's powers under the general conditions of the underlying contract to demand payment under the letter of credit. It was conceded that the clause referred to constituted a contractual qualification on the purchaser's powers in relation to the security. This is to be contrasted with earlier Australian cases where the initial question was whether the underlying contract on its proper construction qualified the security holder's powers to claim under the security. The only point in the appeal as his Honour put it was as to the content of the qualification. [30]</text>

<tocase>Bolivinter Oil SA v Chase Manhattan Bank NA [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 251</tocase>
<text>17 The Banks submit that the only traditional exception where a banker may be enjoined, is where the beneficiary is fraudulently attempting to draw down the letter of credit. That is because of the Court's special jurisdiction to prevent fraud, which is wider than the jurisdiction to prevent the beneficiary breaching the underlying contract with the applicant for a letter of credit: Bolivinter Oil SA v Chase Manhattan Bank NA [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 251 at 254, Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG v Wallbrook Insurance Co Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 1017 at 1029-1030, Ideas Plus at 496 [93]. There is no allegation of fraud here and so, the Banks submit, no injunction should be granted against them. The Banks nonetheless rightly, in my opinion, accept that another basis upon which the Banks might be enjoined is by reason of it being allegedly unconscionable, contrary to s 51AA of the Act, for ONGC to exercise its contractual rights in the underlying construction contract and draw upon the performance guarantees although any such restraint would be ancillary to Clough's claim against ONGC.</text>

<tocase>Boral Formwork v Action Makers (2003) ATPR 41-953</tocase>
<text>43 I remain satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether ONGC has acted unconscionably in contravention of s 51AA of the Act in calling on or threatening to call on the performance guarantees despite there being no legal right, on its part, to do so. As Austin J said in Boral Formwork v Action Makers (2003) ATPR 41-953 at [14] when referring relevantly to s 51AA of the Act: "The principle of autonomy, applicable to a standby letter of credit, cannot override the Statute" . I am also satisfied that, upon the same factual matrix, there is a serious issue to be tried whether ONGC is in breach if the negative stipulation conditioning the right to call up the performance guarantees.

44 These findings warrant the continuation of the injunctive orders as against ONGC, and subject to consideration of the balance of convenience, ancillary injunctive orders as against the Banks.

45 In these circumstance it is not necessary for me presently to enter upon the question of the construction of the performance guarantees and in particular whether, as between the Banks and ONGC the obligation to pay under a call is conditioned by 'breach of contract' by Clough, and if so, just what is required to be done by way of notice, or proof, or otherwise, in order for that condition to be satisfied.</text>

<tocase>Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/881.html</AustLII>
<text>6 The affidavit of Mr Malcolm Rutter sworn 15 June 2007 provides a very detailed account of the background to the Construction Contract and what has occurred since its execution. I have set out the relevant factual background as exposed in that affidavit in my reasons of 7 June 2007 when I, amongst other things, restrained ONGC from taking any further step to demand or to obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from any of the respondent Banks under the respective performance guarantees: Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 881 [8]-[23]. It is accordingly not necessary for me to repeat that background detail here. Mr Rutter has variously deposed in his affidavit to the effect that Clough is not in any way in default under the Construction Contract. The Banks do not, understandably, attempt to contradict this. ONGC has not appeared in this application.

7 It is fundamental to Clough's arguments that it is not relevantly in breach of the Construction Contract nor are there any other contractual bases such as to entitle ONGC to make a demand upon the Banks under the respective performance guarantees. It is contended alternatively that if it is in breach then ONGC has contributed to this in the sense that to the extent that Clough has not met any of its obligations, this has been directly caused by ONGC's failure to perform its obligations. In other words Clough's obligations are dependent upon ONGC's performance.

8 Clough says that it has, at all material times, been ready willing and able to comply with its obligations, subject to ONGC's timely performance of its inter-dependent obligations. Clough says that, otherwise, it has completed the work required of it. However, on the evidence of Mr Rutter, ONGC has been in breach of a number of its obligations, including failing to effect necessary well-completion at the deep water field, as well as meeting invoiced payments from Clough in the order of US$7 million.</text>

<text>26 In Ideas Plus Steytler P with whom McLure and Buss JJA agreed concluded that the National Australia Bank (NAB) was empowered to claim under a letter of credit granted by HSBC Bank of Australia Ltd (HSBC) so long as it had a bona fide belief that the conditions were satisfied. The certificate by the NAB issued to HSBC certifying in effect that the conditions of the letter of credit had been met was only a representation of such a bona fide belief and perhaps that there were reasonable grounds for such a belief. [55]-[57], [105] See also Fletcher Construction Australia Limited v Varnsdorf Pty Ltd [1998] 3 VR 812.

<tocase>Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 545</tocase>
<text>34 Gibbs J, having regard to the proper construction of the performance guarantee, said that to hold that the Banks should not pay on receiving a demand, but should be bound to inquire into the rights of the Authority and the contractor under a contract to which the bank was not a party would be to depart from the ordinary meaning of the undertaking that the Bank is to pay on demand. (p 451) However, Stephen J observed that, if the construction contract itself had contained some qualification upon the Authority's power to make a demand under a performance guarantee, the position in relation to the grant of such an injunction might well have been different (p 459). Young J in Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 545 at 550-551 made observations to like effect.

35 In Reed Construction Services Pty Ltd v Kheng Seng (Australia) Pty Ltd (1999) 15 BCL 158, 164 Austin J said: 
 
 'There are three principal exceptions. The first, noted in passing by Gibbs J in the Wood Hall case (at 451) and recognised as well by Young J in Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1986) 2 BCL 366, 370, is that the Court will enjoin the party in whose favour the bond has been given from acting fraudulently. The second exception, recently recognised by the Victorian Supreme Court in Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd, [1997] ATPR (Digest) [46-163], is that the Court will intervene to restrain the party for whose benefit the bond was given from acting unconscionably for the purposes of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 
 
 There is a third exception, which is based on contract and is the most important for present purposes. A line of cases has recognised that whilst the Court will not restrain the issuer of the bond from acting on the unqualified promise to honour it, if the party in whose favour the bond has been given has made a contract promising not to call upon the bond, breach of that contractual promise may be enjoined on normal principles relating to the enforcement by injunction of negative stipulations in contracts.'

<text>32 However, the Court held that there were serious questions to be tried whether the parties were engaged in trade and commerce between Australia and a place outside Australia, for the purposes of s 6(2) of the Act, and whether the head-contractor had acted unconscionably, and in contravention of s 51AA of the Act, by making demand under the mobilisation guarantees, in the sense that it had insisted on strict legal rights in circumstances which made that harsh or oppressive or caused hardship. Accordingly, the sub-contractors were entitled to injunctions in respect of the mobilisation guarantees: ( Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council [1979] 1 NSWLR 537; Stern v McArthur [1988] HCA 51 ; (1988) 165 CLR 489 referred to). Batt J in so finding held that the effect of the Act, applying as it did to international trade and commerce, was to work a substantial inroad into the well-established common law autonomy of letters of credit and performance bonds and other bank guarantees.

Those authorities range from requiring no more than a claimed entitlement which is not specious or fanciful: Hughes Bros Pty Ltd v Telede Pty Ltd (1989) 7 BCL 210 to requiring that the holder of the security establish, whether by litigation or arbitration, an actual entitlement to payment of the moneys: Mitsui Kensetsu Corporation Australia Pty Ltd v State of South Australia (unreported Qld Supreme Court, 9 August 1990 per Byrne J).</text>

<tocase>Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd [1998] 3 VR 380 at 400</tocase>
<text>27 In Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd , sub-contractors provided unconditional bank guarantees to the head contractor known as mobilisation guarantees. Additionally they provided performance bonds again by way of bank guarantees to the head contractor. All the guarantees contained unconditional undertakings by the bank to pay the head contractor on demand. The contracts made between the sub-contractors and the head-contractor were variously expressed to be subject to the laws of India or Switzerland. The contracts also contained an arbitration clause requiring disputes to be arbitrated in Paris.

28 Disputes arose between the sub-contractors and the head-contractor. The sub-contractors claimed that they had performed all their obligations under the contract. The head-contractor denied this. The head-contractor then called up the full amount of the guarantees. The sub-contractors sought interlocutory injunctions requiring the head-contractor to countermand the demands made upon the bank, restraining the head-contractor from making any further demand under any of the guarantees and restraining the bank from making any payment pursuant to any of the guarantees.

29 The mobilisation and bank guarantees all contained irrevocable undertakings on the part of the bank "to pay the buyer at site forthwith on first demand and in writing without protest or demur or proof or satisfaction and without reference to the seller any and all amounts demanded from us by the buyer", subject to an aggregate limit.

35 In Reed Construction Services Pty Ltd v Kheng Seng (Australia) Pty Ltd (1999) 15 BCL 158, 164 Austin J said: 
 
 'There are three principal exceptions. The first, noted in passing by Gibbs J in the Wood Hall case (at 451) and recognised as well by Young J in Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1986) 2 BCL 366, 370, is that the Court will enjoin the party in whose favour the bond has been given from acting fraudulently. The second exception, recently recognised by the Victorian Supreme Court in Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd, [1997] ATPR (Digest) [46-163], is that the Court will intervene to restrain the party for whose benefit the bond was given from acting unconscionably for the purposes of s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 
 
 There is a third exception, which is based on contract and is the most important for present purposes. A line of cases has recognised that whilst the Court will not restrain the issuer of the bond from acting on the unqualified promise to honour it, if the party in whose favour the bond has been given has made a contract promising not to call upon the bond, breach of that contractual promise may be enjoined on normal principles relating to the enforcement by injunction of negative stipulations in contracts.' [emphasis added]

40 As I have mentioned, Batt J was not persuaded, on the evidence before him in Olex Focas , that there was a serious issue to be tried that the head-contractor was acting unconscionably for the purposes of s 51AA of the Act in calling up the performance guarantee. His Honour came to the opposite conclusion on the evidence before him in respect to the mobilisation/procurement guarantees. This was because his Honour considered that the calling up the whole amount secured by this category of guarantees, when the greater part had already been paid, was "according to ordinary human standards, quite against conscience" and accordingly, unconscionable within the terms of the Act.

50 I have already adverted to the well-established line of authority underlining the importance of the certainty generated by letters of credit, performance bonds and the like. The Banks submit that this is an important factor on the balance of convenience and point to the case of Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd where Batt J refused an injunction against either the beneficiary or the bank to prevent payment on performance bonds based on claims of unconscionable conduct contrary to s 51AA of the Act.

51 It is submitted that an injunction may well adversely affect the commercial reputation of the Banks in a way that would mean that those arranging international letters of credit and performance guarantees would prefer banks from other jurisdictions. This, it is contended, gives rise to an unquantifiable difficulty, which means that an undertaking as to damages, by Clough, may well be insufficient to protect the position of the Banks.

52 As between Clough and ONGC I have already concluded, when granting an interim interlocutory injunction against ONGC that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of an injunction because the evidence demonstrated how Clough would be irreparably affected (both financially and through an adverse impact on its reputation) if ONGC were to press its demands and secured payment under the performance guarantees. I found that damages would not be an adequate remedy for Clough on the evidence then before me.

67 In these circumstances, and in light of the serious issues to be tried as between Clough and ONGC, it is necessary, in my opinion, in order to preserve the status quo, and the efficacy of the injunctive orders made against ONGC, given the Banks' intention, otherwise, to pay under the guarantees, to restrain them from doing so: see Olex Focas at p 405.

68 Accordingly I am of the view that the motion by the Banks should be dismissed. 

 I certify that the preceding sixty-eight (68) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.

<text>10 Clough continues to contend that it would be unconscionable for ONGC to exercise or purport to exercise its apparent legal rights. It points to several equitable norms falling within the "unwritten law" for the purposes of s 51AA of the Act:
 
 
 (a) There is equitable relief analogous to relief against forfeiture even absent waiver or estoppel, where the first party's breach has effectively contributed to the second party's breach, equity may regard it as unconscionable for the first party to exercise its legal rights arising from the second party's breach: Legione v Hateley [1983] HCA 11 ; (1983) 152 CLR 406. See also Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi [2003] HCA 57 ; (2003) 217 CLR 315, [40], [58]. 
 


 
 
 (b) Equity may restrain the exercise of legal right if it is sought to be used unconscionably in the sense of it being used unreasonably or arbitrarily: Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer [1973] HCA 13 ; (1973) 130 CLR 575.
 
 (c) Equity may relieve against one party's insistence upon rights in circumstances which make that harsh or oppressive. ACCC v Samton Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 62 ; (2002) 117 FCR 301.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/51.html</AustLII>
<text>32 However, the Court held that there were serious questions to be tried whether the parties were engaged in trade and commerce between Australia and a place outside Australia, for the purposes of s 6(2) of the Act, and whether the head-contractor had acted unconscionably, and in contravention of s 51AA of the Act, by making demand under the mobilisation guarantees, in the sense that it had insisted on strict legal rights in circumstances which made that harsh or oppressive or caused hardship. Accordingly, the sub-contractors were entitled to injunctions in respect of the mobilisation guarantees: ( Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council [1979] 1 NSWLR 537; Stern v McArthur [1988] HCA 51 ; (1988) 165 CLR 489 referred to). Batt J in so finding held that the effect of the Act, applying as it did to international trade and commerce, was to work a substantial inroad into the well-established common law autonomy of letters of credit and performance bonds and other bank guarantees. In that case the bank which operated in Victoria, had made a submitting appearance only.

41 This conclusion was reached although the contractor was, in calling up these guarantees, acting according to his strict legal entitlement: Stern v McArthur [1988] HCA 51 ; (1988) 165 CLR 489.

<tocase>Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/21.html</AustLII>
<text>21 The cases relied upon by his Honour included Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443 at 452-4 per Gibbs J (with whom Mason J agreed) and at 459 per Stephen J. His Honour continued: 
 
 'I do not overlook the credible distinction between the effect of the underlying contract as between the parties to it and its effect (if any) as between the holder of the security and the third person whose obligation constitutes the security. One can for brevity speak of a contractual qualification upon the owner's powers in relation to the security where the underlying agreement between the owner and the contractor or supplier contains a term which restricts the exercise of those powers in some way.' [29]

31 The Court declined to grant injunctions under the general law, they not having established a clear case of fraud by the head-contractor in making demand under the guarantees and that the bank was aware of any such fraud at the time of the post payment. There was accordingly no serious question to be tried in that respect. In so finding the Court applied Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443.

33 In Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority a condition in a contract for the construction of a pipeline required the contractor to provide a cash security or, alternatively, a bank guarantee as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work. This was in the nature of a performance guarantee. Another condition entitled the owner to retain 10% of the progress payments due to the contractor until the work had been performed and accepted in accordance with the contract. The owner, at the contractor's request, agreed to accept a bank guarantee in lieu of the monies retained. This was a so-called retention guarantee. By each of the guarantees the bank unconditionally undertook to pay the owner on demand any sum up to the limit specified in each guarantee. When the work was almost complete, the owner demanded payment from the bank under the guarantee. The contactor sought declarations and orders the purpose of which was to restrain the bank from making payment to the Authority under four instruments described on their face as bank guarantees given by the bank to the Pipeline Authority. The Court there held that the owner was entitled to demand and be paid the amount of the performance guarantee whether or not there had been a want of due and faithful performance of the work, and the monies so paid must be held by him as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work.

34 Gibbs J, having regard to the proper construction of the performance guarantee, said that to hold that the Banks should not pay on receiving a demand, but should be bound to inquire into the rights of the Authority and the contractor under a contract to which the bank was not a party would be to depart from the ordinary meaning of the undertaking that the Bank is to pay on demand. (p 451) However, Stephen J observed that, if the construction contract itself had contained some qualification upon the Authority's power to make a demand under a performance guarantee, the position in relation to the grant of such an injunction might well have been different (p 459). Young J in Hortico (Australia) Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co (Australia) Pty Ltd (1985) 1 NSWLR 545 at 550-551 made observations to like effect.

47 The Banks contend that even if ONGC has incorrectly drawn down on the performance guarantees there are remedies available between Clough and ONGC, for example, by suing the beneficiary for an account and payment of any overpayment under a performance bond: Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar &amp; Food Corporation [1996] 2 Lloyd's LR 524 at 530. See also Australasian Conference Association Ltd v Mainline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) [1978] HCA 45 ; (1978) 141 CLR 335 at 351 and Wood Hall Ltd v Pipeline Authority [1979] HCA 21 ; (1979) 141 CLR 443 at 454. It points also to the fact that there is no suggestion that ONGC would be unable to repay any amount owing. Accordingly damages from ONGC, it is said, would be an adequate remedy.</text>
