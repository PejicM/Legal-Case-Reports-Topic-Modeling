<tocase>Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69</tocase>
<text>11 Various methods of measuring damages for an infringement of copyright have been described in the cases. In Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] 1 Ch 323 at 336, Lord Wright MR said that the measure of damages in a copyright case "is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright as a chose in action". However, the authorities make it clear that is only one method of measuring damages: Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69 ; Bailey 53 FCR at 111-112; Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 240. Another method is to determine the licence fee or royalty the infringing party would have to pay to use the work lawfully. There are difficulties in applying that approach in circumstances where it cannot be inferred that the infringing party would pay a licence fee rather than not use the work ( Autodesk 17 IPR at 75). The applicant did not contend that either of the aforesaid methods was appropriate in this case. It submitted that this was a case in which it was appropriate to treat the damages as being at large and to approach the assessment of damages as a jury would ( Fenning Film Service Ltd v Wolverhampton, Walsall and District Cinemas Ltd [1914] 3 KB 1171 at 1174 per Horridge J). I think that is the proper approach in the circumstances of this case.</text>

<text>10 In relation to the claim for damages under s 115(2) of the Act , the Court, in awarding damages for infringement of copyright, will have regard to similar considerations as attend the award of damages in tort: General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1976] RPC 197. The purpose of an award is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered as a result of the defendant's infringement: Bailey v Namol Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1401 ; (1994) 53 FCR 102 at 110-111.

11 Various methods of measuring damages for an infringement of copyright have been described in the cases. In Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] 1 Ch 323 at 336, Lord Wright MR said that the measure of damages in a copyright case "is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright as a chose in action". However, the authorities make it clear that is only one method of measuring damages: Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69 ; Bailey 53 FCR at 111-112; Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 240. Another method is to determine the licence fee or royalty the infringing party would have to pay to use the work lawfully. There are difficulties in applying that approach in circumstances where it cannot be inferred that the infringing party would pay a licence fee rather than not use the work ( Autodesk 17 IPR at 75).

I think that is the proper approach in the circumstances of this case.

17 In relation to the claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Act , it is appropriate to begin by making the following general observations. First, there is no need for me to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) if no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded nominal damages under s 115(2) ( Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) 38 IPR 451 at 459-461 per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics at 283-284 per Sundberg J). Secondly, it is not necessary that there be a proportionate relationship between the additional damages awarded under subs (4) and the damages awarded under subs (2): Flags 2000 Pty Ltd v Smith (2003) 59 IPR 191 at 198 per Goldberg J. An award of additional damages under subs (4) is not dependent upon the adequacy or inadequacy of an award of damages under subs (2). Thirdly, the matters in subs (4)(b)(i)-(iv) inclusive are not preconditions to an award of additional damages. In other words, and using the flagrancy of the infringement as an example, the Court must have regard to the flagrancy of the infringement in determining whether to award additional damages, but it is not the case that additional damages can be awarded only if the breach involves a particular degree of flagrancy. Fourthly, in the recent case of Flags 2000 Goldberg J suggested that there is a distinction between conduct of a defendant after an infringement (or after being informed that he has allegedly infringed the plaintiff's copyright) and relevant to the substantive allegations against him on the one hand, and the defendant's conduct of his defence to an action for an infringement of copyright in relation to procedural matters on the other. The former matter is within the terms of s 115(4)(b)(ib) of the Act , whereas it has been suggested that the latter matter is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate order as to costs. In Flags 2000 59 IPR at 201, [45]-[46] Goldberg J said:
 "[45] The applicants submitted that the insertion of subparas (ia) and (ib) was declaratory of the position which had existed prior to the amendments. There is substance in that submission as can be seen from cases such as Carson v John Fairfax &amp; Sons [1993] HCA 31 ; (1992) 178 CLR 44 at 71 ; [1993] HCA 31 ; 113 ALR 577 at 597 and Microsoft Corp v Goodview Electronics Pty Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 578. However, the conduct taken into account in those cases was conduct which was relevant to the substantive allegations made against the respondents. For example, in the Microsoft case the respondent filed a defence which proved to be false. Branson J took that fact into account in conjunction with other evidence which showed an intention on behalf of the respondent to conceal the identity of their suppliers to find 'a deliberate pattern of conduct by the respondents in which they recognised the illegality of the enterprise they are engaged in and actively sought to conceal it'. [46] I do not consider that the conduct of the respondent contemplated by subpara (ib) of s 115(4)(b) is referable to conduct of the defence in so far as it relates to procedural matters and matters whereby the applicants are put to the proof of their case, albeit unreasonably. I consider that these are matters more appropriately dealt with by an appropriate order for costs." 
In certain circumstances, the distinction may be a difficult one to apply and there is an obvious need to avoid double-counting. Nevertheless, I agree with the distinction identified by Goldberg J in Flags 2000 59 IPR 191. 
 
Fifthly, an award under s 115(4) of the Act can encompass damages which at common law would be aggravated damages and exemplary damages: Bailey 53 FCR at 113-114.</text>

<text>1 The applicant made a number of claims against the respondents in a proceeding issued in this Court. A judge of the Court made an order that issues of liability be determined separately from and prior to issues of quantum. I heard and determined the issues of liability. My reasons, which I will refer to as my liability reasons, are published in Futuretronics.com.au Pty Limited v Graphix Labels Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1621.

2 On 22 November 2007, I made the following declarations:
 "1. The applicant is the owner of copyright in the artworks. 
 
 2. By the production and distribution of the brochure to the parties listed below the first respondent has infringed the applicant's copyright in the artworks in breach of s 36 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth):
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Mr David Bartlett and Mr Boyd Dainton of Audion Australia on or about 10 October 2006;

<tocase>MJA Scientifics International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275</tocase>
<text>16 I am not satisfied that the applicant has established any loss which should be reflected in an award of damages under s 115(2) of the Act . An award of nominal damages is appropriate to vindicate the invasion of the applicant's proprietary right ( MJA Scientifics International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275 at 281 per Sundberg J) and I award the sum of $10.00.

17 In relation to the claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Act , it is appropriate to begin by making the following general observations. First, there is no need for me to consider if an award of additional damages can be made under s 115(4) if no damages are awarded under s 115(2) because I have awarded nominal damages under s 115(2) ( Polygram Pty Ltd v Golden Editions Pty Ltd (No 2) 38 IPR 451 at 459-461 per Lockhart J; MJA Scientifics at 283-284 per Sundberg J).

<text>15 In view of the above conclusions, it is not necessary for me to consider a submission made by the respondents that if there was any damage in this case it was to the goodwill of the applicant's business and such damage is not recoverable under s 115(2) of the Act . The respondents referred to Paterson Zochonis Ltd v Merfarken Packaging Ltd [1983] FSR 273 at 281-282 per Oliver LJ; at 287 per Fox J; at 294-295 per Goff LJ although that was quite a different case on the facts.</text>

<tocase>Pollock v J C Williamson Ltd [1923] VLR 225</tocase>
<text>20 In my opinion, the infringements of copyright in this case were flagrant. Before 29 September 2006 the second respondent was employed by the applicant and he knew Ms W Hung, who was also an employee of the applicant, and he knew that she had produced the artworks on behalf of the applicant. He left the employ of the applicant and on 4 October 2006 he became an employee of the first respondent. He was responsible for producing the brochure on behalf of the first respondent and he knew the artworks on the brochure belonged to the applicant. Despite this knowledge, he went ahead and used them in a brochure designed to promote the first respondent's products. Whether he actually knew that the use of the applicant's artworks was an infringement of copyright is immaterial ( Pollock v J C Williamson Ltd [1923] VLR 225) ; the important point is that he knew the artworks were the applicant's artworks or, put a different way, that they belonged to the applicant. Although he attempted to say that he did not know he could not use the applicant's artworks because he was a "bit vague as to how all this worked" and that he had used samples with the brands of third parties before, I think he knew that he should not be using the artworks or, at least, was wilfully blind to that fact. As I said in my liability reasons there were unsatisfactory features of the second respondent's evidence (at [51]). As to what was said to be a practice in the printing industry of using other people's brands as illustrative of the work which can be done, it seems to me that it is one thing to use a sample showing a brand which announces itself as a brand of a well-known business; it is quite another for a previous employee of the applicant so shortly after he left the applicant's employ to use the artworks, which in no way announce themselves as belonging to the applicant, to promote his new employer's business.

21 It appears that the principals of the first respondent were prepared to leave, or largely leave, the production of the brochure to the second respondent. Mr Tallent was not able to shed any light on the production of the brochure with the applicant's artworks on it and the change to the second brochure, which it seems had taken place by 16 October 2006. He said that the second respondent would have been engaged "in most of that work and driving that". Mr Taylor said that the brochure was changed to remove the applicant's artworks and replace them with other artworks after he had received a telephone call from Mr Chojna complaining about the use of the applicant's artworks without its permission. He said that the second respondent probably made the change.

22 The respondents submitted that the infringements were few in number and that the evidence was that the first respondent did not intend to produce skins with the artworks on them for sale to customers. I accept the evidence that the first respondent did not intend to use the artworks on skins to be sold to customers.</text>

<tocase>Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65</tocase>
<text>19 The meaning of "the flagrancy of the infringement" has been described in various ways. In Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library Limited [1980] RPC 193 Brightman J referred to it as "scandalous conduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculated copyright infringement"; in Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 70, Gowans J (at 70) referred to it as a "calculated disregard of the plaintiff's rights, or cynical pursuit of benefit"; and in Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 103 flagrancy was said to connote conduct which could probably be described as "glaring, notorious, scandalous" or "blatant". In Polygram at 461-462 Lockhart J said that flagrancy did not include mere mistakes or carelessness and that if the infringer mistakenly believed that he or she owned the relevant copyright, or acted in the bona fide belief that no copyright subsisted in the plaintiff's work then the conduct was not flagrant.</text>

<tocase>Prior v Sheldon (2000) 48 IPR 301</tocase>
<text>13 As far as loss of reputation is concerned the applicant sought to overcome the difficulties it faced by referring to cases in which damages have been allowed for injury to reputation and by submitting that this was such a case. In particular, reference was made to the decision of Wilcox J in Prior v Sheldon (2000) 48 IPR 301. At issue in that case was the damages to be awarded for the infringement of copyright in two original musical works used in connection with a popular television series. One joint owner had claimed sole authorship of the two original musical works. The other joint owner sued for infringement of copyright. Wilcox J referred to the significance of the recognition of authorship in terms of possible future commissions from film and television producers and directors. The infringement of copyright had meant that the innocent party had been unable to enhance her reputation and enhancement of her reputation may have led to future engagements. That loss, said Wilcox J, should be reflected in the award of damages although he said the amount was difficult to calculate. He awarded a sum of $40,000.

14 It seems to me that this case is quite a different one. There is no evidence that any of the three parties who received the brochure placed orders for skins with the first respondent, or were dissuaded from placing orders for skins with the applicant by reason of the distribution of the brochure. For completeness I also note that there was no evidence in this case of damage to reputation caused by the production and distribution of inferior or substandard copies of the artworks.</text>

<tocase>Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88</tocase>
<text>19 The meaning of "the flagrancy of the infringement" has been described in various ways. In Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library Limited [1980] RPC 193 Brightman J referred to it as "scandalous conduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculated copyright infringement"; in Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 70, Gowans J (at 70) referred to it as a "calculated disregard of the plaintiff's rights, or cynical pursuit of benefit"; and in Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 103 flagrancy was said to connote conduct which could probably be described as "glaring, notorious, scandalous" or "blatant". In Polygram at 461-462 Lockhart J said that flagrancy did not include mere mistakes or carelessness and that if the infringer mistakenly believed that he or she owned the relevant copyright, or acted in the bona fide belief that no copyright subsisted in the plaintiff's work then the conduct was not flagrant.</text>

<tocase>Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library Limited [1980] RPC 193</tocase>
<text>19 The meaning of "the flagrancy of the infringement" has been described in various ways. In Ravenscroft v Herbert and New English Library Limited [1980] RPC 193 Brightman J referred to it as "scandalous conduct, deceit and such like; it includes deliberate and calculated copyright infringement"; in Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 70, Gowans J (at 70) referred to it as a "calculated disregard of the plaintiff's rights, or cynical pursuit of benefit"; and in Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 103 flagrancy was said to connote conduct which could probably be described as "glaring, notorious, scandalous" or "blatant".

33 The fifth matter I must have regard to is "any benefit shown to have accrued to the [respondents] by reason of the infringement". In Ravenscroft v Herbert [1980] RPC 193 Brightman J said that in his view "benefit" in the English section implied "that the defendant has reaped a pecuniary advantage in excess of the damages he would otherwise have to pay (see also Polygram 38 IPR at 462 per Lockhart J). There is no evidence that the respondents secured any financial benefit in this case by reason of the distribution of the brochure to the three named parties.

34 I do not think there are any other relevant matters apart from those I have already mentioned.

35 In my opinion, having regard to the matters I have identified, an award of additional damages should be made. It should be a modest award and I award a sum of $10,000.</text>

<text>23 The second matter I must have regard to is the need to deter similar infringements of copyright. It seems to me considering authorities such as Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Miyamoto (aka DJ Moto ) (2004) 62 IPR 605 and Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 that the circumstances may call for an award of additional damages, or a larger award of additional damages, if there is a real need to deter similar infringements of copyright. In Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd the infringers were disc jockeys who were likely to be regarded as role models for others and the infringements were deliberate and in flagrant disregard of the innocent party's rights, and in Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd the respondents had, to use Jacobson J's words in that case (at 41 [175]) "shown utter contempt for the applicants and for the court". This case does not exhibit those features and I think that in this case the need to deter similar infringements of copyright is a somewhat neutral factor. The second respondent's conduct was fairly blatant, but at the same time, upon complaint the respondents changed the brochure and gave undertakings not to use the artworks.</text>

<tocase>Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] 1 Ch 323</tocase>
<text>11 Various methods of measuring damages for an infringement of copyright have been described in the cases. In Sutherland Publishing Co Ltd v Caxton Publishing Co Ltd [1936] 1 Ch 323 at 336, Lord Wright MR said that the measure of damages in a copyright case "is the depreciation caused by the infringement to the value of the copyright as a chose in action". However, the authorities make it clear that is only one method of measuring damages: Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd v Cheung (1990) 17 IPR 69 ; Bailey 53 FCR at 111-112; Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 240. Another method is to determine the licence fee or royalty the infringing party would have to pay to use the work lawfully. There are difficulties in applying that approach in circumstances where it cannot be inferred that the infringing party would pay a licence fee rather than not use the work ( Autodesk 17 IPR at 75). The applicant did not contend that either of the aforesaid methods was appropriate in this case. It submitted that this was a case in which it was appropriate to treat the damages as being at large and to approach the assessment of damages as a jury would ( Fenning Film Service Ltd v Wolverhampton, Walsall and District Cinemas Ltd [1914] 3 KB 1171 at 1174 per Horridge J). I think that is the proper approach in the circumstances of this case.</text>
