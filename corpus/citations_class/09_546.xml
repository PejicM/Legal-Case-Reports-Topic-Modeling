<text>In considering the formulation of categories of documents for the purposes of discovery, two matters are important. First, it is trite to say that the categories will be formulated having regard to the issues between the parties as revealed in the pleadings. Secondly, the criteria in O 15 r 2(3) generally provide an appropriate guide to the formulation of appropriate categories. The categories can be formulated by reference to O 15 r 2(3) without specific reference to that rule, or O 15 r 2(3) can be incorporated into the categories as a limiting factor: Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 366 at [17] - [23] per Lindgren J; Aveling v UBS Capital Markets Australia Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 415 at [9] - [11] per Lindgren J; Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) (2009) 253 ALR 354 at 360 [21]-[22]. It seems to me, however, that the Court retains a general power to fashion an order for discovery which is appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Although it is perhaps most unlikely, it is within the Court's power to make an order for discovery in accordance with the "train of inquiry" test (see The Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co (1882) 11 QBD 55 at 63; see also O 15 r 8, which uses the expression, "any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding").
