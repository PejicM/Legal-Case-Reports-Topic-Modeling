<text>9 That same issue occurred in relation to proposals to acquire native title rights and interests, or certain of them, in the Town of Timber Creek. On 31 July 2003, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory decided that such notices were invalid as being beyond power in the circumstances: Griffiths v Lands and Mining Tribunal and Minister for Lands Planning and the Environment (2003) 179 FLR 241. That decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory: Minister for Lands, Planning &amp; Environment (2004) 14 NTLR 188. The High Court subsequently granted leave to appeal from that decision. On 15 November 2007, judgment on the appeal was reserved. It addresses questions as to whether s 43 of the Lands Acquisition Act permits the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of extinguishing native title in order to alienate land for the private benefit of another citizen; whether s 24MD of the NT Act permits the acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of vesting the affected land in the Northern Territory freed and discharged of the native title rights and interests; and whether s 46 of the Lands Acquisition Act is repugnant to s 238 of the NT Act.</text>

<text>14 They contend that their interests are adversely affected by the Registrar's decision, so that success in this application for review will result in a benefit to them, or relieve them of a detriment, to an extent greater than ordinary members of the public: see Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 at 75-76; Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc. v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50 at 60-65.

21 Upon that basis, in my view, the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants have demonstrated that their interests are adversely affected by the decision of the Registrar to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application. The potential benefits or advantages which they enjoyed before that decision, by reason of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application having been accepted for registration, would be diminished so they would have suffered a disadvantage or detriment to an extent greater than the ordinary members of the public: Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd at 75.

<tocase>Western Australia v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1591 ; (1999) 95 FCR 93</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1591.html</AustLII>
<text>15 In Western Australia v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1591 ; (1999) 95 FCR 93 , Carr J decided that the State of Western Australia was a "person aggrieved" for the purposes of making an application for review under s 5 of the ADJR Act in respect of a decision of the Registrar to admit for registration a particular native title claim. His Honour found that the adverse effect of registration upon the State so qualified it, because as owner of the land the subject of that particular native title claim, the State was restricted in its capacity to deal with its proprietary interest, and was obliged to submit to the statutory requirements of negotiation in respect of future acts under the NT Act. Obviously, the impact upon an owner of land of an application for the determination of native title being admitted for registration under s 190A of the NT Act is different from the impact upon a person or persons in the position of the Batchelor No 1 applicants. They are competing native title claimants whose claim has been registered, and not land owners.

16 One of the reasons Carr J reached that conclusion in Western Australia v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1591 ; 95 FCR 93 was that the government, being primarily responsible for the development and manner of use of the land the subject of that particular native title claim, had a "very close relationship with the subject matter" of the registration decision, and that the NT Act recognised that closeness by, for example, the requirement in s 66(2) of the Act not only that the State be notified of the application for registration, but also that it be supplied with all affidavits and documents in support of it: see at [20].

17 A similar obligation is imposed upon the Registrar under s 66(2A) of the NT Act in relation to the relevant representative body of the area covered by the application, in this case the NLC.

18 I was referred by counsel for the Batchelor No 1 applicants to s 66(3)(a)(i) of the NT Act. Under that provision, the Registrar is obliged to give notice containing details of an application for determination of native title to any registered native title claimant in relation to any of the area covered by the application which is being assessed for registration under s 190A. I do not think that that provision operates to provide or enhance the status of the Batchelor No 1 applicants in this matter as persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar. That is because s 66(3) commences by saying that it is generally subject to the section. The Registrar's obligation is specifically then explained or qualified, at least in terms of the time when it must be implemented, by s 66(6)(a). Pursuant to s 66(6)(a), in the event of a claimant application, the Registrar must not comply with sub-section (3) until the Registrar has decided, in accordance with s 190A, whether or not to accept for registration the claim made in the application. In my view the position is clear. Not only is the Registrar not required by s 66(3)(a)(i) to have given notice of the Batchelor No 2 application to the Batchelor No 1 applicants, as registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area, until the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the Batchelor No 2 application for registration, but he is positively directed not to do so by s 66(6)(a).

19 Consequently, if the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants are to establish that they are persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar, they must do so by some circumstance un-unsupported by, and perhaps even informed by, s 66(6)(a).

20 In my view, the procedural rights which they obtained by registration of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application are not, in terms, diminished by the fact of the acceptance for registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application. Their procedural rights under the Act remain the same. But, at a practical level, it is said that the enjoyment of those procedural rights is diminished because the persons with whom they have rights of negotiation would also have to deal with the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants who would possess equivalent rights of negotiation. The outcomes of negotiations in relation to a future act or future acts which might be the subject of such negotiation would, it is argued, in a practical sense have to be shared or may have to be shared between the two sets of registered applicants. In my view, as a matter of commonsense, that is likely to be correct. In such negotiations, the person or entity who is the potential beneficiary of the future act is unlikely to negotiate in a way which would give each of the negotiating registered native title applicants the same benefits as if there were only one group of registered native title applicants with whom those negotiations should be conducted. To put it somewhat crudely, the potential fruits of the negotiations would probably be shared rather than doubled.</text>

<tocase>Griffith University v Tang (2005) 31 CLR 99</tocase>
<text>26 
 
In my view s 66 of the NT Act, for the reasons I have given above, proceeds on the basis that a decision to accept for registration a native title claim under s 190 not only may, but must, be made before competing registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area are notified of the competing claim. In Griffith University v Tang (2005) 31 CLR 99 Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at 117-118 referred to there generally being a relationship between the questions of standing and, in the context of procedural fairness, the right to be heard. However, in my view s 66(6)(a) makes it plain that in the normal course a competing registered native title claimant is not entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard when the Registrar is considering whether to accept for registration a native title determination application over the same area of land. The mere fact of having standing to challenge the Registrar's decision does not mean that the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were entitled to the opportunity to make submissions to the Registrar and to present material to him when he was considering such a decision.

27 However, there are particular features in the present matter which take the position further. The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were in fact aware of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, and that the Registrar would in due course consider whether to accept it for registration. The NLC, as the relevant representative body for the area covered by both applications, was entitled to be given a copy of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and other documents relating to it pursuant to s 66(2A) of the Act. That may be how the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants came to learn of the later application. The NLC had certified the Town of Batchelor No 1 application. The solicitors acting for the NLC were the same solicitors as were acting for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants. Those solicitors had indicated a desire to make a submission to the Registrar on whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should be accepted for registration. There was then an e-mail exchange between the Registrar by his officers and those solicitors on 1 December 2005 in which it was acknowledged that such a submission was to be made, and that such a submission would be made after the proposed amendment to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application. The officer of the Registrar indicated that the time within which the submission should be made and material presented would be notified to the NLC once the amendments had been effected. I accept that, on the evidence, the proposed submission in opposition to the potential registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim was delayed until after the proposed amendment of that claim and that the Registrar gave notification that the Registrar was considering whether to accept for registration the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application. I also accept, as I have said above, that had such a submission been made it would have raised significant material for the Registrar's consideration relevant to whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should have been accepted for registration.

28 It is that combination of particular circumstances which, in my view, gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and an obligation on the part of the Registrar that he would give the NLC and its solicitors notification that he was considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and a time within which to take the opportunity to make submissions and to provide information in relation to it. I am mindful of the fact that relevant communications on 1 December 2005 were between the solicitor for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and for the NLC on the one hand, and an officer of the Registrar, but referred only to a submission from the NLC. In my view, there was such a coincidence of interest between the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and the NLC in the present circumstances, a coincidence which was apparent to the Registrar from the Town of Batchelor No 1 application having been certified by the NLC, that the opportunity to make a submission and to present additional information was one which was an entitlement to procedural fairness which covered both the NLC and the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants.

29 It is accepted that that opportunity was not provided by the Registrar.

30 In my judgment, therefore, there was a failure to accord procedural fairness to the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants in the particular circumstances before the decision was made by the Registrar to accept the Town of Batchelor No 2 application for registration. The nature of the submission, and additional information, which may have been provided in response to such an opportunity might have affected the outcome of the Registrar's decision.

31 I accordingly propose to set aside the Registrar's decision on that ground.

32 
 
I will briefly refer to the other two grounds upon which the Registrar's decision is attacked.</text>

<tocase>Martin v Native Title Registrar [2001] FCA 16</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/16.html</AustLII>
<text>37 The Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are entitled to provide additional material to the Registrar, in addition to that in the native title determination itself, to support the Registrar's satisfaction of the requirements of s 190B(5): see Martin v Native Title Registrar [2001] FCA 16.

38 Section 53A does not prevent a party producing in evidence the same material as that presented at a mediation, provided of course it is relevant. That is really self-evident. If it were not so, no party could (for example) at a mediation refer to a statement of a proposed witness without the risk that that witness statement could not be adduced at a later hearing. Of course, the fact that that witness statement was referred to at the mediation could not be adduced at evidence at the hearing. Nor, generally, would it be relevant. What was improperly before the Registrar (if any error was made) was the fact that what he called "the FRBG Submissions" were presented at the mediation. But subject to their relevance, the FRBG Submissions could have been (and were) presented to the Registrar as material relevant to his satisfaction under s 190B(5). And the Registrar simply recorded that he understood that material "to have been prepared for the purposes of mediation" in the Court. He did not receive material as to what was said at the mediation, or of anything there said. Had he actually received material that the FRBG Submissions were presented at the mediation, then s 53A may have been infringed. But there was no apparent reliance by the Registrar upon the fact of their presentation to the mediation, so it would have been an error without consequence. The material apparently is of a factual and conclusory nature, and was equally eligible to be presented to the Registrar as to a mediator.

39 It is not necessary to consider, therefore, whether the role of the Registrar in considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application is a proceeding attracted by the scope of s 53A(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act .</text>

<tocase>Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/1384.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Section 190C(2) requires the Registrar to be satisfied that the application contains all the details and other information, and is accompanied by any affidavit or other document, required by ss 61 and 62. That requires the Registrar to consider whether the requirements of ss 61 and 62 are met in the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application. For the reasons I expressed in Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112 at [32] - [37] , I do not think the Registrar was required to go beyond the application in considering if that requirement was satisfied, and in particular was not required to undertake some form of merit assessment of the material.

42 The Registrar has worked through each of the requirements or elements of s 61 and s 62 of the Act, and assessed the application, that is the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, by reference to each of those requirements. That involved a careful consideration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and of the affidavits which accompanied it, as required by s 62(1)(a). He concluded that the application contained all the details and other information, and was accompanied by the documents, required by ss 61 and 62. I have gone through the documents to which he referred, in the light of submissions by counsel for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants. In my view, the Registrar's conclusion was reasonably available to him. I do not think he is shown to have misunderstood the law or to have asked himself the wrong question in addressing the requirements of s 190C(2).

43 The gravamen of the contention on behalf of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants was more focused upon the requirements of s 190C(4)(b). It provides that the Registrar must be satisfied that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of the native title claim group and are authorised to make the application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the persons in the native title claim group. The alternative provided by s 190C(4)(a) was not available because the NLC as the relevant representative body had not certified the Town of Batchelor No 2 application under Pt 11 of the NT Act. The requirements of s 190C(4)(b) are then further explained by s 190C(5) which is in the following terms:
 
 If the application has not been certified as mentioned in paragraph (4)(a), the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in sub-section (4) has been satisfied unless the application:
 
 
 
 (a) includes a statement to the effect that the requirements set out in paragraph (4)(b) has been met; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met.

44 The Registrar noted the definition of authorisation in s 251B of the NT Act. He correctly identified that he was required to be satisfied of the matters set out in s 190C(4)(b). He also identified the nature of that task as described in Doepel at [78]. As he said, the NT Act places fundamental importance upon ensuring that claimant applications are properly authorised: see e.g. Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378. The Registrar said that the necessary statements for s 190C(5)(a) are made in the s 62 affidavits. There are affidavits pursuant to s 62 of the NT Act of May Stevens, Thomas Edward Petherick and Captain Wodidj adopting or using the words of s 62 of the NT Act, and therefore apparently providing a foundation for the Registrar's satisfaction that the requirement of s 190D(5)(a) of the NT Act had been met. He then said that he was satisfied that there was material at Schedule R and in Attachments R1, R2 and R3 to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application which met the requirements of s 190C(5)(b) as that material briefly set out the grounds on which he should consider that the requirements of s 190C(4)(b) had been met.</text>
