<tocase>Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/438.html</AustLII>
<text>45 The Tribunal then turned its attention to the question of compassionate and compelling circumstances, for the purpose of determining whether reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations was applicable. At [74], it referred to Boakye-Danquah v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 438 (2002) 116 FCR 557. In that case, the Court was dealing with an earlier version of item 820.211 in Sch 2 to the Migration Regulations , in which there was a requirement to satisfy several criteria found in Sch 3, 'unless the Minister is satisfied that there are compelling reasons for not applying those criteria.' Relying on an explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister at the time when this provision had been inserted into the Migration Regulations , which described the provision as a 'waiver provision', Wilcox J held at [33] that it was clear that the 'compelling circumstances' criterion was intended to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa, not at the time of decision, because item 820.211 in its entirety was required to be satisfied at the time of application. Discussing the effect of this case at [76] of its reasons, the Tribunal said:
 

 
 'The Tribunal notes that the Court in Boakye-Danquah was not concerned about whether compassionate and compelling circumstances applied to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement. However, the Court clearly stated that the relevant criterion in that case was concerned with "the circumstances in which the application is made". The 12 month cohabitation requirement is also clearly concerned with the circumstances in which the application is made. This requirement may only be waived if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A. If the Tribunal was to take into account compassionate and compelling circumstances which apply only at the time of the decision it would be, in effect, making a determination in relation a [ sic ] time of application requirement by reference to facts which did not yet exist at the time of application. Such a determination would entirely undermine the two-stage assessment process which underpins the regulations. That is, an assessment of relevant factors which exist at the time of application and a later assessment of factors which exist at the time of decision.'

46 At [77], the Tribunal purported to apply Boakye-Danquah in assessing whether there were compelling and compassionate circumstances justifying what it called 'the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement at the time of application.' It expressed a finding that the only circumstances which could properly be taken into account 'in determining whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement are those circumstances which applied at the time of application.' After referring to other authority, the Tribunal then said at [81]:
 

 
 'Policy provides that, in assessing whether there are compelling and compassionate reasons, officers are to take into account the circumstances which the Minister considers to be compelling and compassionate which includes, but is not limited to, applicants who have a dependent child of the relationship. The parties should be given the opportunity to present information as to why they consider there are compelling and compassionate reasons to waive the one year pre-existing cohabitation requirement. However, it is the policy intention that an assessment that the parties' relationship is genuine would not, in the absence of a dependent child of the relationship, be sufficiently compelling to justify not applying regulation 1.15A(2)(d) requirements.'

47 At [82], the Tribunal found that there were no dependent children of the relationship, and that there was no evidence that the parties were affected by extreme hardship at the time of application or that they would suffer irreparable prejudice if the 12-month cohabitation period were not waived. It referred to the relationship between Mr Petrou and the two children of his former marriage and to the fact that he had lived away from them for some time. It took the view that Mr Petrou would be able to prepare his children psychologically for his departure from Australia to be with Ms Antipova. The Tribunal found that it was not satisfied that a close relationship existed between Mr Petrou and his children at the time of application and was not satisfied that the relationship amounted to compassionate and compelling circumstances at that time. It was also not satisfied that the current needs of Mr Petrou's children were sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12-month cohabitation requirement, even if it could properly take those circumstances into account.

48 Three documents filed on behalf of Ms Antipova, and oral submissions of her counsel at the hearing of the proceeding, disclosed a great variety of approaches to the case put on her behalf. Some of the points raised can be dealt with very briefly, whereas others require a more detailed examination. The three documents are the amended application, filed on 8 June 2004, contentions of fact and law, also filed on 8 June 2004, and contentions in response to the respondent's supplementary contentions, filed on 2 May 2005.

103 The Tribunal construed this provision as a 'waiver' provision, and held that it was required to take into account only those circumstances existing at the date of the application for a visa. In doing so, the Tribunal said that it was following Boakye-Danquah . That was a case concerned with criteria for a particular type of visa, found in a schedule to the Migration Regulations , in which the reference to 'compelling reasons' appeared in the very criterion required to be satisfied at the time of application for the visa. That provision referred to compelling reasons for not applying certain otherwise applicable criteria. It is not surprising that Wilcox J in that case construed the relevant provision as requiring the compelling reasons to exist at the time of application for the visa.

104 Regulation 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations is a very different provision. It is found in a separate regulation, providing a definition of the word 'spouse', for a variety of purposes, wherever that word is found in the Migration Regulations . It does not call upon a decision-maker to determine 'whether to exercise the waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement', as the Tribunal characterised it at [77] of its reasons. Rather, reg 1.15A(2A) provides that reg 1.15A(2)(d) does not apply if a specified condition is met. That condition is not that the applicant can establish compelling and compassionate reasons for not applying the criteria referred to in reg 1.15A(2)(d), but that the applicant can establish 'compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.' In other words, the Tribunal is not required to determine whether compelling and compassionate circumstances exist for the waiver or non-application of the 12-month requirement, but whether such circumstances exist for the granting of the visa sought. The focus is not on the criteria to be ousted from consideration, but on the end result. The wording of reg 1.15A(2A) suggests strongly that, at whatever stage of whatever decision-making process the question of special circumstances arises, it is to be determined by reference to whatever circumstances exist at the date of decision. It would be a strange result if the circumstances to be considered differed according to whether the application of the definition of 'spouse' was required to be applied at the time of application of the visa, or at the time of decision, or at some other stage, so that different views might be taken as to whether compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa existed at different times. The wording of the provision suggests strongly that this is not the intention.

105 Applying this view does nothing to undermine the two-stage assessment process of determining entitlement to the type of visa Ms Antipova sought, as the Tribunal suggested at [76] of its reasons. Even assuming the definition in reg 1.15A of the Migration Regulations to be confined in its application to that type of visa (and subreg (2)(d) in its terms applies to a range of types of visas, including any permanent visa), the two-stage process remains intact. In determining whether the applicant for a visa was the spouse of a nominating person at the date of application for the visa, the decision-maker is required to determine whether, throughout a 12-month period prior to that date, the two persons met the three requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d), namely mutual commitment, genuine and continuing relationship, and cohabitation. If any of these three requirements should be absent, the decision-maker is then required to consider whether the applicant has established compelling and compassionate reasons for the grant of the visa. If so, reg 1.15A(2)(d) no longer has to be satisfied at the date of application for the visa; it no longer applies. Once understood in this sense, reg 1.15A(2A) can be seen to be compatible with the two-stage process of assessment. On this analysis, there is nothing strange about making a determination about the application of a criterion to be satisfied at the time of application for a visa by reference to facts not in existence at that time, as the Tribunal thought.

107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A).

108 The Tribunal appears to have been led into error by its misunderstanding of the principle for which Boakye-Danquah stood as authority, and by its incorrect characterisation of reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations, at [76] of the Tribunal's reasons, as permitting waiver of the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) 'if there are circumstances sufficiently compassionate and compelling which would justify the parties having lodged the visa application before they had lived together in a spousal relationship for a sufficient period to satisfy the definition of spouse under regulation 1.15A.' As I have said in [104], reg 1.15A(2A) did not focus on the circumstances attending the making of the application for a visa, but on the circumstances justifying the granting of the visa. Those circumstances are the ones the Tribunal was required to take into account in determining whether the criteria in reg 1.15A(2)(d) was applicable.

109 Such an error is capable of amounting to a jurisdictional error if it affected the exercise of the Tribunal's statutory function. In the present case, the issue of compelling and compassionate circumstances turned on Mr Petrou's re-established relationship with his children from a former union, and on Ms Antipova's emerging relationship with those children. The Tribunal was prepared to take into account the needs of those children in determining whether compelling and compassionate circumstances existed. Having held that it could not take into account the circumstances that existed at the date of decision, the Tribunal nevertheless expressed the view at [82] of its reasons that, even if it could do so, it did not regard the current needs of the children as 'sufficiently compelling to justify a waiver of the 12 month cohabitation requirement'. Despite the incorrect characterisation of the effect of reg 1.15A(2A), it is fair to take this finding to be a finding that there were no compelling and compassionate circumstances, for the purposes of the application of that provision, even if current circumstances were to be considered. The assessment of the circumstances against the standard of 'compelling and compassionate' was a matter for the Tribunal. It does not appear that the Tribunal misunderstood or misapplied the required standard. The result, therefore, is the same as if the Tribunal had not held erroneously that it could not take circumstances at the time of the decision into account. In effect, it did so. Its error did not amount to a jurisdictional error, because it did carry out the task required of it by the legislation.

110 For this reason, the Tribunal's decision cannot be set aside on the basis of its error in construing reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations.</text>

<tocase>Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/788.html</AustLII>
<text>60 In determining whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had been in a de facto relationship for 12 months or more prior to the visa application, the Tribunal was bound to have regard to all of the matters referred to in reg 1.15A(3) of the Migration Regulations . That subregulation so provides and, as the Tribunal pointed out at [48] of its reasons, the mandatory nature of the provision was emphasised in Nassouh v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 788 at [10] . In conformity with its obligation, the Tribunal discussed in its reasons for decision each of those matters, to the extent to which there was evidence before the Tribunal relating to them. It did so under headings reflecting the requirements of pars (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively of reg 1.15A(3). This arrangement of the Tribunal's reasons for decision makes it difficult for Ms Antipova to sustain the argument that the Tribunal failed to consider the mandatory considerations.

61 In its consideration of the financial aspects of the relationship, required by reg 1.15A(3)(a) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal first found that there was no evidence that, in the 12-month period it was considering, the parties combined their financial affairs or shared assets or liabilities. It acknowledged that Ms Antipova had given a reason for the lack of a joint bank account, namely that she and Mr Petrou had little money and there was no need. The Tribunal pointed out that there was no documentary evidence of shared household or daily living expenses in the relevant 12-month period, but appeared to accept that it would have been impractical to have had such evidence, because Mr Petrou was the sole lessee of the six-bedroom house in California in which Ms Antipova claimed to have lived with him and others. The Tribunal clearly did not focus solely on whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had a joint bank account, as the submissions on behalf of Ms Antipova suggested. Nor did it ignore evidence of the joint burden of debt for legal expenses, loans and university fees. To the extent that such a joint burden might have existed, it plainly did not exist during the 12 months preceding the application for a visa. Indeed, as late as 1 September 2003, Ms Antipova's migration agent (who was also, apparently, a legal practitioner) submitted in writing to the Tribunal the statement that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou 'do not have joint financial commitments because of their parlous financial position.' The Tribunal could hardly have made any finding other than the one it made on this aspect of the case. In weighing the credibility of Ms Antipova's case, the Tribunal was certainly entitled to use material that Ms Antipova had supplied to it, concerning the travel undertaken by her and Mr Petrou, when testing their assertion that, because they had very little money, they did not open a joint bank account and Ms Antipova did not apply for a divorce from her former husband. The material was relevant to this issue, and there was no element of conjecture involved in the Tribunal's reliance on it.

62 In considering the social aspects of the relationship during the 12-month period, as required by reg 1.15A(3)(c) of the Migration Regulations , the Tribunal dealt expressly with the material supplied by Ms Antipova from friends and family. As I have already pointed out, it gave little weight to the statements of Ms Downie, Ms Shpits and Ms Karagoz. It did not reject the statements as evidence that family and friends considered Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou to be a couple, and thereby used the statements for the purpose for which they were required under the regulation, and for the purpose for which they had been supplied to it. The Tribunal did point out, however, that the statements of Mr Petrou's parents did not bear upon whether Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were living together at the relevant time. Since this was the crucial issue, the Tribunal could not be criticised for making this observation, although it did so under the heading dealing with the social aspects of the relationship, rather than under the earlier heading, dealing with the nature of the household, including the living arrangements. The Tribunal did not fail to consider the evidence of travel itineraries, air tickets and passport copies, as Ms Antipova contended. It detailed every document in its reasons for decision. The material indicated that the parties travelled together in March 2002. Although evidence of later events can sometimes cast light on the nature of a relationship at an earlier time, it is hard to see, and counsel for Ms Antipova never explained, how the evidence of joint travel in March 2002 could bear upon the nature of the relationship between Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou in May and June 2001. The Tribunal was not bound to look at this material in relation to the issue of the social aspects of the relationship at the relevant time.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>66 The contention that the Tribunal failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case, as it was required to do by s 353(2)(b) of the Migration Act , also appears to be an attempt to reargue the merits, and therefore impermissible. In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [46] [52] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J (Hayne J concurring at [158]), [69] [77] per Gaudron and Kirby JJ, [106] [109] per Gummow J, and [175] [179] per Callinan J, the High Court held that s 420 of the Migration Act was insufficiently specific to constitute a ground for review of a decision under the limited jurisdiction then given to this Court by s 476 of the Migration Act , which has since been repealed. Section 420 makes provisions with respect to the Refugee Review Tribunal in terms identical to those made by s 353 with respect to the Tribunal. For reasons similar to those given in Eshetu , s 353 is unlikely to be the source of an obligation, failure to comply with which could be said to constitute jurisdictional error.

67 A consideration of whether the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by misleading Ms Antipova about what was in issue requires an examination of further factual matters. On 6 August 2002, Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou were interviewed separately by an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (subsequently the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (in both cases, 'the Department'). The notes of the interview record that Ms Antipova was asked when and where she moved in with Mr Petrou. Her answer was 18 May 2001, and she gave the address of the premises at which Mr Petrou lived in California. The officer asked if she had any other documents that would support this claim, and Ms Antipova said that she did not. By letter dated 16 August 2002, the officer referred to a request on 6 August 2002 'to provide further evidence of cohabitation within 28 days' and requested certain specified documents. With a letter dated 6 September 2002, Ms Antipova's migration agent provided the statutory declarations of Mr Petrou's parents, the statement of Ms Karagoz and a statement of Mr Petrou. With a letter dated 15 October 2002, the migration agent provided the letter of Ms Downie dated 15 August 2002.

68 The decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse to grant Ms Antipova a visa was accompanied by written reasons, dated 3 January 2003. According to those reasons, the delegate found 'conflicting information about the extent of commitment of this relationship since May 2001'. The delegate found that there was 'inadequate evidence...to support claims of a de facto marital relationship to have been in existence for at least 12 months prior to the date of application' for the visa [underlining in original]. It was for this reason that the delegate decided that Ms Antipova was not entitled to the visa.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/126.html</AustLII>
<text>82 There are two possible answers to this question. The first is that s 360(1) of the Migration Act requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.' If the Tribunal has conducted what purports to be a hearing, but has not in truth allowed an applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to those issues, it has not complied with this statutory obligation. The Tribunal has failed to comply with an essential precondition to making a decision on the applicant's application to review the decision of the Minister's delegate, and has therefore failed to perform the duty, conferred on it by s 348 of the Migration Act , to review that decision. Its decision is invalid and must be set aside. This is the reasoning followed by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [33] [41], in relation to s 425(1) of the Migration Act , which imposes on the Refugee Review Tribunal an obligation in terms identical with the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 360(1). At [33], the Full Court approved the statement of Goldberg J in Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188 at [31] that:
 

 
 'The invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture.'

84 In SCAR at [38], the Full Court recognised that compliance with s 425 is a 'precondition to the valid exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction', and that failure to comply involves a jurisdictional error. At [41], the Full Court found that the Refugee Review Tribunal in that case had not extended 'a meaningful invitation'.

85 In the present case, because it interrupted her and imposed an arbitrary time limit on her, the Tribunal did not permit Ms Antipova to give evidence and present arguments as she wished to do. Although there was a semblance of a hearing, and the Tribunal invited Ms Antipova to it in terms mandated by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , the invitation was not a real and meaningful one, because what she was invited to do was denied to her. The Tribunal failed to observe a precondition of the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it. Its decision was made without an invitation to attend a hearing of the kind required, because such a hearing has not yet been conducted.

86 Counsel for the Minister submitted that SCAR has been the subject of judicial criticism, and even that it has been not followed. Reference was made to WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 (2004) 204 ALR 624, in which French J distinguished SCAR on the facts at [46]. At [57] [59], his Honour discussed the question whether s 422B of the Migration Act operated to preclude the application of the principles of procedural fairness in the context of the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to ask any questions at the hearing as to a particular issue on which it later found adversely to the person seeking a protection visa. In the course of that discussion, his Honour examined whether there had been a failure to comply with s 425 of the Migration Act . In the alternative, his Honour examined the issue on the assumption that s 425 had no application, holding that the denial of procedural fairness in that case amounted to jurisdictional error, notwithstanding s 422B. Nothing that his Honour said in that passage amounted to a criticism of SCAR , or a refusal to follow it. Indeed, at [58], his Honour affirmed the central propositions for which SCAR stands, saying:
 

 
 'A failure to conduct a hearing of the kind contemplated by s 425 in my opinion would amount to a failure to comply with the obligation imposed by that section upon the tribunal to invite an applicant to participate in such a hearing. That obligation is so central to the conduct of the tribunal process that it necessarily conditions the power to make an adverse decision on review.'

87 In M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 (2005) 85 ALD 597, Ryan J also dealt with the alleged failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to raise at the hearing an issue on which it later found against the person applying for a protection visa. At [58], his Honour accepted that compliance with s 425 was held in SCAR to be a precondition to the valid exercise of the Refugee Review Tribunal's jurisdiction, and that failure to comply would therefore be jurisdictional error. At [59], his Honour quoted from the joint judgment of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Cho [1999] FCA 946 (1999) 92 FCR 315 at [29] , where their Honours said:
 

 
 'In considering the extent of the requirements imposed by s 425 it is important to keep in mind that the exercise is essentially one of statutory interpretation...Care must be taken not to confuse the question of the interpretation of s 425 according to its language with a question as to whether the full range of natural justice requirements should be injected into s 425 under the guise of giving content to an obligation to afford an "opportunity to give evidence".'

90 At [62], Ryan J quoted from NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [30] , a passage in which the Full Court recognised that the invitation required by s 425 must be 'real and meaningful and not just an empty gesture', citing both SCAR and Mazhar . The Full Court in NALQ proceeded to discuss earlier authorities on the nature of the invitation required. At [34], there was a discussion of whether the Full Court in SCAR at [37] had misconstrued the judgment of Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 (2003) 128 FCR 359, but the Full Court in NALQ did not determine this question.

91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority. The invitation required by s 425 of the Migration Act (and, for identical reasons, that required by s 360), must be real and genuine. As the reasoning of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Cho at [33] demonstrates, it is legitimate to examine what occurred at the hearing, in order to ascertain whether the invitation extended satisfies that requirement. If what took place under the guise of a hearing was not a genuine opportunity for an applicant for review 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to a decision under review', then the invitation required by s 425 (or s 360) will not have been extended as required. Of course, it is necessary to bear in mind, as Tamberlin and Katz JJ said in Cho at [29], that it is not legitimate to regard every want of procedural fairness as nullifying the invitation. It is only defects rendering the proceedings ineffective to fulfil the purpose for which the invitation is required that will have this effect. SCAR is therefore binding on me as a single judge. In any event, in my view, it is correctly decided.

93 If SCAR is wrongly decided, and s 360(1) of the Migration Act is not to be given the meaning it bears in my opinion, it is necessary to consider the second answer to the question whether s 357A of the Migration Act ousts the right, which Ms Antipova would have otherwise, to establish that the Tribunal's unfairness to her constitutes jurisdictional error, entitling her to have the Tribunal's decision set aside. Section 357A is a difficult provision to construe. It does not exclude altogether the principles of procedural fairness. There must be some doubt as to whether Parliament could exclude procedural fairness altogether, given that a denial of procedural fairness is a ground for the remedies referred to in s 75(v) of the Constitution . At best, the legislative power extends to regulating procedures, and this is what s 357A attempts to do. It provides that Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act is taken to be 'an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with'. The provision assumes that there will be aspects of the 'natural justice hearing rule' that are not matters dealt with by any provision of Div 5. As the cases so far have shown, identifying a provision dealing with a particular 'matter', relating to procedural fairness is not always easy. See, for example, the passages in WAJR , to which I have referred in [86]. The present case is relatively easy. No provision of Div 5 deals with the imposition of time limits on the hearings of the Tribunal. Unless it be s 360(1) , no provision deals with the process by which evidence is adduced at a Tribunal hearing. There is certainly no provision dealing with the 'matter' of a Tribunal member interrupting answers to questions. No provision gives the Tribunal member a right to control and censor the evidence given, by refusing to hear what the applicant for review wishes to say.</text>

<tocase>Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1759.html</AustLII>
<text>82 There are two possible answers to this question. The first is that s 360(1) of the Migration Act requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant 'to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.' If the Tribunal has conducted what purports to be a hearing, but has not in truth allowed an applicant to give evidence and present arguments relating to those issues, it has not complied with this statutory obligation. The Tribunal has failed to comply with an essential precondition to making a decision on the applicant's application to review the decision of the Minister's delegate, and has therefore failed to perform the duty, conferred on it by s 348 of the Migration Act , to review that decision. Its decision is invalid and must be set aside. This is the reasoning followed by the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [33] [41], in relation to s 425(1) of the Migration Act , which imposes on the Refugee Review Tribunal an obligation in terms identical with the obligation imposed on the Tribunal by s 360(1). At [33], the Full Court approved the statement of Goldberg J in Mazhar v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 (2000) 183 ALR 188 at [31] that:
 

 
 'The invitation must not be a hollow shell or an empty gesture.'

90 At [62], Ryan J quoted from NALQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 121 at [30] , a passage in which the Full Court recognised that the invitation required by s 425 must be 'real and meaningful and not just an empty gesture', citing both SCAR and Mazhar . The Full Court in NALQ proceeded to discuss earlier authorities on the nature of the invitation required. At [34], there was a discussion of whether the Full Court in SCAR at [37] had misconstrued the judgment of Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 (2003) 128 FCR 359, but the Full Court in NALQ did not determine this question.</text>

<tocase>WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 (2004) 204 ALR 624</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/106.html</AustLII>
<text>86 Counsel for the Minister submitted that SCAR has been the subject of judicial criticism, and even that it has been not followed. Reference was made to WAJR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 (2004) 204 ALR 624, in which French J distinguished SCAR on the facts at [46]. At [57] [59], his Honour discussed the question whether s 422B of the Migration Act operated to preclude the application of the principles of procedural fairness in the context of the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to ask any questions at the hearing as to a particular issue on which it later found adversely to the person seeking a protection visa. In the course of that discussion, his Honour examined whether there had been a failure to comply with s 425 of the Migration Act . In the alternative, his Honour examined the issue on the assumption that s 425 had no application, holding that the denial of procedural fairness in that case amounted to jurisdictional error, notwithstanding s 422B. Nothing that his Honour said in that passage amounted to a criticism of SCAR , or a refusal to follow it. Indeed, at [58], his Honour affirmed the central propositions for which SCAR stands, saying:
 

 
 'A failure to conduct a hearing of the kind contemplated by s 425 in my opinion would amount to a failure to comply with the obligation imposed by that section upon the tribunal to invite an applicant to participate in such a hearing. That obligation is so central to the conduct of the tribunal process that it necessarily conditions the power to make an adverse decision on review.'

93 If SCAR is wrongly decided, and s 360(1) of the Migration Act is not to be given the meaning it bears in my opinion, it is necessary to consider the second answer to the question whether s 357A of the Migration Act ousts the right, which Ms Antipova would have otherwise, to establish that the Tribunal's unfairness to her constitutes jurisdictional error, entitling her to have the Tribunal's decision set aside. Section 357A is a difficult provision to construe. It does not exclude altogether the principles of procedural fairness. There must be some doubt as to whether Parliament could exclude procedural fairness altogether, given that a denial of procedural fairness is a ground for the remedies referred to in s 75(v) of the Constitution . At best, the legislative power extends to regulating procedures, and this is what s 357A attempts to do. It provides that Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act is taken to be 'an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with'. The provision assumes that there will be aspects of the 'natural justice hearing rule' that are not matters dealt with by any provision of Div 5. As the cases so far have shown, identifying a provision dealing with a particular 'matter', relating to procedural fairness is not always easy. See, for example, the passages in WAJR , to which I have referred in [86]. The present case is relatively easy. No provision of Div 5 deals with the imposition of time limits on the hearings of the Tribunal. Unless it be s 360(1) , no provision deals with the process by which evidence is adduced at a Tribunal hearing. There is certainly no provision dealing with the 'matter' of a Tribunal member interrupting answers to questions. No provision gives the Tribunal member a right to control and censor the evidence given, by refusing to hear what the applicant for review wishes to say.</text>

<text>87 In M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 86 (2005) 85 ALD 597, Ryan J also dealt with the alleged failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to raise at the hearing an issue on which it later found against the person applying for a protection visa. At [58], his Honour accepted that compliance with s 425 was held in SCAR to be a precondition to the valid exercise of the Refugee Review Tribunal's jurisdiction, and that failure to comply would therefore be jurisdictional error. At [59], his Honour quoted from the joint judgment of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Cho [1999] FCA 946 (1999) 92 FCR 315 at [29] , where their Honours said:
 

 
 'In considering the extent of the requirements imposed by s 425 it is important to keep in mind that the exercise is essentially one of statutory interpretation...Care must be taken not to confuse the question of the interpretation of s 425 according to its language with a question as to whether the full range of natural justice requirements should be injected into s 425 under the guise of giving content to an obligation to afford an "opportunity to give evidence".'

89 In M17/2004 , Ryan J did not refer to this additional passage, although what his Honour said at [61] indicates that he was aware of the requirement for the invitation required by s 425 to be a genuine one. What his Honour there said was:
 

 
 'I accept the submission advanced on behalf of the Minister that s 425 in its present form requires the Tribunal to issue a genuine invitation to the applicant to appear but does not bear on the procedures to be followed at or after the hearing which results from acceptance of that invitation.'</text>

88 Incidentally, in Cho at [33], Tamberlin and Katz JJ also said:
 

 
 'We do not consider that there is any special significance in the reference to the word "genuine" which would expand the content of s 425 beyond the ordinary and natural meaning of the language used. According to its terms the section simply requires that an opportunity be given to the applicant to appear and give evidence. Obviously if there is no real opportunity given then the section has not been complied with. This could arise, for example, where relevant evidence is not admitted or misleading statements are made by the decision-maker which discourage an applicant from calling or proceeding with a particular line of evidence.'

91 This examination of the authorities demonstrates that, far from having been criticised or not followed, SCAR is very much in the mainstream of authority. The invitation required by s 425 of the Migration Act (and, for identical reasons, that required by s 360), must be real and genuine. As the reasoning of Tamberlin and Katz JJ in Cho at [33] demonstrates, it is legitimate to examine what occurred at the hearing, in order to ascertain whether the invitation extended satisfies that requirement. If what took place under the guise of a hearing was not a genuine opportunity for an applicant for review 'to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to a decision under review', then the invitation required by s 425 (or s 360) will not have been extended as required. Of course, it is necessary to bear in mind, as Tamberlin and Katz JJ said in Cho at [29], that it is not legitimate to regard every want of procedural fairness as nullifying the invitation. It is only defects rendering the proceedings ineffective to fulfil the purpose for which the invitation is required that will have this effect. SCAR is therefore binding on me as a single judge. In any event, in my view, it is correctly decided.</text>

<text>94 In Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v WAFJ [2004] FCAFC 5 (2004) 137 FCR 30, the Full Court dealt with a case in which, on more than one occasion, the Refugee Review Tribunal had interrupted the evidence of an applicant for a protection visa, accused him of misbehaving, asserted that his evidence could not be believed, and treated him rudely and with sarcasm, to the point where he was likely to have become upset, confused and distressed, and to have been deflected from the presentation of his case. By majority, the Full Court upheld a judgment of a federal magistrate, setting aside the Refugee Review Tribunal's decision, by reason of denial of procedural fairness.

In that case, similarly to this one, the Tribunal announced in the course of the hearing that it did not have sufficient time to hear all the evidence the applicant wished to give. The Tribunal also interrupted the applicant and prevented him from giving details in the course of his evidence. The Tribunal made repeated references to the need to hurry, and to the shortage of available time. It did not hear all the witnesses who had attended for the purpose of giving evidence on behalf of the applicant. The Full Court held that the resulting decision of the Tribunal was the result of jurisdictional error, which involved a denial of procedural fairness.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/61.html</AustLII>
<text>96 Since writing these reasons for judgment, I have become aware of the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61. That judgment deals with an appeal by the Minister from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which quashed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse a Business Skills Migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal, a person who had applied from outside Australia for that visa. The issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the Full Court called 'common law procedural fairness', because the decision-maker did not draw to the respondent's attention the point on which the decision against him turned. If the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue, there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51A of the Migration Act , a provision in terms similar to both s 357A and s 422B , but relating to decisions by the Minister or delegates of the Minister. At [46] [59], the Full Court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness, because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent. The Full Court then proceeded, at [60] [70], to make some observations, which are clearly obiter, on the effect of s 51A. Following VXDC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 (2005) 146 FCR 562, the Full Court expressed the view that s 51A operates to exclude the 'common law natural justice hearing rule' altogether.

97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result.

98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'.

99 For these reasons, if it is necessary to ask the question whether Ms Antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the Tribunal denied her procedural fairness, by the manner in which it conducted her hearing, I do not regard VXDC and Lay Lat as requiring me to take a view different from that I have expressed above.</text>

<text>97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result.</text>

<tocase>Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/54.html</AustLII>
<text>100 It is therefore necessary to see whether the particular denial of procedural fairness made a difference, in the sense referred to in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 147, ie whether the Tribunal's error deprived Ms Antipova 'of the possibility of a successful outcome.' In the present case, the answer is plain. The Tribunal disbelieved Ms Antipova when she said that she was determined to make a life with Mr Petrou from the time she went to live with him on 18 May 2001. To a significant extent, the Tribunal's reasoning in this respect was based on its refusal to accept Ms Antipova's explanation of how she had come to continue with her marriage plans after meeting Mr Petrou, and then abandoned her marriage so soon after she had undertaken it. It was this very question that Ms Antipova was attempting to answer when the Tribunal member interrupted her, on several occasions, and asked her for a less detailed answer. If the Tribunal had been patient enough to listen to the detail, it might well have been persuaded to accept what Ms Antipova said. In other words, the very point on which Ms Antipova lost, because she was disbelieved, is one on which she would have given a fuller explanation, if the Tribunal had permitted her to do so. It cannot be said that the denial of procedural fairness in truncating Ms Antipova's evidence, to fit within a timetable about which she had not been warned, could have made no difference to the outcome of the proceeding.

101 It follows that the performance of the Tribunal's statutory function was affected by the denial of procedural fairness. The Tribunal's decision is therefore tainted by jurisdictional error, either because of its failure to comply with s 360 of the Migration Act , or because of a denial of procedural fairness, which s 357A of the Migration Act does not exclude from consideration.

102 Once the Tribunal had found that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had not been in a marriage-like relationship for 12 months before Ms Antipova applied for her visa, it was necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether reg 1.15A(2A)(b) of the Migration Regulations applied. The effect of that provision was that the requirements of reg 1.15A(2)(d) (in this case, the requirement of a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others for a period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of the application for a visa) did not apply if Ms Antipova could 'establish compelling and compassionate circumstances for the grant of the visa.'</text>

<tocase>Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/919.html</AustLII>
<text>106 In Neofotistou v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 919 (2005) 144 FCR 478 at [19] [28], the Court took a view similar to the one I have expressed, with respect to the provisions of reg 3A of the Migration Regulations 1989 (Cth). Regulation 3A(2) provided for the specification of a lesser period than the six-month period of cohabitation prior to the date of application for a visa, required by reg 3A(1), if :
 

 
 '(a) there are exceptional circumstances affecting the persons; and 
 
 (b) there are compelling reasons for specifying that lesser period.'

107 At [24], North J expressed the view that it was not to be expected that a decision-maker would be required to ignore the current state of affairs, unless the legislation expressly required such an exercise to be undertaken. At [25], his Honour referred to the fact that reg 3A(2) was an ameliorating provision, which suggested that it should be given an expansive, rather than a restrictive, meaning. At [26], his Honour regarded any uncertainty arising from applying the assessment on the facts as they exist at the time of the decision, rather than at the time of the application, as insufficient to outweigh the intended ameliorating purpose of the regulation. His Honour did not refer to Boakye-Danquah . In many respects, the provision with which North J was dealing in Neofotistou was more similar to that with which Wilcox J was dealing in Boakye-Danquah than either is to reg 1.15A(2A) of the Migration Regulations. Despite the fact that North J appears to have been unaware of Boakye-Danquah , I regard Neofotistou as correct, and as supporting the view I take of reg 1.15A(2A). As I have said, Boakye-Danquah is distinguishable, because it dealt with a provision very different from reg 1.15A(2A).</text>

<tocase>Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/30.html</AustLII>
<text>111 Nor does it appear that the Tribunal's decision can be set aside on the ground of bias. The ground was raised, but not argued in detail. The test for ostensible bias as a ground for setting aside a decision of the Tribunal is whether a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material objective facts might entertain a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question in issue. See Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67-68 per Deane J. In my view, a fair-minded lay observer, informed as to the material objective facts, who witnessed the Tribunal dealing with Ms Antipova's case, would have been more likely to conclude that the Tribunal had simply not performed its statutory function very well, rather than that it would fail to bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of Ms Antipova's case. The insistence on imposing a time limit, and the associated interruptions and attempts to shorten the evidence, were indicative of a desire to deal with the matter expeditiously, rather than of a desire to find against Ms Antipova, whatever the evidence might reveal. Nothing about the Tribunal's reasoning discloses that it approached the case with a closed mind.

112 For the reasons I have given, the Tribunal's decision is flawed by reason of its jurisdictional error. That error consists of failure to comply with the essential precondition to the exercise of the jurisdiction, provided by s 360(1) of the Migration Act , that the Tribunal invite the applicant to appear before it, to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. Although the Tribunal gave Ms Antipova such an invitation in form, because of the manner in which it conducted the hearing, there was no such invitation in reality. Alternatively, the Tribunal denied Ms Antipova procedural fairness by the manner in which it conducted the hearing, and the denial of procedural fairness is such as to amount to jurisdictional error. Ms Antipova is entitled to have the decision set aside, and to have the Tribunal rehear her application for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate.</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>113 Among the relief Ms Antipova seeks is a writ of certiorari, for the purpose of quashing the Tribunal's decision, as well as an order remitting the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law (in reality, a writ of mandamus, or an order in the nature of mandamus). Relief of these kinds can only be granted against the Tribunal, which is not a party to the proceeding. See SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [43] per McHugh J, [91] per Gummow J, [153] per Kirby J and [180] per Hayne J. It will therefore be necessary for me to make an order joining the Tribunal as the second respondent to the proceeding. It is safe to assume that the Tribunal would follow the usual practice of submitting to any order that the Court might make, save an order for costs against the Tribunal. Service of the application and associated material on the Tribunal can therefore be dispensed with. A writ of certiorari should issue, directed to the Tribunal, bringing the decision into the Court, for the purpose of quashing it. The decision should be quashed. A writ of mandamus should also issue, directed to the Tribunal, requiring it to hear and determine the application of Ms Antipova for review of the decision of the Minister according to law.

114 No reason was advanced, and none appears, why the usual order, that costs follow the event, should not be made. The Minister will be ordered to pay Ms Antipova's costs of the proceeding.
