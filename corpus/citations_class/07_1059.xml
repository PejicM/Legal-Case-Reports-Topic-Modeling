<text>9 The first proceeding was commenced in this Court against the State and concerned the transport claim only. It was remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court on 28 September 2001. In the Federal Magistrates Court McInnis FM delivered judgment on 28 November 2001 dismissing Mr Rainsford's application on the grounds that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (HREOC Act) and the DDA did not bind the State of Victoria: Rainsford v Victoria [2001] FMCA 115. Subsequent to this order, the HREOC Act was amended retrospectively to bind the State. Mr Rainsford appealed to the Full Federal Court which, by consent, ordered that the appeal be allowed and the matter remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>

<text>10 The second proceeding was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 8 November 2001 against both current respondents. It concerned the Charlotte Management Unit claim and was consolidated with the proceeding remitted from the Full Federal Court. The combined proceeding was heard before Bryant CFM in September 2003. In June 2004, before she had delivered judgment, the Chief Federal Magistrate was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court. Regrettably, the matter had to be reheard before a different Federal Magistrate, Raphael FM. That hearing took place on 26 27 August 2004 and was, pursuant to a direction made by the Federal Magistrate, a hearing of certain separate questions. Raphael FM answered the two separate questions adversely to Mr Rainsford and, in consequence of those unfavourable answers, dismissed the entire proceeding: Rainsford v Victoria [2004] FMCA 707 ; (2004) 184 FLR 110.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/163.html</AustLII>
<text>11 Mr Rainsford then appealed to the Full Federal Court which unanimously found that the separate questions posed by Raphael FM were inappropriate to answer because they relied on facts that had not been found or agreed between the parties: Rainsford v Victoria [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279. The Full Court remitted the matter back to the Federal Magistrates Court.

12 Finally, on 6 December 2005, after hearing submissions from counsel, Walters FM determined that it was appropriate to transfer the proceeding to this Court. No party objected to this course.

13 I must also mention a related proceeding. In September 2001, Mr Rainsford commenced a related proceeding in the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking judicial review of the decision to move him to the Charlotte Management Unit. That proceeding was dismissed on 23 November 2001. It is not challenged in this proceeding, and nor could it be. I mention it only because some of the affidavit evidence given in that proceeding has been put in evidence before me.

65 Some assistance on this question is to be gained from the obiter comments of Kenny J (with whom Hill and Finn JJ agreed) in the Full Court in this case. To begin with, however, it is important to note Kenny J's caveat at Rainsford v Victoria [2005] FCAFC 163 ; (2005) 144 FCR 279 at [52] :
 
 "The absence of findings of fact makes it very difficult indeed to provide any guidance to the parties on any substantive matter. An expression of opinion by this Court may be misleading because it is based on a misconception of the facts that are ultimately found ... With this in mind, only some very brief comments may be made about [the Federal Magistrate's] reasons in relation to the ['service'] question." 


Her Honour made those brief comments at [2005] FCAFC 163 ; 144 FCR 279 at [54] [55]:
 
 "[54] Section 4(1) provides an inclusive definition of services and that, amongst other things, unless the contrary intention appears, "services" includes "services of the kind provided by a government, a government authority or a local government body" (par (f)). As [the Federal Magistrate] recognised, on account of its remedial character, the DDA is to be generously construed and the word 'services' includes all matters which ordinarily fall within that notion: see IW v City of Perth at 11-12 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J; 22-23 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ; 27 per Toohey J; 39, 41-42 per Gummow J; and 69-70 per Kirby J. The identification of the 'service' at issue in any case is a question of fact for the trier of fact: see Waters at 361 per Mason CJ and Gaudron J, with whom Deane J relevantly agreed (382); 394 per Dawson and Toohey JJ; and 404-405 per McHugh J; and also Catholic Education Office at [12]-[13] per Tamberlin J and [102] per Sackville and Stone JJ. The question of whether an activity is a service for the purposes of s 24 of the DDA is essentially a matter of characterisation. In discharging statutory duties and functions and in exercising statutory powers in the public interest, a body may also be engaged in the provision of services to particular individuals: see IW v City of Perth at 44 per Gummow J; also 12-13 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J; 24 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ; 29 per Toohey J; and 72 per Kirby J. The Federal Magistrate erroneously relied on a distinction that he drew between the provision of services pursuant to a statutory discretion and "the situation ... where no discretionary element exists": see [17]. 
 
 [55] In addition to the management and security of prisons, the purposes of the Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) include provision for the welfare of offenders. The custodial regime that governs prisoners under this Act is compatible with the provision of services to them: see, eg, s 47. Indeed, this proposition is fortified by the provisions of the [Prison Services] Agreement to which counsel for Mr Rainsford referred on the hearing of the appeal (see [21]). In discharging their statutory duties and functions and exercising their powers with respect to the management and security of prisons, the respondents were also providing services to prisoners. The fact that prisoners were unable to provide for themselves because of their imprisonment meant that they were dependent in all aspects of their daily living on the provision of services by the respondents. Although the provision of transport and accommodation would ordinarily constitute the provision of services, whether the acts relied on by Mr Rainsford will constitute services for the DDA will depend upon the findings of fact, which are yet to be made and, in particular, the identification of the acts that are said to constitute such services."

79 I am conscious of the arguments made by Mr Rainsford relying on the provisions of the Corrections Act and the Prison Services Agreement; they are referred to in the passage of the judgment of Kenny J in the Full Court in this matter that I have set out at [65]. Attending to the welfare of prisoners is an important legal obligation placed on both respondents. This is all the more so given the vulnerabilities of prisoners who are unable to do much to control their circumstances within prisons. It is for this reason that I accept that certain facilities provided by the respondents to prisoners may constitute services for the purposes of the DDA. However, for the reasons I have identified, I do not consider either of the postulated services to fit the definition in the DDA. In addition, it is important not to focus only on the prisoner welfare purposes of the Corrections Act and the Prison Services Agreement. The first purpose listed in the Corrections Act is "to provide for the establishment management and security of prisons and the welfare of prisoners": s 1(a). This purpose demonstrates the balancing act that prison authorities must perform. Their obligations are not just to the welfare of prisoners but also to the general public and prison staff through providing adequate security measures, to other prisoners by ensuring that prisoners do not harm one another, and to the general good governance of the prison. To suggest that transport of prisoners or cell accommodation is a service to prisoners is to ignore the fact that they are functions performed in order to comply with the sometimes competing obligations of prison management to its prisoners, its staff, the public and the good governance of the prison.

80 The parties did not argue for any difference in result depending on whether transportation and accommodation were analysed as involving the provision of a service or the making available of a facility. I agree that in this case there is no relevant difference. Neither activity can be described as a facility any more than as a service.

81 Having concluded that the respondents did not provide a relevant service or make available a relevant facility, the application must be dismissed. In case a contrary view should be taken on this point, I will consider the other aspects of the applicant's claim.</text>

Although the provision of transport and accommodation would ordinarily constitute the provision of services, whether the acts relied on by Mr Rainsford will constitute services for the DDA will depend upon the findings of fact, which are yet to be made and, in particular, the identification of the acts that are said to constitute such services."

66 In IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1 the High Court considered the meaning of 'service' in the Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (WA), the provisions of which are for present purposes identical to those of the DDA. The case was a discrimination claim brought on behalf of an association of people with AIDS. They had sought and been refused planning approval from the City of Perth to build a drop-in centre for people affected by AIDS. They alleged that the decision to refuse the planning permit discriminated against the group on the basis that its members had AIDS. The majority of the High Court found against the association.

67 Brennan CJ and McHugh J said that a council considering planning approvals is not engaged in the provision of a service. They said, at IW 191 CLR at 11:
 
 "The term 'services' has a wide meaning. The Macquarie Dictionary relevantly defines it to include 'an act of helpful activity'; 'the providing or a provider of some accommodation required by the public, as messengers, telegraphs, telephones, or conveyance'; 'the organised system of apparatus, appliances, employees, etc, for supplying some accommodation required by the public'; 'the supplying or the supplier of water, gas, or the like to the public'; and 'the duty or work of public servants'. But wide as the definition is, in our opinion it is not capable of including a refusal to exercise the statutory discretion provided for by the Town Planning and Development Act 1928 (WA) and Clause 40 of the City of Perth City Planning Scheme to approve the use of premises for use other than as a shop." 
 
 

Further on, at IW 191 CLR at 18, they said:
 
 "The process by which the Council considers applications for approvals is not in our view arguably describable as a service that it provides to applicants for planning approval. Rather it is a power to process applications for the protection and general benefit of the residents of the City." 
 (Emphasis in original)

68 Dawson and Gaudron JJ took a somewhat different view. They began by noting, at IW 191 CLR at 23, that "'services', a word of complete generality, should not be given a narrow construction unless that is clearly required by definition or by context". However, where Brennan CJ and McHugh J found that the Council did not provide a service, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held that there was a service, but that it needed to be properly identified. They identified the service as "the exercise of a discretion to grant or withhold planning approval", and when so identified it was apparent that the Council had not failed to provide a service. The Council had considered the application for planning approval and had exercised its discretion, albeit contrary to the wishes of the association.

69 Gummow J had a similar view to that of Dawson and Gaudron JJ, saying, at IW 191 CLR at 44, that:
 
 "There is no reason in logic or good sense to deny the proposition that the Council may be engaged in the provision of services, not only to the community as a whole, but also to individual applicants who invoke the exercise of the powers of the Council under the town planning law. There is no dichotomy here between the discharge of statutory functions and the provision of services to those seeking the discharge of these functions." 


Like Dawson and Gaudron JJ, Gummow J found that the Council had not refused to provide the relevant service, since it had considered the application and refused it.

70 Toohey J dissented on the services point. He agreed with Dawson and Gaudron JJ and Gummow J that the Council provided a service, but said that classifying the service as the consideration of applications for planning permits was too narrow. His Honour said at IW 191 CLR at 28:
 
 "If the service is seen as the consideration of the application and its disposition and if it appears that the Council refused the application on the ground of impairment, why is that not discrimination 'in the manner in which the first-mentioned person provides the other person with those ... services'? Consideration of an application is of itself hardly a service; it is the disposition of the application which either provides or refuses the service. In the manner of that refusal there may be discrimination."

71 Kirby J also dissented, concluding, at IW 191 CLR at 75 that "[t]he word 'service' is wide enough to sustain the appellant's submission."

72 The judgments in IW are clearly dependent on the particular fact situation of that case, but some general propositions can be identified. First, not all government functions are services, although some undoubtedly are. Second, as the difference between Dawson, Gaudron and Gummow JJ on the one hand, and Toohey and Kirby JJ on the other hand demonstrates, the way in which the service is identified is critical. It is a question of fact determined by the situation of the particular case.

73 Counsel for the State suggested that the touchstone for service should be whether the act involves helpful or beneficial activity: IW 191 CLR at 11 per Brennan CJ and McHugh J. I accept that this is a useful test, but in a qualified way. Most activities are helpful or beneficial to someone. That in itself does not make them services. The question must be whether the act is helpful or beneficial to the relevant class of persons to which the person alleging discrimination belongs. There is little doubt that GSL provides a service to the State: there was in evidence parts of the Prison Services Agreement between the State and ACF and further evidence that ACF sub-contracted its obligations to GSL. Were it not for the decision of the Court of Appeal in Farah v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1998] QB 65, I would have thought that the State, by maintaining a prison system, provides a service to the general public. However, in Farah , where the alleged discriminator was the police, it was held that assisting and protecting members of the public is a service but that pursuing, arresting and charging criminals is not. To my mind, the pursuit of criminals is so much a part of protecting the members of the public that a distinction between them is hard to justify, but I need not pursue this. These services for the benefit of the State or the general public are not to the point. The question in this case is whether the respondents provide a service to the relevant class to which Mr Rainsford belongs, namely prisoners.

83 For each of his two claims, that requirement or condition has been differently formulated. As the judgments in IW [1997] HCA 30 ; 191 CLR 1 demonstrate, the precise formulation of the requirement or condition is critical. For the transport claim, Mr Rainsford says that the requirement or condition was that he be transported between prisons without access to conditions which would have protected his back. For their part, the respondents say that there are two services and that the condition only relates to the second. The first service is the provision of regular scheduled transport available to all prisoners. The second is the provision of separate special transport in circumstances where the regular transport was unavailable or inappropriate. The condition (or at least one of them) attaching to this second service is that the prisoner first obtain a medical certificate demonstrating a need for particular special transport.

84 I do not think either Mr Rainsford or the respondents accurately states both the service and its condition. On the evidence it is not correct to say that prisoners were offered a transport service that did not allow them access to conditions relevant to any medical problems. On the contrary, the evidence established that there were alternative transport arrangements available to those prisoners who demonstrated a need for them. I therefore reject Mr Rainsford's formulation of the condition. The respondents' formulation artificially divides transport into two categories, one for the able-bodied travelling at times when the regular service is available, the other for those with special requirements or travelling when the regular service is unavailable.

85 In my view, if there is a service (which, for the reasons set out above, I reject) then it is appropriate to classify it broadly, so as to encompass prison transport generally. The relevant condition which attaches to the service is that a prisoner who for medical reasons is unfit to take the regular transport service must first obtain a medical certificate stating that alternative transport arrangements should be made.</text>

<tocase>Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/49.html</AustLII>
<text>75 Part of the error I have just referred to comes from a failure on the part of Mr Rainsford to articulate with precision what service he contends for. The importance of this exercise was stressed by the High Court in Waters v Public Transport Corporation [1991] HCA 49 ; (1991) 173 CLR 349. In that case, McHugh J said at 404 5:
 
 "the goods or services which must be identified are those goods or services which are relevant to the complainant or any person or persons whom the complainant represents. Before there can be a finding of discrimination by a person in relation to the provision of goods or services, therefore, the relevant goods or services must be identified with sufficient precision to relate them to the facts of the case and the issues which arise for determination. If a person is alleged to have refused to perform services, eg, the services in question must be identified in sufficiently concrete terms to enable the Board to determine whether or not there has been a refusal to perform those services. What is a sufficiently precise identification of the service in one case may be too general in another. If the discrimination alleged was the refusal to allow impaired persons to travel on trams to St Kilda, it would be meaningless to identify the service provided as 'the public transport system'. If, however, the discrimination alleged was the refusal to allow impaired persons to travel on trams generally, 'transportation of members of the public by trams' might identify the service with sufficient precision to enable the relevant issues to be resolved."

76 In his outline of submissions, Mr Rainsford identifies the relevant service as "prison management and control, including the control of cell accommodation and transport between prisons". In my view, such a wide identification of service is meaningless; it is, in effect, no more than "prison management and control". The two activities complained of by Mr Rainsford are, first, the transportation of prisoners between prisons and between a prison and court and, second, the accommodation of prisoners in cells within the prison system. This is the appropriate level of precision with which to identify the alleged services. So identified, I am of the view that neither constitutes a service for the purpose of the DDA.

77 At [74] I postulated what would have happened had no transport been available to prisoners. The question is entirely hypothetical since transport is an inherent part of incarceration. Prisoners on remand must attend court for their hearings. Prisoners in low-security prisons who are re-classified must be moved to higher-security prisons. The prison system simply could not function without prison transport. It is an artificial use of the word service to apply it to a fundamental integer of a system over which those affected have no or almost no control.

82 The discrimination that the respondents are alleged to have engaged in is indirect discrimination as defined in s 6 of the DDA. In order to satisfy this definition Mr Rainsford must show that he was required to comply with a requirement or condition. In responding to the requirements that Mr Rainsford claims he was unable to comply with, the respondents raised a number of different arguments. One argument was that the alleged conditions were negative and that the DDA does not apply to a negative condition. Another argument was that the conditions in Mr Rainsford's case were no more than inherent in the relevant services and that the condition must be over and above the service: see Waters [1991] HCA 49 ; 173 CLR 349. In my view the question whether Mr Rainsford was required to comply with a requirement or condition can be disposed of without answering these submissions of the respondents. All that needs to be done is to correctly identify the service and the requirement and to apply these to Mr Rainsford's case. Once this is done, it is apparent that for neither claim can Mr Rainsford demonstrate that he was required to comply with a requirement or condition.</text>

<text>78 The accommodation of prisoners in cells within the prison system is similarly an inherent part of incarceration. Prisoners must be housed somewhere within the prison system and that this is so demonstrates that for a prisoner to have a cell is not a helpful or beneficial activity so far as the prisoner is concerned. In so far as there is choice in the allocation of prison cells, it is a purely administrative and prison management matter. It does not, of itself, provide prisoners with a benefit. Rather, it is better described as being "part and parcel of the exercise of a statutory duty and cannot be described as the provision of a service or services", to adopt the words of Underwood J in Secretary of the Department of Justice and Industrial Relations v Anti-Discrimination Commissioner (2003) 11 Tas R 324 at 341.</text>

<text>100 In the case of the transport claim, I accept that Mr Rainsford experienced some pain and suffering as a result of being transported in the manner in which he was. There is however, another problem with his claim on this point. It is that he was able to comply with the condition that was imposed. Mr Rainsford attempts to get around this problem by saying that the requirement was that he be transported without access to conditions that would protect his back from injury. In support of this negative formulation of the condition, he relies on the recent Full Court decision in Hurst v Queensland [2006] FCAFC 100 ; (2006) 151 FCR 562. In that case, the appellant was a deaf child who was denied access to an Auslan teacher or interpreter. The trial judge found that because the child could cope in a regular classroom without Auslan assistance, she could comply with the condition that she "accept an education and receive instruction in English without the assistance of an Auslan teacher or an Auslan interpreter": Hurst v Education Queensland [2005] FCA 405 at [85] . The Full Court found that the trial judge erred in his construction of s 6(c) of the DDA. Ryan, Finn and Weinberg JJ said at 151 FCR at [134]:
 
 "His Honour's own findings ought to have led him to conclude that [the appellant] was relevantly 'not able to comply' with the requirement or condition that she be taught in English, without the assistance of Auslan. In our view, it is sufficient to satisfy that component of s 6(c) that a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with a requirement or condition of the relevant kind, irrespective of whether that person can 'cope' with the requirement or condition. A disabled person's inability to achieve his or her full potential, in educational terms, can amount to serious disadvantage. In [the appellant's] case, the evidence established that it had done so." 
 

The evidence referred to in this passage included that without Auslan in the classroom the appellant "would cope, but not reach her full educational potential": Hurst 151 FCR at [44] and [108] [113].

101 The Full Court made it plain (at Hurst 151 FCR at [132]) that the outcome depended on the highly specific facts of the case. There was almost no discussion of whether a claimant who suffers something less than 'serious disadvantage' in complying with a condition would satisfy s 6(c) of the DDA. There is, however, one obiter paragraph that is fatal to Mr Rainsford's claim. After discussing the first instance decision of Madgwick J in Clarke v Catholic Education Office (2003) 202 ALR 340, in which his Honour had found in favour of another deaf child who would have faced 'serious' or 'substantial' disadvantage by not being educated with Auslan, the Full Court said at Hurst 151 FCR at [120]:
 
 "there appears to be no real difference between his Honour's [ie Madgwick J's] use of the term 'substantial disadvantage' in relation to the comparable base group, and his use of the term 'serious disadvantages' in relation to the issue of ability to comply. On the other hand, neither formulation accords with [the submission of counsel for the intervener, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission,] that 'non-trivial disadvantage' is all that s 6(c) contemplates. That submission goes too far, and cannot be accepted." 
 

Later on, their Honours note that they do not do deal with the 'various construction arguments' put by counsel for HREOC: Hurst 151 FCR at [135]. There was no evidence before me as to what those arguments were.</text>

In that case, the appellant was a deaf child who was denied access to an Auslan teacher or interpreter. The trial judge found that because the child could cope in a regular classroom without Auslan assistance, she could comply with the condition that she "accept an education and receive instruction in English without the assistance of an Auslan teacher or an Auslan interpreter": Hurst v Education Queensland [2005] FCA 405 at [85] . The Full Court found that the trial judge erred in his construction of s 6(c) of the DDA. Ryan, Finn and Weinberg JJ said at 151 FCR at [134]:
 
 "His Honour's own findings ought to have led him to conclude that [the appellant] was relevantly 'not able to comply' with the requirement or condition that she be taught in English, without the assistance of Auslan. In our view, it is sufficient to satisfy that component of s 6(c) that a disabled person will suffer serious disadvantage in complying with a requirement or condition of the relevant kind, irrespective of whether that person can 'cope' with the requirement or condition. A disabled person's inability to achieve his or her full potential, in educational terms, can amount to serious disadvantage. In [the appellant's] case, the evidence established that it had done so." 
 

The evidence referred to in this passage included that without Auslan in the classroom the appellant "would cope, but not reach her full educational potential": Hurst 151 FCR at [44] and [108] [113].</text>

<text>101 The Full Court made it plain (at Hurst 151 FCR at [132]) that the outcome depended on the highly specific facts of the case. There was almost no discussion of whether a claimant who suffers something less than 'serious disadvantage' in complying with a condition would satisfy s 6(c) of the DDA. There is, however, one obiter paragraph that is fatal to Mr Rainsford's claim. After discussing the first instance decision of Madgwick J in Clarke v Catholic Education Office (2003) 202 ALR 340, in which his Honour had found in favour of another deaf child who would have faced 'serious' or 'substantial' disadvantage by not being educated with Auslan, the Full Court said at Hurst 151 FCR at [120]:
 
 "there appears to be no real difference between his Honour's [ie Madgwick J's] use of the term 'substantial disadvantage' in relation to the comparable base group, and his use of the term 'serious disadvantages' in relation to the issue of ability to comply. On the other hand, neither formulation accords with [the submission of counsel for the intervener, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission,] that 'non-trivial disadvantage' is all that s 6(c) contemplates. That submission goes too far, and cannot be accepted." 
 

Later on, their Honours note that they do not do deal with the 'various construction arguments' put by counsel for HREOC: Hurst 151 FCR at [135]. There was no evidence before me as to what those arguments were.</text>
