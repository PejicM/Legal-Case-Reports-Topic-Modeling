<text>1 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, published as SZHDO v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1156. That judgment was given on 15 August 2008. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application by the appellant, seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"), dated 24 December 2007 and handed down or sent on 10 January 2008. The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"), to refuse to grant to the appellant a protection visa.

2 The appellant is a citizen of Nepal. He arrived in Australia on 29 November 2004. On 12 January 2005, he applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a protection visa. The Minister's delegate decided to refuse to grant the visa on 20 January 2005. The appellant has had two hearings in the Tribunal. The first decision affirming the delegate's decision was set aside by the Federal Magistrates Court and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal.

3 By s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Migration Act "), there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas. A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. The terms "Refugees Convention" and "Refugees Protocol" are defined in s 5(1) of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967 . It is convenient to refer to those two instruments, taken together, as the "Convention". For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that, pursuant to the Convention, Australia has protection obligations to a person who:
 owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country</text>
