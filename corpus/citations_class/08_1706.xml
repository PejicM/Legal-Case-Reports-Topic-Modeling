<tocase>Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd (in liq) [2007] FCA 1428</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1428.html</AustLII>
<text>In Employers Reinsurance Corporation v Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 28 ; (2008) 166 FCR 398 a Full Court considered a claim by investors involved with an insolvent investment firm for a declaration that the firm's insurer was liable to it under the terms of a professional indemnity policy. No claim was made by the liquidator of the firm against the insurer. At first instance, French J had utilised O 6 r 2 to join the insurer: Ashmere Cove Pty Ltd v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd (in lid) [2007] FCA 1428. On appeal the insurer argued that there was no "matter" in the requisite constitutional sense since the liquidator was not making the claim. Heerey, Sackville and Siopis JJ rejected this submission (at 411-412 [61]-[62]) and held (at 414 [73]-[74]) that the seeking of such a declaration and consequent joinder pursuant to O 6 r 2 was an appropriate exercise of discretion by the primary judge. It seems to me that similar reasoning applies in this case. The making of a declaration that Allianz is liable to Bentley Barton and Mr Taylor under the terms of the Policy and the presence of Allianz in any such suit will, effectively, resolve in the most efficient fashion, all of the issues between the parties. Accordingly, Allianz should be joined pursuant to O 6 r 2.</text>

<tocase>Council of the City of Sydney v West [1965] HCA 68 ; (1965) 114 CLR 481</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1965/68.html</AustLII>
<text>The application to join Allianz was made pursuant to O 6 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules , s 562 of the Corporations Act and s 6(4) of the Law Reform Act. Allianz resisted joinder on only one ground. It contended that the Policy contained an exclusion which was applicable in the present circumstances so that the claim against it would inevitably fail. The clause upon which Allianz relied was entitled "Investment Performance Exclusion" (IPE). That clause provided: 
 We are not liable to indemnify you in respect of any claim directly or indirectly based upon, attributable to, or in consequence of:
 (a) depreciation (or failure to appreciate) in value of any investments, including but not limited to securities, commodities, currencies, options and futures transactions; or
 (b) any actual or alleged representation, advice or guarantee provided by or on your behalf as to the performance of any such investments.
 For the sake of clarity we agree that this exclusion does not apply to any claim arising directly out of your failure to effect a specific investment transaction pursuant to a specific instruction from a client of yours .

Allianz argued that all of the losses which were claimed by the applicants were connected with a depreciation of "investments". It was submitted that a necessary step in the applicants' pleaded case was that the value of their investments had decreased from which it must follow that the losses claimed fell squarely within the terms of the exclusion. The applicants on the other hand denied that the losses which were claimed by them could all necessarily be described as "investments". Further, they submitted that the clause, properly construed, applied only to "investments" which were authorised and that the investments which had been effected by Bentley Barton and/or Mr Taylor were contrary to Mr Done's express instructions.

The loss claimed from Bentley Barton is pleaded in paragraph 512 of the proposed further amended statement of claim. It says: By reason of Bentley Barton's breach of its duty of care, each of the applicants has suffered loss and damage. 
 Particulars of loss and damage 
 
See particulars to paragraph

It is important to emphasise that the Court's conclusion directed attention to the status of the investments as authorised. That approach to the question of the construction of the exclusion clause was not surprising. The same result, effectively, had been achieved in the Court's prior decision in Council of the City of Sydney v West [1965] HCA 68 ; (1965) 114 CLR 481. In this case Mr West had driven his car into the Domain car park in Sydney. He had been handed a ticket by the attendant upon entering. It contained a clause which read: 
 1. The Council does not accept any responsibility for the loss or damage to any vehicle or for loss of or damage to any article or thing in or upon any vehicle or for any injury to any person however such loss, damage or injury may arise or be caused.

After the car was parked a rogue obtained, by deceit, a duplicate of the parking ticket for Mr West's vehicle and so armed, proceeded to drive Mr West's car to the exit where he was permitted by an attendant to drive away without further inquiry. The ticket also provided that it had to be presented for time stamping and payment before taking delivery of the vehicle. Barwick CJ and Taylor J held (at 489-490): 
 The fact that the attendant at the exit through which the car was driven was negligent is of no consequence in the case; the act of delivery was one which was neither authorized nor permitted by the contract and in our view the appellant was not entitled to be exonerated by the exempting clause.

The application of that principle to the present facts is, it seems to me, straightforward. "Investments" within the meaning of the IPE clause should be construed to mean "authorised investments". Such a construction is consonant with the final words of the clause which show clearly that the clause was not intended to cover the situation where, contrary to instructions, the insured had failed to effect a particular investment. That demonstrates that the clause is concerned to make clear that the insurers are not underwriting the insured's investment advice business. However, the clause says nothing, in my opinion, about situations where the liability of the insured is said to arise, not from the execution of instructions in relation to investments, but rather from the expenditure of client funds contrary to instructions. If it were otherwise, the exclusion would apply wherever client money was misappropriated so long as the final destination of that money was in an "investment".</text>

<tocase>Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/82.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicants, however, also submitted that the exclusion should be construed as applying only to authorised investments. This submission should be accepted. In Nissho Iwai Australia Ltd v Malaysian International Shipping Corporation, Berhad [1989] HCA 32 ; (1989) 167 CLR 219 at 227 a unanimous High Court adopted a passage from Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 82 ; (1986) 161 CLR 500 at 510 in these terms: 
 ... the interpretation of an exclusion clause is to be determined by construing the clause according to its natural and ordinary meaning, read in the light of the contract as a whole, thereby giving due weight to the context in which the clause appears including the nature and object of the contract, and, where appropriate, construing the clause contra proferentem in case of ambiguity.

The operation of that principle in the context of unauthorised investments was itself considered by the High Court in Darlington Futures Pty Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd . In that case, a broker dealing on the commodity futures market entered into a written agreement with a client under which the broker was instructed to engage on behalf of the client in a form of commodity futures dealings known as tax straddles. An amount of trading occurred contrary to the client's instructions and in consequence heavy losses were sustained. Clause 6 of the written agreement between the broker and the client contained various acknowledgements about the exigencies of the market and concluded with the sentence: 
 The Client finally acknowledges that the Agent will not be responsible for any loss arising in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this Agreement or not, and that the Agent shall not be liable to account to the Client for any profit made by the Agent in any of the circumstances set out in clause 9 whether or not such circumstances result in a loss to the Client.

Having made the statement set out above, the Court then turned to the question of how that sentence was to be construed. The Court held (at 511 per Mason, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ): 
 Turning now to cl. 6 of the contract between the appellant and the respondent, the question is whether the relevant losses arose "in any way out of any trading activity undertaken on behalf of the Client whether pursuant to this agreement or not". Read in context these words plainly refer to trading activity undertaken by the appellant for the respondent with the respondent's authority, whether pursuant to the agreement or not. It can scarcely be supposed that the parties intended to exclude liability on the part of the appellant for losses arising from trading activity in which it presumed to engage on behalf of the respondent when the appellant had no authority so to do.</text>

<tocase>Ogilvie-Grant v East (1983) 7 ACLR 669</tocase>
<text>The circumstances in which it would be appropriate to grant leave are not closed. In Ogilvie-Grant v East (1983) 7 ACLR 669 at 672 the following observation was made by McPherson J (with whom Campbell CJ and Sheahan J agreed): 
 It, of course, follows that it is quite impossible to state in an exhaustive manner all the circumstances in which leave to proceed may be appropriate, but in the past they have been said to include factors such as the amount and seriousness of the claim, the degree of complexity of the legal and factual issues involved, and the stage to which the proceedings, if already commenced, may have progressed.

Here the proceeding is of considerable complexity. To require those claims to be dealt with by the liquidator on a proof of debt with the almost inevitable consequence of an appeal to a court in relation to any rejection of that proof of debt seems to me to be an inefficient way to proceed. More is this so where I have concluded that there is a potentially an insurance policy involved. Although the proceeding has not progressed far, it seems to me in all the circumstances that the complexity and seriousness of the proceeding, together with the existence of a potential insurance policy, justify a grant of leave pursuant to s 471B. Leave to proceed under the Bankruptcy Act</text>

<tocase>Re Rose; Ex parte Devaban Pty Ltd (unreported, Hill J, 7 October 1994)</tocase>
<text>I turn then to the question of whether leave should be granted to the Applicants to proceed against Mr Taylor pursuant to s 58(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act . In Re Rose; Ex parte Devaban Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1082 (unreported, 7 October 1994, Hill J) it was held (at 3-4): 
 On the other hand, the Act does contemplate that the Court will, in an appropriate case, grant leave. In that respect a case would be an appropriate case where the proceedings proposed against the bankrupt are proceedings to which other parties are involved and for the proper conduct of which it may be necessary for the bankrupt to become a party.</text>
