<tocase>Jennings v Credit Corp Australia Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 210 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 709</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/210.html</AustLII>
<text>48 I also note that in Jennings v Credit Corp Australia Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 210 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 709, an assignment of the legal ownership of a debt was made after the expiry of the limitation period. The Court permitted the substitution of the new legal owner.

49 The question is whether Errol Nominees, if it were the trustee, is added or substituted as a party. It is not uncommon for trustees to be changed. In ordinary circumstances it should not follow that questions of limitation thereby arise. If in such a case, the new trustee were added rather than substituted, the beneficiaries would lose their rights to bring proceedings. Consistent with the provisions of the Trustee Act and the authorities I have cited, I am of the view that the amendment sought is best characterised as a substitution.

50 The fact, however, is that the condition that gives rise to amendment under O 6 r 10(2) has not occurred as there has not yet been a passing of interest by assignment or otherwise. The occasion has not arisen to make the order for substitution sought.</text>

<tocase>Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited [2006] FCA 531</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/531.html</AustLII>
<text>29 As set out in Vintage Developments Pty Limited v GHD Pty Limited [2006] FCA 531 at [10] (' Vintage (No 1)' ), the further amended statement of claim was filed with the leave of the Court, which leave, obtained in November 2005 and prior to the expiry of the limitation period, did not extend to joining Mr Johnston. I gave leave for that joinder on 11 May 2006 and no further order was sought from the applicants as to leave to file a second further amended application and statement of claim.

30 The submission now is that, despite the decision in Vintage (No 1) , this is the first amendment to the application and statement of claim to effect that joinder, so that the proposed second further amended statement of claim discloses a new (and statute barred) cause of action as against Mr Johnston.

31 In Vintage (No 1) , I granted leave to join Mr Johnston to the proceedings. That is, he was joined to the proceedings as pleaded in the pleadings filed on 2 December 2005. Those pleadings constitute the original claim against him. The circumstances, put shortly, were that an amended application and further amended statement of claim were filed within the limitation period naming Mr Johnston as a respondent. Leave that had been given to file the amended documents did not extend to leave to include Mr Johnston as a respondent, nor to include allegations or orders against him. Many of the arguments put by Ms Richards were canvassed in Vintage (No 1) . It is the case, as I noted at [24] and [27], that leave was not sought further to amend the amended statement of claim to permit the pleading against Mr Johnston, as pleaded in the further amended statement of claim. However, as I discussed at [33], the further amended statement of claim filed within time may be considered as a fresh pleading as against Mr Johnston. It was put in Vintage (No 1) that Mr Johnston should not be joined because it was a futility as the limitation period would apply because the proceedings had not commenced on 2 December 2005 but would only commence on the date of joinder. I rejected that submission.</text>

<tocase>Worrell v Westpac Banking Corporation (1994) 51 FCR 304</tocase>
<text>44 The rights of Errol Nominees do not extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced (cf Worrell v Westpac Banking Corporation (1994) 51 FCR 304). Indeed the rights of the proposed party have not yet come into existence. What is proposed, however, is that the rights of the new trustee will substitute for the rights of the existing trustee, which do extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced.

45 A new trustee may by registered deed be appointed in place of a trustee (s 6(1) Trustee Act 1925 (NSW) (' Trustee Act ')). Section 6(8) provides that a new trustee appointed under this section may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument creating the trust. Errol Investments submits that this is reflected in O 6 r 11(2) which should therefore be applied.</text>

<tocase>Yorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd [1996] 1 All ER 519</tocase>
<text>46 In Yorkshire Regional Health Authority v Fairclough Building Ltd [1996] 1 All ER 519, the United Kingdom Court of Appeal considered the meaning of a "new claim" in s 35(2) of the Limitation Act 1980 (UK) and O 15 r 7 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK) as those provisions then provided. Order 15 r 7 relevantly provided:
 
 
 '(1) Where a party to an action dies or becomes bankrupt but the cause of action survives, the action shall not abate by reason of the death or bankruptcy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Where at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter the interest or liability of any party is assigned or transmitted to or devolves upon some other person, the Court may, if it thinks it necessary in order to ensure that all matters in dispute in the cause or matter may be effectively and completely determined and adjudicated upon, order that other person to be made a party to the cause or matter and the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party.'

47 The Court observed that the rule of court, which is cast in similar but not identical terms to O 6 r 10 of the Rules contains no reference to limitation and commented '[t] his is as it should be, since the circumstances in which the rule may be invoked do not give rise to any question of limitation ' (at 523). The Court recognised that the new party is substituted because he or she has succeeded to a claim or liability already represented in the action and sues or is sued in respect of the existing cause of action. It concluded that ' the expiry of the limitation period is completely irrelevant ' (at 523). While the English O 15 r 7 specifically provided for ' the proceedings to be carried on as if he had been substituted for the first mentioned party ' and those words are not present in O 6 r 10 of the Rules, the logic of the Court of Appeal is persuasive.</text>
