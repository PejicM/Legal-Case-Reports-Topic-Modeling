<text>47 It is appropriate, in a case such as this, for the Court to evaluate the strength of CSA's case for final relief in relation to this aspect of its claim in order to see where the balance of convenience lies: Australian Broadcasting Commission v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [71] , [72] and Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535-536.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/1.html</AustLII>
<text>45 The requisite strength of the likelihood or probability which will be sufficient depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the orders sought: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 84 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.

46 Here the grant of the interlocutory injunctions sought would amount, in practical effect, to final relief in respect to the s 45 case at least so far as the Perth Test is concerned. In my opinion, there are serious issues to be tried in relation to the various elements which arise on CSA's s 45 case. Accordingly the balance of convenience now requires to be considered.</text>

<tocase>Carlton &amp; United Breweries (NSW) Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New South Wales Ltd (1978) 76 ALR 633</tocase>
<text>63 Despite this, CSA, no doubt advisedly, decided to challenge what counsel for CSA described as the ARU business model. The challenge, as I have indicated, goes well beyond the immediate s 45 case in respect of the Perth Test. These proceedings are the manifestation of that decision. It was unnecessary in my opinion, in order to pursue such challenge, for CSA to enter into contracts with its corporate clients for the supply of hospitality packages, including tickets, for the Perth Test. The proceedings might simply have sought declarations without deliberately involving third parties. The proceedings could also have been instituted as early as November last year when CSA and the ARU terminated their contractual relationship, if it had wanted to obtain relevant discretionary relief in time for the Perth Test. There has been an unreasonable delay on the part of CSA in bringing this application. I would, for that reason alone, have refused to grant the relief sought: Carlton &amp; United Breweries (NSW) Pty Ltd v Bond Brewing New South Wales Ltd (1978) 76 ALR 633 at 638-9.

64 Further it is clear that when CSA entered into its contract with SFC for the acquisition of packages in order to access tickets, at a significant premium, for its own packages, it was aware that this was a contravention of the Ticket Condition.

65 The position of the purchasers of corporate hospitality packages from CSA is of course regrettable. However, there is a consideration which outweighs their personal position. In my opinion, a Court should be alert not to give weight to circumstances, deliberately and unnecessarily created by the moving party, which were then sought to be relied upon as a relevant ingredient in the consideration of the balance of convenience. I consider this to be so, even where it involves third parties. There may be occasions when, despite the wilful nature of the moving party's conduct that the position of third parties will nonetheless be a determining factor. This is not such a case.</text>

<tocase>Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1040.html</AustLII>
<text>6 Tickets issued by the ARU which are in substance the same as the tickets for the Perth Test, have already been the subject of consideration by this Court: Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157. This decision, in its application to this case, is to the effect that each ticket comprises a licence from the ARU to the bearer for admission to Subiaco Oval for the purpose of watching the match, in consideration of payment of the ticket price. The case did not concern s 45 of the Act .

7 The following condition is printed on each ticket for the Perth Test ("the Ticket Condition"): 
 Sale of this ticket creates a contract between the ARU and the purchaser which gives the purchaser a transferable but conditional licence for admission to the specified match. The licence will automatically terminate if the purchaser or any subsequent transferee: 
 
 (a) resells this ticket at a premium; 
 (b) resells the is ticket through a broker or agent; 
 (c) advertises or offers this ticket for resale on the internet or in any other medium; or 
 (d) uses this ticket for advertising, promotion or other commercial purpose (including competitions or trade promotions) or to enhance the demand for other goods or services, 
 
without the prior, written permission of the ARU. The ARU has the right to deny admission if the licence has terminated.

8 The Ticket Condition prohibits the resale of the ticket at a premium, that is, at a price higher than the amount for which it was sold by the ARU, as well as use of the ticket for commercial purposes, without the prior written permission of the ARU. If the condition is breached, the ARU is entitled to deny admission to any bearer: Hospitality Group at [103]-[105] and [136].

9 There is an immediate and direct relationship between the Ticket Condition and the SFC Contract Condition. The SFC Contract Condition amounts to a pre-emptive refusal on the part of the ARU to give permission to the SFC to use the tickets to be provided under the SFC Contract for commercial purposes by way of supplying them to CSA. Such permission under the Ticket Condition is necessary before tickets can be used for commercial purposes. The use of tickets for commercial purposes without such permission constitutes a breach of the Ticket Condition.

10 The written evidence of Mr Eddie Moore, Head of ARU's Operations, as to the justification for the Ticket Condition and its enforcement by the ARU, is to the following effect. It is to ensure that the purchaser of a ticket to the Perth Test or any Rugby Union test match does not pay more than the face value price appearing on the ticket. This objective is consistent with the ARU's responsibility to promote and advance the sport of Rugby Union because it maximises public access to Rugby Union tests through the various channels available to a wide cross-section of the public. In addition, the Ticket Condition assists the ARU in protecting an important revenue stream from the sale of hospitality packages which is in turn invested into the Rugby Union game. In particular, by imposing the Ticket Condition, the purpose of the ARU is to:
 
 
 (a) prevent scalping and a black market in tickets at inflated prices;
 (b) ensure that all members of the public within the various groups that attend Rugby Union tests, including those who wish to use corporate hospitality packages, have purchased the same product at the same price;
 (c) prevent confusion amongst the public as to which agents are official and authorised to sell tickets on behalf of the ARU and those who are not;
 (d) prevent persons such as CSA from increasing the cost of corporate hospitality associated with Rugby Union tests in an era when re-building is the focus of the ARU.</text>

<tocase>News Ltd v South Sydney Football Club [2003] HCA 45 ; (2003) 215 CLR 563</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/45.html</AustLII>
<text>59 Furthermore, s 45(2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii) require a consideration of "purpose". It is the subjective purpose of the ARU in seeking to enforce both the Condition in the SFC Contract as well as the Ticket Condition, which is relevant: News Ltd v South Sydney Football Club [2003] HCA 45 ; (2003) 215 CLR 563 at [18] .

60 I think it more likely than not that the ARU's subjective purposes are as deposed to by Mr Moore, which broadly, is to promote Rugby Union in Australia and to ensure that all members of the public are given equal access to rugby tickets so far as possible. I do not think it likely that the purpose was, as CSA contends, to "lock-out" CSA from supplying corporate hospitality at the Perth Test match.

61 CSA submits that it cannot be adequately compensated by an award of damages because it has entered into contracts to supply the tickets to third parties and without the aid of the Court it will be unable to supply these tickets. It says this will cause damage to its reputation which is incapable of accurate assessment and will also cause a windfall to the ARU by securing to itself, the SFC or to Matchpoint a transfer of the customers who would otherwise seek corporate hospitality packages from it. It also submits that there is no evidence that these third parties will be adequately accommodated or dealt with in a manner suitable to them.</text>

<tocase>Visy Paper Pty Limited v ACCC [2003] HCA 59 ; (2003) 216 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/59.html</AustLII>
<text>55 Second, the ARU submits that even if the ARU does supply SFC with tickets in SFC's capacity as principal, the ARU does so on condition that SFC will not re-supply those tickets except to a limited extent, being to members and specified clients: s 47(2)(f) of the Act . However, by operation of s 47(10) the prohibition on exclusive dealing will not apply to such an arrangement. It submits that by operation of s 45(6) , the prohibition against exclusionary provisions in s 45(2)(a)(i) does not apply to the alleged provision in ARU's arrangement with SFC: Visy Paper Pty Limited v ACCC [2003] HCA 59 ; (2003) 216 CLR 1 at [29] - [35] .

56 There was less than full argument on this submission. It is arguably correct. CSA did not persuade me that it was wrong or likely to be wrong. This is principally because it again would involve my being satisfied, to the necessary degree, that there was a substantial lessening of competition. For the following reasons I cannot be satisfied as to that.

57 Third, I have not been persuaded to the necessary degree of the likelihood that there has been the substantial lessening of competition in an identified market arising out of the arrangements between the ARU and the SFC or through the enforcement by the ARU of the Ticket Condition in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) or (b)(ii) of the Act .</text>
