<text>1 By order made herein dated 7 November 2007 I appointed Mr Colin Nicol as receiver to deal with certain funds which had been held in the names of the respondent, the Terra Nova Cache and the Principality of Camside. The circumstances in which the receiver came to be appointed are explained in my judgment in Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. Mr Nicol entered on his task promptly. He has discovered various funds which are additional to those which are identified in Schedule A of the order made on 7 November 2007. He has also identified a large number of persons who claim to have made deposits in the Terra Nova Cache. He has sought the co-operation and assistance of the respondent in identifying depositors and the whereabouts of moneys contributed by them. He has received very little assistance from the respondent in response to these requests.

2 By an Amended Notice of Motion dated 4 February 2008 Mr Nicol seeks various orders to assist him in the performance of his duties. I heard argument on the Amended Notice of Motion on 6 February 2008. Following argument I indicated that I would make orders in the terms of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Motion and would publish reasons for doing so at a later date. I reserved judgment on whether orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the Amended Notice of Motion should be made. What follows are my reasons for making orders 1 to 3 and my reasons, following further consideration, for determining that orders in the terms proposed in paragraphs 5 and 6 (with some minor variations) should be made.

3 The first order sought by Mr Nicol is the addition of a number of funds to those identified in Schedule A of the order which I made on 7 November 2007. The evidence established, in each case, a reasonable basis for the conclusion that the source of the moneys in those funds was contributions made to the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside. Counsel for the respondent did not direct any specific argument to the question of whether order 1 should or should not be made. It is appropriate that the order should be made.

13 Counsel for the receiver argued that these orders should be made because the respondent had, during the period of the receivership, failed to respond to requests made by the receiver that he provide relevant documents to the receiver. In particular the receiver relied on the failure of the respondent to comply with paragraph five of the orders made on 7 November 2007 which required the respondent to provide to the receiver "all bank statements, books of accounts, receipts, invoices, correspondence or other documents in his possession, custody, power or control relating to monies received from members of the public for deposit in the Terra Nova Cache." The receiver's solicitor had written on numerous occasions to the respondent requesting that he comply with the Court's order. The respondent had not done so. He had, through his solicitors, made general claims that he could not be required to produce any documents because of the protection afforded him by the privilege against self incrimination. In one letter the respondent acknowledged that he had three documents (bank statements) which fell within the terms of the order. He also provided the receiver with a copy of documentary evidence tendered in the course of the trial of the principal proceeding in which the order appointing the receiver was made: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608. The respondent has failed to advise the receiver whether there are additional documents, which although not in his possession, are within his power or control.

14 Counsel for the respondent opposed the making of the proposed orders. He made what he described as "an in limine objection" to the making of any order that would require the respondent to swear an affidavit of documents or discover any documents on the ground that to do so would infringe his right to protection against self incrimination.

15 In making the in limine objection counsel for the respondent relied on an affidavit, sworn by the respondent, in which he deposed that:
 
 "3. It has been alleged that with respect to the Principality of Camside and Terra Nova Cache, I am in breach if the Banking Act , sections 7 and 66 , which are respectively an indictable offence and an offence. Such allegations have already been tried herein and found proven on a civil basis, and it has been maintained by APRA, a Commonwealth instrumentality, that the right to bring criminal charges against me with respect of the alleged breaches of the relevant sections remains extant. 
 
 4. The documents requested clearly relate to the alleged breaches of the Act and, accordingly, I object to producing the same pursuant to the right against self incrimination." 
 

It is noted that the respondent makes an in limine objection to production. He does not identify the documents for which a privilege claim is made. He does not explain why their production would tend to incriminate him. Moreover he offers no reason why he should not be required to swear an affidavit of documents.

19 As already noted counsel for the respondent sought to argue that the circumstances which confronted the respondent in this case were such as to bring it within the exceptional category which Deane J referred to in Refrigerated Express. I invited counsel to articulate with precision the rare and exceptional circumstances which rendered the present case one which fell within the exception to the ordinary rule. He submitted that his client had been found, in Siminton (No 6) , to have contravened ss 7 and 66 of the Banking Act . These findings had been made on the civil standard. His client apprehended that he might, at some time in the future, be charged with having committed criminal offences by contravening those provisions. He contended that the mere acknowledgement by the respondent that he had in his possession, custody or control documents of the character referred to in the proposed order could be used in evidence against him in such a criminal proceeding.</text>

<text>16 Counsel acknowledged that the circumstances in which an in limine objection to making an affidavit of documents, in a case such as the present, might be upheld are extremely rare. He contended that the circumstances of the present case brought it within the rare exception, the existence of which was recognised by Deane J in Refrigerated Express Lines (A/asia) Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live Stock Corporation (1979) 42 FLR 204. In Refrigerated Express Deane J held that, in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding in which the imposition of a pecuniary penalty was sought, a Court should not order a respondent to give discovery or produce documents for inspection. In other forms of proceeding his Honour recognised that the general rule was that a party ought not to be excused, in limine , from giving discovery on the ground that production might tend to expose him to a penalty. His Honour held that there might exist "exceptional" cases in which "the only means of protecting the right against self incrimination ... [would be] to excuse a party in limine from discovery ..." (at 211) (Emphasis added). His Honour said that such cases would be "rare indeed." He said (at 211) that:
 
 "The cases where the making of an order for discovery or interrogatories will, in itself, involve exposing a party to self incrimination ... must, however, be rare indeed in view of the fact that the party will remain entitled to refuse to answer questions asked or produce documents discovered if the answers or production might tend to incriminate him or expose him to a penalty." 

Deane J's judgment was referred to in the joint judgment of Mason A.C.J., Wilson and Dawson JJ in Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1983] HCA 9 ; (1983) 152 CLR 328 at 336. Their Honours noted that:
 
 "There [in Refrigerated Express] his Honour drew a distinction between discovery in a mere action for a penalty and discovery in an action which was not for a penalty the result of which might be used to establish a party's liability to a penalty in other proceedings (50). In the first situation, the court should, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, refuse to make any order for discovery, production of documents or the provision of information for the reason that an intended consequence of the discovery, production of documents or provision of information is the imposition of the penalty, this being the object of the action ... But in the second situation the order will be made and the party against whom the order is made may object to the production of particular documents or to the provision of particular information on the ground that it may tend to expose him to a penalty."

17 In Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 Lindgren J reviewed a series of cases in which Deane J's decision in Refrigerated Express had been applied or followed. He summarised his conclusions as follows (at 388):
 
 "Although the course of authority since Refrigerated Express is not all one way, there has been a strong disposition in a proceeding not itself concerned with the imposition of a penalty for an offence or a civil penalty, in favour of ordering discovery, reserving the issue of self incrimination to the stage of production for inspection, and also reserving liberty to apply in relation to the degree of specificity with which a document is to be described in the individual's list of documents."

19 As already noted counsel for the respondent sought to argue that the circumstances which confronted the respondent in this case were such as to bring it within the exceptional category which Deane J referred to in Refrigerated Express.
