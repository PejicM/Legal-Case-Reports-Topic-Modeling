<tocase>AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/642.html</AustLII>
<text>A similar argument was put in two matters I heard earlier this year. I rejected the argument. I take the liberty of repeating what I said in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 at [45] - [48] : 
 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons. The applicant submits that if this proposition is correct then it follows that the Statement should set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4) either because the words 'otherwise given, a summons' in s 29B(1) have a different meaning from the same words used in s 29A(3), or because a person 'otherwise given, a summons' can fall within the terms of both s 29B(1) on the one hand and s 29B(2) and (4) on the other. 
 

 
 
 The respondents submit that the Act creates two classes, namely, a class of persons served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, and a class of persons to whom disclosure is made by a person in the first class or by a person otherwise in the second class. The obligations and rights of the first class are set out in s 29B(1) and (2) and the obligations and rights of the second class are set out in s 29B(3) and (4). On this analysis, the written statement referred to in s 29A(3) must set out the obligations and rights set out in s 29B(1) and (2), but need not set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4). 
 

 
 
 In my opinion, the construction of s 29A and s 29B of the ACC Act advanced by the respondents is the correct one. First, the respondents' construction means the words 'otherwise given, the summons' are given the same meaning in the two sections. Secondly, the construction is consistent with the distinction suggested by the structure of s 29B between a person directly involved with the Commission or an examiner in that he or she has been served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, on the one hand, and a person to whom disclosure has been made, on the other. Thirdly, the respondents' construction avoids the practical difficulties that the applicant's construction creates in terms of the obligation placed on the Chief Executive Officer of the Commission by s 29A(5). 
 

 
 
 This issue was also an issue considered by Jagot J in SS . Again, I have reached my conclusions independently of her Honour's decision. However, with respect, her Honour's reasons neatly summarise why in this case the applicant's submission must be rejected and I take the liberty of repeating them. Her Honour said (at [123]-[127]): 
 

 
 
 'Three matters are apparent from this scheme. 
 
 
 
 
 First, the scheme distinguishes between a person "served, or otherwise given" a summons or notice and a person to whom a person "served, or otherwise given" a summons or notice makes disclosure. The former is subject to ss 29B(1) and (2). The latter is subject to ss 29B(3) and/or (4). Consideration of the opening words of the provisions of ss 29B(1) to (4) supports this distinction (that is, the fact that s 29B(1) uses the words "served, or otherwise given" whereas ss 29B(3) and (4) refer to persons to whom disclosure has been made or information disclosed). This distinction indicates that the Act establishes two classes of persons for the purpose of these provisions, namely: - (i) persons who are served or otherwise given a summons or notice, and (ii) persons who are the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice, but who have not themselves been served or otherwise given a summons. This scheme is inconsistent with SS's case that the words "otherwise given" in s 29A(3) should be read as applying to a person who is the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice. 
 
 Second, treating a person to whom disclosure has been made about a summons or notice as a person 'otherwise given' the summons or notice under s 29A(3) undermines the careful scheme of obligations imposed by s 29B. The reason for this is that the words 'or otherwise given' must take the same meaning wherever they appear in the ACC Act. Hence, s 29B(1), on SS's construction, would apply to a person to whom disclosure is made (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) under s 29B(2). Yet such a person would also be subject to the obligations imposed by s 29B(3). Similarly, if that person to whom disclosure is made under s 29B(2) (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) themselves makes a disclosure under s 29B(4) (and happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) the person who is the recipient of the disclosure under s 29B(4) would also become a person subject to the obligations under s 29B(3), yet also (on SS's case) s 29B(1) as well. This makes the statutory scheme nonsensical. 
 
 Third, and as the ACC pointed out, if SS's construction is correct then the CEO's obligation in s 29A(5) is unworkable. The CEO will know the persons served or otherwise given the summons by the ACC. The CEO cannot know the persons to whom a disclosure has been made in accordance with ss 29B(2) or (4). Such a disclosure is not a matter for the CEO. It is a matter for the person served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and the recipient of the disclosure. Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 
 
 
 
 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted." 
 

 
(See also GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759 at [34] - [37] .)

It seems to me that there are arguments on both sides. In support of the applicant's submission, it can be said that the examiner must reach a state of satisfaction before issuing the summons and there is no reason to think that he or she could or should not record in writing his or her reasons at the same time. In support of the respondent's submission, it can be said that there is no obligation on the examiner to give reasons to the person summoned and that, as the record in writing referred to in s 28(1A) performs the function identified by Finn J in Barnes v Boulton [2004] FCA 1219 ; (2004) 139 FCR 356 at 363-364 [28] - [29] , there is no reason to require the record to be made before the summons is issued.

<tocase>A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/119.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant referred to the decision in Ganke v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1975) 25 FLR 98 and submitted that the examiner was bound under the ACC Act to allow a reasonable time for the production of the documents and things and that the respondent bore the onus of establishing that "forthwith" was a reasonable time. After the hearing, the applicant wrote to my chambers and referred me to the decision of Flick J in A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119. In that case, his Honour referred to a number of factors which are to be considered in determining objectively whether the period of time allowed for production in a notice under s 29 is reasonable. He said (at [61]): 
 
 "The objective surrounding circumstances would include the breadth of each particular notice and (perhaps) the need for a recipient to construe the terms of a notice; the classes of documents required to be produced; the apparent ability of the recipient to collate and thereafter produce the documents; the time of the year at which a notice is served and intervening disruption to business activities by reason of public or religious holidays; whether there has been a prior attempt to require the production of the same or similar documents; and the time in fact allowed. Some consideration could also be given to the amount of time an examiner thought appropriate; although that consideration would not be decisive."

The ACC Act gives the examiner the power to fix the time for production and this is not a case in which an Act is silent on the time within which a statutory obligation must be performed. In other words, this is a not a case in which the law must imply a requirement that the performance of a statutory obligation must take place within a reasonable time because, under the ACC Act, the examiner has the power to fix the time for performance. However, as the decision in A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 illustrates, that does not mean that the examiner's decision as to the time within which documents or things must be produced is unexaminable. I do not need to examine in detail the grounds upon which an examiner's decision as to the time for production may be successfully challenged because I am satisfied that "forthwith" was a reasonable time in the circumstances of this case, or at least that the applicant has not established that an examiner could not reasonably take the view that it was a reasonable time.

The documents or things in issue in this case were in the possession of the respondent on 19 February 2004. The applicant was present at an examination on 19 February 2004 and he was accompanied by his senior counsel and by his solicitor. The documents or things were handed to him and then he was served with the notice to produce. He then produced the documents or things in issue. He did not need time within which to locate the documents or things he was to produce and he had the opportunity "on the spot" to obtain legal advice.

I reject the fourth ground of challenge to the notice to produce.

The applicant's fifth ground of challenge to the notice to produce is that the notice was invalid because the examiner did not record in writing his reasons for issuing the notice until after the notice was issued. This ground raises the same matters as are raised in relation to the same ground with respect to the summons. For the same reasons, I reject this ground of challenge (at [55]-[66]). Conclusion

All grounds of challenge to both the summons and the notice to produce fail and the proceeding must be dismissed. The applicant must pay the respondent its costs of the proceeding.
 I certify that the preceding ninety-three (93) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.

<tocase>A1 v National Crime Authority (1996) 67 FCR 464</tocase>
<text>In an analogous context, Merkel J, in A1 v National Crime Authority (1996) 67 FCR 464 , referred to the purpose behind the requirement in s 28(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) that a notice of reference accompany a summons. Merkel J said (at 480): 
 
 "In order to ascertain how that requirement may work in practice it is useful to consider the requirement in s 28(2) that the notice of reference accompany a summons to attend a s 25 hearing. The purpose of the requirement is to enable a witness summoned to ascertain the existence, source and extent of the authority and power of the NCA to require his or her 
 

 
 
 (a) attendance at the hearing; 
 (b) answers under compulsion at the hearing to questions considered by the NCA to be relevant to the special investigation. 
 

 
 
 A failure to attend or to answer a question without "reasonable excuse" may result in severe penalties being imposed. An objection, if upheld, that the matter being enquired into by a line of questioning is not capable of being considered to be relevant would constitute a reasonable excuse: see for example Ganin v NSW Crime Commission (1993) 32 NSWLR 423 at 436 per Kirby P. 
 
 
 
 
 In my view the notice of reference must enable the NCA and the witness to ascertain, albeit in a general way, the limits of the authority of the NCA to conduct the investigation and also to determine, or at least form a view as to, whether the matters being inquired into at the hearing are relevant or capable of being considered to be relevant to the investigation."

The respondent's answer to this submission is that, for the purposes of s 28(2) of the ACC Act, the specification of the class or classes of persons to participate in the investigation is not an essential part of the determination. Section 28(2) refers to the determination that, relevantly, "the investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation". I think the respondent's submission is correct. The essential matters are the determination that the investigation is a special investigation and the matters set out in s 7C(4) (see [30] above). Those matters were in the determination which accompanied the summons and they were unaffected by the 2003 variation. The applicant was given notice of those matters and there is no evidence that he was misled by that part of the 2003 authorisation or determination which addressed the class or classes of persons who were to participate in the special investigation.

I reject the first ground of challenge to the summons.</text>

<tocase>Attorney General of New South Wales v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2005/261.html</AustLII>
<text>Secondly, the applicant emphasised the fact that it was open to the Parliament to validate the examination and that its failure to expressly do so was significant. Reference was made to Attorney General of New South Wales v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 , a case in which not only the constitution of the Tribunal was validated, but also its acts or omissions. That was, submits the applicant, to be contrasted with the fact that, in this case, the Parliament had only validated the summons.

The effect of the construction of the amendments in 2007 advanced by the applicant would be that all existing summons are validated, but no examinations which had been held are validated. The practical effect of the amendments in 2007 would, on this argument, be very narrow. As to summonses previously issued, only those where the examination had not yet been held would, in a practical sense, be affected.

The validation provision in the 2007 Amendment Act must be construed according to its terms. Even if it is appropriate to apply the approach to construction referred to by the High Court in Coco to a case where the examination has taken place and the question is whether the Parliament has "validated" not only the summons but also the examination, I think Parliament has expressed its intention in clear words in this case. Not only is the summons valid, but it "is taken always to have been as valid" as if the invalidating event had not occurred. To my mind, these words remove any suggestion that the examination which followed the issue of the summons remained unlawful. The other point to be made about the applicant's submissions is that he seeks to put more weight on the decision in Attorney-General for New South Wales v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 than it can reasonably bear. In my opinion, that case is no more than an example of how Parliament chose to validate acts in the particular circumstances of the case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/2007/297.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for the applicant relied on the decision of Smith J in Australian Crime Commission v Magistrates' Court of Victoria [2007] VSC 297 ; (2007) 173 A Crim R 572 in support of the proposition that a failure to record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons before the issue of the summons rendered the summons and any examination conducted pursuant to it invalid. In that case, the proposition advanced by the applicant in this case was conceded by the Australian Crime Commission, although Smith J said that the concession was one which was properly made (at 578 [9]).

The validity of the proposition depends on whether the temporal aspect of the first sentence in subs (1A) of s 28 also applies to the second sentence.</text>

<tocase>Burchell v Thompson [1920] 2 KB 80</tocase>
<text>The statutory context will determine whether a requirement that a copy of a document be served or provided means an actual or facsimile copy or a copy which contains the contents of the document in question. In Burchell v Thompson [1920] 2 KB 80 , Lush J said (at 87): 
 
 "It is quite possible in a case of this kind to find whether or not a copy of the original document is a true copy. The criterion, as laid down by the authorities, is to consider whether or not the copy differs from the original to such an extent that it would mislead any person of ordinary intelligence as to the effect of the original." 
 

 
Sankey J said (at 90):
 
 
 "Counsel for the respondent has endeavoured to show that some persons might be misled by the omission in the copy now in question, but he has failed to convince me that that would be at all likely. Kay J continued: 'Then is there any untruth in this copy&#8212;untruth, I mean, upon an intelligent understanding of the Bills of Sale Act? In my opinion there is not. A true copy of a thing means a copy which is true in all essential particulars; the mere fact that a copy contains a blank which is immaterial, and cannot mislead anyone as to the effect of the instrument, does not make the copy an untrue copy within the meaning of the Act.'"

<tocase>Button v Evans (1984) 3 NSWLR 191</tocase>
<text>In Button v Evans (1984) 3 NSWLR 191 , Carruthers J said (at 198-199): 
 
 "I am mindful of the fact that in Hanfstaengl v American Tobacco Co 
 [1895] 1 QB 347 at 355, Rigby LJ said of the word 'produced' that it is 'a
word that has not got an exact legal meaning, but requires an interpretation
to be put upon it in the statute in which it occurs'. 
 A later case, Ex parte Wickens [1898] 1 QB 543 , suggests that 'to produce'
a thing to a person means to show it to him personally, but does not involve
the idea that the possession of it has to be parted with. Thus the Court of
Appeal held that for the holder of a bill of sale to ask the grantor to send him
the last receipt for rent, is not to ask the grantor to 'produce' it to him within
the Bills of Sales Act 1882 (Imp): s 7(4). 
 A similar view was taken by Hardie J in Collier Garland Properties Pty 
 Ltd v O'Hair [1963] SR (NSW) 500 ; 80 WN 768; [1964] NSWR 775 , when
dealing with the phrase "the production of all books and documents in
custody of ... &#8212; that officer or agent" in the Companies Act 1961, s 171(3).
 The Court of Criminal Appeal gave consideration to the construction of
s 234(e) of the Act in R v Amenores [1980] 2 NSWLR 34 , a case to which, I
regret to say, neither party referred me during the course of argument. 
 The critical significance of that case is that in the leading judgment,
Street CJ said (at 37): 
 '... What is contemplated by s 234(e) is, in my view, no more than
the ordinary grammatical meaning of "produce".'
 Glass JA and Cross J concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.
 What then is the ordinary grammatical meaning of the transitive verb, to
produce? 
 The Oxford Dictionary defines it thus: 
 'To bring forward, bring forth or out; to bring into view, to present to
view or notice; to offer for inspection or consideration, exhibit. Often
used of bringing forward witnesses, as well as evidence, or vouchers, in a
court of law.'
 It is to be noted that the verb "produce" is used in juxtaposition to the verb
'deliver' in s 234(e). 
 To deliver a document to a Customs officer necessarily involves a transfer
of possession, but it does not necessarily involve a transfer by hand. 
 A document may be delivered by a person to a Customs officer through the
post or by courier, to use two common examples. 
 To 'produce' a document to a Customs officer on the other hand involves,
to my mind, the concept of a person presenting a document to a Customs
officer, whilst they are in each others' presence.
 The presentation may or may not involve as an additional element transfer
of the possession of the document to the Customs officer."

The statutory context in Button v Evans was s 234(e) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), which was to the effect that no person shall make in any declaration or document produced to any officer any statement which is untrue in any particular or produce or deliver to any officer any declaration or document containing any such statement.</text>

<tocase>CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCAFC 96 ; (2007) 159 FCR 282</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/96.html</AustLII>
<text>In terms of the facts, the starting point is an authorisation and determination made by the Board of the Australian Crime Commission ("the Board") at a meeting of the Board held on 13 May 2003. The authorisation and determination was called the "Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003" and the authorisation was expressed to be valid until 31 May 2004. I will refer to this as the 2003 authorisation and determination. It is common ground between the parties that the Board resolution making this authorisation and determination was passed at a Board meeting held on 13 May 2003 (see CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission [2007] FCAFC 96 ; (2007) 159 FCR 282). It appears that on 15 May 2003, the Chair of the Board signed a copy of the authorisation and determination, mistakenly asserting that it was made by resolution of the Board on 15 May 2003.

The 2003 authorisation and determination was varied by a determination made by the Board by resolution passed on 4 December 2003. The determination was called the "Australian Crime Commission Operations and Investigations (Participants) Determination 2003". I will refer to this as the 2003 variation.

Under the ACC Act, the Board may authorise in writing an investigation and may determine in writing that the investigation is a special investigation (s 7C(1)(c) and (d) and (3)). It may also determine in writing the class or classes of persons who are to participate in such an investigation (s 7C(1)(e)). In the 2003 authorisation and determination, the classes of persons to participate in the investigation were specified in Schedule 2 of the document. The purpose and effect of the 2003 variation was to make changes to the classes of persons who were to participate in the special investigation. After setting out certain preliminary matters, clause 4 of the 2003 variation stated: 
 
 " 4. Classes of persons to participate in operation 
 

 
 
 (1) For paragraph 7C(1)(e) of the Act, the classes of persons to participate in the intelligence operation, or the investigation into a federally relevant criminal activity, to which an Instrument mentioned in Schedule 1 applies are the classes mentioned in Schedule 2. 
 

 
 
 (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a provision in an Instrument mentioned in Schedule 1 that specifies the classes of persons to participate in the operation or investigation to which the Instrument relates is revoked and replaced by this Determination. 
 

 
 
 Schedule 1 Instruments amended by this Determination (section 4) 
 

 
 
 ... 
 
 Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Money Laundering and Tax Fraud) 2003 ...
 
 
 Schedule 2 Classes of persons (section 4) 
 

 The CEO. Each person who is: 
 
 (a) a member of the staff of the ACC; and
 (b) identified in writing by the CEO, or a delegate of the CEO, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to ACC operations and investigations. 
 
 Each person who is: 
 
 (a) an officer or member of the staff of any of the following agencies:
 (i) an agency of which a Board member is head (other than the CEO) in his or her capacity as a Board member;
 (ii) the Australian Taxation Office;
 (iii) AUSTRAC;
 (iv) the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs;
 (v) the New South Wales Crime Commission;
 (vi) the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission; and
 (b) identified in writing by the head of that agency, or a delegate of that head, as a person whose duties include providing services in relation to ACC operations and investigations."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/16.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant referred to CC Pty Ltd v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 16 ; (2007) 66 ATR 39 in which Mansfield J, in referring to the 2003 authorisation and determination, said (at 46 [36]): 
 
 "The determination, as it stood at the time of the passing of the resolution set out at [5] above, was not an ideal document. It did not record the date and time at which it was made and it had the distinct appearance of a draft."

Section 28(2) is an important section in the ACC Act. A person facing an examination is given only limited information about the proposed examination and the questions he or she is likely to be asked at an examination. The principal provision in this regard is s 28(3), but even that provision is subject to the two qualifications referred to in the subsection.

To understand the information which will be provided to a proposed examinee by virtue of the obligation in s 28(2), it is necessary to refer to s 7C(3) and (4) of the ACC Act. Those subsections are in the following terms: 
 
 " 7C Functions of the Board 
 

 
 
 ...
 Special investigation 
 (3) The Board may determine, in writing, that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation. Before doing so, it must consider whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective.
 Note 1: See also subsection 7G(4) for the voting rule that applies in relation to such a determination.
 Note 2: See also Division 2 for the examination powers available if there is a special investigation. 
 

 
 
 Further details 
 (4) A determination under subsection (2) or (3) must:
 (a) describe the general nature of the circumstances or allegations constituting the federally relevant criminal activity; and
 (b) state that the serious and organised crime is, or the serious and organised crimes are or include, an offence or offences against a law of the Commonwealth, a law of a Territory or a law of a State but need not specify the particular offence or offences; and
 (c) set out the purpose of the operation or investigation."</text>

<tocase>Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427</tocase>
<text>The point at issue is whether the amendments in 2007 validated not only the summons, but also the examination conducted following its issue. The applicant submits that it did not, and he relies on two particular points in support of his submission. First, he points to the common law right to silence which he submits is abrogated by provisions such as s 28 of the ACC Act. The amendments in 2007 should be strictly construed so as not to interfere with common law rights. The applicant referred to Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 (" Coco ") and, in particular, the observations of Mason CJ, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 437: 
 
 "The insistence on express authorization of an abrogation or curtailment of a fundamental right, freedom or immunity must be understood as a requirement for some manifestation or indication that the legislature has not only directed its attention to the question of the abrogation or curtailment of such basic rights, freedoms or immunities but has also determined upon abrogation or curtailment of them. The courts should not impute to the legislature an intention to interfere with fundamental rights. Such an intention must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose if they do not specifically deal with the question because, in the context in which they appear, they will often be ambiguous on the aspect of interference with fundamental rights."

The validation provision in the 2007 Amendment Act must be construed according to its terms. Even if it is appropriate to apply the approach to construction referred to by the High Court in Coco to a case where the examination has taken place and the question is whether the Parliament has "validated" not only the summons but also the examination, I think Parliament has expressed its intention in clear words in this case. Not only is the summons valid, but it "is taken always to have been as valid" as if the invalidating event had not occurred. To my mind, these words remove any suggestion that the examination which followed the issue of the summons remained unlawful. The other point to be made about the applicant's submissions is that he seeks to put more weight on the decision in Attorney-General for New South Wales v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 than it can reasonably bear. In my opinion, that case is no more than an example of how Parliament chose to validate acts in the particular circumstances of the case.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of The Australian Federal Police v Oke [2007] FCAFC 94 ; (2007) 159 FCR 441</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/94.html</AustLII>
<text>On appeal ( [2007] FCAFC 94 ; (2007) 159 FCR 441) , Branson and Lindgren JJ said (at 446 [25]): 
 
 "As mentioned above, the Commissioner ultimately conceded on appeal that the document made available to Mr Oke in purported compliance with s 3H(1) of the Crimes Act was not a copy of the warrant. It is thus unnecessary for this Court to give consideration to the extent to which a document may fail accurately to reproduce every aspect of a warrant before it loses the character of a copy of that warrant within the meaning of s 3H(1). We doubt, however, that s 3H(1) calls for a facsimile of the warrant to be made available to the occupier of the premises. Whether a document is a copy of a warrant within the meaning of s 3H(1) is a question of fact to be determined in the light of the purpose of the Crimes Act following a comparison of the two documents and an assessment of the significance of any unauthorised differences between them."

It is no doubt important that the determination which accompanies the summons be accurate, but there is no reason which I can discern from the statutory provisions why the copy needs to be an actual or facsimile copy of the document which was before the Board. The process involved in the making of an authorisation and determination is such that it is likely to involve the preparation of a fresh document after the relevant Board meeting. It seems to me that, as long as the contents of the document are accurate, the statutory obligation in s 28(2) is met. As I have said, there is nothing in this case to suggest that the contents of the 2003 authorisation and determination were not accurate.

The second limb to the submission that there was a failure to comply with s 28(2) is that the determination for the purposes of s 28(2) is not only the 2003 authorisation and determination, but also any amendment or variation thereto and, in this case, that includes the 2003 variation. It is common ground between the parties that the 2003 variation did not accompany the summons.</text>

<tocase>Evans v Button (1988) 13 NSWLR 57</tocase>
<text>In Evans v Button (1988) 13 NSWLR 57 , the Court of Appeal (Mahoney JA with whom Priestley and McHugh JJA agreed) said (at 63-64): 
 
 "The learned trial judge considered cases in which the meaning of 'produce' in particular contexts had been examined. He concluded, in my opinion correctly, that the word is one 'that has not got an exact legal meaning, but requires an interpretation to be put upon it in the statute in which it occurs'. Hanfstaengl v American Tobacco Co [1895] 1 QB 347 at 355: and he saw the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Amenores [1980] 2 NSWLR 34 as indicating that, in the present section, the word is used in its 'ordinary grammatical meaning' (at 37). In s 234(e) the legislature has used the phrase 'produced delivered or furnished to'. I do not think that the juxtaposition of these three terms should be seen as indicating an intention that each of them has a meaning separate and distinct from the other in the sense that they do not overlap. It may be, as his Honour was inclined to think, that 'produced' ordinarily means that the one person is presenting a document to the other whilst they are in each others presence. If this be so, then the purpose of 'delivered or furnished to' was, inter alia, to indicate that what was in contemplation in s 234(e) was not so limited and that the legislature was looking to a wide class of communication of the document to the relevant officer."

I agree with counsel for the respondent that the identity of the person serving the notice to produce is immaterial. It does not have to be the person specified in the notice. It seems to me that the physical presence of the person to whom documents or things are to be produced is probably necessary. Parliament chose not to prescribe a procedure requiring production simply to the Commission or any staff member of the Commission. On the other hand, Mr Hellings was present at the time of production and the applicant had previously met him. I do not think the person to whom the documents and things are to be produced need take actual physical possession of the documents or things. Documents or things may be placed on a table, or, if produced in large quantities, be in cartons which are immediately taken away by staff members of the Commission. In my opinion, the production which took place on 19 February 2004 was in accordance with the notice to produce and s 29(1) of the ACC Act.

I reject the third ground of challenge to the notice to produce.</text>

<text>The applicant referred to the decision in Ganke v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1975) 25 FLR 98 and submitted that the examiner was bound under the ACC Act to allow a reasonable time for the production of the documents and things and that the respondent bore the onus of establishing that "forthwith" was a reasonable time. After the hearing, the applicant wrote to my chambers and referred me to the decision of Flick J in A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119. In that case, his Honour referred to a number of factors which are to be considered in determining objectively whether the period of time allowed for production in a notice under s 29 is reasonable. He said (at [61]): 
 
 "The objective surrounding circumstances would include the breadth of each particular notice and (perhaps) the need for a recipient to construe the terms of a notice; the classes of documents required to be produced; the apparent ability of the recipient to collate and thereafter produce the documents; the time of the year at which a notice is served and intervening disruption to business activities by reason of public or religious holidays; whether there has been a prior attempt to require the production of the same or similar documents; and the time in fact allowed. Some consideration could also be given to the amount of time an examiner thought appropriate; although that consideration would not be decisive."</text>

<text>A summons issued under s 28 and a notice to produce issued under s 29 interfere with the rights of the citizen and, generally speaking, the courts will insist on strict compliance with conditions governing their issue. In the context of a search warrant, the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 (at 110-111): 
 
 "Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature's concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation."

<tocase>GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/759.html</AustLII>
<text>As to the former submission, a similar submission was made and rejected by me in GG v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 759. I said (at [31]): 
 
 "The first ground of challenge to the second summons is that it failed to state that the applicant was required to give evidence as a "witness". It is submitted that the second summons was therefore deficient "on its face". The applicant referred to various sections in the Act which refer to a person appearing before an examiner in response to a summons as a witness: ss 25A(6), (7) and (8), 26, 27, 28 (heading), 30 and 31. I leave to one side the fact that a section heading is not part of an Act: Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) (" Acts Interpretation Act ") s 13(3). There is nothing in the Act which requires a summons to state that the person to whom it is directed is required to give evidence as a witness. It is not clear to me whether, by making this submission, the applicant was suggesting that he could only be required to give evidence as a witness in the sense that he could not be required to give evidence of his own activities or involvement in the activities of others. If he was suggesting that, it is plainly not a proposition supported by the provisions of the Act. The provisions of the Act have the effect of removing the privilege against self-incrimination: s 30(4) and (5) (see A v Boulton [2004] FCAFC 101 ; (2004) 136 FCR 420). "

The applicant referred to the practice books dealing with the procedure relevant to summary offences heard by justices of the peace. He referred to a distinction between a general form of a summons and a summons of a witness. That matter may be accepted, but it does not assist in the proper interpretation of the ACC Act. Under the ACC Act, all examinees appear as witnesses and there is no need to refer to that fact in the summons.

Furthermore, it seems to me strongly arguable that, read as a whole, the summons in any event makes it clear enough that the applicant is summoned to give evidence as a witness. The summons bears the heading "Summons to Appear Before the Australian Crime Commission". It refers to attendance, "to give evidence". It refers to obligations in s 30(1), (2) and (3) of the ACC Act and the first two of those subsections refer to a person appearing as a witness at an examination.

A similar argument was put in two matters I heard earlier this year. I rejected the argument. I take the liberty of repeating what I said in AA v Board of the Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 642 at [45] - [48] : 
 
 "The applicant submits that a person otherwise given the summons within the terms of s 29A(3) includes a person given the summons, not only by the Commission or an examiner, but by a person served with the summons, or by a person who has been given the summons by a person who in turn has received the summons from the person served with the summons. The applicant submits that if this proposition is correct then it follows that the Statement should set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4) either because the words 'otherwise given, a summons' in s 29B(1) have a different meaning from the same words used in s 29A(3), or because a person 'otherwise given, a summons' can fall within the terms of both s 29B(1) on the one hand and s 29B(2) and (4) on the other. 
 

 
 
 The respondents submit that the Act creates two classes, namely, a class of persons served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, and a class of persons to whom disclosure is made by a person in the first class or by a person otherwise in the second class. The obligations and rights of the first class are set out in s 29B(1) and (2) and the obligations and rights of the second class are set out in s 29B(3) and (4). On this analysis, the written statement referred to in s 29A(3) must set out the obligations and rights set out in s 29B(1) and (2), but need not set out the obligations and rights in s 29B(3) and (4). 
 

 
 
 In my opinion, the construction of s 29A and s 29B of the ACC Act advanced by the respondents is the correct one. First, the respondents' construction means the words 'otherwise given, the summons' are given the same meaning in the two sections. Secondly, the construction is consistent with the distinction suggested by the structure of s 29B between a person directly involved with the Commission or an examiner in that he or she has been served with a summons or otherwise given a summons by the Commission or an examiner, on the one hand, and a person to whom disclosure has been made, on the other. Thirdly, the respondents' construction avoids the practical difficulties that the applicant's construction creates in terms of the obligation placed on the Chief Executive Officer of the Commission by s 29A(5). 
 

 
 
 This issue was also an issue considered by Jagot J in SS . Again, I have reached my conclusions independently of her Honour's decision. However, with respect, her Honour's reasons neatly summarise why in this case the applicant's submission must be rejected and I take the liberty of repeating them. Her Honour said (at [123]-[127]): 
 

 
 
 'Three matters are apparent from this scheme. 
 
 
 
 
 First, the scheme distinguishes between a person "served, or otherwise given" a summons or notice and a person to whom a person "served, or otherwise given" a summons or notice makes disclosure. The former is subject to ss 29B(1) and (2). The latter is subject to ss 29B(3) and/or (4). Consideration of the opening words of the provisions of ss 29B(1) to (4) supports this distinction (that is, the fact that s 29B(1) uses the words "served, or otherwise given" whereas ss 29B(3) and (4) refer to persons to whom disclosure has been made or information disclosed). This distinction indicates that the Act establishes two classes of persons for the purpose of these provisions, namely: - (i) persons who are served or otherwise given a summons or notice, and (ii) persons who are the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice, but who have not themselves been served or otherwise given a summons. This scheme is inconsistent with SS's case that the words "otherwise given" in s 29A(3) should be read as applying to a person who is the recipient of disclosure by a person served or otherwise given a summons or notice. 
 
 Second, treating a person to whom disclosure has been made about a summons or notice as a person 'otherwise given' the summons or notice under s 29A(3) undermines the careful scheme of obligations imposed by s 29B. The reason for this is that the words 'or otherwise given' must take the same meaning wherever they appear in the ACC Act. Hence, s 29B(1), on SS's construction, would apply to a person to whom disclosure is made (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) under s 29B(2). Yet such a person would also be subject to the obligations imposed by s 29B(3). Similarly, if that person to whom disclosure is made under s 29B(2) (and who happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) themselves makes a disclosure under s 29B(4) (and happens to be given a copy of the summons or notice as part of that disclosure) the person who is the recipient of the disclosure under s 29B(4) would also become a person subject to the obligations under s 29B(3), yet also (on SS's case) s 29B(1) as well. This makes the statutory scheme nonsensical. 
 
 Third, and as the ACC pointed out, if SS's construction is correct then the CEO's obligation in s 29A(5) is unworkable. The CEO will know the persons served or otherwise given the summons by the ACC. The CEO cannot know the persons to whom a disclosure has been made in accordance with ss 29B(2) or (4). Such a disclosure is not a matter for the CEO. It is a matter for the person served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and the recipient of the disclosure. Yet SS's construction would require the CEO to give written notice of the cancellation of the notation to persons both served or otherwise given the summons or notice by the ACC and persons (unknown to the CEO) to whom such a person made disclosure (and so on in accordance with s 29B(4)). 
 
 
 
 
 These considerations indicate that the ACC's submission must be accepted."

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<text>The issues raised by the applicant are essentially issues of statutory construction. It will be necessary for me to address the proper construction of various sections in the ACC Act. A breach of a statutory provision does not necessarily lead to invalidity. Whether a breach leads to invalidity is a question to be determined by the application of the principles laid down by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355: 
 
 "An act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power is not necessarily invalid and of no effect. Whether it is depends upon whether there can be discerned a legislative purpose to invalidate any act that fails to comply with the condition. The existence of the purpose is ascertained by reference to the language of the statute, its subject matter and objects, and the consequences for the parties of holding void every act done in breach of the condition. Unfortunately, a finding of purpose or no purpose in this context often reflects a contestable judgment. The cases show various factors that have proved decisive in various contexts, but they do no more than provide guidance in analogous circumstances. There is no decisive rule that can be applied; there is not even a ranking of relevant factors or categories to give guidance on the issue."
