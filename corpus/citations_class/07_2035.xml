22 Austin J in Sweeney (No 2) 38 ACSR 743 referred to the passage quoted in the High Court and said: 
 
 In this passage their Honours acknowledged the proposition that substituted service cannot be ordered if direct personal service is not available in the circumstances and the corollary, that if under the rules direct personal service could have been effected, although the defendant was outside the jurisdiction, then substituted service is also permissible.</text>
