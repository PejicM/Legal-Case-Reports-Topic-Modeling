<text>4 On 3 September 2007 the appellant filed his application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court. On 22 February 2008 Orchiston FM dismissed the application: SZLGH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 187. On 10 March 2008 the appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court.

5 The appellant set out his claims in his protection visa application. The RRT accurately summarised those claims, together with the claims made at the hearing, in its reasons for decision:
 
 
 " The applicant claims that he fears harm in his country because he was a member of the committee of the Chattra League, the student arm of the Awami League, when he was a student at the Omar Gani (MES) Degree College at Chittagaong in 1994. There was a split on the committee between the President, Mohi Uddin, who the applicant supported, and the Secretary, Bathen, who took bribes from the BNP. During orientation in January 1995 a student was killed in crossfire between the group led by the President and the applicant, and the Bathen group who were assisted by the BNP and its student wing, Chattra Daal. The BNP leaders and Chattra Daal lodged a murder case against Chattra League leaders especially against the Mohi Uddin group. The applicant went into hiding from 1995 and in 1999. He claims that there were charges laid against him, associated with the murder of the student, and he was wanted by the police and the [Rapid Action Battalion] . Although the [Awami League] came to power in 1996 an application for the withdrawal of the case against the applicant was refused. With the assistance of his father, the applicant went to Saudi Arabia in 1999 but he became illegal there and the authorities told him he had to leave by 30 December 2006. He came to Australia via Bangladesh in January 2007. "

6 The RRT found that the appellant's account of his student experiences was not credible. Whilst it accepted that he might have been involved in various activities such as publishing meeting dates of the Chattra League, it was not satisfied that he had a political profile of any kind or was of interest to the police or the Rapid Action Battalion ("RAB"), as he claimed.</text>
