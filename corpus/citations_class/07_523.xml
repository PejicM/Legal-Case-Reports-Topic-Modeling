<text>23 I do not accept this submission. Clearly the Probiotec parties were a party to the litigation. The expression "litigation" in this case should be read as a reference to both the infringement and validity aspects of the proceeding. It should not be confined simply to the cross claim alleging invalidity brought by the NSI parties. They denied not only infringement but also invalidity. They gave an undertaking inter partes not to carry out relevant conduct, but this was a conditional undertaking in that it was made without admissions and was only to continue until the outcome of the proceedings, and even then only in the event that they were unsuccessful in their defence. In my view, the principles in Knight are not relevant to the present circumstances. When looked at in the context of the overall litigation, the Probiotec parties intended to and did take advantage of the invalidity claim and non-infringement submissions advanced on behalf of the NSI parties. Looking at the substance of the position taken by the Probiotec parties, the non-infringement defence in relation to the patent involves by its nature, substance and effect a consideration of the patent's validity in a real sense: see Baygol Pty Ltd v Huntsman Chemical Co Australia Pty Limited t/a RMAH [2004] FCA 1248 at [27] - [28] ; and Farmitalia Carlo Erba SrL v Delta West Pty Ltd (1994) 28 IPR 336 at 339 and 341. The end result of this consideration is that, although they took no active part in argument or in the conduct of the proceeding, the Probiotec parties, in denying infringement and asserting invalidity in the event that infringement was found to have been made out, were content to allow the NSI parties to put the case and to rely on the same submissions thus advanced. When regard is had to the limited and conditional nature of the position taken by them in the undertaking and in not withdrawing the pleading as to invalidity, the approach of the Probiotec parties to the litigation was not one simply of a submitting party. The University parties therefore are entitled to their costs against the Probiotec parties, including costs on the question of invalidity and infringement.</text>

<tocase>Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 40-748</tocase>
<text>21 Although the discretion of the Court to award costs is a broad one, it must be exercised judicially and unless special circumstances are shown a successful litigant will receive costs: see Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) ATPR 40-748 per Toohey J. In the present case the question is whether there are special circumstances in relation to the Probiotec parties which displace that general rule.</text>

<tocase>Knight v F.P. Special Assets LTD [1992] HCA 28 ; 1992 174 CLR 178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/28.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The Probiotec parties refer in support of their case on costs to the decision in Knight v F.P. Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 192-193, where Mason CJ and Deane J considered the principles on which costs may be awarded against a non-party to the litigation. Their Honours referred to the position where the non-party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non-party, or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting, has an interest in the subject of the litigation. The Probiotec parties say in the present case that they were not party to the cross claim alleging invalidity of the patent claim, that they were drawn into the litigation in which they played no active role, and that they should not be the subject of adverse costs order.

23 I do not accept this submission. Clearly the Probiotec parties were a party to the litigation. The expression "litigation" in this case should be read as a reference to both the infringement and validity aspects of the proceeding. It should not be confined simply to the cross claim alleging invalidity brought by the NSI parties. They denied not only infringement but also invalidity.

<tocase>Stumm v Dixon &amp; Co (1889) 22 QBD 529</tocase>
<text>24 It is settled law that liability for payment of a costs order is ordinarily joint and several. In the present case it cannot be said that the Probiotec parties have raised a separate and distinct defence which has incurred costs that cannot be attributed to the joint conduct of the Cross Respondents in the course of this action. In Stumm v Dixon &amp; Co (1889) 22 QBD 529 at 533-534, the Court of Appeal said:
 
 'When an action is tried against two or more defendants, and any defendant separates in his defence, and the judgment is against all, the law is that each of them is liable for the damages awarded by the judgment, and each of them is liable to the plaintiff for all costs taxed on his behalf as properly incurred by him in the maintenance of his action, except as to costs caused to him by so much of the separate defence of any defendant as is ... a defence for that defendant as distinguished from other defendants.'

25 The above principle set out in Stumm was referred to by Cooper J in Thiess Watkins White Constructions Limited (in liq) v Witan Nominees (1985) Pty Ltd [1992] 2 Qd R 452 at 453.

26 The final orders made in the case by way of restraint are against all Cross Respondents in relation to the relevant claims challenged. In order to make good its case on the pleadings, it was necessary for the University parties to prove the involvement of the Probiotec parties, and I note no director of any of the Probiotec parties gave evidence about the relationship between those parties and the NSI parties until after the 20 March 2007 hearing on costs. It was also necessary to counter the allegation of invalidity and appropriate to obtain a Court order, especially having regard to the fact that the undertaking as to conduct was given without admission

27 After the hearing on costs on 20 March 2007, I gave liberty to the University parties to make further written submissions, and gave leave for the Probiotec parties to file an affidavit of Mr Stringer, the Chief Executive Officer of Probiotec (Australia) Pty Ltd. That affidavit was filed the next day, on 21 March 2007. In it, Mr Stringer gives a detailed history and states that he was the person responsible for the Probiotec parties' instructions to solicitors in respect of the current proceedings. He states that he has never given instructions to Messrs Spruson &amp; Ferguson that the Probiotec parties wished to dispute the validity of the University's patents or to assist the First to Fifth Cross Respondents in their contest of the validity of the University parties' patents. His instructions are reflected in the Letter of Undertaking from Spruson &amp; Ferguson to Freehills dated 17 September 2004. In view of the conclusion which I have reached above and the reasons for that conclusion, the contents of Mr Stringer's affidavit do not persuade me that the Probiotec parties should not be jointly and severally liable for costs in this matter. Consequently, although the University parties have not, since the hearing of 20 March 2007, made written submissions in reply to either the content of Mr Stringer's affidavit or the written submissions handed up by the Probiotec parties in court on that date, in any event, in view of my conclusion, any further submissions on behalf of the University parties would not affect the outcome of my decision on costs in this matter, as the orders which I have made are in favour of the University parties. In those circumstances, there is no necessity for any further submissions on behalf of the University parties in relation to the costs question.</text>
