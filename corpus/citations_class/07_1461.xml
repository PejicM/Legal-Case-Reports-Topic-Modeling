<text>10 I accept that Tribunals, and particularly lay Tribunals, sometimes assert that there is 'no evidence' on an issue when they mean that, although there is some evidence on the issue, they do not regard the evidence as sufficient to support a particular finding (see, for example A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [23] - [27] and Wickramasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 30 at [18] ). In every case the meaning intended to be conveyed by the Tribunal is to be determined by reference to the language used by the Tribunal understood in the context provided by the Tribunal's reasons for decision as a whole. In this case, having twice asserted that there was 'no evidence' of a particular character, the Tribunal went on to state that the appellant had not provided 'any information which would support [his] claim other than his own speculative assertion' . I conclude that the Tribunal's language, understood in the context provided by its written reasons as a whole, suggests that the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<text>23 I accept the submission of the first respondent that the above submission is inconsistent with the recent decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609. While the full import of that decision awaits clarification, the majority judgment makes clear that s 424A has a more limited operation than was previously assumed. It had been argued before the High Court that passages from the appellant's statutory declaration that the Tribunal regarded as inconsistent with his evidence at his hearing should have been the subject of a notice under s 424A of the Act because those inconsistencies were the reason, or part of the reason, for the Tribunal's decision to affirm the decision under review.

24 The majority judgment in SZBYR at 615-617 at [17]-[21] makes clear that, in the circumstances of that case, the relevant parts of the statutory declaration of the appellant in support of his claims to be entitled to a protection visa were not 'information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review' . The circumstances of SZBYR are not in this respect distinguishable from the circumstances of this case. I therefore reject the submission of the appellant that the Tribunal was obliged to comply with s 424A of the Act with respect to the information available to it concerning the content of his protection visa application. It is therefore unnecessary for this Court to determine whether the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the decision of the Tribunal was not based on an inconsistency between what the appellant said in his visa application and what he said to the Tribunal.

25 The second ground of appeal also fails.

26 The appeal will be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson.
