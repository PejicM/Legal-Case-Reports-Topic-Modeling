<text>84 It is quite clear that each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly knew that Silvestri P/L had been engaged to do the excavation work. The opening exchange on 20 October 2003 showed that Lane was aware that the existing contractor had been sacked. Lane and Primmer knew of Antonio Silvestri's proposed involvement on 20 October 2003 and each of them saw Antonio Silvestri working on the site on 21 October 2003. It was obvious that that was the result of a contract for reward with LGB. Silvestri P/L was not a charitable organisation and LGB was not a mendicant. It is not necessary to prove that Lane, Primmer and Kelly had knowledge of the precise terms of the agreement ( J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley [1965] AC 269 per Lord Pearce at 332F G; Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 at 293). The findings that I have already made involve each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly in deliberately taking steps to hinder or prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out its contract with LGB and were, in fact, intended to cause Silvestri P/L and Antonio Silvestri to be banned from the site and the contract to be terminated. There could not be a clearer case than this of interference with contractual relations. There was no attempt to pursue a defence of justification. (See, generally, Williams v Hursey [1959] HCA 51 ; (1959) 103 CLR 30; Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 26; Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Australian Federation of Air Pilots (1989) 95 ALR 211; and Odco Pty Ltd 29 FCR 104 and the authorities referred to in those cases.)</text>

<text>78 The factual findings that I have made require further findings that: 
 
 (1) Lane and Primmer, on 20 and 21 October 2003, engaged in conduct that hindered and prevented LGB from acquiring services from Silvestri P/L. Threats and verbal intimidation, as well as physical interference, can constitute hindering or preventing the supply or acquisition of services ( Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish (1980) 29 ALR 228; (1980) 43 FLR 129; J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ at 459 460). Services for these purposes include benefits to be provided under a contract for the performance of work ( Trade Practices Act , s 4). It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, in any event, the conduct could not extend beyond the blocking of the driveway by Lane. That is too limited a view of the situation. The aim of Lane and Primmer was to prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out any work on site by LGB. They succeeded. Work was stopped and the contract was terminated. The blocking of the driveway was a small step toward that objective. It was not of great significance in itself. It was significant in the wider context by demonstrating the extent to which Union officials would go to target Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L.
 (2) The conduct was engaged in for the purpose and would have, or be likely to have, the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of Silvestri P/L. It is enough if one of the purposes of engaging in the conduct was the proscribed purpose (s 45D(2)). A purpose of the conduct was plainly to inflict such injury to Silvestri P/L that it would enter into an EBA with the Union and Antonio Silvestri would become a Union member. The evidence as to what Lane, Primmer and Kelly said to LGB employees, consistently with the evidence of Antonio Silvestri, was that this was not an isolated instance of pursuit of Antonio Silvestri by the Union. That circumstance gives colour to the particular facts relied upon in this case. This is not a case, such as J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452, where damage was collateral in the sense that, although predictable, the infliction of harm or damage was not a purpose in itself. Here, the two were inextricably linked. It is significant in this, and a number of other respects, that no endeavour was made by the Union to establish the genuineness of the complaints made by its officials about the safety record and commercial morality of Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L. Loss or damage to Silvestri P/L was inevitable. "Substantial" in the context of s 45D means real or of substance rather than large ( Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 27 ALR 367; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348; Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104 at 140). Being prevented from carrying out a contract for reward is substantial in this sense. The arrangement between Antonio Silvestri and LGB was that Silvestri P/L would provide those services necessary to carry out the whole of the excavation work required on the site. Preventing that outcome would cause substantial loss or damage.</text>

<text>69 The threat of disruption was a threat of "other action" ( National Tertiary Education Industry Union v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 441 ; (2002) 117 FCR 114 at [95] ; Laing v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCA 1018 at [7] and [12] [13]). It can safely be concluded that Lane's intent in making the threats was to coerce the officers of LGB into agreeing to an EBA. The threat of disruption to work on the project by any available means was pressure that was illegitimate and unconscionable. LGB had completion of a project of some $16 million at stake. Any disruption to progress would have significant adverse financial consequences. It was clear enough that the threats also envisaged unlawful action. Threats of picketing were made. There would appear to be no lawful basis for picketing in relation to this site (cf Australian Builders' Labourers' Federated Union of Workers Western Australian Branch v J-Corp Pty Limited (1993) 42 FCR 452 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ at 456 458, although on different legislation). Unlawful conduct had taken place. The direct action by Lane and Primmer on 21 October 2003 fell into that category. The conduct in breach of s 45D and the inducement of breach of contract to be found were unlawful as well as illegitimate and unconscionable. (See generally Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2000] FCA 1468 ; (2000) 106 FCR 16 at [19] [25]; Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia [2001] FCA 456 ; (2001) 109 FCR 378 at [41] ; and National Tertiary Education Industry Union [2002] FCA 441 ; 117 FCR 114 at [97] [103].)

<text>82 It is unnecessary to explore the difficulties in the way of establishing liability in the Union for this particular offence, absent s 349 (cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (2006) 157 FCR 162).

83 I find that the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L was to carry out the whole of the excavation works required at the site for the works being conducted by LGB, subject to implied terms as to competence and progress. The fact that the remuneration was to be calculated on a per hour or per load basis does not detract from that conclusion.</text>

<text>74 There are some questions as to the proper construction of the section. It is contended for the respondents that intention to make a false and misleading representation is a necessary element of the offence. There is no direct authority in favour of that proposition. It is submitted that the reasoning in relation to other sections included in Pt 10A would be applicable (cf BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; (2000) 102 FCR 97 at [77] ; Australian Workers' Union v BHP Iron-Ore Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 3 ; (2001) 106 FCR 482 at [70] [78]). Indeed, such authority as exists is against the proposition contended for by the respondents ( Hadgkiss v Sunland Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 346 at [31] [34]; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) (2007) 160 IR 263, [2007] FCA 87 at [288] [289]; see also Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1977) 15 ALR 561; (1977) 31 FLR 129 per Bowen CJ at 134; Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 15 ALR 439; (1977) 29 FLR 212). The presence of s 4(7) also tends against it. There is also a question as to whether the section only applies where the false or misleading representation about another's obligation to join an industrial association must be made to that other person. Graham J was of the opinion that the section was not so limited ( Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) (2007) 160 IR 263; [2007] FCA 87 at [287] [291]).

<tocase>Hanley v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 1188 ; (2000) 100 FCR 530</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1188.html</AustLII>
<text>71 The next question is whether either or both of CFMEU and CFMEU NSW are liable for the conduct of Lane. The leading Full Court authority as to that question in relation to these provisions is Hanley v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 1188 ; (2000) 100 FCR 530, particularly at [48] [85]. It is not necessary to set that passage out. Lane's conduct was within the scope of his employment and his inferred actual and apparent authority as an officer of CFMEU. He was not on a frolic of his own. He was accompanied by other officials. Meetings took place at the Union office. The objective of entering into an EBA with LGB was a normal Union objective. The position in relation to CFMEU NSW is not quite so clear. Lane is a conference delegate. The later correspondence with the State President of CFMEU NSW did not repudiate his authority and it described those concerned collectively as "our Wollongong officials". The draft EBA proffered by Lane was with the CFMEU NSW. I am satisfied that he represented both organisations.

72 In my opinion, consistently with the reasons of the Full Court in Hanley [2000] FCA 1188 ; 100 FCR 530, each of CFMEU and CFMEU NSW was liable for breach of s 170NC by reason of the actions of Lane, both under the general law and pursuant to s 349 of the Act. I am also satisfied that Lane and those organisations can all be liable. The reasoning of Merkel J in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd [2001] FCA 456 ; 109 FCR 378 at [45] [47] to that effect receives support from the decision of the High Court in Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553.

80 That gives rise to the issue of the liability of the Union for these breaches. The principles applying to a union's direct liability for breach of s 45D of the Trade Practices Act are broadly similar to those discussed in Hanley [2000] FCA 1188 ; 100 FCR 530, substituting s 45DC and s 75B of the Trade Practices Act for s 349 of the Workplace Relations Act . The Union argues that s 45DC was not pleaded and that reliance upon it is not open. The applicants do not accept that it needed to be pleaded or that failure to plead it has had any adverse evidentiary or forensic consequences to the respondents. Whether s 45DC should be pleaded is a difficult question, somewhat similar to that as to whether s 51A of the Trade Practices Act should be pleaded. However, on any view, the intention to rely upon it should be made clear in some way to avoid forensic disadvantage. Whether or not the section should have been pleaded, reliance upon it by the applicants was flagged in time for any adverse consequence to have been cured by the Union. It can be taken that all of the available evidence relevant to that provision has been led. No adjournment to lead further evidence was sought. The question of costs can be left open.

81 In my opinion, s 45DC is clearly applicable and catches both CFMEU and CFMEU NSW. Lane and Primmer were officials and members of the organisations in the way previously discussed. No attempt was made to rely upon s 45DD. I note that there is a conflict between the respondents as to this point. If s 45DC is applied, Lane and Primmer are relieved of liability for damages for the breaches (s 45DC(4)).</text>

<tocase>J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley [1965] AC 269</tocase>
<text>84 It is quite clear that each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly knew that Silvestri P/L had been engaged to do the excavation work. The opening exchange on 20 October 2003 showed that Lane was aware that the existing contractor had been sacked. Lane and Primmer knew of Antonio Silvestri's proposed involvement on 20 October 2003 and each of them saw Antonio Silvestri working on the site on 21 October 2003. It was obvious that that was the result of a contract for reward with LGB. Silvestri P/L was not a charitable organisation and LGB was not a mendicant. It is not necessary to prove that Lane, Primmer and Kelly had knowledge of the precise terms of the agreement ( J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley [1965] AC 269 per Lord Pearce at 332F G; Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 at 293). The findings that I have already made involve each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly in deliberately taking steps to hinder or prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out its contract with LGB and were, in fact, intended to cause Silvestri P/L and Antonio Silvestri to be banned from the site and the contract to be terminated. There could not be a clearer case than this of interference with contractual relations. There was no attempt to pursue a defence of justification. (See, generally, Williams v Hursey [1959] HCA 51 ; (1959) 103 CLR 30; Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 26; Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v Australian Federation of Air Pilots (1989) 95 ALR 211; and Odco Pty Ltd 29 FCR 104 and the authorities referred to in those cases.)</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>39 I am satisfied that such an occasion did occur on 20 October 2003. Evidence to that effect was given by five witnesses for the applicant. Krkovski had only recently made the decision to employ Silvestri P/L in lieu of the previous excavation subcontractor. At the time he gave evidence, he was not employed by LGB and provided no affidavit in advance of the hearing. Matlioski was a contracts administrator employed by LGB based in Sydney who was visiting the site. He was no longer employed by LGB at the time he gave evidence. Matlioski was accompanied to the site that day by one Mr Branco Riklovski, a draftsman employed by LGB based in Sydney. He was not called to give evidence. Because of the absence of that witness, counsel for the respondents sought to rely upon the principle in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298. Picciau was the Assistant Project Manager employed by LGB. Srbinovski was a leading hand employed by LGB. Hill was a labourer employed by LGB who was no longer employed at the time he gave evidence and had not been employed since April 2004. There were inconsistencies in the detail of the evidence given by these witnesses and there is no contemporaneous note by any of them. There is a reasonably contemporaneous note by Matlioski but it appears to have been produced as a result of a request by the Building Industry Taskforce which was investigating Antonio Silvestri's complaints. However, each witness clearly identified and gave evidence about the same occurrence on the Monday, which was the day before the drama at the site on Tuesday 21 October 2003. Given what occurred on 21 October 2003, it is most unlikely that all of the witnesses would have been mistaken about the timing of the meeting with the Union officials about which they gave evidence.

40 The WorkCover inspector, Childs, recorded in his notebook that, when he met Krkovski and Antonio Silvestri on the morning of 21 October 2003, Krkovski stated that:
 
 "The issue started yesterday when they attended" [the Union and] "arrived on site Dave Kelly &amp; Mick Lane. Issues raised by Union 1) Why was the excavation company changed ..." 
 

Whilst Krkovski had obviously mistaken the names of Primmer and Kelly, this was significant independent and contemporaneous evidence confirming the version of the witnesses for the applicants.

41 I see no reason to doubt the honesty of any of the witnesses called by the applicants as to this incident. Three had left the employ of LGB at the time they gave evidence and clearly had nothing to gain one way or the other. The newly-appointed site manager would be expected to have a good recall of the events and appeared to do so given the difficulties occasioned by the considerable lapse of time between the events and giving evidence. He presented as a competent and intelligent person. Matlioski appeared to be an honest and competent witness whose nearly contemporaneous note supported the existence of the occasion. Hill was, as his background would suggest, of limited sophistication and was, at times, quite inarticulate. Apart from a tendency to agree, perhaps too readily, to matters that were put to him, his honesty could not be questioned. Srbinovski, although still employed by LGB, appeared to me to be an honest and reliable witness. The same could be said of Picciau. It needs to be borne in mind that LGB itself had little to gain from involvement in the proceedings. It is suggested that the proceeding assists LGB in dealing with or avoiding any claim from Silvestri P/L. In my view, that possibility would rate fairly low on the scale for a developer compared with becoming embroiled in an adversary proceeding against these respondents.</text>

It can safely be concluded that Lane's intent in making the threats was to coerce the officers of LGB into agreeing to an EBA.

Any disruption to progress would have significant adverse financial consequences. It was clear enough that the threats also envisaged unlawful action. Threats of picketing were made.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/4.html</AustLII>
<text>85 Each of the individual respondents was a full time official of either the CFMEU or CFMEU NSW. Each was engaged in what may broadly be called union business on the days in question. No one was on a frolic of his own. For relevant purposes, officers of each organisation were cooperating or acting in concert to achieve a result. The conduct of each was in the course of employment. Each organisation is liable on ordinary principles of vicarious liability in tort ( New South Wales v Lepore [2003] HCA 4 ; (2003) 212 CLR 511 per Gleeson CJ at [40] [41]).

86 I reject the submission that the interference with contract was limited to the couple of hours for which the car was parked across the vehicular access to the site on 21 October 2003. It follows from the findings previously made that the intention of the officials of the Union was to ensure that the contract was terminated and that Silvestri P/L did not return to the site. Whilst closure of the site on 21 October 2003 might be directly attributed to the Council, the closure of the site for that reason was not the effective cause of the termination of the contract with Silvestri P/L. That result was achieved by the concerted action of the Union officials.

87 Liability can be summarised as follows:
 
 (1) Lane, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 170NC.
 (2) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s 45D. 
 (3) Lane, Primmer, Kelly, CFMEU and CFMEU NSW induced a breach of the contract between LGB and Silvestri P/L.</text>

Indeed, such authority as exists is against the proposition contended for by the respondents ( Hadgkiss v Sunland Constructions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 346 at [31] [34]; Hadgkiss v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) (2007) 160 IR 263, [2007] FCA 87 at [288] [289]; see also Riley McKay Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1977) 15 ALR 561; (1977) 31 FLR 129 per Bowen CJ at 134; Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 15 ALR 439; (1977) 29 FLR 212).

<tocase>Rowe v Transport Workers' Union of Australia (1998) 90 FCR 95</tocase>
<text>75 It is not necessary for me to come to any independent view about those issues. Counsel for the respondents points out that it is only conduct which falls within the scope of s 298D s 298H (inclusive) that is proscribed. Authority is hardly necessary for that proposition in view of s 298C, but, cf Rowe v Transport Workers' Union of Australia (1998) 90 FCR 95 at 106G. The only hook to hang this proceeding upon would be s 298D(c) providing that the Part applied to:
 
 "conduct carried out with a purpose or intent relating to a person's membership or non-membership of an organisation."

76 In my opinion, that hook is not available. The statements by Kelly to Veljanov were an explanation of, or commentary upon, what was occurring. They were answers to inquiries with no intent or purpose as such relating to the membership of the Union either by Veljanov or Antonio Silvestri. That conclusion is assisted by bearing in mind that Kelly was only a casual participant in the events, having been brought along by Primmer.

77 Even if it were not for Div 2 of Pt 10A , I would have been inclined to construe s 298SC as requiring a greater connection between the false or misleading representation and the obligation than established by these facts.</text>

(See generally Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2000] FCA 1468 ; (2000) 106 FCR 16 at [19] [25]; Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia [2001] FCA 456 ; (2001) 109 FCR 378 at [41] ; and National Tertiary Education Industry Union [2002] FCA 441 ; 117 FCR 114 at [97] [103].)

72 In my opinion, consistently with the reasons of the Full Court in Hanley [2000] FCA 1188 ; 100 FCR 530, each of CFMEU and CFMEU NSW was liable for breach of s 170NC by reason of the actions of Lane, both under the general law and pursuant to s 349 of the Act. I am also satisfied that Lane and those organisations can all be liable. The reasoning of Merkel J in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd [2001] FCA 456 ; 109 FCR 378 at [45] [47] to that effect receives support from the decision of the High Court in Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553.</text>

<text>78 The factual findings that I have made require further findings that: 
 
 (1) Lane and Primmer, on 20 and 21 October 2003, engaged in conduct that hindered and prevented LGB from acquiring services from Silvestri P/L. Threats and verbal intimidation, as well as physical interference, can constitute hindering or preventing the supply or acquisition of services ( Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish (1980) 29 ALR 228; (1980) 43 FLR 129; J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452 per Lockhart and Gummow JJ at 459 460). Services for these purposes include benefits to be provided under a contract for the performance of work ( Trade Practices Act , s 4). It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, in any event, the conduct could not extend beyond the blocking of the driveway by Lane. That is too limited a view of the situation. The aim of Lane and Primmer was to prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out any work on site by LGB. They succeeded. Work was stopped and the contract was terminated. The blocking of the driveway was a small step toward that objective. It was not of great significance in itself. It was significant in the wider context by demonstrating the extent to which Union officials would go to target Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L.
 (2) The conduct was engaged in for the purpose and would have, or be likely to have, the effect of causing substantial loss or damage to the business of Silvestri P/L. It is enough if one of the purposes of engaging in the conduct was the proscribed purpose (s 45D(2)). A purpose of the conduct was plainly to inflict such injury to Silvestri P/L that it would enter into an EBA with the Union and Antonio Silvestri would become a Union member. The evidence as to what Lane, Primmer and Kelly said to LGB employees, consistently with the evidence of Antonio Silvestri, was that this was not an isolated instance of pursuit of Antonio Silvestri by the Union. That circumstance gives colour to the particular facts relied upon in this case. This is not a case, such as J-Corp Pty Limited 42 FCR 452, where damage was collateral in the sense that, although predictable, the infliction of harm or damage was not a purpose in itself. Here, the two were inextricably linked. It is significant in this, and a number of other respects, that no endeavour was made by the Union to establish the genuineness of the complaints made by its officials about the safety record and commercial morality of Antonio Silvestri and Silvestri P/L. Loss or damage to Silvestri P/L was inevitable. "Substantial" in the context of s 45D means real or of substance rather than large ( Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 27 ALR 367; (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348; Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia v Odco Pty Ltd (1991) 29 FCR 104 at 140). Being prevented from carrying out a contract for reward is substantial in this sense. The arrangement between Antonio Silvestri and LGB was that Silvestri P/L would provide those services necessary to carry out the whole of the excavation work required on the site. Preventing that outcome would cause substantial loss or damage.</text>

<text>84 It is quite clear that each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly knew that Silvestri P/L had been engaged to do the excavation work. The opening exchange on 20 October 2003 showed that Lane was aware that the existing contractor had been sacked. Lane and Primmer knew of Antonio Silvestri's proposed involvement on 20 October 2003 and each of them saw Antonio Silvestri working on the site on 21 October 2003. It was obvious that that was the result of a contract for reward with LGB. Silvestri P/L was not a charitable organisation and LGB was not a mendicant. It is not necessary to prove that Lane, Primmer and Kelly had knowledge of the precise terms of the agreement ( J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley [1965] AC 269 per Lord Pearce at 332F G; Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 at 293). The findings that I have already made involve each of Lane, Primmer and Kelly in deliberately taking steps to hinder or prevent Silvestri P/L from carrying out its contract with LGB and were, in fact, intended to cause Silvestri P/L and Antonio Silvestri to be banned from the site and the contract to be terminated. There could not be a clearer case than this of interference with contractual relations. There was no attempt to pursue a defence of justification.
