<text>25 It is well-known that the provisions of the ASIC Act regulating consumer protection resulted from the transfer of consumer protection functions in relation to financial services from the regulatory responsibility of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission: Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 (Cth), Second reading speech, Treasurer, the Hon Peter Costello MP; Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 (Cth) Explanatory Memorandum, paras 4.11-4.14; Cassidy v Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 34.

26 It is also clear that the provisions of the ASIC Act under consideration in this case replicate the equivalent provisions of the Trade Practices Act : Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 (Cth) Explanatory Memorandum, paras 4.33-4.39, Miller R, Annotated Trade Practices Act (28th ed, Thomson, 2007) at 516.

27 I am not persuaded that, by substituting the consumer protection provisions of the ASIC Act for the equivalent provisions of the Trade Practices Act in her claim, the applicant's case in paras 1-4 and 6-7 under "Details of Claim" and paras 2-3 under "Claim for Interlocutory Relief" is any different from the case which was before Spender J. Indeed, these pleadings are otherwise identical to those before Spender J, and no relevance has been ascribed either in the pleadings before me or by the applicant at the hearing to the conduct of the respondents so far as it relates specifically to financial services (to which the ASIC Act applies), as distinct from other goods or services (to which the Trade Practices Act applies). The applicant relies on the same facts, matters and circumstances in the application before me as she did in QUD525/2005 before Spender J. The applicant is attempting to re-litigate issues already decided by Spender J. In this respect the application is an abuse of process and should be dismissed pursuant to O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules .</text>

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] 2 Qd R 232</tocase>
<text>14 Section 31A Federal Court Act applies to all cases commenced on or after 1 December 2005. The nature of the provision and its overlap with O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules have been considered in a number of cases in this Court, including the recent decision of Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511. In that case, his Honour articulated a number of principles including:
 
&#8226; Section 31A of the Federal Court Act, like O 20 of the Rules, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form (at [50]).
 
&#8226; Section 31A(2) is comparable to O 20 r 2 in that they are both concerned with dismissals of proceedings (at [50]).
 
&#8226; The only difference that suggests itself between the concept of no reasonable cause of action being disclosed (O 20 r 2(1)(a)) and no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding (s 31A(2)) is that the latter makes plain that there may be taken into account the unavailability of evidence necessary to bring success at trial, whereas it is arguable that the former does not permit the unavailability of such evidence to be taken into account (at [51]).
 
&#8226; It appears that the legislature's intention in enacting s 31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92, and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130 (at [54]). (To that extent the test in s 31A appears less stringent than that in O 20 r 2: Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (2007) FCA 1371 at [55] ).
 
&#8226; The "no reasonable prospects of success" formula of s 31A reflects the approach adopted in r 24.2 of the United Kingdom's Civil Procedure Rules (at [53]). In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of that equivalent rule that the expressions "no real prospect of succeeding" and "no real prospect of successfully defending" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects (at [59]).
 
&#8226; The same test has been adopted in r 292(2) and r 293(2) of Queensland's Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (at [53]). The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held that the "no reasonable prospects of success" test requires the court to determine whether there are "real" as opposed to "fanciful" prospects of success: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235 (at [59]).</text>

<tocase>Ebert v The Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 29 ; (1960) 104 CLR 339</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1960/29.html</AustLII>
<text>31 As stated by the High Court (Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Windeyer JJ) in Ebert v The Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 29 ; (1960) 104 CLR 339 at 350:
 
 "The debtor clearly must satisfy the Court that there exists in him a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand.... In Re A Debtor [1958] 1 Ch 81 Roxburgh J said: 'But not every demand will suffice. A demand made in bad faith would not be good enough. The debtor must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand... But in my opinion a demand must be more than bona fide: the Court must be satisfied that it has a reasonable probability of success' (at 99). Perhaps the standard may be expressed by saying that the debtor must show that he has a prima facie case, even if then and there he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case before a court trying the issues that are involved in his counter-claim, set-off or cross demand."

36 Having reviewed the material before me, and read:
 
&#8226; the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 
 
&#8226; the application filed in QUD525/2005 (which is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 19 June 2007 in these proceedings) and
 
&#8226; the affidavits (including that of the applicant) filed in support of that application (which are annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 6 September 2007 in these proceedings).
 
it is clear that the facts, matters and circumstances upon which the applicant is relying in the substantive proceedings before me to have the relevant bankruptcy notice set aside - and which relate to a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage caused by conduct of the respondents - are exactly the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371. I note that Spender J dismissed the claim of the applicant for damages for economic loss and mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents. It is inappropriate to allow the application before me to continue, on the basis that there is a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents, which identical claim has already been dismissed. In this respect, I accept the submission of the respondents that there is, in fact, no setoff or counterclaim as envisaged by ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the High Court in Ebert 104 CLR at 350.</text>

<tocase>Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665</tocase>
<text>11 That an attempt to re-litigate matters already determined is an abuse of process and should not be entertained by the Court is a principle of long-standing authority. In Reichel v Magrath (1889) 14 App Cas 665 at 668-669, Lord Halsbury LC said that it would be:
 
 "...a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceeding to set up the same case again. ...it surely must be in the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to prevent the defeated litigant raising the very same question which the Court has decided in a separate action."</text>

17 The applicant has submitted that the current proceedings have been commenced under the ASIC Act instead of the Trade Practices Act in light of the comments of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 195 at [44] that the ASIC Act was the relevant legislation in respect of financial services. The applicant has further submitted that the matters are different because they are brought under different statutory schemes and that since QUD525/2005 was commenced "new breaches" had occurred (TS p 20, ll 43-44).

18 The application before me asserts that it is brought pursuant to ss 12DA and 12DJ ASIC Act . There is no reference to any particular sections of the Trade Practices Act in the application file in QUD525/2005 however, the comparable sections in the Trade Practices Act are s 52 and s 60 respectively.

19 Sections 12DA and 12DJ ASIC Act are found in Pt 2 Div 2 Subdiv D which is entitled "Consumer Protection". Sections 52 and 60 Trade Practices Act are found in Pt V Div 1 which is entitled "Unfair Practices".</text>

&#8226; my decision in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. 
 
7 The application filed in QUD525/2005, upon which judgment was given by Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Sean Whittle sworn 19 June 2006 and filed 20 June 2006 in these proceedings. The application in that matter stated that it was a "Claim for Relief under the Trade Practices Act ". The Details of Claim were described as:
 
 
 "A. Details of Claim 
 
 
 
 On the grounds stated in the accompanying affidavit or statement of claim the applicant claims. 
 
 
 
 1. An order that any loan agreements, mortgages and deeds of settlement are void
 2. An order that any or all security documents in relation to a property at 2 Crown Street Fingal Head, NSW are void 
 
 
 3. An order for damages 
 4. Any other orders that the court deems fit 
 
 
 5. An order for the return of interest paid, return of costs incurred as a result of any or all agreements between the parties 
 
 
 6. An order for costs in the proceeding."

9 The respondents seek dismissal or stay of the substantive proceedings before me on the basis that:
 
 
 1. First, in relation to paras1-4 and 6-7 under the heading "Details of Claim" and paras 2-3 in the "Claim for Interlocutory Relief": 
 

&#8226; the proceedings are identical to those previously before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , are attempt to re-litigate matters already determined by his Honour, and as such constitute an abuse of process; and
 
&#8226; in any event, the applicant's application has no reasonable prospects of success and should be dismissed pursuant to s 31A Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 
 
 2. Second, in relation to para 5 under the heading "Details of Claim" and para 1 in the "Claim for Interlocutory Relief", the applicant does not have an existing counterclaim or set off upon which to set aside the bankruptcy notice and as such this claim should be dismissed. 
 
 Relevant principles 
 Abuse of process

10 It is not in contention that the Federal Court has power to dismiss or permanently stay proceedings as an abuse of process. This is clear from O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules which provides:
 
 (1) Where in any proceeding it appears to the Court that in relation to the proceeding generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding 
 
 
 (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed;
 (b) the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious; or
 (c) the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the Court, 
 
 
 the Court may order that the proceeding be stayed or dismissed generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceeding.
 (2) The Court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).

14 Section 31A Federal Court Act applies to all cases commenced on or after 1 December 2005. The nature of the provision and its overlap with O 20 r 2 Federal Court Rules have been considered in a number of cases in this Court, including the recent decision of Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511. In that case, his Honour articulated a number of principles including:
 
&#8226; Section 31A of the Federal Court Act, like O 20 of the Rules, is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings, not just with pleadings; with substance, not just with form (at [50]).
 
&#8226; Section 31A(2) is comparable to O 20 r 2 in that they are both concerned with dismissals of proceedings (at [50]).
 
&#8226; The only difference that suggests itself between the concept of no reasonable cause of action being disclosed (O 20 r 2(1)(a)) and no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding (s 31A(2)) is that the latter makes plain that there may be taken into account the unavailability of evidence necessary to bring success at trial, whereas it is arguable that the former does not permit the unavailability of such evidence to be taken into account (at [51]).
 
&#8226; It appears that the legislature's intention in enacting s 31A was to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92, and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130 (at [54]). (To that extent the test in s 31A appears less stringent than that in O 20 r 2: Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd (2007) FCA 1371 at [55] ).
 
&#8226; The "no reasonable prospects of success" formula of s 31A reflects the approach adopted in r 24.2 of the United Kingdom's Civil Procedure Rules (at [53]). In the United Kingdom it has been held in the context of that equivalent rule that the expressions "no real prospect of succeeding" and "no real prospect of successfully defending" require attention to be given to real, as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects (at [59]).
 
&#8226; The same test has been adopted in r 292(2) and r 293(2) of Queensland's Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (at [53]). The Queensland Court of Appeal has similarly held that the "no reasonable prospects of success" test requires the court to determine whether there are "real" as opposed to "fanciful" prospects of success: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at 235 (at [59]).

28 In any event, having regard to the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , it is clear that the applicant would be no more successful on the material before me in claiming relief under the ASIC Act than she was before his Honour in claiming relief under the Trade Practices Act . In light of the principles articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries [2007] FCA 511 , it is plain that the claim has no reasonable prospects of success in terms of s 31A Federal Court Act.

34 Mr Handran submitted further that the facts, matters and circumstances which the applicant relies on in support of the counterclaim or set off, are the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 and which have been dismissed by his Honour. Mr Handran submits that this is also evident from the supporting affidavit filed by the applicant in support of both her application in this case and that in QUD525/2005.

35 It is useful to compare this affidavit of the applicant, with an affidavit sworn by her on 30 November 2005 and filed in QUD525/2005. In particular I note that:
 
&#8226; paragraphs 9-35 of the applicant's affidavit sworn 13 June 2007 and filed in these proceedings are identical to paras 4-30 of her affidavit sworn 30 November 2005 and filed in QUD525/2005 (before Spender J), and in summary, set out the applicant's version of the background to and nature of the dispute between herself and the respondents which gives rise to the relevant set off or counterclaim
 
&#8226; the only different paragraphs paras 2-8 (set out above in this judgment) and paras 36-43 of the applicant's affidavit sworn 13 June 2007 and filed in these proceedings - concern the applicant's version of the events surrounding the service of the bankruptcy notice filed by the respondents on 19 April 2007 and the fact that this application has been brought under the ASIC Act .

36 Having reviewed the material before me, and read:
 
&#8226; the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 
 
&#8226; the application filed in QUD525/2005 (which is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 19 June 2007 in these proceedings) and
 
&#8226; the affidavits (including that of the applicant) filed in support of that application (which are annexed to the affidavit of Mr Whittle sworn 6 September 2007 in these proceedings).
 
it is clear that the facts, matters and circumstances upon which the applicant is relying in the substantive proceedings before me to have the relevant bankruptcy notice set aside - and which relate to a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage caused by conduct of the respondents - are exactly the same facts, matters and circumstances which were before Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371. I note that Spender J dismissed the claim of the applicant for damages for economic loss and mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents. It is inappropriate to allow the application before me to continue, on the basis that there is a set off or counterclaim for damages for financial loss and psychological or mental damage as a result of the conduct of the respondents, which identical claim has already been dismissed. In this respect, I accept the submission of the respondents that there is, in fact, no setoff or counterclaim as envisaged by ss 40(1)(g) and 41 (7) Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the High Court in Ebert 104 CLR at 350.</text>

15 I respectfully adopt this articulation of principles of Lindgren J.

16 It is clear that the substantive application before me is almost identical to that which was before Spender J in QUD525/2005, and upon which his Honour has given judgment. This suggests immediately a possible abuse of process by the applicant in these proceedings. However, there are clearly two differences between the substantive application before Spender J upon which his Honour has given judgment, and the substantive application before me, namely:
 
 
 1. First, the substantive application in QUD525/2005 purported to be a claim for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) while the proceedings before me purport to be brought under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("ASIC Act").
 2. Second, whereas in the substantive application before me the applicant seeks as relief an order to set aside a bankruptcy notice filed by the second respondent on the grounds of a set off or counterclaim, and by way of interlocutory relief an order extending time to comply with that bankruptcy notice, no such relief was sought in the substantive application in QUD525/2005.

28 In any event, having regard to the decision of Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371 , it is clear that the applicant would be no more successful on the material before me in claiming relief under the ASIC Act than she was before his Honour in claiming relief under the Trade Practices Act . In light of the principles articulated by Lindgren J in White Industries [2007] FCA 511 , it is plain that the claim has no reasonable prospects of success in terms of s 31A Federal Court Act.</text>
