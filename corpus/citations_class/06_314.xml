<tocase>Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/8.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In hearing an application under s 1321 and/or reg 5.6.54, the Court conducts a hearing de novo : see Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 ( "Tanning Research" ) per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 339 and 341; Re North Sydney District Rugby League Football Club (2000) 34 ACSR 630 per Bryson J at 631 [3]; and Brodyn Pty Ltd v Dasein Constructions Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1230 ( "Brodyn" ) per Young CJ at [29] [33].

33 In Tanning Research , Brennan and Dawson JJ said that the principles which determine the enforceability of a liability to which a proof of debt relates are, in the main, the same as the principles which would be applied in an action brought directly against the company to enforce that liability (at 339). Their Honours went on to explain the role played by a liquidator or administrator in an appeal brought under s 1321 or reg 5.6.54 (at 341): 
 
 "In such a proceeding, a liquidator who defends his decision to reject a proof of debt is no longer acting in a quasi-judicial capacity; he is cast in the role of an adversary, defending the assets available for distribution against a liability which, according to the view he formed when acting quasi-judicially, is not legally enforceable. The liquidator may defend those assets against the creditor's claim on any ground on which the company might have defended the claim had it been sued by the creditor. If the liquidator relies on those special defences which allow him to go behind a judgment, an account stated, a covenant or an estoppel in order to ascertain the true liability of the company, he is none the less in the role of an adversary. The issue in the proceeding is whether the liability referred to in the proof of debt is a true liability of the company enforceable against it. The issue is contested between the putative creditor on the one hand and the liquidator on the other; the liquidator is a party litigant. And none the less so though the liquidator is required to act fairly in conducting the litigation."</text>

34 In a hearing de novo , the Court will act on the evidence that is placed before it. However, the onus remains with the party who challenges the decision to reject the proof of debt: see Westpac Bank Incorporation v Totterdell (1997) 25 ACSR 769 per Templeman J at 772 and 774. There is, however, no rule or practice whereby material that was placed before the liquidator or administrator is automatically material before the Court on the hearing of such an appeal: see Brodyn at [33].</text>
