<tocase>Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720; (2006) 70 IPR 146</tocase>
<text>4 Whether or not the applicant/cross-respondent was entitled to amend without leave need not be determined as the parties are agreed that the substance of the matter should be decided on the basis that the respondent/cross-claimant is to satisfy the Court that the test laid down by s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is met. There is a burgeoning number of authorities which have considered the relatively straightforward wording of s 31A. Many of the authorities are cited by Lindgren J in White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58]; see also Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 720; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [45]. Subsection (3) of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) makes it clear that the way in which the previous regime had developed should no longer govern the question. Beyond that I respectfully see little merit in this case in considering judicial paraphrases of ordinary English.</text>

<tocase>Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2007) 98 ALD 49; [2007] FCA 1422</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1422.html</AustLII>
<text>7 In my opinion, in this case I should follow the approach of Lindgren J. I also venture the view that, if s 31A had been in force at the time Lehane J gave his interlocutory decision, it more than likely would have been different. In short, I am not satisfied that this is one of those rare cases where it is appropriate to have this Court intervene by way of declaration in statutory process (see also in another context, Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (2007) 98 ALD 49; [2007] FCA 1422 at [9] and [13]).

8 There is inevitably some overlap between the issues which arise in this proceeding, absent the amendment, and the applications for trade mark by or on behalf of the respondent/cross-claimant, which are now before the Registrar. It may be that a decision on one or more of those issues might be inconsistent with the trade marks being entitled to registration, if decided favourably to the applicant/cross-respondent. However, there is by no means an identity of issues. Therefore, a decision in this case would not be necessarily decisive of one or more of those applications before the Registrar. Furthermore, the Registrar would not be bound by any declaration that is made in a technical sense, and nor would any other party who joined in those proceedings. There is no claim for an injunction against the Registrar, and it is difficult to see any proper basis on which an injunction could be granted.

9 It is possible, but by no means certain, that some time and money might be saved if the declaration was decisive as to registrability, and no other party took any interest in the applications. That result is speculative. The possibility of inconsistent findings is not removed, because granting declarations is not the equivalent of actually deciding the applications before the Registrar on the same issues. The paragraphs of the statement of claim which refer to the respondent/cross-claimant's applications have, in effect, been superseded by events, as the respondent/cross-claimant is now "on the market" with beer being sold in connection with the mark "BAREFOOT". I am not persuaded that there is any legitimate way in which the validity of the applications for trade mark will arise in the proceeding as it stands without amendment.

10 The respondent/cross-claimant submits that the cross-claim should be determined first as a matter of logic and practicality. It is a relatively straight forward factual issue that could be promptly determined. Infringement, it is said, is a more complex issue which will take time both to prepare and hear. If the respondent/cross-claimant were to succeed in the cross-claim, it would be unnecessary to proceed with the action for infringement. It is also put that the original application to the Registrar was made prior to the proceeding for infringement being commenced. It is also said that the applicant/cross-respondent has shown no great expedition in relation to its prosecution of the claim for infringement and, in particular, has sought no interlocutory relief. It was also pointed out that the separate hearing of a cross-claim is not to be equated with isolating one out of a number of issues arising on a claim.

11 This submission has more legs than many of its kind. The non-use point is quite distinct and separate, and should be capable of relatively quick resolution. However, on balance, the risk of potential problems created by separately hearing the cross-claim and the claim in relation to the same trade mark need not, and should not, be run. The carrot of an early disposition of the cross-claim rendering infringement proceedings unnecessary is more apparent than real in view of the opportunities for appeal. There is the problem occasioned by witnesses being dealt with on more than one occasion (one such witness has been identified to date). There is always the risk of issues emerging in the course of running, which should be dealt with in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, the applicant/cross-respondent has the benefit of a registered mark, and should be entitled to pursue an infringement action with expedition and no more complication than is necessary. I do not think that there has been any delay in the real sense on its part, such as would disentitle it to have its claim dealt with with appropriate expedition. I also take into account that finding successive times for hearing parts of a case is disruptive to the schedule of the Court and its resources.</text>

<text>5 I am relieved of the necessity of analysing the question that arises here ab initio, as it has been considered in the authorities to which I have been referred. In Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 150 ALR 355; (1997) 39 IPR 303 Lehane J, confronted with a similar question, refused to strike out a claim for a similar declaration. His Honour said (150 ALR at 360; 39 IPR at 309):
 
 "In the end, however, the question, on the footing that there is jurisdiction to make a declaration of the kind sought, is whether the case pleaded in support of that relief ... is so evidently hopeless that the paragraphs and prayers for relief should be struck out. It may be accepted that it will be a rare case where the court finds it appropriate to grant declaratory relief in relation to a pending trade mark application rather than allow the procedure under the Act to take its course. But it is now well established that, given jurisdiction, the provision by statute of a particular means of determining an issue in relation to which a declaration is sought does not necessarily mean that a declaration will be refused ...; the existence of the statutory procedure is a matter albeit an important matter to be taken into account in exercising the court's discretion." 
 (Emphasis added.)
 

In the event, his Honour was not satisfied at that stage that the case for declaration was hopeless and did not strike it out. However, on the final hearing, Lehane J declined to make the declaration and, in substance, was unpersuaded that the statutory process should be interfered with (see Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 816 ; (1999) 91 FCR 167 at [60] [65]).</text>

<text>6 A similar question in relation to the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) was determined by Lindgren J in RGC Mineral Sands Ltd v Wimmera Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 22. That, too, was decided prior to the introduction of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act . In a typically thorough judgment, his Honour analysed the issues that arise and the many authorities relating to it, including the decision of Lehane J to which I have just referred. Summary dismissal was granted.</text>
