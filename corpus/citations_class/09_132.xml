<tocase>Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/10.html</AustLII>
<text>If a contravention of s 52 of the TP Act is made out, the Court clearly has power in appropriate circumstances to grant the injunctive relief which is applicable, and similarly has power under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to grant the declaratory relief which is, or may be, appropriate, such jurisdiction having been expressly conferred by s 86 of the TP Act: see eg Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564. See also s 163A of the TP Act.

Plainly enough, for conduct to contravene s 52, it must convey a representation which is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or deceive. Putting aside the issue concerning the ticket machines, the council asserts that each of the ACF Notices conveyed the following representations: that the ACF Notices were issued or authorised by the Council, or that ACF was associated or affiliated with the Council; that the ACF Notices were issued for the recovery of a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; that ACF was authorised by law to recover a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; and that the claim in the ACF Notice was not in respect of an alleged contractual debt.

As the above discussion indicates, the dispute in this case turns upon whether those alleged representations were made. Neither ACF nor Park Fast have contended that the ACF Notices, if they conveyed those representations, were true. The case therefore is whether or not those representations were made.</text>

<tocase>Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/44.html</AustLII>
<text>Whether or not a representation is made, and is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, is a matter to be determined objectively by the Court. Conduct is misleading or deceptive only if it induces or is capable of inducing error; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 ( Parkdale ). The objective judgment is made in relation to the persons or class of persons who may be mislead by the relevant conduct. In Parkdale Gibbs CJ said at 199: 
 Section 52 does not expressly state what persons or class of persons should be considered as the possible victims for the purpose of deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It seems clear enough that consideration must be given to the class of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct. Although it is true, as has often been said, that ordinarily a class of consumers may include the inexperienced as well as the experienced, and the gullible as well as the astute, the section must in my opinion by [sic] regarded as contemplating the effect of the conduct on reasonable members of the class. The heavy burdens which the section creates cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will or [sic] course depend on all the circumstances. 

 
It is not necessary to prove that the conduct in question actually deceived or mislead anyone: Parkdale at 198 ; Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 ( Taco ).

Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not a remote possibility of it doing so. The person in receipt of the representation must labour under some error: Taco at 200 . In reaching such a conclusion, it is appropriate to ignore assumptions that a member of the public may make which are extreme or fanciful. It is necessary to consider the likely reaction to the representations by ordinary or reasonable members of the class of persons to whom the representation is directed: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ( Campomar ). In Parkdale it was made plain that, in assessing objectively the effect of a representation, there may be more than one reasonable response in any given circumstance. It is necessary to have regard to the personal capacity and experience of different people, acting reasonably. In Campomar at 87, the High Court said: 
 The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconceptions, or deceptions, alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of prospective purchasers.</text>

It is not necessary to prove that the conduct in question actually deceived or mislead anyone: Parkdale at 198 ; Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd [1982] FCA 136 ; (1982) 42 ALR 177 ( Taco ).

Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not a remote possibility of it doing so. The person in receipt of the representation must labour under some error: Taco at 200 . In reaching such a conclusion, it is appropriate to ignore assumptions that a member of the public may make which are extreme or fanciful. It is necessary to consider the likely reaction to the representations by ordinary or reasonable members of the class of persons to whom the representation is directed: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ( Campomar ).

 The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconceptions, or deceptions, alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of prospective purchasers.

It is plain enough, also from Campomar at [106], that it is not sufficient for the conduct to cause confusion for it to be misleading or deceptive. That is not a sufficient level of error on which to base a finding that s 52 has been breached. The question is whether a class of the potential target audience, approaching the communication reasonably, would be likely to be misled or deceived: see Taco at 181 ; Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88. There is some debate about whether the relevant class must be "significant" in number. I do not need to explore that because, as appears below, I find that the relevant class was significant in number.</text>

<text>Conduct is likely to mislead or deceive if there is a real and not a remote possibility of it doing so. The person in receipt of the representation must labour under some error: Taco at 200 . In reaching such a conclusion, it is appropriate to ignore assumptions that a member of the public may make which are extreme or fanciful.

 The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconceptions, or deceptions, alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of prospective purchasers.

The relevant section of the public must therefore be identified, and the context in which the representation was made must be considered. Whilst all persons must be considered, conduct must be tested against ordinary or reasonable members of the class and not those whose approach to the communication is fanciful or extreme: Campomar at 86-7.

The question is therefore whether there is a class of persons who are likely to have received an ACF Notice (for it was not suggested by the Council that persons who had not received an ACF Notice might be misled by such a notice) and who reasonably understood that it was issued or authorised by the Council; or that ACF was associated or affiliated with the Council; or that the notice was issued for recovery of a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; or that ACF was authorised by law to recover a fine, expiation fee or other penalty imposed by law; or finally that the claim in the ACF Notice was not in respect of a claimed contractual debt.

It is plain enough, also from Campomar at [106], that it is not sufficient for the conduct to cause confusion for it to be misleading or deceptive. That is not a sufficient level of error on which to base a finding that s 52 has been breached. The question is whether a class of the potential target audience, approaching the communication reasonably, would be likely to be misled or deceived: see Taco at 181 ; Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88. There is some debate about whether the relevant class must be "significant" in number. I do not need to explore that because, as appears below, I find that the relevant class was significant in number.

Of course, any notice by ACF based upon breach of Park Fast's parking conditions necessarily had certain content. But there is no good reason offered for why the name Adelaide City Fines was chosen, as I do not accept Mr Lester's explanation for why it was chosen. There is no monopoly in the words Adelaide City. But here, ACF or its promoters selected a name which had those words and a descriptive noun in its name which carries particular connotations, but did so to enter a field of activity in which the Council for many years had carried on the function of imposing fines by its Expiation Notices: cf Aerospatiale Societe Nationale Industrielle v Aerospatiale Helicopters Pty Ltd (1986) 11 FCR 37. The general layout and presentation of the first ACF Notice reflects closely that of the first Expiation Notice. It did not need to do so. The earlier draft document, contrary to Mr Lester's evidence, clearly was prepared by adopting the first Expiation Notice and I infer that the first ACF Notice evolved from that draft. There is no other explanation for the choice of the general layout and presentation of the first ACF Notice. Consequently, that intention supports an inference that it was effectuated so as to lead to the contravention alleged: see Campomar at [33]; Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 per Gummow J at 394; Telmak Teleproducts (Australia) Pty Ltd v Coles Myer Ltd [1989] FCA 272 ; (1989) 89 ALR 48 at 69; Apand Pty Ltd v The Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 474 at 496. Indeed, in Nylex Corp Ltd v Sabco Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-752 at 48,179 Woodward J said where there is clear evidence of an intention to deceive, a court will readily find a breach of s 52 of the TP Act.</text>

<text>It is not necessary to prove an intention to mislead or deceive. However, proof of an intention to deceive has a very strong evidentiary value: see Interlego AG v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 624 ; (1992) 39 FCR 348 at 394. Hence, the intention may be particularly inferred by the copying of a symbol or part only of a symbol used by another party: Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 55 IPR 354 at [121].

<text>Close similarities in the fields in which the two businesses operate obviously will increase the likelihood of deception if the names and symbols are similar. Subsequent subtle changes to name or get-up are unlikely to correct the deception of members of the public who have already been exposed to the initial get-up. To the contrary, the impression originally gained might be reinforced by the repetition of a closely similar message not corrected: see Duracell Australia Pty Ltd v Union Carbide Australia Ltd [1988] FCA 40 ; (1988) 10 ATPR 49 ,856 at 49,861.
