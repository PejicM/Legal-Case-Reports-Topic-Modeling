<tocase>Adultshop.com Ltd v Members of the Classification Review Board (No 2) (2000) FCA 1872</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1872.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In Adultshop.com Ltd v Members of the Classification Review Board (No 2 ) (2000) FCA 1872 at [23] - [31] , I referred briefly to the principles which apply in the exercise of the Court's discretion to make an order under s 50. I observed at [28] of my reasons in that case that the Court will respect legitimate claims for confidentiality which should not be unduly discounted in the weighing process when balancing the claim for confidentiality against the countervailing public interest in open justice.

56 In the present case it is sufficient to say that an order under s 50 is warranted for the time being because of the conditions subsequent referred to in the Deed of Settlement. As I have said previously, I do not think it is necessary for me to refer to them in my reasons for judgment, but I have considered them carefully and I do think that the weighing process in the present case points in favour of upholding the claim for confidentiality. The Deed of Settlement itself contains a confidentiality clause in cl 16.

57 In summary, I think it is sufficient to say that disclosure of the pertinent provisions of Mr McGrath's affidavit which exposed his reasoning process would seriously prejudice the liquidators in the event that Mr Selim and the Commonwealth have access to the views which Mr McGrath has expressed in his affidavit.

58 For these reasons, I propose to make the direction set out in [1] of the draft order handed to me this morning by Senior Counsel for the liquidators. I also propose to make orders in terms of [2], [3] and [4]. Order 4 reserves liberty to apply. It may be appropriate in due course for the orders under s 50 to be reviewed in light of subsequent developments in the litigation.

59 I have given this judgment in closed court pursuant to s 17(4) of the Federal Court Act . However, having now heard from Mr Nixon who has fairly conceded that the order under s 17(4) need not be continued, I will dissolve that order and direct that my reasons for judgment may be published.

60 I will leave in force the order under s 17(4) insofar as it applies to the transcript of the application that was made before me this morning.


 I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson. 


 Associate:

Dated: 7 May 2008


 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr J Sheahan QC with Mr S Nixon 
 
 Solicitor for the Applicant: Blake Dawson

<tocase>Bank of Melbourne Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd (in liq) (1997) 26 ACSR 110</tocase>
<text>31 One of the powers which the Court might exercise if Pan were being wound up by the Court is the power to apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up. This Court has previously heard and granted similar applications under both ss 479(3) and 511(1). A useful example of this is the decision of Lee J in Bank of Melbourne Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd (in liq) (1997) 26 ACSR 110. See also the decision of Hansen J in UTSA Pty Ltd (in liq) v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd (1996) 21 ACSR 251 , affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal in (1996) 21 ACSR 457 (per Hayne JA, Brooking and Phillips JJA concurring).

34 A number of decisions have confirmed that the power under s 477(2)(c) includes the power to cause the company to assign a cause of action to a third party. The leading authorities were referred to by Lee J in Bank of Melbourne at 112.

35 His Honour observed at 112 that the power of sale under s 477(2)(c) is similar to that conferred on a trustee in bankruptcy by ss 134(1)(a) and 135(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to dispose of the property of a bankrupt. His Honour observed that it entitles the liquidator to sell a bare right of action to a stranger, whether for a cash payment or on terms that the stranger will pay to the company part of the proceeds of the litigation provided only that the right of action is property. His Honour also observed at 112 that s 9 of the Corporations Law (which was then in force) defined "property" to include a chose in action.

36 Unlike the Bankruptcy Act , the Corporations Law did not vest the property of the company in liquidation in the liquidator unless an order to this effect was made by the Court. However, as Lee J pointed out, the lack of such an order will not limit the liquidator's power to assign a company's right of action provided that in such a case the company remains the assignor for the purposes of the transaction.

37 In the present case the agreement in cl 10.1 of the Deed is that the liquidators will cause Pan to assign the causes of action against the Commonwealth. The assignment is an absolute one.

38 It seems to me to follow from what was said by Lee J and from the various authorities to which his Honour referred that in the present case the proposed assignment of the causes of action is within the power of the liquidator. See also the comparatively recent decision of the High Court in Campbells Cash &amp; Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386.

39 The second question is whether the liquidators are justified in entering into the assignment. Lee J pointed out in Bank of Melbourne that in determining whether a liquidator should be directed to make an assignment, a Court should consider whether the assignment would lead to vexatious or improper litigation. His Honour observed that there is no obligation on either the Court or the liquidator to conduct an investigation of the likelihood of success of the proceeding and that it will be quite impractical to do so in an application of this nature.

52 I should mention that the application before me has been made ex parte . In Bank of Melbourne , Lee J observed at 112 to 113 that this is an appropriate course. His Honour referred to a number of leading authorities including decisions of McClelland CJ in Re BPTC Limited (1996) 14 ACLC 845 at 846 and Re G B Nathan v Co Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 674.</text>

<tocase>Citicorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 141 ALR 667</tocase>
<text>40 In Citicorp Australia Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 141 ALR 667 a Full Court dealt with a similar question arising under the Bankruptcy Act . The Court observed at 682, upon the basis of English and Australian authorities, that it is only in a clear case that the Court should come to the view that the proposed assignment is frivolous or vexatious or that the Court should not allow the assignment to occur.

41 Their Honours pointed to the observations of Lord Hoffman in the English decision in Stein v Blake (1996) 1 AC 243 at 260. The relevant passage was set out by the Full Court in Citicorp at 681. It is unnecessary to repeat what Lord Hoffman said in that passage.

42 The observations of the Full Court in Citicorp at 679 are also pertinent. Their Honours observed that there will be few cases where some decisive point exists on which the trustee or the Court can be satisfied that the claim which is proposed to be assigned has no reasonable prospects of success.

43 In the present case it is relevant to note, as I have already, that the cross-claims brought by Mr Selim against the Commonwealth and the TGA offices were the subject of a strikeout application but that the Commonwealth ultimately determined not to pursue that application after amendments were made to the pleadings.

44 In those circumstances, it seems to me to be the position that it is not clear and obvious that any proceeding in respect of the cause of action against the Commonwealth would have no reasonable prospects of success. Accordingly, there is no basis for me to conclude that the assignment of the causes of action to Mr Selim would result in vexatious or improper litigation, so the assignment cannot be said to be an inappropriate exercise of the liquidator's powers.

45 There are a number of other reasons why it seems to me that the liquidators are justified in assigning the causes of action to Mr Selim. It is not necessary to state them in any detail. I have referred to some of them above but in summary there are three principal reasons.

46 First, the proceedings would be lengthy and expensive and if they proceed to a final hearing there is always the risk of the insolvent estate of Pan being exposed to a substantial costs order in the event that the claims against Mr Selim fail.</text>

<tocase>Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 24 ACSR 79</tocase>
<text>32 The Court's power to give directions pursuant to s 511 is subject to the provisions of s 511(2). The Court must be satisfied that the determination of the question or the exercise of the power will be "just and beneficial" before it accedes to an application. In Re ACN 007 537 000 Pty Ltd (in liq); Ex parte Parker (1997) 150 ALR 92 at 97, Mansfield J referred with approval to the decision of Young J in Dean-Willcocks v Soluble Solution Hydroponics Pty Ltd (1997) 24 ACSR 79. Mansfield J quoted a passage from the judgment of Young J in which his Honour observed that the meaning of the words "just and beneficial" are that the Court has a discretion as to whether making any order under the section will be of advantage to the liquidation.</text>

51 Finally, I have referred to what Mansfield J said in Ex parte Parker about s 511(2) and the requirement that the exercise of the power be just and beneficial. The reasons, which I have referred to above, point in favour of that condition being satisfied.</text>

<tocase>Re Addstone Pty Limited (in liq) (1998) 83 FCR 583</tocase>
<text>54 Second, the liquidators also sought an order under s 50 of the Federal Court Act that access to the affidavit of Mr McGrath and to the exhibit to the affidavit be restricted to the Court and the liquidators. That course is consistent with the course adopted by Mansfield J in Re Addstone Pty Limited (in liq) (1998) 83 FCR 583 at 598. The position in Re Addstone was slightly different from that which occurs in the present case. However, there are a number of aspects of the Deed of Settlement which seem to me to point in favour of the confidentiality orders at least for the time being.</text>
