<tocase>Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 75</tocase>

<text>29 The Corporation invoked the powers conferred in the Court by s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act . As Ms Barry advanced no submissions to the Court, and it is not clear beyond argument that the Court's jurisdiction under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act was properly invoked (see Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 227 ALR 75), I prefer to make orders under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act .

30 The orders of the Court will therefore be:
 
 1. The decision, including the order as to costs, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal given on 2 June 2006 in Sydney concerning matter N2005/1246 be set aside with effect from 2 June 2006.
 2. The matter be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be heard and decided again.
 3. 
 The first respondent pay the applicant's reasonable costs of its application to the Court. 


 I certify that the preceding thirty (30) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Branson.
