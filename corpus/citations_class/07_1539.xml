<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/63.html</AustLII>
<text>84 The claim for interlocutory relief may involve consideration of both the legal and factual merits of the final relief sought. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199, Gummow and Hayne JJ (Gaudron J concurring) pointed to the necessity to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which final relief is sought which may or may not be injunctive in nature. Gleeson CJ said (at 219): 
 
 The extent to which it is necessary, or appropriate, to examine the legal merits of a plaintiff's claim for final relief, in determining whether to grant an interlocutory injunction, will depend upon the circumstances of the case. There is no inflexible rule. It may depend upon the nature of the dispute. For example, if there is little room for argument about the legal basis of a plaintiff's case, and the dispute is about the facts, a court may be persuaded easily, at an interlocutory stage, that there is sufficient evidence to show, prima facie, an entitlement to final relief. The court may then move on to discretionary considerations, including the balance of convenience.

85 Chimaera invoked three propositions in support of its claim for interlocutory relief. The first was that the directors were acting beyond power in making the rights issue because they were caretaker directors pending the outcome of the EGM requisitioned by the aggrieved shareholders. The second was that they were in breach of their duty under s 181 of the Act in making the rights issue for an improper purpose. The third was that they were acting contrary to the interests of the shareholders as a whole or in a way that was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to Chimaera and other shareholders.

86 Company directors properly appointed have the powers conferred on them by the constitution of the company and by the Act. In the exercise of those powers they are subject to constraints and obligations deriving from the constitution and the Act and from the common law. The term "caretaker" is a metaphorical adjective. It should not be allowed to obscure legal analysis of powers and duties, the proper application of which will vary according to the circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464</tocase>
<text>83 There was no dispute between the parties that the basis upon which interlocutory injunctive relief is granted requires the applicant for relief to demonstrate a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience favours the grant: Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148. The two considerations are interdependent. As was said in Bullock v The Federated Furnishing Trades Society of Australasia (No 1) (1985) 5 FCR 464 (at 472): 
 
 ... the two legs of the test need not be considered in isolation from each other. Thus an apparently strong claim may lead a court more readily to grant an injunction when the balance of convenience is fairly even. A more doubtful claim (which nevertheless raises "a serious question to be tried") may still attract interlocutory relief if there is a marked balance of convenience in favour of it.</text>

<tocase>Chief Commissioner of State Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/4.html</AustLII>
<text>91 If there is a caretaker doctrine it has not been defined. The use of an adjectival metaphor does not define a doctrine and can best be regarded as a shorthand reference to the kinds of duties that may constrain the exercise of directors' powers in particular situations including circumstances in which an extraordinary general meeting for the removal of directors has been requisitioned. In my opinion, however, it should be treated with great caution. Such usages which are taxonomical or descriptive, rather than conveying principle or doctrine, have arisen in other areas of the law: see eg the discussion of the term "discretionary trust" in Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 at [8] .

92 In Austin RP, Ford HAJ and Ramsay IM, Company Directors Principles of Law and Corporate Governance (LexisNexis, Butterworths, Australia, 2005) at 2.55, the learned authors observed that if there is a principle of caretaker directors it may be thought essential to confine its operation to situations where there is a high degree of certainty that the directors would be removed at the general meeting of the company. Otherwise any such principle could be used by disaffected minority shareholders to disrupt the management of companies.

93 I would not be prepared to rest upon the very uncertain proposition of a "doctrine" of caretaker directors, a conclusion that there is a seriously arguable question, simply because of the requisitioned EGM, the directors lacked power to embark upon the rights issue. I do not regard such an absolute proposition as being of sufficient strength to warrant the grant of injunctive relief. I regard the existence of such a "doctrine" as highly questionable. What I do not regard as questionable is that, in the circumstances in which an EGM has been requisitioned and with a reasonable prospect that the directors may be removed, a rights issue to protect their position would be made for an improper purpose and would, subject to balance of convenience considerations, attract injunctive relief. In so saying I accept that my views both of the law and of the facts are provisional at this interlocutory stage.</text>

<tocase>Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821</tocase>
<text>88 The position of directors issuing shares where their own board positions may be at stake was considered by the Privy Council in Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821. The Privy Council held that it was unconstitutional for directors to use fiduciary powers over shares in the company for the purpose of destroying an existing majority or creating a new majority. In that case the directors' primary object had been to alter the majority shareholding. They had improperly exercised their powers and the allotment was invalid. Their Lordships said (at 837):
 
 Just as it is established that directors, within their management powers, may take decisions against the wishes of the majority of shareholders, and indeed that the majority of shareholders cannot control them in the exercise of these powers while they remain in office ... so it must be unconstitutional for directors to use their fiduciary powers over the shares in the company purely for the purpose of destroying an existing majority, or creating a new majority which did not previously exist. To do so is to interfere with that element of the company's constitution which is separate from and set against their powers. 
 

Their Lordships also looked to the approach to assessing purpose and said (at 835):
 
 
 In their Lordships' opinion it is necessary to start with a consideration of the power whose exercise is in question, in this case a power to issue shares. Having ascertained, on a fair view, the nature of this power, and having defined as can best be done in the light of modern conditions the, or some, limits within which it may be exercised, it is then necessary for the court, if a particular exercise of it is challenged, to examine the substantial purpose for which it was exercised, and to reach a conclusion whether that purpose was proper or not. In doing so it will necessarily give credit to the bona fide opinion of the directors, if such is found to exist, and will respect their judgment as to matters of management; having done this, the ultimate conclusion has to be as to the side of a fairly broad line on which the case falls.</text>

<tocase>Mills v Mills [1938] HCA 4 ; (1938) 60 CLR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/4.html</AustLII>
<text>87 The directors have power to effect rights issues. That was not in dispute. The exercise of that power is constrained by their statutory and fiduciary obligations. It must be exercised in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose: 
 
 Directors of a company are fiduciary agents, and a power conferred upon them cannot be exercised in order to obtain some private advantage or for any purpose foreign to the power. 
 Mills v Mills [1938] HCA 4 ; (1938) 60 CLR 150 at 185 (Dixon J)
 

In that case the directors passed a resolution increasing the voting power of one of them but in the belief that it was in the best interests of the company. The fact that one of them derived a benefit from the resolution did not invalidate it if passed in good faith. If the purpose of the resolution had been simply to alter voting powers, then it would have been invalid.</text>

<tocase>Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc v North Flinders Mines Ltd (1988) 14 ACLR 587</tocase>
<text>89 In Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc v North Flinders Mines Ltd (1988) 14 ACLR 587, Paringa held 49.59% of the issued capital of North Flinders. It requested certain directors of North Flinders resign and be replaced by Paringa's nominees to give it control of the board. The board decided instead to make a takeover offer for Paringa and for another company financing the offers by a rights issue. Paringa requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting of North Flinders with a view to the replacement of certain members of the board. The meeting was scheduled for the last day permitted by the Code. Paringa instituted proceedings challenging the takeover offer and rights issue decisions on the basis they had been made for improper purposes. It obtained interlocutory injunctions restraining the offers and the issue pending the outcome of the proceeding. The trial judge also ordered that the extraordinary general meeting be adjourned to 57 days after discharge of the injunctions and that no other business be transacted at the meeting. The appeal was against that latter order. The question whether interlocutory injunctive relief was rightly granted in respect of the rights issues and the takeover offer did not fall for decision. However in the course of the judgment of King CJ, with which White and O'Loughlin JJ agreed, the Chief Justice said (at 591): 
 
 The controlling shareholder, or majority shareholders, are entitled to use their voting power to exercise such control of the company as is permitted to shareholders in general meetings. That power is exercised, of course, by means of a general meeting of the shareholders. A reasonable period of time is permitted after requisition to enable the meeting to be arranged, that is to say, to put in place the mechanism whereby the shareholders can exercise their power. The directors are, of course, free to exercise their powers during that interval, but the reality is that from the time a meeting is requisitioned for the purpose of replacing them, especially where it is requisitioned by a controlling shareholder, they are caretaker directors. If they choose to make use of the interval to circumvent the known wishes of the controlling shareholder who seeks to replace them, they cannot complain, in my view, if circumstances supervene to prevent them from so doing. 
 

The observation of the Chief Justice in that case, does not appear to have been underpinned by some general proposition that when an extraordinary general meeting is requisitioned the directors of the company are deprived of their power to pursue a rights issue. It may be that in such circumstances the pursuit of a rights issue will be scrutinised closely with a view to determining whether it is made for the improper purpose of simply protecting the directors' position by creating a new majority prior to the requisitioned meeting. That does not require the adjectival metaphor "caretaker" to be attached to the directors in such a circumstance. It simply requires an analysis of their powers, duties and purposes.

90 Owen J considered the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Woonda Nominees Pty Ltd v Chng (2000) 34 ACSR 558. After referring to the judgment of King CJ and the passage quoted above and also the decision of Giles J in Utilicorp NZ Inc v Power New Zealand Ltd (1997) 8 NZCLC 261,465, his Honour referred to the submission that he should find "... that there is no principle of caretaker directors in Australian law" (at 568). His Honour said (at 568): 
 
 I simply cannot do that in the light of authority such as Paringa Mining .</text>
