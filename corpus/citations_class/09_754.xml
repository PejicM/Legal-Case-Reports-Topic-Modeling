<tocase>Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158</tocase>
<text>The spoken word is the vehicle used to shape views on radio current affairs programs. The identity of the speaker, if known to the audience, can itself influence their receptivity to what he or she says; as can the speaker's oratorical style and manner of delivery. And, because of its orality, publication in a radio broadcast conveys a transient message. The listener may tune in or turn on the radio part way through a program; he or she may have missed an earlier disclosure announcement by the presenter when he or she returns to a topic that attracts an obligation to make such an announcement. If it is not made, that new listener will not be aware of what the disclosure standard, and the licence, require be conveyed contemporaneously, namely the presenter's sponsorship. Additionally, listeners may not always be attentive to what is being broadcast on radio and may miss the significance, or indeed the occurrence, of an earlier disclosure statement in the same program. That can affect the meaning which the listener understands to have been conveyed by what he or she hears the presenter saying later. These characteristics of transient communications, such as radio or television broadcasts, are also recognised in the common law principles of defamation: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 165G-166E per Hunt CJ at CL, Mason P and Handley JA agreeing.

Thus, the transience both of what is spoken on-air during a radio broadcast and of the listening audience (who may tune in or out at any time and, when tuned in, may pay closer or lesser degrees of attention) underlie the policy behind the disclosure standard's insistence on the presenter making a disclosure announcement contemporaneously each time one of his or her sponsor's name, products or service is mentioned.

The liability in s 140A(3) corresponds to, but is distinct from the criminal liability imposed by s 139(3). The conduct proscribed by each section is the same, namely a breach of a condition of a licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2, including a breach of the disclosure standard. But the objects of the two sections are not the same. One object of s 140A(3) is to create a civil, not criminal, liability so as to enable the Authority to secure compliance with important provisions in the Act more readily than through criminal proceedings. But another object of the section is to reinforce the norm of conduct for licensees in s 139(3) and to provide a means to enforce their compliance with it less drastic than the remedies existing before 2006.</text>

<text>In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 107-108 [25]-[27] Lindgren J identified 11 propositions relating to the fixing of penalties under the Trade Practices Act as flowing from the decisions in NW Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 and Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 (and these were recently applied by Jacobson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v PRK Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 715 at [20] - [24] ). These included the propositions that: the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range; the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning; the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been "tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [regulator] in proving its case"; the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/6.html</AustLII>
<text>At common law the fact that an accused person has pleaded guilty is a matter properly to be taken into account in mitigation of his or her sentence in a criminal proceeding. That is because it is usually evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender, and secondly, an acceptance of responsibility. It may also indicate a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: see Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 ; (2002) 209 CLR 339 at 343 [11] - [14] per Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ.

In Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 404-405 [73] - [76] , Stone and Buchanan JJ considered the applicability to civil penalty proceedings of the common law principle of affording a discount to a sentence imposed after a plea of guilty. Stone and Buchanan JJ concluded that the rationale for providing a discount for an early plea of guilty in a criminal case did not apply neatly to a case where a civil penalty is sought and the case proceeded on pleadings. They said, that nonetheless, it should be accepted for the same reasons as given in Cameron [2002] HCA 6 ; 209 CLR 339 , that a discount should not be available simply because a respondent has spared the community the cost of a contested trial. They held that the benefit of such a discount should be reserved for cases where it can be fairly said that an admission of liability, first had indicated an acceptance of wrongdoing and a suitable and credible expression of regret, and or secondly, had indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: Mornington Inn 168 FCR at 405 [76].</text>

<text>The Parliament provided that the civil penalty could match the criminal penalty for the same conduct of a commercial radio broadcasting licensee in breaching a condition of its licence. However, the imposition of a civil penalty under s 140A(3) would not carry the stigma attached to a criminal conviction under s 139(3). And, pursuant to s 205K of the Act the civil penalty could be imposed after a trial using the civil onus of proof (see too s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)): see too Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 477-482 [19] - [38] per Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ.</text>

<text>Radio 2UE had a privilege conferred on it under the Act to conduct a broadcasting service on the public radio spectrum. Conditions of its licence required it to ensure that the disclosure standard's requirements were met. Mr Laws had significant and valuable commercial agreements with six different sponsors in 2007. I infer that those sponsors saw considerable benefit to their businesses in having Mr Laws refer to and promote their names and brands, products or services in as favourable light as possible. It can also be safely inferred that he was seen by his sponsors to be able to use Radio 2UE's licence to influence public awareness and opinion with respect to their own products or services (see s 4(1) of the Act). Material which is designed or calculated to draw public attention to a person, product or service or to promote its use may constitute an advertisement: Director of Public Prosecutions v United Telecasters Sydney Ltd [1990] HCA 5 ; (1990) 168 CLR 594 at 598 per Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, 605 per Toohey and McHugh JJ. And, Radio 2UE was conscious that Mr Laws was not only able to use its licence in this way, but that he had done so.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/65.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 140A(3) in terms, imposes liability directly on a licensee by requiring it not to breach a condition of its licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2 to the Act. That liability is not a vicarious liability imposed on Radio 2UE for the conduct of its presenters, but a direct liability on it: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 127-128. There, Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ held that when an employee acted in the course of his or her employment he or she did so as the embodiment of the corporate employer: Hamilton 166 CLR at 127; Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153 at 170 per Lord Reid. Under s 140A(3) a corporation will incur liability for what its agent, Mr Laws, did or failed to do to comply with the disclosure standard. This is because Mr Laws was acting as the licensee when using its licence to broadcast his program. Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ said of a provision similar to s 140A(3) in Hamilton 166 CLR at 127 that it: 
 "... speaks directly to the company. It is not a case of a company being made liable for an act performed by a servant of the company on its behalf. The liability imposed is direct, not vicarious. The distinction was drawn by Viscount Haldane LC in Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd ([1915] AC 705 at p 173). Its significance is explained by Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass ([1972] AC 153 at p 170): 

 
'I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation. A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions. A corporation has none of these: it must act through living persons, though not always one or the same person. Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company . There is no question of the company being vicariously liable. He is not acting as a servant, representative, agent or delegate. He is an embodiment of the company or, one could say, he hears and speaks through the persona of the company , within his appropriate sphere, and his mind is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company. It must be a question of law whether, once the facts have been ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the company or merely as the company's servant or agent. In that case any liability of the company can only be a statutory or vicarious liability.' 
 
 
 See also the statement of Denning LJ in H L Bolton (Engineering) Co Ltd v T J Graham &amp; Sons Ltd ([1957] 1 QB 159 at p 172). 

 
 There can be no doubt, on the facts of the present case, that the respondent, in placing the advertisement and in dealing with those who replied to it, was the company. He was its managing director and his mind was the mind of the company. The company therefore was liable as a principal for the breaches of s 169 of the Code. The liability was direct, not vicarious."

<tocase>L Vogel &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Anderson (1968) 120 CLR 157</tocase>
<text>In arriving at the appropriate pecuniary penalties to be imposed for multiple contraventions, a court must first assess individual penalties for each contravention. But, before finalising the civil penalty orders the Court must look at and, if need be, adjust the resulting total effect of the individual orders it is considering, so as to produce an overall set of civil penalty orders appropriate to deal with all the contraventions. In other words, the totality principle applicable in passing criminal sentences should be adapted to apply to the overall civil penalty orders imposed on a contravenor: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, applied in a civil penalty context by Stone and Buchanan JJ in Mornington Inn (2008) 168 FCR at 408 [91]; see too at 397-398 [42]-[45]; see also per Gyles J who dissented in the result but not on the principle's applicability at 386-387 [5]-[9]. Where contraventions are separate offences in law but are substantially contemporaneous and connected, the Court must have regard to the totality principle in fixing the individual penalties: L Vogel &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Anderson (1968) 120 CLR 158 at 168 per Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ. The Court must also have regard to the relative closeness of the relationship in time and character of the offences (or contraventions): Mill 166 CLR at 64.</text>

The Court held in Lamb 164 CLR at 8-11 that the objects of an award of exemplary or punitive damages include:

&#8226; deterrence of that defendant and others; and

<tocase>Lukatela v Brich (2008) 223 FLR 1</tocase>
<text>The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne. If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26]. In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,632 [77] Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said: 
 "Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution's views on the appropriate sentence, so the court in the civil penalty case, as NW Frozen Foods explained, will take account of the regulator's position. But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence (in criminal cases), or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention (in civil penalty cases). In each case, the Court should be satisfied that it is being given accurate, reliable and complete information on critical questions."

Some aspects of the totality principle are not as easily applied to pecuniary penalties as to sentences of imprisonment using the method preferred in Mill 166 CLR at 63. The High Court suggested its preference for making sentences wholly or partially concurrent, where practicable, to reflect the appropriate overall punishment in the ultimate total result rather than lowering individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate to reflect the fact that a number of sentences were being imposed: Mill 166 CLR at 63; RH McL v The Queen [2000] HCA 46 ; (2000) 203 CLR 452 at 457 [15] - [16] , 462-464 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ, 476 [75] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see too Lukatela 223 FLR at 15-16 [75]-[77] where I discussed the principle. Concurrent pecuniary penalties cannot be imposed. So the Court must consider the overall burden imposed by the set of pecuniary penalties to assess whether, in totality, the burden is greater that is warranted by the contraventions in all of the circumstances: see too s 205F(3). In fixing the penalties below I have had regard to the totality principle as explained above.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/25.html</AustLII>
<text>Just as there is no single, correct sentence, so too there is no single, correct amount of a pecuniary penalty: cp Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25 ; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371 [27] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. In arriving at an appropriate penalty, a court must give careful attention to the maximum provided for in the Act. The maximum invites comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the Court. And the maximum can provide a yardstick when balanced with the other relevant factors: Markarian 228 CLR at 372 [30]-[31].

In this respect, ordinarily the worst possible case for a civil penalty would not be equivalent to the worst possible case for a criminal penalty under the corresponding section in the Act. That is because, first, the purpose of the Parliament providing for the civil penalty was to enable the Authority to use that power to address conduct not warranting the use of the corresponding criminal provision or the suspension or cancellation of a licence. Secondly, if a person has been convicted of an offence (e.g. under s 139(3)) constituted by substantially the same conduct as attracts a civil penalty (e.g. under s 140A(3)) then s 205L prohibits the Court making a civil penalty order against that person. And, s 205M stays civil penalty proceedings if criminal proceedings have been or are later commenced in respect of substantially the same conduct. If the person is convicted, then s 205M(2) provides for the civil penalty proceedings to be dismissed, but the stay is lifted if the person is acquitted. Conversely, s 205N authorises criminal proceedings to be commenced in the opposite situation; i.e. after a civil penalty order has been made. This preserves the option of later prosecution where, for example further evidence has come to light showing that a more severe penalty is called for than that in the civil penalty order.

There is a prosecutorial discretion to bring criminal proceedings under s 205N. Ordinarily, some enlivening factor must arise after the conclusion of the civil penalty order proceedings to warrant the initiation of the criminal proceedings so that they would not be seen as an abuse of process in light of the policy in ss 205L and 205M (e.g. if facts subsequently were discovered, casting a different light on an apparently middle range contravention for which a civil penalty was appropriate, prosecution might be warranted).

The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne. If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26].

<tocase>Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993</tocase>
<text>The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne. If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26]. In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,632 [77] Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said: 
 "Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution's views on the appropriate sentence, so the court in the civil penalty case, as NW Frozen Foods explained, will take account of the regulator's position. But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence (in criminal cases), or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention (in civil penalty cases). In each case, the Court should be satisfied that it is being given accurate, reliable and complete information on critical questions."

Their Honours had emphasised earlier in their reasons that in civil penalty proceedings the view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant but not determative consideration on the question of penalty, adding ( Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-999 at 48,626 [51(iv)]): 
 "In particular, the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise (such as the ACCC's views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market) will usually be given greater weight than its views on more "subjective" matters."

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Qantas Airways Ltd (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 107-108 [25]-[27] Lindgren J identified 11 propositions relating to the fixing of penalties under the Trade Practices Act as flowing from the decisions in NW Foods [1996] FCA 1134 ; 71 FCR 285 and Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 (and these were recently applied by Jacobson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v PRK Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 715 at [20] - [24] ). These included the propositions that: the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range; the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning; the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been "tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the [regulator] in proving its case"; the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty.

Radio 2UE argued that the joint submissions had identified the Authority's concern about Mr Laws' inappropriate attitude to the disclosure standard and the failure by Radio 2UE to comply with it, but submitted that there were substantial mitigating factors warranting a lower penalty. Radio 2UE argued that there was a public interest in bringing the litigation to a speedy resolution resulting in savings of resources for the Authority and the Court: Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,624 [41] and 48,627 [53].

However, as Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said there, arguments in favour of the negotiation of settlements have to take account of the fact that it is the Court that bears the ultimate responsibility for determining the appropriate penalty: Mobil (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,627 [53]. 2. The nature and extent of the contraventions: s 205F(3)(A)

The parties submitted that the 13 contraventions related only to Mr Laws' program and not to any other programs broadcast by Radio 2UE. They pointed to the fact that Mr Laws ceased to be an on-air presenter for Radio 2UE following his retirement on 30 November 2007. And, the parties submitted that it was relevant that Fairfax Media acquired Radio 2UE on 9 November 2007 and that only the last four contraventions occurred after that time and then on the last day of Mr Laws' career.

The Authority argued that Mr Laws' commercial agreements were recorded on the register and there were various on-air disclosures even though not all of them were compliant with the disclosure standard. It argued that Mr Laws has now retired and there was no specific deterrent necessary for his conduct. It argued that the new compliance regime adequately addressed the concerns arising from the previous regime. The Authority noted that Radio 2UE had not deliberately engaged in the conduct and had taken steps to prevent it. It accepted that Radio 2UE had acted bona fide, even if it had been ineffectual, in seeking to regulate Mr Laws.</text>

<tocase>Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/70.html</AustLII>
<text>In Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 404-405 [73] - [76] , Stone and Buchanan JJ considered the applicability to civil penalty proceedings of the common law principle of affording a discount to a sentence imposed after a plea of guilty. Stone and Buchanan JJ concluded that the rationale for providing a discount for an early plea of guilty in a criminal case did not apply neatly to a case where a civil penalty is sought and the case proceeded on pleadings. They said, that nonetheless, it should be accepted for the same reasons as given in Cameron [2002] HCA 6 ; 209 CLR 339 , that a discount should not be available simply because a respondent has spared the community the cost of a contested trial. They held that the benefit of such a discount should be reserved for cases where it can be fairly said that an admission of liability, first had indicated an acceptance of wrongdoing and a suitable and credible expression of regret, and or secondly, had indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice: Mornington Inn 168 FCR at 405 [76].

In arriving at the appropriate pecuniary penalties to be imposed for multiple contraventions, a court must first assess individual penalties for each contravention. But, before finalising the civil penalty orders the Court must look at and, if need be, adjust the resulting total effect of the individual orders it is considering, so as to produce an overall set of civil penalty orders appropriate to deal with all the contraventions. In other words, the totality principle applicable in passing criminal sentences should be adapted to apply to the overall civil penalty orders imposed on a contravenor: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, applied in a civil penalty context by Stone and Buchanan JJ in Mornington Inn (2008) 168 FCR at 408 [91]; see too at 397-398 [42]-[45]; see also per Gyles J who dissented in the result but not on the principle's applicability at 386-387 [5]-[9]. Where contraventions are separate offences in law but are substantially contemporaneous and connected, the Court must have regard to the totality principle in fixing the individual penalties: L Vogel &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Anderson (1968) 120 CLR 158 at 168 per Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ. The Court must also have regard to the relative closeness of the relationship in time and character of the offences (or contraventions): Mill 166 CLR at 64.</text>

<tocase>NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1996/1134.html</AustLII>
<text>Ordinarily, the views of the Authority will be of significant weight in assisting the Court to fix an appropriate pecuniary penalty for a contravention of s 140A(3) of the Act. The Authority's functions and role under the Act enable it to offer insight into the circumstances and impact of the contravention and the measures taken or proposed to guard against similar conduct in the future. And, one purpose of enacting the civil penalty provisions was to give the Authority access to a greater range of enforcement measures. Thus, its choice of remedy and the manner in which it ought be imposed are important factors to weigh in assessing the appropriateness of its suggested pecuniary penalties: cp NW Frozen Foods Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290G-291C, where Burchett and Kiefel JJ said: 
 "Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science, the Court, in such a case, does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed, but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount. 

 
 There is an important public policy involved. When corporations acknowledge contraventions, very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided, freeing the courts to deal with other matters, and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention. At the same time, a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote, for the future, vigorous competition in the particular market concerned. These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks. A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances. The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure, or except in a clear case."

Their Honours emphasised that the Court in such cases recognised that the selection of a penalty is not an exact science and that, as in the formation of other discretionary judgments, there will usually be a range of penalties that could be appropriate. Generally, the Court does not undertake the exercise of fixing a penalty itself to assess whether it is prepared to give effect to the parties' suggestion: NW Foods 71 FCR at 291B-G.

The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne. If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26]. In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,632 [77] Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said: 
 "Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution's views on the appropriate sentence, so the court in the civil penalty case, as NW Frozen Foods explained, will take account of the regulator's position. But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence (in criminal cases), or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention (in civil penalty cases).

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>Where ss 205L or 205M apply, the apparent intention of the Parliament, was to exclude the use of the civil penalty order if criminal proceedings result in conviction. This is because the stamp or, possibility, of the conviction has characterised the contravention (even if only temporarily so, pending the determination of the criminal proceedings) as of a more serious kind. No doubt the civil penalty imposed would be relevant to the criminal penalty following conviction, where s 205N applies. But, s 205N must be read harmoniously with the legislative policy reflected in ss 205L and 205M: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69] - [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.

The Parliament conferred power on the Court to impose and to determine the amount of any pecuniary penalty: s 205F(1), (3). For many years the Court has recognised the ability of parties to such proceedings to make a joint or agreed submission as to the civil penalties to be imposed for contraventions of legislation. Agreement as to the suggested result can be reached prior to the institution of the proceedings for civil penalties, as happened here. Ordinarily, there will be savings in time and public and private expense that can be expected from parties putting forward, in a responsible manner (as they have in these proceedings) agreed contraventions and suggested penalties.

The Court may reject the suggested penalty, and impose a different one. But, in the ordinary case the use of this sensible approach will result in a speedy determination of the proceedings. Such a consequence is obviously of considerable benefit to the community; a lengthy and expensive trial and possibly an appeal or appeals are averted and a just penalty is imposed. But there is another, very important benefit in the approach; it gives the wrongdoer a degree of certainty and a speedy imposition of the penalty. Where a result is uncertain, such as the outcome of a contested trial and the consequent penalty (whether a criminal sentence or the imposition of a civil penalty), it is all too human for a wrongdoer to procrastinate in the hope that something will work out favourably. But if a wrongdoer (such as a person who contravenes a civil penalty provision in legislation) can have relative assurance that, however severe, an agreed penalty is likely to be imposed promptly, that degree of certainty is a powerful spur to action.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/46.html</AustLII>
<text>Some aspects of the totality principle are not as easily applied to pecuniary penalties as to sentences of imprisonment using the method preferred in Mill 166 CLR at 63. The High Court suggested its preference for making sentences wholly or partially concurrent, where practicable, to reflect the appropriate overall punishment in the ultimate total result rather than lowering individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate to reflect the fact that a number of sentences were being imposed: Mill 166 CLR at 63; RH McL v The Queen [2000] HCA 46 ; (2000) 203 CLR 452 at 457 [15] - [16] , 462-464 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Callinan JJ, 476 [75] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see too Lukatela 223 FLR at 15-16 [75]-[77] where I discussed the principle. Concurrent pecuniary penalties cannot be imposed. So the Court must consider the overall burden imposed by the set of pecuniary penalties to assess whether, in totality, the burden is greater that is warranted by the contraventions in all of the circumstances: see too s 205F(3). In fixing the penalties below I have had regard to the totality principle as explained above.</text>

<text>When the Parliament adopted the well recognised device of a civil penalty as a remedy for contraventions of the Act, it did not exclude, expressly or by necessary implication, the Court from having regard to objects that are not exclusively criminal such as punishment or condemnation, in addition to deterrence: see too CEPU 162 FCR at 477-479 [19]-[28]. In Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at 146 [35] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said that classification of proceedings as protective or penal wrongly assumed that those two objects were mutually exclusive. They held that a law may bear several characters, as may proceedings that seek relief which, if granted, would protect the public and penalise the defendant.

Talk back radio and current affairs programs of the kind that Mr Laws had, occupy a significant place in commercial radio broadcasting. Presenters of such programs can exert considerable influence in shaping community views.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/21.html</AustLII>
<text>The chairman of the Authority, Chris Chapman, explained its reasons for commencing these proceedings in a media release. Radio 2UE relied on the media release, its dissemination and its terms as evidence of harm to Radio 2UE's reputation in respect of compliance and of its public denunciation in respect of the 13 contraventions (cf Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21 ; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 284-286 [52] - [59] per McHugh J, 303-304 [123] per Kirby J, 318-319 [177] per Callinan J). Mr Chapman said: 
 "ACMA has taken the step of applying for civil penalty orders against 2UE, having earlier tried to address 2UE's compliance failures through other means. These latest breaches occurred at a time when 2UE had given ACMA an enforceable undertaking to improve its performance, particularly in relation to the John Laws Morning Show.... 
 
 However, ACMA &#8212;and the Australian Broadcasting Authority before it&#8212; has emphasised in previous findings against 2UE that the obligation to comply with program standards lies with the licensee itself; in fact it goes to the heart of a licensee's obligations . 

 
 Broadcasting licences are not given out lightly by government and convey significant benefit to those to whom a licence is granted . It is a licensee's unrelenting responsibility to manage its business, including its presenters and production staff, so as to ensure satisfactory compliance with the regulatory requirements. 

 
 Company management put at real risk the retention of these licences when they allow on-air personalities or other staff to breach the rules. One consideration informing the Authority's agreement to consenting to the civil penalty order was its assessment that Fairfax genuinely accepts that proposition." (emphasis added)

The grant of the licence is a privilege to use the public resource of the radio spectrum. Abuse of the privilege, by breaching a condition of a licence, attracts liability under ss 139(3) and 140A(3). The primary purpose of s 140A(3) is to protect the public by holding licensees to the standard of conduct that their licence requires them to observe. The disclosure standard addresses a particular, and insidious, means of abusing the privilege of a commercial radio broadcasting licence. That standard recognised the significant degree of influence current affairs presenters could exert in shaping community views in Australia (see s 4(1)). The more prominent the presenter, the greater the potential he or she has to exert influence in shaping community views.</text>

<tocase>Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1545.html</AustLII>
<text>The parties urged that no difference in approach to fixing an agreed civil penalty was called for under the Act as compared to the approach taken under legislation such as under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth). They relied on what Flick J had said in Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [17] , [23]-[25]. He helpfully reviewed a large number of cases imposing civil penalties arising under a number of Acts: Pagasa [2008] FCA 1545 at [23] - [27] , concluding at [27]: 
 "Although the form of words set forth in other legislative provisions may be the same or comparable to those employed in the 1989 Act, the legislative mandate that the Court " must have regard to all relevant matters " in s 42Y(3) assumes obvious importance. It is that mandate which directs attention to those more specific matters which can only be discerned from an analysis of the 1989 Act itself. Of central importance in identifying those matters which are " relevant " &#8212; and which must therefore be taken into account &#8212; are the objects and purposes of the 1989 Act."

I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act. French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no "... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV" of the Trade Practices Act .</text>

<tocase>Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153</tocase>
<text>Section 140A(3) in terms, imposes liability directly on a licensee by requiring it not to breach a condition of its licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2 to the Act. That liability is not a vicarious liability imposed on Radio 2UE for the conduct of its presenters, but a direct liability on it: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 127-128. There, Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ held that when an employee acted in the course of his or her employment he or she did so as the embodiment of the corporate employer: Hamilton 166 CLR at 127; Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1971] UKHL 1 ; [1972] AC 153 at 170 per Lord Reid. Under s 140A(3) a corporation will incur liability for what its agent, Mr Laws, did or failed to do to comply with the disclosure standard. This is because Mr Laws was acting as the licensee when using its licence to broadcast his program. Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ said of a provision similar to s 140A(3) in Hamilton 166 CLR at 127 that it: 
 "... speaks directly to the company. It is not a case of a company being made liable for an act performed by a servant of the company on its behalf. The liability imposed is direct, not vicarious. The distinction was drawn by Viscount Haldane LC in Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd ([1915] AC 705 at p 173). Its significance is explained by Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass ([1972] AC 153 at p 170): 

 
'I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation. A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions. A corporation has none of these: it must act through living persons, though not always one or the same person. Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company . There is no question of the company being vicariously liable. He is not acting as a servant, representative, agent or delegate. He is an embodiment of the company or, one could say, he hears and speaks through the persona of the company , within his appropriate sphere, and his mind is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company. It must be a question of law whether, once the facts have been ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the company or merely as the company's servant or agent. In that case any liability of the company can only be a statutory or vicarious liability.' 
 
 
 See also the statement of Denning LJ in H L Bolton (Engineering) Co Ltd v T J Graham &amp; Sons Ltd ([1957] 1 QB 159 at p 172). 

 
 There can be no doubt, on the facts of the present case, that the respondent, in placing the advertisement and in dealing with those who replied to it, was the company. He was its managing director and his mind was the mind of the company. The company therefore was liable as a principal for the breaches of s 169 of the Code. The liability was direct, not vicarious."

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076</tocase>
<text>A primary purpose of civil penalties is deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J. Hence, in assessing the penalty to be imposed, a court will consider whether, in all the circumstances relevant to be taken into account (here under s 205F(3)), others would be deterred by the penalty and at the same time the licensee will be penalised or punished appropriately. The range of relevant matters under s 205F(3) ordinarily will include (borrowing from what French J suggested in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152-52,153):

I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act. French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no "... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV" of the Trade Practices Act .

The pecuniary penalties must put a price on the contraventions that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by Radio 2UE as the contravenor and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act and the disclosure standard: see CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J. I am of opinion that there will be a substantial deterrent effect given to licensees by the penalties I will impose. The kind of contraventions that Mr Laws caused Radio 2UE to make and its inadequate attention to the requirements of compliance must be deterred if the purpose of the disclosure standard is to be upheld.

I am satisfied that there will not be a repetition of Mr Laws' conduct only because he has retired from presenting his program on Radio 2UE. Radio 2UE has not had to deal with or test whether Mr Laws would now comply under its new measures. However, I am also satisfied that Radio 2UE has implemented genuine and satisfactory changes to its compliance systems that are likely to lead to compliance by its other presenters. And, I am also satisfied that no bad faith was involved on the part of Radio 2UE's management or Mr Mott.

Licensees must be deterred from taking lackadaisical attitudes to compliance with their statutory and licence obligations. Takeovers and changes of control in ownership occur on a fairly regular basis in the broadcasting industry. Such events are not an excuse for a licensee to fail to comply with the Act, the disclosure standard or its licence. If Mr Mott and all the senior management were too busy to protect the very basis which generated Radio 2UE's entitlement to earn income, namely its licence, then a clear message must be sent by condign penalisation of that attitude. Such an attitude is unacceptable. It demonstrates an inattention to the public trust in commercial radio broadcasting licensees.</text>

<text>I do not consider that in these proceedings it is appropriate to punish Radio 2UE by imposing a heavier penalty for the 13 contraventions because of its further breaches of the enforceable undertaking. The circumstances in which those further breaches occurred are nonetheless relevant, in accordance with s 205F(3) of the Act, for the purpose of assessing the conduct of Radio 2UE, because of their contemporaneity and interrelation with the 13 contraventions and the extent to which they went unremedied: cf Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14 ; (2003) 212 CLR 629 at 640 [32] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 11. Alternative enforcement options

The Centre identified other enforcement powers that were available to the Authority, which it had not sought to use in this matter. It relied on the context of the Parliament's decision to expand the potential remedies available to the Authority. Under s 143(1) the Authority was given power, by notice in writing, to suspend a licence for such period, not exceeding three months as was specified in the licence or to cancel the licence where a commercial radio broadcasting licensee breached a condition of the licence. In addition, s 205X provided the Authority with power to apply to the Court, where a person had given an enforceable undertaking under s 205W that the Authority considered had been breached, for orders that included any order that the Court thought appropriate (s 205X(2)(d)). The Centre argued, that accordingly, the Authority had formed the view that it would proceed with the less drastic remedy of seeking pecuniary penalties under s 205F and declaratory relief.

The Authority and Radio 2UE both argued that the availability of other sanctions was not relevant to the quantum of a civil penalty to be imposed and that Radio 2UE should not be penalised more severely because of the existence of other enforcement remedies which the Authority chose not to employ. I accept that submission. 12. Deterrence

A licensee cannot assume that nothing will go wrong. Far less could Radio 2UE have assumed this with Mr Laws who, after all, had been the cause of giving the enforceable undertaking. Radio 2UE had a duty to be vigilant to ensure compliance with its licence, the disclosure standard and the Act. Instead, Radio 2UE committed the contraventions when it permitted Mr Laws to use its licence knowing that, first, Mr Laws had a history of previous contraventions of the disclosure standard (cp Weininger 212 CLR at 640 [32] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ), secondly, he had an antipathy to the disclosure standard, thirdly, he had six very substantial commercial agreements and, fourthly, he made frequent references during his program to his sponsors, their products and services. But for Radio 2UE's mitigating conduct, I would have imposed higher penalties for these serious breaches.

Rather than making declarations, I consider that it is appropriate to state each contravention and the pecuniary penalty I have imposed for it in the formal orders. The Authority, licensees and the public will be able to relate the two together in that way.

In my opinion, these contraventions should be marked with severe and substantial pecuniary penalties. The agreed penalties are, overall, but with the three exceptions I have noted, manifestly inadequate, indeed, negligible. To be sure, the Parliament intended that ss 140A and 205F would be a means of dealing with contraventions not calling for more severe sanctions such as suspension of a licence or its cancellation. The Chairman of the Authority aptly described the obligation to comply with the disclosure standard as going to the heart of a licensee's obligations.</text>

<text>The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate, having regard to all relevant factors under s 205F(3) is, like a criminal sentence, the result of the "process of instinctive synthesis" described in Markarian 228 CLR at 373-374 [36]-[37] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 ; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612 [74] - [76] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne. If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate: cf Markarian 228 CLR at 370-371 [25]; Lukatela v Birch (2008) 223 FLR 1 at 7 [25]-[26]. In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR p41-993 at 48,632 [77] Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ said: 
 "Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution's views on the appropriate sentence, so the court in the civil penalty case, as NW Frozen Foods explained, will take account of the regulator's position. But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence (in criminal cases), or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention (in civil penalty cases). In each case, the Court should be satisfied that it is being given accurate, reliable and complete information on critical questions."</text>
