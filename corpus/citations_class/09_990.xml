<text>The Company, in fact, received all but $350,000 of $3,500,000 from the plaintiffs on the basis of the charge. Those funds would not have been advanced had the charge not been made. Those funds were received by the Company for its benefit, and therefore, for the benefit of unsecured creditors, including employees. On one view, the unsecured creditors, therefore, would have derived a windfall benefit by the inadvertence that led to the delay in giving notice of the charge. It is not unfair or inconsistent with the general policy of the law and the rights of creditors that they might be deprived of that windfall gain (see Craig Mostyn &amp; Co v Old Valley Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1083 ; 139 FCR 477 at [52] ).

In all of the circumstances, I consider that it is appropriate to accede to the plaintiffs' application. Accordingly, I propose to make orders as sought by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have joined the Company and the administrators as defendants. The plaintiffs are seeking orders in the nature of an indulgence. It is appropriate, therefore, that the plaintiffs should pay the defendants' costs. The plaintiffs do not oppose such an order. 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.
