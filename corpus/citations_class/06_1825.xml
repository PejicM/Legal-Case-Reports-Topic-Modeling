<text>72 Examples of cases in which receivers have been appointed on an interlocutory basis can be multiplied. Relevantly, a court may appoint a receiver to a trust in order to protect trust property. Such an appointment may be made where the trust is "in a state of disarray" Martyniuk v King [2000] VSC 319 at [14] (Warren J). Her Honour there observed, citing Halsburys Laws of England (4 th ed, Vol 39, par 827), that the general ground upon which a court appoints a receiver is ultimately in every case the protection or preservation of property for the benefit of persons who have an interest in it. She went on to say (at [15]):
 
 'The basis upon which a receiver may be appointed has been regarded by the courts on even as wide a basis as when the circumstances render it just and convenient.' 
 

See Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Co v Parkinson (1888) 22 QBD 173. And further (at [16]):
 
 
 'The court may appoint a receiver of trust property where that it necessary for the wellbeing of the trust."

<tocase>Vouros as Liquidator of Cadima Express Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] NSWSC 1143 ; (1933) 33 ACSR 527</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/1999/1143.html</AustLII>
<text>73 A receiver may be appointed to a body to conduct litigation on its behalf. In Vouros as Liquidator of Cadima Express Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] NSWSC 1143 ; (1993) 33 ACSR 527, Austin J dismissed an application for the appointment of a receiver to a company in liquidation to conduct litigation on its behalf. Nevertheless his Honour accepted that there was a power to make such an appointment (at [56]): 
 
 'These cases demonstrate that the court has the power to appoint a receiver in cases where it decides to permit proceedings to be commenced and prosecuted in the name of a company in liquidation by a person other than the liquidator.'

74 In my opinion the Court, in an appropriate case, may appoint a person as a receiver to an incorporated body to conduct or defend litigation on its behalf. The power may be exercised where the body is effectively paralysed by internal dissension or where for one reason or another those charged with its management are unable to be identified or, if identified, are unable to act for one reason or another.

75 The present case should not be approached as one simply concerned with the protection of private property. To the extent that CRI holds its Sirtex shares free of any trust in favour of the University, it holds them for the purposes set out in its Constitution . The assets so held cannot be applied to the private benefit of the members. The circumstances may be seen as somewhat analogous to a charitable trust. The public interest served by the association's objects is protected by its own rules relating to the disposition of its assets on a winding up. These are reinforced by like provisions in the Associations Incorporation Act .

76 It is apparent from the evidence that there is considerable room for debate about the membership of CRI, whether it has any members and, if so, who they are. I do not consider, given the apparently incomplete and somewhat conflicting nature of the CRI membership records, that it is possible to determine its membership within any reasonable certainty and within a reasonable time.

77 Whatever their legal status in the association the persons presently claiming to be the board of CRI are not appropriate persons to make decisions about its conduct in relation to the present litigation. One of them, Dr Gray, is being sued by the University in his personal capacity. The chairman is his solicitor. The other member of the board is his sister. Dr Gray's letter to Sirtex shareholders about the alignment of the interests of CRI with those of himself and Sirtex is suggestive of an inability to distinguish between his interests and that of CRI.</text>
