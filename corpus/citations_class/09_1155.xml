<tocase>Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 951</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2009/27.html</AustLII>
<text>Recently, the High Court has had occasion to reflect upon the amendment of pleadings and case management principles in the context of litigation: see Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27 ; (2009) 83 ALJR 951 (Aon Risk Services). One factor which, in my opinion, emerges from the judgments delivered in that case is that decisions in relation to whether or not to permit amendments ought to be informed not merely by the interests of the parties but also by a wider public interest. For example, at para 25, French CJ observed: 
 
 Recognition of the public interest in the administration of civil justice procedures in Australia and the United Kingdom pre-dates the Woolf Report and its attendant reforms. In Dawson v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation , King CJ acknowledge the responsibility of judges to ensure, "so far as possible and subject to overriding considerations of justice", that the limited resources which the State commits to the administration of justice are not wasted by the failure of parties to adhere to trial dates of which they have had proper notice. In a late amendment case considered by the House of Lords in 1987, there was a marked departure from the approach of Bowen LJ in Cropper v Smith . Lord Griffiths required that judges considering amendments weigh in the balance: 
 

 
 
 
 the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be conducted efficiently.

French CJ continued: 
 
 The same indulgence could not be shown towards the negligent conduct of litigation as might have been possible in a "more leisured age". That approach was followed by Sheppard J in a revenue case heard in the Federal Court. And in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in GSA Industries , Samuels JA said that: 
 

 
 
 
 the emollient effect of an order for costs as a panacea may now be consigned to the Aladdin's cave which Lord Reid rejected as one of the fairy tales in which we no longer believe.

Accepting, as I do, that an appeal statement is not a pleading document, its purpose nonetheless is to serve the ends of justice by ensuring procedural fairness. At this late stage of a proceeding, and having regard to sentiments evident in Aon Risk Services , the purpose of Tax List directions and of case management generally, it seems to me that it would be procedurally unfair to permit the Commissioner to rely upon the appeal statement in its amended form. Especially that is so in light of the deliberate statement made in open court six months ago by reference to which the appellant taxpayer has cast its case.

There is a further observation which I feel constrained to make, and that is in relation to the Commissioner's utilisation of, or attempted utilisation of, s 15 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) in relation to the conduct of serious revenue law litigation in this Court.

Like any litigant, the Commissioner is entitled to appear in person. Section 15 also makes it plain that the intention is that the Commissioner may in writing authorise one of his officers to appear. In so doing, though, that officer is not clothed with all that a court is entitled to expect from a person on the roll of legal practitioners.</text>

<tocase>BAE Systems Australia (New South Wales) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2008) 69 ATR 567</tocase>
<text>It has been observed in prior authority that the purpose of the appeal statement is one of informing a taxpayer of the Commissioner's view, at that time, of the bases of the Commissioner's rejection of an assessment objection. In this regard, it has been said that its purpose is a practical one: see BAE Systems Australia (New South Wales) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2008) 69 ATR 567. It has also been observed that the appeal statement is not a pleading: McDonald's Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2008) 69 ATR 898. So much may be accepted. It is nonetheless a feature of an appeal statement that it forms part of an obligation which the Court has to afford the parties to a proceeding procedural fairness. One of the ways in which that particular obligation is fulfilled is by ensuring that a party to a proceeding knows the case it has to meet.</text>

<tocase>Bailey v Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/11.html</AustLII>
<text>In Bailey v Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214 , commencing at 216, Barwick CJ observed that the assessment of income tax is the process of applying the Act to a state of fact. His Honour continued that: 
 
 [T]he process of assessment requires the application of the Act to the facts as known to and accepted by the Commissioner. He must of necessity, as part of that process, adopt a view of the relevant facts.

And then, a little later: 
 
 Quite clearly, the taxpayer is entitled to know the basis on which the assessment has been made. An adjustment sheet supplied with the notice of assessment can be expected to state and should state that basis. The taxpayer should be told the taxable facts.

In a separate judgment in that case, Mason J stated, at pages 220 to 221: 
 
 There is therefore no foundation for the notion that the Commissioner stands apart from ordinary litigants in some special position in relation to the giving of particulars ... To conclude otherwise would result not merely in injustice to the taxpayer, who will remain in doubt as to the Commissioner's case until it is presented at the hearing, but also in unnecessary preparations and in a hearing of unnecessary length as the taxpayer endeavours to deal with matters on which, as it may subsequently transpire, the Commissioner is placing no reliance whatsoever ... 
 

 
 
 Although, speaking generally, the taxpayer knows or should know the facts relevant to a correct assessment of his income, there are other facts which will be relevant on the hearing of an appeal. Under s 190 [the then equivalent of s 14ZZO] the taxpayer bears the onus of showing that the Commissioner's assessment is excessive. Consequently the relevant facts in the appeal include the view of the facts on which the Commissioner has based his assessment, the manner in which he has arrived at his assessment. These facts are not within the knowledge of the taxpayer; they are within the knowledge of the Commissioner. 
 

 
 
 Indeed, there is very much to be said for the view that fairness to the taxpayer demands that the Commissioner should be compelled to give particulars of his assessment when it issues so that the taxpayer is adequately informed as to the manner in which the assessment has been arrived at and may then determine whether he will object to the assessment and subsequently appeal.

It is not difficult to see that sentiments in relation to fairness to a taxpayer informed the making of O 52B and, in particular, r 5, in its provision for an appeal statement; nor is it difficult to see that those same sentiments of fairness attend the provision found in the Tax List Directions at para 5.4 that, at the scheduling conference, the parties will be expected to address the following: 
 
 (a) Narrowing of issues. In clear outline, the issues and facts that appear to be in dispute.

None of this is to suggest that in any way an appeal statement rule, or for that matter, a practice direction can be a substitute for the statutory obligation which falls on an appellant to prove an assessment to be excessive. That is not to say, though, that when a taxpayer, by filing an appeal, engages judicial power, the respondent Commissioner is in some special privileged position in relation to the affording of procedural fairness to a taxpayer. The statement that was given in response to what was a very deliberate question at the scheduling conference was a statement made on instructions. It is true to say there had been some earlier informal correspondence between counsel acting respectively for the Commissioner and the taxpayer. Whatever might be the tenor of that correspondence, it was not known to the Court, nor for that matter, did it have the formality of a statement made in open court by counsel on behalf of, in this case, the Commissioner.

The affidavits which have come to be filed on behalf of the applicant, Pacific Exchange, were cast, unsurprisingly, with the benefit of, not only the Commissioner's appeal statement, but also the statement made in open court.</text>

<text>Later in time, in Commissioner of Taxation v ANZ Savings Bank [1994] HCA 58 ; (1994) 181 CLR 466 at 479, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ remarked, in their joint judgment: 
 
 In several decisions it has been held that the Commissioner may support the amount of the assessment on a ground not taken into account at the time the assessment was made. The Commissioner will be required to give proper notice to the taxpayer and, where appropriate, will be directed to furnish particulars.

<tocase>Hadjiloucas v Crean [1988] 1 WLR 1006</tocase>
<text>One of the cases to which their Honours refer, at para 33 in the passage quoted, is Hadjiloucas v Crean [1988] 1 WLR 1006. In particular, their Honours draw attention in their joint judgment to remarks made by Mustill LJ at page 1019, with reference to earlier remarks as to sham, made by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd [1967] 2 QB 786 at 802. What Mustill LJ had to say was this: 
 
 [I]t is necessary to distinguish between three situations in which, aside from any question of rectification, the court may take an agreement otherwise than at its face value. The first exists where the surrounding circumstances show that the arrangement between the parties was never intended to create any legally enforceable obligation. The second is the case of the "sham", in the sense in which that word has been used in numerous cases, including Snook v London and West Riding Investments Limited (1967) 2 QB 786 at 802. Correctly employed, this term denotes an agreement or series of agreements which are deliberately framed with the object of deceiving third parties as to the true nature and effect of the legal relations between the parties. The third situation is one in which the document does precisely reflect the true agreement between the parties, but where the language of the document (and in particular its title or description) superficially indicates that it falls into one legal category, whereas when properly analysed in light of the surrounding circumstances it can be seen to fall into another.

As I have mentioned by reference to Mustill LJ's observations in Hadjiloucas , there are three situations in which a court might take an agreement otherwise than at its face value. A fair reading of the Commissioner's appeal statement, as originally cast, takes one to the position, confirmed in open court by the statement on the Commissioner's behalf, that a sham in the sense described by Mustill LJ was not being relied upon, as opposed to one or perhaps both of the other bases upon which a court might choose to take an agreement otherwise than at its face value.

It was submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that the amended appeal statement was merely an extension of sentiments already apparent in the appeal statement as filed in February. It is true to say that the use of the word "purported" raised or might be thought to raise an interrogative note as to exactly the case the Commissioner was seeking to have a taxpayer meet by way of discharging the burden of proving an assessment to be excessive. Whatever interrogative note there may be in that word was answered on 20 March.

Mr Prescott deposes in his affidavit to the particular consequences which he apprehends would fall upon Pacific Exchange in the event that leave to amend were granted. These statements are not challenged: 
 
 If the new allegations are allowed to be pressed, then I believe that the trial dates will have to be vacated. We will need to seek particulars of the allegations, apply for limited discovery, prepare affidavits in reply, including an affidavit for Mrs Catherine Cea against whom the allegation of sham has been made in and because of her absence as a witness, and prepare an amended appeal statement. Having regard to the time taken to date in preparing the case to date, this will take a significant amount of time. It is further relevant to note that both Mr Philip Cea and Ms Michelle King have finalised their travel arrangements to attend before the Court in three weeks time. 
 

 
 
 Having discussed the issue with Mr Robertson of counsel, my reasons for deciding not to produce an affidavit from Mrs Catherine Cea were two-fold: 
 

 
 
 (a) Counsel was satisfied that the material provided and evidence sworn by Mr Phillip Cea and Ms Michelle King was, when read in conjunction with the other affidavit material and evidence provided, sufficient to adequately address the issues which I believed, at the time were to be resolved by the Court, and
 (b) More importantly, Mrs Catherin Cea's medical condition was such that she was house-bound and would not be able to travel to Australia to give evidence on medical advice. [sic]</text>

<tocase>Jupiters Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 4022</tocase>
<text>One of the submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner as to why it was not procedurally unfair for the appeal statement in its amended form to be the subject of a grant of leave was put in these terms: 
 
 The fact the Commissioner had not alleged sham or relied upon the tax avoidance provisions of the legislation prior to the filing of the applicant's material does not mean that the Court is obliged to accept PEC had completely subjected itself to an obligation under the purported "Participation Agreement" or that the alleged payments had the characterisation of an outgoing for the purposes of ss 51(1)/8- 1 . Goldberg J, with whom the other members of the Full Court agreed, dismissed a similar proposition by the taxpayer in Star City [2009] FCAFC 19 by reference, inter alia, to Jupiters Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 148 ATR 511.

Jupiters Limited v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2002) ATC 4022 though, was not a case in which "sham", as that term was used by Mustill LJ, was in any way a feature. Rather, it was a case where, against wider surrounding circumstances, a conclusion was able to be reached that a particular outgoing was one of capital rather than on revenue account. It is quite irrelevant to the present case.

When an allegation of sham is made, it is tantamount to an allegation of fraud. As it is made in this case, it is certainly such an allegation, and a serious one indeed. It has been made at a time when, having regard to the ordinary residence of key witnesses or potential witnesses in the Philippines, it is difficult to see how the granting of leave would do other than carry with it, as a corollary, an adjournment of the hearing of a taxation appeal, the trial of which has been fixed for many months.</text>

<tocase>Raftland Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] HCA 21 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 934</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/21.html</AustLII>
<text>I approach the question as to what amounts to sham by reference to a passage which appears in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow and Crennan JJ in Raftland Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] HCA 21 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 934 at paras 33 36: 
 
 [33] It was not contended by the appellant that the amounts referred to above were misappropriated. Yet it is central to the argument for the appellant that they were amounts to which the E &amp; M Unit Trust and, through that trust, its beneficiaries were entitled. The apparent discrepancy between the entitlements appearing on the face of the documents and the way in which the funds were applied gave rise to a question whether the documents were to be taken at face value. In various situations, the court may take an agreement or other instrument, such as a settlement on trust, as not fully disclosing the legal rights and entitlements for which it provides on its face. If that be so, the parol evidence rule in Australia identified with Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer does not apply. 
 

 
 
 [34] One such case is where other evidence of the intentions of the relevant actors shows that the document was brought into existence "as a mere piece of machinery" for serving some purpose other than that of constituting the whole of the arrangement. That, in essence, is the respondent's case with respect to the [2008] HCA 21 ; 246 ALR 406 at 417 alleged existence of the "present entitlement" of the trustee of the E &amp; M Unit Trust to the income of the Raftland Trust. 
 

 
 
 [35] The term "sham" may be employed here, but as Lockhart J emphasised in Sharrment Pty Ltd v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy the term is ambiguous and uncertainty surrounds its meaning and application. With reference to remarks of Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd , Mistily LJ later identified as one of several situations where an agreement may be taken otherwise than at its face value, that where there was a "sham", the term, when "[c]orrectly employed", denoted an objective of deliberate deception of third parties. 
 

 
 
 [36] The presence of an objective of deliberate deception indicates fraud. This suggests the need for caution in adoption of the description "sham". However, in the present litigation it may be used in a sense which is less pejorative but still apt to deny the critical step in the appellant's case. The absence of a present entitlement within the meaning of s 100A(1)(a) of the Act may appear from an examination of the whole of the relevant circumstances, and these are not confined to the terms of the Raftland Trust instrument.

Later in time, in Commissioner of Taxation v ANZ Savings Bank [1994] HCA 58 ; (1994) 181 CLR 466 at 479, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ remarked, in their joint judgment:
