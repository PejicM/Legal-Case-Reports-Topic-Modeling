<text>35 So far as the symptoms in her left elbow were concerned, the Tribunal was entitled, in the absence of expert evidence suggesting to the contrary, to draw the common-sense inference suggested by the fact that she experienced the same symptoms in each elbow; namely that their aetiology was the same ( Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst [1940] HCA 45 ; (1940) 64 CLR 538 esp per Rich ACJ at 563).

36 For the above reason, the onset of symptoms in her right arm that were of the same character as the symptoms in her left arm was not an irrelevant consideration. The Tribunal was not under an obligation to disregard the symptoms experienced by Ms Butler in her right arm because no person expressed an expert opinion on the relevance of the symptoms in Ms Butler's right arm other than in respect of her carpal tunnel syndrome.

37 Ms Butler additionally contended that the Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations when it had regard to 'inadmissible' evidence of Ms Carrall and Ms Small. While acknowledging that the Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence, Ms Butler argued that 'there must be occasions and are occasions that a tribunal could reject evidence that is clearly inadmissible and based on extreme hearsay' .</text>
