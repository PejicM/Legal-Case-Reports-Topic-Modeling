<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Nation (1995) 57 FCR 2538 AAR 55</tocase>
<text>Pursuant to ss 44(4) and (5) of the AAT Act and s 28 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the Court has power to remit the case for re-hearing by the Tribunal, which may be confined or at large: Repatriation Commission v Nation (1995) 57 FCR 25. I consider that the matter as a whole ought be remitted to the Tribunal differently constituted for determination according to law. It is unnecessary, given this conclusion, to consider the other questions of law raised in the application.

The application will accordingly be allowed. I will hear the parties on the question of costs. 
 I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.
