<tocase>Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) FCR 119</tocase>
<text>5 In Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120F-G von Doussa J said of O 62 r 4(2)(c) that:
 
 'The purpose of the rule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in protracted litigation arising out of taxation. The power is appropriate to be used in complex cases.'

6 In my opinion it is also appropriate to be used in cases which are simple and in which there would be utility in the court cutting the Gordian knot of protracted fights about costs which is the hallmark of this particular piece of litigation. It is a commonplace for the court to fix in administrative appeals under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) an amount of costs for a successful party.

7 In my opinion, it is appropriate that an amount of costs be fixed by the court so as to prevent yet further argument and delay in finalising this matter.</text>
