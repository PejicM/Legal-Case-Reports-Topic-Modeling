<text>The respondent further submits that s 255-5, which provides for an express regime of civil recovery but does not extend to amounts arising under s 260-5, is also "a provision to the contrary". This seeks, in effect, to apply the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius as an aid to construction. It is an aid which must be used with caution: Houssein v Under Secretary of Industrial Relations and Technology [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94; Barratt v Howard [1999] FCA 1132 ; (1999) 165 ALR 605 at 615 per Hely J.

<tocase>Bluebottle UK Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] HCA 54 ; (2007) 232 CLR 598</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/54.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondent contends that a dictum in the judgment of the High Court in Bluebottle UK Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] HCA 54 ; (2007) 232 CLR 598 referring to s 218 as a "penal" provision, might on one reading be seen as indicating that that section did not give rise to an obligation enforceable by civil proceedings.

Bluebottle concerned the scope of ITAA36 s 255 which made a person who had "control" of money belonging to a non-resident liable to pay "the tax due and payable by the non-resident". Section 255 did not, itself, contain any provision characterising the relevant amounts as "debts" due to the Commonwealth. Rather, the liability was described as one in respect of "tax", defined in subs (4) to include the general interest charge. Making a person liable to pay the "tax" due and payable by the non-resident clearly had significance: for example, ITAA36 ss 175 and 177(1) would apply to make the relevant assessment conclusive as to the amount payable, while TAA ss 14ZZM and 14ZZR would govern the recoverability of that amount pending the outcome of any review or appeal against the assessment. The Commissioner argued as the Court understood it that, if not given a relatively broad construction, s 255 would have "little or no work to do" different from that done by s 218. The Court considered that s 255 did have additional work to do, even on a narrower view than that urged by the Commissioner. The Court at [93] articulated the different effects of the two provisions: 
 First, s 255 is directed to a more limited class of tax liabilities than those with which s 218 deals. Section 255 concerns only tax which is or will become due from a non-resident; s 218 is not so limited. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, s 255 makes the controller of moneys liable for the tax payable by the non-resident (to the extent of the amount that was, or should have been, retained); s 218 is a penal provision and does not permit the Commissioner to recover any of the tax due from the person to whom the notice is given. These differences suffice to distinguish between the two provisions and give each a separate operation in the 1936 Act. (Emphasis added)

The references to "tax payable" and "tax due" are significant. I apprehend the Court here was saying no more than that under s 218 the third party was, unlike s 255, not liable to pay the "tax payable". Section 255(1)(c) rendered the "controller" of monies of a non-resident personally liable for the tax payable on behalf of the non-resident. Section 218, by contrast, created a new obligation for payment to the Commissioner of "money due, accruing or (which) may become due" by a person to a taxpayer, albeit the payment of that money by the person to the Commissioner was to be credited against the taxpayer's liability to tax. However, it did not in terms enable the Commissioner to recover from the other person the tax due by the taxpayer. The provisions to which I have referred in the ITAA36 concerning assessments of tax have no immediate application in respect of s 218. This, in my view, is how the distinction between ss 218 and 255 referred to in Bluebottle should be understood. I would expect that had the Court meant that s 218 provided no capacity for the Commissioner to sue for recovery of amounts the subject of a notice other than through criminal proceedings, it would have referred to earlier High Court authority on the subject such as Clyne and particularly the principle explained in Mallinson . Indeed Clyne was applied in Bluebottle in dealing with another issue and Mallinson was also referred to but not on this point. I do not regard Bluebottle as overruling the principle articulated in Mallinson.

Bluebottle therefore does not stand in the way of a conclusion that the ITAA36 s 218 permitted the Commissioner to sue in debt for the amount required to be paid pursuant to a notice. Other authority supports this conclusion. It also supports the same conclusion in respect of TAA s 260-5. There is therefore nothing to displace the ordinary rule that, where a statute creates an obligation to pay money, an action in debt will lie to enforce the obligation.

The Commissioner, in my opinion, may sue in debt to recover an amount that is required to be paid by a notice under s 260-5, when the time for payment of that amount as specified in s 260-5(5) has arrived. Monies alleged owed by respondent to Mr and Mrs Barnes

The loan accounts of Mr and Mrs Barnes with the respondent, at the material dates of 30 June and 22 June respectively, according to the records of the respondent were as follows at least prior to the application of a journal entry in each case amounting to $309,609.31. I will refer to the journal entries later: Mr Barnes' loan account with respondent as at 30 June 2007 (rounded)

<tocase>Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 40 ; (1981) 150 CLR 1 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/40.html</AustLII>
<text>In Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 40 ; (1981) 150 CLR 1 , Mason J (Aickin and Wilson JJ agreeing) described s 218 as imposing an obligation on the recipient of a notice to pay money which falls within the statutory description. Brennan J observed that the Commissioner was entitled to insist on compliance and that there was no reason why the Commissioner's right should not be enforced by proceedings other than prosecution under subs (2). No other member of the Court considered this point. When Clyne was decided s 218 did not confer any power on the Court convicting an entity for non-compliance with the notice to pay some or all of the amount in the notice. I do not consider that this affects the proper construction of s 260-5. Brennan J further observed that the statute worked an assignment of the moneys to be paid to the Commissioner as though the taxpayer had charged the moneys otherwise payable to him with payment of his tax liability.

The references to "tax payable" and "tax due" are significant. I apprehend the Court here was saying no more than that under s 218 the third party was, unlike s 255, not liable to pay the "tax payable". Section 255(1)(c) rendered the "controller" of monies of a non-resident personally liable for the tax payable on behalf of the non-resident.

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Lanstel Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 314</tocase>
<text>Bryson J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, referring to that observation, held in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Lanstel Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 314 that the s 218 worked an assignment of the debt so that it became payable to the Commissioner. In doing so his Honour observed: 
 A conclusion that, quite apart from prosecuting a recipient of a notice for an offence, the Commissioner has a legal right to compel the payments to be made to the Commissioner, and to sue for the amount if it is not paid, is left to implication, but the implication is clear.

This conclusion was reached despite the then inclusion by s 218(3) of the discretionary power to order payment.</text>

<tocase>Mallinson v Scottish Australian Investment Co Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1920/51.html</AustLII>
<text>The Commissioner's primary submission is that each amount, the subject of a notice under s 260- 5 , is recoverable by an action in debt under the principles of the general law as explained by the High Court in the following passage from its unanimous judgment in Mallinson v Scottish Australian Investment Co Ltd [1920] HCA 51 ; (1920) 28 CLR 66: 
 The rule applicable here is stated in Shepherd v Hills as follows, viz, 'Wherever an Act of Parliament creates a duty or obligation to pay money, an action will lie for its recovery, unless the Act contains some provision to the contrary'; and where the amount is liquidated the action of debt is appropriate. The obligation is none the less a debt because the statute gives no particular method of enforcing it. In cases in which the statute contains no express denial of the right to bring an action, the proper course to adopt in order to determine whether it contains 'some provision to the contrary' within the meaning of the rule stated above is to consider whether it appears from the whole purview of the Act that it was the intention of the Legislature that the remedy provided should be a substitute for the right of action which would otherwise exist; and in determining this question it is material to consider whether the obligation imposed by the Act was designed to benefit a particular class of persons .... It is also material to consider whether the provision made by the Act for compelling obedience to its commands is in the nature of a penalty for disobedience or in the nature of compensation to the person whose rights are affected by the failure to perform the obligations imposed by the Act. [The case citations have been omitted].

The respondent argues, applying the Shepherd v Hills proviso adopted in Mallinson , that s 260-20 constitutes a "provision to the contrary", which denies the right to sue for recovery that would otherwise arise by implication. This is because, it submits, s 260-20 provides a sanction for non-compliance with a notice under the criminal law, with power in the criminal court in its discretion to order payment of an appropriate sum to the Commissioner.

Section 260-20 relevantly provides: 
 Offence 

 
 (1) The third party must not fail to comply with the Commissioner's notice.
 Penalty: 20 penalty units 

 
 (2) The court may, in addition to imposing a penalty on a person convicted of an offence against subsection (1) in relation to failing to pay an amount under the notice, order the person to pay to the Commissioner an amount not exceeding that amount.

As to s 260-20, there is no general principle that the availability of civil remedies is excluded by provision for a criminal sanction with a discretionary power to order payment of monies due. I do not consider that the Parliament intended the criminal sanctions in s 260-20 to be the exclusive means of enforcing a notice.

The respondent further submits that s 255-5, which provides for an express regime of civil recovery but does not extend to amounts arising under s 260-5, is also "a provision to the contrary". This seeks, in effect, to apply the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius as an aid to construction. It is an aid which must be used with caution: Houssein v Under Secretary of Industrial Relations and Technology [1982] HCA 2 ; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94; Barratt v Howard [1999] FCA 1132 ; (1999) 165 ALR 605 at 615 per Hely J. If applied in this case it would bring about a result which I doubt the Parliament intended: Ainsworth v CJC [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 575. The existence of affirmative provisions elsewhere in the Act does not, in my opinion, override the principle articulated in Mallinson .

The references to "tax payable" and "tax due" are significant. I apprehend the Court here was saying no more than that under s 218 the third party was, unlike s 255, not liable to pay the "tax payable". Section 255(1)(c) rendered the "controller" of monies of a non-resident personally liable for the tax payable on behalf of the non-resident. Section 218, by contrast, created a new obligation for payment to the Commissioner of "money due, accruing or (which) may become due" by a person to a taxpayer, albeit the payment of that money by the person to the Commissioner was to be credited against the taxpayer's liability to tax. However, it did not in terms enable the Commissioner to recover from the other person the tax due by the taxpayer. The provisions to which I have referred in the ITAA36 concerning assessments of tax have no immediate application in respect of s 218. This, in my view, is how the distinction between ss 218 and 255 referred to in Bluebottle should be understood. I would expect that had the Court meant that s 218 provided no capacity for the Commissioner to sue for recovery of amounts the subject of a notice other than through criminal proceedings, it would have referred to earlier High Court authority on the subject such as Clyne and particularly the principle explained in Mallinson . Indeed Clyne was applied in Bluebottle in dealing with another issue and Mallinson was also referred to but not on this point. I do not regard Bluebottle as overruling the principle articulated in Mallinson.</text>
