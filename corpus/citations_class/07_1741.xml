<text>21 In relation to ground 2, I am satisfied that the Tribunal afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to respond to adverse material in keeping with its obligations to accord natural justice. It is for the Tribunal, within recognised limits, to make findings as to credit: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] . The weight to be given to particular evidence is a matter for the Tribunal. It was open to the Tribunal to reach the conclusions that it did given its observations regarding the demeanour of the appellant, and the inconsistency between the various accounts that he had provided.

22 Ground 3 is devoid of any meaningful content. Nothing further need be said about it.

23 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.
