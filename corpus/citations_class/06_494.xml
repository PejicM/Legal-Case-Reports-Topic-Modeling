<text>41 An alternative approach to the determination of the content of the Tribunal's obligation to give notice of the rescheduled hearing was suggested by counsel for the Minister. He submitted that its content would be governed by the statutory obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Act to provide a "real and meaningful" invitation to attend the hearing; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (" SCAR") at [37].

<text>29 As Branson J pointed out in SZBDF at [12], there is a division of opinion within the Court as to the ambit of s 422B(1). One view is that the phrase "in relation to the matters it deals with" imports a limitation upon the extent to which Div 4 is to be read as a code and doe not, in effect, completely exclude common law rules of natural justice; see WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 624 ( WAJR") at [47] [59] and Moradian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 ; (2004) 142 FCR 170 (" Moradian") at [35] [37].

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>18 As the appellant was unrepresented, the Federal Magistrate also considered whether any issue arose in relation to s 424A of the Act , in light of the High Court's decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162. He concluded that there had been no breach of s 424A.

19 The relevant sections of the Act and the Regulations are as follows:-
 
 " Section 425 Tribunal must invite applicant to appear 
 
 
 
 (1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. 
 
 
 
 (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if: 
 
 
 
 (a) the Tribunal considers that it should decide the review in the applicant's favour on the basis of the material before it; or 
 (b) the applicant consents to the Tribunal deciding the review without the applicant appearing before it; or 
 
 
 
 
 (c) subsection 424C(1) or (2) applies to the applicant. 
 
 (3) If any of the paragraphs in subsection (2) of this section apply, the applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal. 
 
 Section 425A Notice of invitation to appear 
 
 (1) If the applicant is invited to appear before the Tribunal, the Tribunal must give the applicant notice of the day on which, and the time and place at which, the applicant is scheduled to appear. 
 
 (2) The notice must be given to the applicant: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) except where paragraph (b) applies--by one of the methods specified in section 441A ; or 
 (b) if the applicant is in immigration detention--by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving documents to such a person. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) The period of notice given must be at least the prescribed period or, if no period is prescribed, a reasonable period. 
 
 (4) The notice must contain a statement of the effect of section 426A."

20 Regulation 4.35D, entitled 'Prescribed periods - notice to appear before Tribunal ([Migration] Act , s 425A) ', provides as follows:
 
 "For subsection 425A (3) of the Act , the prescribed period: 
 
 
 
 (a) if the applicant is a detainee -- starts when the applicant receives notice of the invitation to appear before the Tribunal and ends at the end of 7 days after the day on which the notice is received; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in any other case -- starts when the applicant receives notice of the invitation to appear before the Tribunal and ends at the end of 14 days after the day on which the notice is received. 
 
 
 
 Note 1 If the Tribunal gives a person a document by a method specified in section 441A of the Act , the person is taken to have received the document at the time specified in section 441C of the Act in respect of the method. 
 
 Note 2 A document given to a person in immigration detention is given in the manner specified in regulation 5.02."</text>

<text>23 Support for the view that a distinction is to be drawn between the situation where the Tribunal itself reschedules the hearing date and when it does so at the applicant's request is found in the decisions of Sackville J in NBBU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 767 and Barnes FM in SZBAZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 790 (" SZBAZ") . Conti J referred to both of these authorities.

24 The rationale for the distinction is that where the Tribunal itself reschedules the hearing it may be thought to have issued a fresh invitation. However, where the applicant requests a postponement, s 425A does not apply because the section is limited to the situation where an applicant "is invited to appear before the Tribunal"; see SZBAZ at [28] [29], quoted by Conti J at [21].

25 The conclusion reached by Conti J that s 425A(3) does not apply where an applicant requests a rescheduling is supported by the language of s 425A. It is also consistent with the detailed statutory provisions of Division 4 of Part 7 of the Act , as was observed by Barnes FM in SZBAZ .

26 It is to be noted that s 426A appears to draw a distinction between an invitation to appear before the Tribunal as required by s 425(1) and the power of the Tribunal to reschedule the hearing; see s 426A(2). This might be thought to provide further support for the view that s 425A is limited to the initial invitation but it does not explain the distinction between a rescheduling by the Tribunal itself rather than at the request of an applicant.

27 The difficulty which seems to me to arise on the approach adopted by Conti J is whether the common law rules of nature justice govern the requirement of notice of a hearing which is rescheduled at the applicant's request. As His Honour correctly observed, this must be subject to the provisions of s 422B which provides that Division 4 of Part 7 is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with.</text>

<text>28 Section 422B applies to applications to the Tribunal for review of a decision filed after 4 July 2002; see SZATG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 83 ALD 596 at [31]; see also SZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 (" SZBDF") at [11]. It therefore applies to the present case.

29 As Branson J pointed out in SZBDF at [12], there is a division of opinion within the Court as to the ambit of s 422B(1). One view is that the phrase "in relation to the matters it deals with" imports a limitation upon the extent to which Div 4 is to be read as a code and doe not, in effect, completely exclude common law rules of natural justice; see WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 624 ( WAJR") at [47] [59] and Moradian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 ; (2004) 142 FCR 170 (" Moradian") at [35] [37].

<tocase>SZDQO v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 ; (2005) 144 FCR 251</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1026.html</AustLII>
<text>13 Nicholls FM referred to the decision of Conti J in SZDQO v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 ; (2005) 144 FCR 251 (" SZDQO") which addressed this issue. The learned Federal Magistrate followed SZDQO as authority for the proposition that where the Tribunal reschedules a hearing at the request of an appellant, s 425A(3) does not apply in relation to the notice of the rescheduled hearing.

14 The Federal Magistrate concluded that the appellant was given a reasonable period within the requirements of the law, notwithstanding that it was not the full 14 days required under s 425A. He went on to observe that the Tribunal did not make its decision for some eight days after the rescheduled hearing date, and did not hand down its decision for a month after the rescheduled hearing date. The Magistrate noted that the appellant did nothing to notify the Tribunal of his reason for a failure to attend the rescheduled hearing date, nor to seek any further hearing date. In the circumstances, the Magistrate did not accept the applicant's complaint and found that the ground was not made out.

15 FM Nicholls observed at [15] that even if he had found jurisdictional error, he would have declined to exercise the discretion to grant relief, for two reasons. First, the appellant did not contend that he did not receive the letter notifying him of the rescheduled hearing date and he did not approach the Tribunal to explain his failure to attend. Secondly, there was no evidence put before His Honour to indicate that the appellant wanted to attend the rescheduled hearing, or that the appellant had further evidentiary material he would have wanted to put before the Tribunal.

16 There were six further grounds of review. They were bias, failure to properly conduct a hearing, failure to take into account relevant considerations, failure to apply the correct test, illogicality, and failure to give reasons.

17 The learned Federal Magistrate considered each of these grounds and dismissed them.

22 In SZDQO, Conti J held at [29] that where the Tribunal reschedules a hearing at the request of an applicant, the 14 day notice requirement stipulated in s 425A(3) and Reg 4.35D does not apply to the notice of the rescheduled hearing. His Honour was of the view that, subject to the operation of s 422B of the Act , the requirement of notice of the rescheduled date would be governed by the general law of natural justice.

42 However, there are two difficulties with this approach. First, on the construction of s 425A adopted by Conti J in SZDQO , s 425 would bear the same limitation as s 425A. It would have to be confined to an invitation to attend a hearing and would not extend to a hearing rescheduled at the request of an applicant.

44 In summary, I respectfully agree with the approach to construction of s 425A adopted by Conti J in SZDQO which, for the reasons given above, disposes of the only substantial point in the appeal. At very least, His Honour's decision is not plainly wrong and I would follow it, especially as His Honour was exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court.

45 The other grounds of appeal largely refer to the grounds of review in which the appellant failed before the Federal Magistrate. There is no substance in them and they must be dismissed, essentially for the reasons given by the learned Magistrate. There was no apparent error in His Honour's approach.

46 One of the grounds of appeal alleges failure to consider the availability of effective state protection. This ground was not advanced below. I will not give leave to raise it on appeal.

47 Although not raised in the Notice of Appeal, the appellant was not represented and I will consider the question of whether there was jurisdictional error by reason of a contravention of s 424A.</text>
