<tocase>SZGLQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 670</tocase>

<text>The essence of the application for relief pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), which was made to the Federal Magistrates Court, was that the Tribunal member had not considered the case put forward on behalf of the appellants. In essence, the learned Federal Magistrate, apart from not being persuaded of that, held that the real basis for the Tribunal's decision in any event was the material current at the time of the Tribunal's decision in 1995, which effectively superseded that which went before ( SZGLQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 670). In the appeal to this Court, the appellants pursued three grounds for appeal, attacking the approach of the learned Federal Magistrate to the arguments advanced to him. I will not trouble to set out the detail of the grounds of appeal.

When the matter came on for hearing today, the solicitor for the appellants indicated that he wished to amend the notice of appeal to raise the question of natural justice or procedural fairness, because the material relied upon by the Tribunal member, and regarded as critical by the learned Federal Magistrate, had not been disclosed to the appellants or the adviser prior to the decision. That material, or certainly the bulk of it, is now in evidence, but was at no stage provided to the appellants.

Objection was taken to the amendment, first of all on the general ground that it is not appropriate to take new points at this stage of a case in this Court. There was also a suggestion that the way the case had been presented before the Federal Magistrates Court may have led to some unfairness to the first respondent in the way things developed if the amendment were now allowed. I need not go through all of that as I think it is now accepted that there is no special point that can be made about that. It is not suggested, for example, that if this point had been taken before the learned Federal Magistrate there could have been evidence led to counter it. That is plainly correct because the circumstances appear from the face of the record, or are otherwise very clear.</text>

<text>It seems to me that the approach of the High Court in Miah, and indeed in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, which was applied in Miah , makes this all too plain a case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. The material was crucial to the decision. Whilst it may not have been new in concept it did relate to a later period and amounted to the reason why the applications failed.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57</tocase>

<text>The fundamental objection, however, was that the point had no merit and would not succeed. In my view, the point does have merit, and in the very unusual circumstances of this case, it seems to me that an amendment should be permitted along the lines read onto the record by the solicitor for the appellants. The argument has merit based upon the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57, where in very similar circumstances, (that is, a change of position in the country of origin prior to the decision due to reliance by the delegate on new material and the appellant being given no opportunity to respond), the High Court had no difficulty in finding that there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. The main issue in that case was that by then there had been amendments to the Act which enabled an argument to be put that there was then a code for dealing with the situation and that the ordinary common law natural justice rules did not apply. That argument is not available in this case, because the amendments had not been made, so the common law rules clearly do apply.

The answer which is made on behalf of the Minister is that in this case, all the issues raised in the later material to which reference was made by the Tribunal member were traversed in the earlier material and that the late material really amounted to pieces of evidence which were not required to be put forward for particular comment. There is also, I might say, always the argument that it is the visa applicant's case, and if circumstances change in the country of origin, then it is up to the applicant to keep on top of things and keep the Tribunal informed.

It seems to me that the approach of the High Court in Miah, and indeed in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550, which was applied in Miah , makes this all too plain a case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. The material was crucial to the decision. Whilst it may not have been new in concept it did relate to a later period and amounted to the reason why the applications failed.</text>
