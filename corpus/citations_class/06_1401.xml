<text>Section 31A is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient. Section 31A allows for "judgment" or nothing. Alternative remedies with respect to deficient pleadings must be found in the rules of Court. In this connection I respectfully disagree with the approach taken by Heerey J in Duncan v Lipscombe Child Care Services Inc [2006] FCA 458 in which his Honour said (at [6]): 
 
 'Plainly s 31A was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the High Court's decisions in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1948) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed".'

In the present case the factual denials set out in the affidavits by Mr and Mrs Matthews do not descend to particulars or address the associated allegations made in the statement of claim about the use of their company's name in Thailand. I do not consider that affidavits at this level of generality and essentially seeking to refute a particular of relevant knowledge go far enough to establish that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of success in the proceedings against them. For that reason I will dismiss their motion insofar as it seeks dismissal of the application. The bar is higher under O 20 r 2 and I will not dismiss the proceedings under that Rule.

The second limb of the motion relates to the taking of evidence on commission or prior to trial from Mr Matthews having regard to the uncertain state of his health. I will certainly accede to that proposal and will give directions to enable it to occur after hearing from the parties as to the appropriate time at which such evidence might be taken.

For the preceding reasons, the motion will be dismissed insofar as it seeks judgment or dismissal of the proceedings against the sixth, seventh and eighth respondents. I will however give directions for the evidence of the seventh respondent to be taken on commission. 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French .
