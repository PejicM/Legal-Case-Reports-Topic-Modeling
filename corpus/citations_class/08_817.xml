<tocase>CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/33.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The concession made by Mr Goot appears to me to be correct. In CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 , the joint judgment of six members of the High Court noted (at 391) that the power to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens is an aspect of the inherent or implied power which, in the absence of some statutory provisions to the same effect, every court must have to prevent its own processes being used to bring about injustice. The joint judgment went on to say (at 391) that:
 
 '[t]he counterpart of a court's power to prevent its processes being abused is its power to protect the integrity of those processes once set in motion. And in some cases, it is that counterpart power of protection that authorises the grant of anti-suit injunctions'. (Emphasis in original; citation omitted.)

21 After giving examples of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to grant an anti-suit injunction in relation to foreign proceedings, the joint judgment observed (at 392) that:
 
 '[t]he inherent power to grant anti-suit injunctions is not confined to the examples just given. As with other aspects of that power, it is not to be restricted to defined and closed categories. Rather, it is to be exercised when the administration of justice so demands or, in the context of anti-suit injunctions, when necessary for the protection of the court's own proceedings or processes'. (Citation omitted.)

22 The joint judgment identified a number of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to make orders restraining the commencement or continuation of proceedings in other courts (or arbitral bodies). These include the following:
 
 
 &#8226; where the other proceedings interfere with or have a tendency to interfere with proceedings pending in the court ( CSR, at 392; National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Century Corporation (1989) 22 FCR 209 , at 230-233, per Gummow J);
 &#8226; where the institution or continuation of the other proceedings involves unconscionable conduct or the unconscionable exercise of legal rights ( CSR, at 392); 
 &#8226; where the other proceedings are, according to the principles of equity, vexatious or oppressive ( CSR, at 393), for example where a second proceeding is commenced in a court, and an action is pending in another court with respect to the matters in issue ( Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 , at 590-591, per Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ); and
 &#8226; where the bringing of proceedings with respect to one claim is properly to be seen as an election either not to proceed on another claim or not to proceed in another jurisdiction, thus giving rise to an estoppel by conduct ( CSR, at 394). 
 

The joint judgment emphasised, however, that the power is not to be confined by reference to the example found in the decided cases. Rather, it is a power the limits of which are to be determined by the dictates of ' equity and good conscience ' ( CSR, at 394).</text>

<tocase>Transport Workers' Union of New South Wales v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2008] FCAFC 26</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/26.html</AustLII>
<text>28 By instituting proceedings in the AIRC the day after withdrawing its interlocutory application, Sydney Ferries seeks to achieve, in substance, the same result in the AIRC that it failed to achieve in this Court. It is true, as Mr Goot points out, that there are differences between s 494 and 496 of the Workplace Relations Act and that the differences are not confined to the nature of the decision-making body that exercises the relevant powers. (One example is that an order under s 494(5) of the Workplace Relations Act can be made only by the persons identified in s 494(2) , while an order made under s 496 must be complied with by any person to whom the order is expressed to apply, including a union registered solely under State law: s 496(10) ; Transport Workers' Union of New South Wales v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2008] FCAFC 26 , at [25], [36], per Gray and North JJ.) Nonetheless, in order to discharge its functions, the AIRC must address and make a determination on the proper construction of the statutory expression ' industrial action ' and its application to the circumstances of the present case. That is precisely one of the points that was argued before this Court on the application for injunctive relief that was withdrawn by Sydney Ferries.</text>

<tocase>Miller v University of New South Wales (2003) 127 IR 432</tocase>
<text>29 I accept that, as Mr Goot contended, a determination by the AIRC on the question of statutory construction cannot bind this Court. Any such determination appears to be merely a step to the determination of future rights by the AIRC and does not bind the parties: Miller v University of New South Wales (2003) 127 IR 432, at 439, per Gray J; at 456, per Ryan and Gyles JJ. Nonetheless, having pursued a particular course in this Court and failed, Sydney Ferries now seeks relief in the AIRC that is in substance very similar if not identical to that sought in this Court on an interlocutory basis. It does so, moreover, on the basis of arguments that it has decided not to pursue in this Court on an interlocutory basis and which may remain to be resolved. In my opinion, to allow Sydney Ferries to proceed in this way would impair the integrity of the processes of this Court that Sydney Ferries itself chose to invoke. To put the matter another way, Sydney Ferries' initiation of proceedings in the AIRC is an attempt to seek relief of the kind that it has unsuccessfully sought in this Court, and requires the AIRC to address issues of construction that were and may still be before this Court.

30 It is difficult to see, so far as the present dispute between the parties is concerned, what point would be served by the proceedings in this Court seeking declaratory relief in relation to the construction of the Enterprise Agreements if Sydney Ferries were to succeed in its application before the AIRC, whether on an interim or permanent basis. Assuming Sydney Ferries succeeded before the AIRC, it would have obtained orders binding on the Respondents and their members, in the sense that any contravention of the orders could lead to the imposition of penalties. For the AIRC to make such orders, it would have to address the questions of construction presented by the application to this Court. This is so because if Sydney Ferries' actions are not authorised by the Enterprise Agreements, it is unlikely that the Respondents could be said to be organising or threatening ' industrial action '. Moreover, if the AIRC made the orders sought by Sydney Ferries, the onus would be on the Respondents to challenge the orders, whether by way of an appeal to a Full Bench of the AIRC (for which leave is necessary), or, more likely, by an application in this Court or the High Court by way of constitutional writs alleging jurisdictional error. There would be no need for Sydney Ferries to obtain any additional relief from this Court for the threatened or actual ' industrial action ' to be effectively restrained.

31 I should add that the effect of the anti-suit injunction sought by the Respondents will not be to deprive Sydney Ferries of recourse to the AIRC. The order proposed by the Respondents will apply only until the determination of the application for declaratory relief in this Court. Once that occurs, as Mr Birch SC (who appeared with Mr Gibian for the AMOU) accepted, it will be open to Sydney Ferries to seek orders under s 496 of the Workplace Relations Act from the AIRC. Any declaration made by the Court as to the effect of the Enterprise Agreements will be binding on the parties by virtue of s 849 of the Workplace Relations Act . Since an expedited hearing has been granted, there will be only a short delay before Sydney Ferries' application to this Court is resolved. Thereafter it will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to it in the AIRC.</text>
