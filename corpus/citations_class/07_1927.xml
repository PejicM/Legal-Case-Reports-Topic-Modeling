<tocase>Chandler v Alberta Association of Architects [1989] 2 SCR 848</tocase>
<text>11 In my view, the Federal Magistrate was correct to reach this conclusion. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 (2002) 209 CLR 597, the High Court held that, when the Immigration Review Tribunal had denied an applicant procedural fairness, it was open to that tribunal to take the view that it had not performed its statutory function, to set aside its purported decision and to revisit the matter. As a step to reaching that conclusion, at [52], Gaudron and Gummow JJ cited with approval the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Chandler v Alberta Association of Architects [1989] 2 SCR 848 at 861-862, where Sopinka J, which whom Dixon CJ and Wilson J concurred, said:
 
 As a general rule, once [an administrative] tribunal has reached a final decision in respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling statute, that decision cannot be revisited because the tribunal has changed its mind, made an error within jurisdiction or because there has been a change of circumstances.</text>
