<tocase>Comcare v Amorebieta (1996) 66 FCR 83</tocase>
<text>During the course of the hearing, counsel for the applicant submitted that the Tribunal did not consider the submission, founded upon the observations of von Doussa J in O'Keefe v Comcare [1998] FCA 603 and of Mansfield J in Comcare v Moon [2003] FCA 569 ; (2003) 75 ALD 160 at [50] , consistent with the approach taken by Jenkinson J in Comcare v Amorebieta (1996) 66 FCR 83 that a finding of permanent impairment under Tables 9.5 or 9.6 was available despite Dr McGill's findings on examination. In that last-mentioned case, Jenkinson J said at 99: 
 It was a further ground of appeal that the Tribunal, having found 'that there are occasions on which [the respondent] has a full range of movement if movement is to be measured in a technical sense', erred in law in failing to recognise that the word 'loss' in Table 9.6 and particularly in the phrase 'loss of less than half normal range of movement' requires that that degree of restriction of movement be always present. In that stark form the submission was perhaps not pressed. Nor do I accept it. The finding was based on some of the evidence by medical practitioners who at particular examinations found the respondent able to move within the normal range. But what is done on a particular occasion under medical observation is not determinative of the assessment which Table 9.6 requires.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Davies (2008) 173 IR 294</tocase>
<text>Whilst reasons must be adequate they do not need to be self-contained their sufficiency can depend on the manner in which a case was conducted, and such matters as the 'basic stock of knowledge common to both parties': Cypressvale Pty Ltd v Retail Shopping Lease Tribunal [1995] QCA 187 ; [1996] 2 Qd R 462 per McPherson and Davies JJA at 492. Similar observations were more recently made by Flick J in Comcare v Davies (2008) 173 IR 294 at [31] and [32]: ... 
 
 The nature and extent of this obligation [under s 43(2B) of the AAT Act] has been extensively canvassed. For the purposes of the resolution of the present appeal it is sufficient to note that the reasons of the Tribunal are 'meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed' : Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. But it is equally important 'to review the Tribunal's reasons to be satisfied that the Tribunal has in fact had regard to the matters which it must address' : Zhang v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 30 at [14] . 

 
 32. The extent of the reasoning provided in accordance with s 43(2B) must also be considered against the backdrop of the contentions advanced for resolution and the evidence presented. The Tribunal is exhorted by s 2A of the 1975 Act to 'pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick' . When carrying out its functions the Tribunal is also obliged to 'ensure that every party to a proceeding ... is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case' : s 39(1). The person who made the decision being reviewed by the Tribunal is also required to 'use his or her best endeavours to assist the tribunal to make its decision in relation to the proceeding' : s 33(1AA).

<tocase>Dodds v Comcare Australia (1993) 31 ALD 690</tocase>
<text>The adequacy of reasons provided, however, is also a matter of 'substance': Dodds v Comcare Australia (1993) 31 ALD 690. Burchett J at 691 there observed: 
 The obligation to furnish reasons, and to furnish reasons which are adequate, is a very important obligation. It is a pillar of the system of administrative decision-making by the Tribunal, and it is essential that the Court should insist on its fulfilment. But it is the substance of the obligation that matters . Indeed, as Lord Sumner pointed out in SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack [1927] AC 37 at 50, even a Judge's reasons on a question of fact will not be vitiated by 'imperfections in form and expression'. Section 43 is not to be construed in a pedantic spirit, but sensibly. If the Tribunal's reasons exposed the logic of its decision, and contain findings on those matters of fact which are essential to that logic, it will not be easy to demonstrate a failure of compliance with the requirement to include 'findings on material questions of fact '. (Emphasis added)

On reviewing [11] [18] of the Tribunal's reasons, one can discern two fundamental conclusions or findings on material questions of fact or mixed fact and law: 
(1) The finding at [13] that the Tribunal did not accept 'that the current condition suffered by Mrs Sagigi was a result of her employment'.
 
(2) The finding at [13] that the Tribunal 'simply cannot make a finding that there was any relevant impairment or permanent impairment on the evidence before [it]'; and the similar finding at [18] that the Tribunal 'cannot find that she has any permanent impairment relevantly under Table 9.6'.

The conclusion or finding in [19(1)] above is supported by reference to the following process of reasoning: 
(1) Inconsistencies in the evidence of the applicant in the Tribunal and the histories given to the various doctors (at [9] and [11]).
 
(2) The evidence of Dr McGill 'that the back condition may be related to other factors or an underlying degenerative condition' (at [15]).
 
(3) That Dr McGill's evidence was 'more plausible, given that he has seen this patient on three occasions, whereas Dr Berry and Dr Bodel have only seen her on two occasions' (at [15]); to which I would add, on three occasions over seven years, not five years as referred to at [12] of the Tribunal's reasons.</text>

<tocase>Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co [1983] 3 NSWLR 378</tocase>
<text>A standard of perfection is not required. It is sufficient if the basis of the decision is apparent, and one can reasonably understand or discern why the decision was reached. In Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 381, Hutley JA (with whom Samuels JA agreed) said: 
 The extent to which a court must go in giving reasons is incapable of precise definition. A court must not nullify rights of appeal by giving no or nominal reasons, but there is no duty to expound reasons so as to facilitate appeals. This applies particularly to the situation where a judge has to decide between conflicting witnesses, including experts. The choice between conflicting experts may have to be a matter of judgment, not of detailed reasoning.</text>
