<text>18 The Court now considers the issue of discovery under Order 15A Rule 6 of the Rules. In Paxus Services Ltd v People Bank Pty Limited (1990) 99 ALR 728 at 733 Burchett J held that Order 15A Rule 6 is to be given a wide operation and construed beneficially: see also Minister for Health and Aged Care v Harrington Associates Ltd [1999] FCA 549 at [27] . Order 15A Rule 6 has been the subject of judicial consideration by the Full Court of this Court in Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 60 ; (2001) 105 FCR 136. At 143 the Court said:
 
 In a number of cases it has been pointed out that O 15A, r 6 (discovery before action) expressly contemplates what once might have been castigated as fishing and that it would be incongruous if the power to order discovery were less extensive in favour of a party to a proceeding properly brought in the Court than in favour of someone unable for lack of evidence to mount a case: Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (1990) 51 IR 113, Trade Practices Commission v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 426 at 436 (Lindgren J), Treasurer of the Commonwealth v Canwest Global Communications Corp [1997] FCA 578 (Full Court), Microsoft Corporation v Adelong Electronics Pty Ltd (t/as Ade Computers) [1997] FCA 224 (Burchett J), Bertran v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1753 at [18] - [23] (Kenny J). Donnelly v Davison [2000] FCA 1396 ; (2000) 105 FCR 1 (Branson J). Also one should not lose sight of what the majority of the High Court in Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 at 685 noted as the public interest 
 " ... which requires that in the interests of a fair trial litigation should be conducted on the footing that all relevant documentary evidence is available."</text>

<tocase>Fermanis v Cheshire Holdings Pty Limited (1990) ATR 1862</tocase>
<text>16 In Fermanis v Cheshire Holdings Pty Limited (1990) ATR 1862 at 1865 Murray J said:
 
 It is clear, I think, the provision operates as a machinery provision to facilitate tax collection in relation to liable trust income, when the liability is otherwise imposed than by s 254. 

At 1866 his Honour continued:
 
 I conclude that the Income Tax Assessment Act s 254(1)(d) is a machinery provision which requires a trustee in possession of trust income to retain out of such income received by him in his representative capacity moneys sufficient to pay tax which is, or will become due, in respect of the income.

17 Since there may be a debt to the Commissioner of Taxation arising out of the nondisclosure of income from undisclosed overseas assets of the estate, the Court is satisfied that, prima facie, the applicants may have a claim arising under a Commonwealth statute sufficient to attract the jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and s 19 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Accordingly the Court possesses jurisdiction to grant relief.</text>

<tocase>Skyes v Stratton [1972] 1 NSWLR 145</tocase>
<text>13 As a second source of federal jurisdiction to support the orders sought the appellants rely upon Regulation 41 of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959 ('the Regulations') which provides for a possible right to restitution. The applicants refer to the decision in Skyes v Stratton [1972] 1 NSWLR 145 at 160 and submit that any contract or arrangement is illegal if it is made for the purpose of or has the effect of defeating, evading, avoiding or preventing the operation of the Regulations. They submit that the evidence prima facie establishes the existence of such arrangement between the deceased and the respondent.

14 The applicants submit that unless restrained, the respondent may destroy relevant records and deal with assets derived from the estate in such a manner as may defeat the interests of the Commissioner of Taxation. Further, there may be tax liabilities of the estate which will need to be met from the assets held overseas. The applicant's concern is based upon the fact that the respondent has refused requests to make disclosure of the existence of such assets.

15 In these proceedings the applicants are trustees as defined by s 254(1) of the ITAA 36. By virtue of s 254(1)(f) of the ITAA 36 trustees are indemnified for all payments which they may make pursuant to the ITAA 36 or of any requirement by the Commissioner.</text>
