<tocase>Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/2.html</AustLII>
<text>37 I have no hesitation in assuming that his Honour set out in his reasons for judgment fully, honestly and accurately all of what he took into account in coming to his decision to dismiss the appellant's complaint relating to Mr Xiao. Nor is it necessary or appropriate to inquire further into this question for the issue here is relevantly whether what occurred gave rise to the appearance of a possibility of an absence of an impartial mind on the part of his Honour as Callinan J explained in Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at 76-77 [81] - [83] , Haydon J agreeing at 78 [91]; see too per Gleeson CJ at 57 [22]. But what I, as a judge, or any lawyer for that matter, knows or assumes that a judicial officer referred to or took into account in deciding a matter when regard is had to the judicial officer's fulfillment of the duty to give reasons for judgment, is one thing. It is quite another thing for a fair-minded lay observer to be precluded from forming a reasonable apprehension that, in the present factual context, the judge might not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the dispute. As Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ said in Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 573:
 
 'An experienced lawyer would appreciate the ability of a trial judge to ensure that preconceived views do not cause the actual decision to be tainted by prejudgment or bias. The likelihood that the lay observer would not lies at the heart of the requirement of the appearance as well as the reality of impartial justice.'

49 However, in a case like the present, I am of opinion that it was not appropriate for his Honour to have used Ms Frank's affidavit in any way, although the parts of the affidavit which his Honour used were simply confirmatory of what the appellant herself had accepted in her cross-examination and also of what the objective evidence revealed. As Kirby J remarked in Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at 63 [47] :
 
 '... it is every person's right to have a trial conducted in accordance with the law. The trial judge here was disqualified because he crossed the line. The trial did not conform to law.'

50 The fact is that his Honour's intervention and use of Ms Frank's affidavit raises more questions for a fair minded observer than it answers. One does not know what, if anything, his Honour discarded in order to assess what he said was relevant to use from the other material in the file. Why did his Honour need to review any of the other material that was not formally before the court placed there in the ordinary way by the parties seeking to have their dispute properly ventilated?

51 In one sense it may be possible to say that the material used from Ms Frank's affidavit would have made no difference. In my opinion that material was capable of falling into such a category. However, the evidence of Ms Frank in this case did not assist the appellant's case at all. At worst it bolstered the case of the University and Mr Xiao as to her lack of complaint and made her case look thinner. There was no need for the evidence of Ms Frank to be called in aid for that purpose, for the very reasons which the University has sought on this appeal to say that the evidence would have made no difference. The trouble is that his Honour saw fit himself to introduce that evidence, after the appellant had given evidence and without any attention to the rules of the court providing for making directions about examination and cross-examination of the witness whose evidence it was.</text>

<tocase>Ebner v Official Trustee [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/63.html</AustLII>
<text>33 In Ebner v Official Trustee [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344-345 [6] - [8] Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:
 
 'Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge (or other judicial officer or juror), as here, the governing principle is that, subject to qualifications relating to waiver (which is not presently relevant) or necessity (which may be relevant to the second appeal), a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide (R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39 ; (1976) 136 CLR 248; Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw (1980) 55 ALJR 12; 32 ALR 47; Livesey v NSW Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288; Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342; Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568; Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41; Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488). That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done (R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 at 259, per Lord Hewart CJ), a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial. It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle. 
 
 The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror) might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors actually influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror. 
 
 The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an "interest" in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.'</text>

<tocase>Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263</tocase>
<text>52 I am of opinion that a fair-minded person could reasonably have apprehended that his Honour was seeking to assist the respondents' cases by introducing the evidence. Excessive judicial intervention in proceedings sometimes raises issues of fact and degree as to how far a judge is or is not entitled to go. Thus Wood CJ at CL noted that the line that a trial judge walks when asking questions of a witness is a narrow one ( R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 at 472B-C; see too Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 esp at 280-282 per Kirby ACJ). But the issue here really is whether a fair-minded person could reasonably have apprehended that his Honour's introduction and use of Ms Frank's evidence indicated that he was not being impartial.</text>

<text>56 I have anxiously given consideration as to whether it could be said that his Honour's conduct could have made no difference (see e.g. Goldsmith v Sandilands (2002) 190 ALR 370; [2002] HCA 31 ; Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 444 [28]-[29]; [2003] HCA 60) but I have come to the conclusion the course his Honour took is so irregular that the breach of the rules of procedural fairness cannot be regarded as not possibly having affected the outcome. A different judicial officer may have taken a different view as to the appellant's credibility and that of Mr Xiao and if that had happened, the outcome may have been different.</text>

Their Honours went on to quote with approval from Megarry J in John v Rees [1970] Ch 345 at 402:
 
 'As everybody who has anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered; of inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change.'</text>

<tocase>Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB 55</tocase>
<text>46 As the High Court said in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145:
 
 'The general principle applicable in the present circumstances was well expressed by the English Court of Appeal (Denning, Romer and Parker LJJ) in Jones v National Coal Board ([1957] 2 QB 55 at p 67) , in these terms: 
 
 "There is one thing to which everyone in this country is entitled, and that is a fair trial at which he can put his case properly before the judge. ... No cause is lost until the judge has found it so; and he cannot find it without a fair trial, nor can we affirm it." 
 
 That general principle is, however, subject to an important qualification [...]: Would further information possibly have made any difference? That qualification is that an appellate court will not order a new trial if it would inevitably result in the making of the same order as that made by the primary judge at the first trial. An order for a new trial in such a case would be a futility.'

47 Here the question is not so much whether further information could possibly have made any difference. The question is whether or not the proceedings below crossed the line described in the seminal case of Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB 55 at 63 by the English Court of Appeal who said:
 
 'In the system of trial which we have evolved in this country, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries.'

48 Their Lordships continued that Lord Greene MR had explained in Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20: '... that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations[.] If a judge, said Lord Greene, should himself conduct the examination of witnesses, "he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have his vision clouded by the dust of conflict".' That was, of course, said in the context in which a judge was not allowed to call witnesses (see Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB at 64). These considerations may not be entirely apposite for the Federal Magistrates Court if r 15.04 is a valid exercise of the rule-making power. Certainly, as noted above, there will be situations for example (and I do not intend to be exhaustive) in which that court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction in which it may be necessary or desirable for the court to have information from witnesses, particularly in cases involving the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) where welfare of a child may be in issue and where the relevant parties before the court may each have interests which the court regards as not properly able fully to inform it of what might be in the overall best interests of the child.</text>

<tocase>Obacelo Pty Ltd v Taveraft Pty Ltd (1986) 10 FCR 518</tocase>
<text>25 In Obacelo Pty Ltd v Taveraft Pty Ltd (1986) 10 FCR 518 at 540 Wilcox J expressed the view in obiter dicta , that in a civil action, a trial judge has power to call a witness, even over the opposition of a party, but that the discretion to take such a course should be exercised sparingly and with great care. (See too Wigmore on Evidence (Chadborn Revision) Vol 9 SS2483 where the learned author emphatically asserts the right of a judge in a civil case to call a witness.) Wilcox J said this view was consistent with the principle adopted in R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38 ; (1984) 154 CLR 563 in respect of criminal trials. Unless his Honour meant by the word 'sparingly' to encapsulate the concept of the power being exercisable only '... in the most exceptional circumstances' (154 CLR at 575 [5]), I am unable to agree that the power in a civil case may be exercised more freely, absent statutory authority.</text>

<tocase>Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854</tocase>
<text>28 At the end of the day, if the absence of a witness occurs and this affects the quality of the evidence properly before the court, the result will still be fair as between the parties, if the judge acts on that limited material, even though it may be thought to be unsatisfactory. The latter, but not the former, consequence may be the fault of the parties in their selection of the evidence or it may be that the parties have each decided that the witness would be of no assistance (cp: Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 920H-921C per Lord Roskill; DA Ipp 'Judicial Intervention in the Trial Process' (1995) 69 ALJ 365 at 373-375).

29 In any event, the trial judge in admitting Ms Frank's evidence, to the extent that he considered the basis of its admissibility at all, did no more than express a view that it was relevant. There was no necessity to admit that evidence. The circumstances of the proceedings were unexceptionable and raised no occasion on which it could be said that it was appropriate, on any of the tests above, to admit Ms Frank's evidence in the way in which his Honour did.

30 I am satisfied that Ms Frank's evidence was not properly received and that in the circumstances there was no basis for the trial judge to have admitted or used Ms Frank's evidence.

31 The issue assumes increased significance because in his Honour's reasons for judgment, having referred to the admission of the material from Ms Frank's affidavit ([2005] FMCA 463 [8]) his Honour considered the allegations made by the appellant on the Briginshaw [v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-362 per Dixon J] standard ([2005] FMCA 463 at [32]). His Honour noted that required him to have a high degree of satisfaction that the events alleged by the appellant happened. His Honour found as supporting his conclusion that he did not have that high degree of satisfaction. Among other things, he relied on the fact that the appellant had made no complaint about Mr Xiao's alleged conduct until more than twelve months afterwards although she had been expressly given the opportunity to make a complaint in 2002 ([2005] FMCA 463 at [32]).

32 A fair-minded observer sitting in the court room might wonder why, when the University was represented, it had not led any evidence from Ms Frank, yet his Honour had gone through the papers and had found an affidavit by her and had then identified parts of it as being 'relevant' and as ' effectively confirm[ing] ' that the appellant had not, in any written material lodged with the University, raised any allegations against Mr Xiao in 2002. By saying ' I think for completeness I should receive paragraphs 1, 2, 3 of Sybille Frank's affidavit of 10 January 2005 for the purposes of today's proceedings' his Honour was deciding of his own motion to admit material which no party had put before him as her, his or its evidence at the hearing. Ms Frank was not required to be present or to be available for cross-examination.</text>

<text>38 I do not consider that any question of waiver of his Honour's conduct can be imputed to Ms Huang. She was not to know that what his Honour did was extraordinary. Nor did counsel for the University intervene to suggest that what his Honour proposed to do was inappropriate. In Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572 Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ held that waiver was the consequence of a legally represented party failing to object to judicial conduct reasonably capable of being regarded as conveying an apprehension of bias. Their Honours did not explore the position for an unrepresented party but in Preston v Carmody (1993) 44 FCR 1 at 14 Wilcox J referred to the principle they had identified and said:
 
 'But the principle to which their Honours referred is not limited to cases where the relevant party is legally represented. It was applied by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in relation to a litigant in person in Wentworth v Rogers (No 12) (1987) 9 NSWLR 400 at 421-422. Where a person is not legally represented or advised, it will always be necessary to consider whether he/she had the knowledge necessary to found waiver.</text>

<text>22 The circumstances in which a judge may call a witness of his or her own motion, absent a statutory power, have been the subject of considerable judicial discussion (see JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed) at [17080]-[17100]). In Shaw v The Queen [1952] HCA 18 ; (1952) 85 CLR 365 at 379, Dixon, McTiernan, Webb and Kitto JJ said that in Titheradge v The King [1917] HCA 76 ; (1917) 24 CLR 107 the High Court had denied that a presiding judge in a criminal trial had power to call a witness if he (or she) thought that the imperative demands of justice so required. Dawson J affirmed that view in Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42 ; (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 684 where he said that Shaw v The Queen [1952] HCA 18 ; (1952) 85 CLR 365 had held that Titheradge v The Queen [1917] HCA 76 ; (1917) 24 CLR 107 was authority for the proposition that no distinction was to be drawn in Australia between criminal trials and civil actions with regard to the power of a judge to call a witness. However, Gibbs CJ and Brennan J, reserved their positions on this issue (152 CLR at 660). Gibbs CJ, Mason, Murphy, Wilson and Dawson JJ returned to the issue in R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38 ; (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575 saying of the conduct of criminal trials:
 
 'Save in the most exceptional circumstances, the trial judge should not himself call a person to give evidence.' 


 
That position appears to have been reaffirmed by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in R v Soma [2003] HCA 13 ; (2003) 212 CLR 299 at 309 [29] .

23 In Titheradge v The King [1917] HCA 76 ; (1917) 24 CLR 107 at 116, Barton J said that where the right of a judge to call a witness exists and R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38 ; (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575 [5] accepts that it does in the conduct of a criminal trial it must be exercised with extreme caution. He continued (24 CLR at 116):
 
 'In a civil case there must either be the consent of the parties or an acquiescence on their part from which the strong inference is consent.' 


 
Isaacs and Rich JJ said (24 CLR at 118) that the observations of Fletcher Moulton LJ in In re Enoch and Zaretzky Bock &amp; Co's Arbitration [1910] 1 KB 327 were of general application to the administration of justice both civil and criminal. His Lordship denied the power of a judge to call a witness against the will of a party ([1910] 1 KB at 332, 333; see too per Powell J in Clark Equipment Credit Australia Ltd v Como Factory Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 552 at 567F-568A and IF Sheppard, 'Court Witnesses A Desirable or Undesirable Encroachment on the Adversary System?' (1982) 56 ALJ 234 at 235) but accepted that where the parties acquiesced in a witness being called by the judge, a judge may do so provided that the parties have a right to cross-examine.

25 In Obacelo Pty Ltd v Taveraft Pty Ltd (1986) 10 FCR 518 at 540 Wilcox J expressed the view in obiter dicta , that in a civil action, a trial judge has power to call a witness, even over the opposition of a party, but that the discretion to take such a course should be exercised sparingly and with great care. (See too Wigmore on Evidence (Chadborn Revision) Vol 9 SS2483 where the learned author emphatically asserts the right of a judge in a civil case to call a witness.) Wilcox J said this view was consistent with the principle adopted in R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38 ; (1984) 154 CLR 563 in respect of criminal trials. Unless his Honour meant by the word 'sparingly' to encapsulate the concept of the power being exercisable only '... in the most exceptional circumstances' (154 CLR at 575 [5]), I am unable to agree that the power in a civil case may be exercised more freely, absent statutory authority.

27 So, it is vital to guard against an absolute prohibition of a judge's power of calling witnesses because some circumstances in which courts exercise jurisdiction are not wholly adversarial. But the power, according to the authorities to which I have referred, exists to prevent, not occasion, a miscarriage of justice which the judge perceives would otherwise occur. Before forming such a view, over the opposition of the parties and, where appropriate, their legal representatives, a trial judge would obviously need to consider whether the conscious choice of the parties not to call the witness properly can be overborne by the court while preserving the appearance and actuality of judicial impartiality. For a judge to use his or her power to override the choice of the parties as to what evidence they will adduce in order that the judge may decide their dispute is a drastic step which must only be available even in civil proceedings '... in the most exceptional circumstances' ( R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR at 575 [5]). The exercise of such a power removes the court from its usual and necessary position outside, and places it within, the forensic arena (cp: Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20).</text>

<text>52 I am of opinion that a fair-minded person could reasonably have apprehended that his Honour was seeking to assist the respondents' cases by introducing the evidence. Excessive judicial intervention in proceedings sometimes raises issues of fact and degree as to how far a judge is or is not entitled to go. Thus Wood CJ at CL noted that the line that a trial judge walks when asking questions of a witness is a narrow one ( R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 at 472B-C; see too Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 esp at 280-282 per Kirby ACJ). But the issue here really is whether a fair-minded person could reasonably have apprehended that his Honour's introduction and use of Ms Frank's evidence indicated that he was not being impartial.</text>

<text>56 I have anxiously given consideration as to whether it could be said that his Honour's conduct could have made no difference (see e.g. Goldsmith v Sandilands (2002) 190 ALR 370; [2002] HCA 31 ; Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at 444 [28]-[29]; [2003] HCA 60) but I have come to the conclusion the course his Honour took is so irregular that the breach of the rules of procedural fairness cannot be regarded as not possibly having affected the outcome. A different judicial officer may have taken a different view as to the appellant's credibility and that of Mr Xiao and if that had happened, the outcome may have been different.</text>

<text>43 Merkel J then referred to what the High Court had said in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145-146:
 
 'It is no easy task for a court of appeal to satisfy itself that what appears on its face would have been a denial of natural justice could have had no bearing on the outcome of the trial of an issue of fact.'

44 The University submitted that the objective evidence showed that Ms Frank's evidence was uncontroversial and therefore did not and could not affect the result of the proceedings. The appellant had conceded in cross-examination that she had not made in her very lengthy complaint to the University, to which Ms Frank's evidence related, any mention whatever of Mr Xiao (Transcript 6 April 2005 pp 44 line 25 45 line 5) and that the first time she had written to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in July 2002, the appellant had made no mention of a complaint involving Mr Xiao (Transcript 6 April 2005 pp 48 line 32 49 line 22).

45 Moreover, the appellant agreed that prior to her complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of 31 October 2002 she had made no complaint against Mr Xiao relating to being shown a photograph of a naked man and a naked woman in August or September 2001 (Transcript 6 April 2005 pp 52 line 25 53 line 14). Accordingly, it was submitted that the admission of the material of Ms Frank's affidavit did not, as a matter of substance, affect the outcome of the proceedings or create any substantive adverse consequence for the appellant in the proceedings.

46 As the High Court said in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145:
 
 'The general principle applicable in the present circumstances was well expressed by the English Court of Appeal (Denning, Romer and Parker LJJ) in Jones v National Coal Board ([1957] 2 QB 55 at p 67) , in these terms: 
 
 "There is one thing to which everyone in this country is entitled, and that is a fair trial at which he can put his case properly before the judge. ... No cause is lost until the judge has found it so; and he cannot find it without a fair trial, nor can we affirm it." 
 
 That general principle is, however, subject to an important qualification [...]: Would further information possibly have made any difference? That qualification is that an appellate court will not order a new trial if it would inevitably result in the making of the same order as that made by the primary judge at the first trial. An order for a new trial in such a case would be a futility.'

54 As Gaudron and Gummow JJ noted in Re Refugee Tribunal ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at 116-117 [80] - [81] it is sufficient that a denial of natural justice deprives the appellant of the possibility of a successful outcome (applying Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 147).

<text>22 The circumstances in which a judge may call a witness of his or her own motion, absent a statutory power, have been the subject of considerable judicial discussion (see JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed) at [17080]-[17100]).

<text>33 In Ebner v Official Trustee [2000] HCA 63 ; (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 344-345 [6] - [8] Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:
 
 'Where, in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge (or other judicial officer or juror), as here, the governing principle is that, subject to qualifications relating to waiver (which is not presently relevant) or necessity (which may be relevant to the second appeal), a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide (R v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39 ; (1976) 136 CLR 248; Re Lusink; Ex parte Shaw (1980) 55 ALJR 12; 32 ALR 47; Livesey v NSW Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288; Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342; Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568; Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41; Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48 ; (2000) 201 CLR 488). That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done (R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 at 259, per Lord Hewart CJ), a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial. It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle. 
 
 The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror) might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors actually influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror. 
 
 The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an "interest" in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.'

37 I have no hesitation in assuming that his Honour set out in his reasons for judgment fully, honestly and accurately all of what he took into account in coming to his decision to dismiss the appellant's complaint relating to Mr Xiao. Nor is it necessary or appropriate to inquire further into this question for the issue here is relevantly whether what occurred gave rise to the appearance of a possibility of an absence of an impartial mind on the part of his Honour as Callinan J explained in Antoun v The Queen [2006] HCA 2 ; (2006) 224 ALR 51 at 76-77 [81] - [83] , Haydon J agreeing at 78 [91]; see too per Gleeson CJ at 57 [22]. But what I, as a judge, or any lawyer for that matter, knows or assumes that a judicial officer referred to or took into account in deciding a matter when regard is had to the judicial officer's fulfillment of the duty to give reasons for judgment, is one thing. It is quite another thing for a fair-minded lay observer to be precluded from forming a reasonable apprehension that, in the present factual context, the judge might not have brought an impartial mind to the resolution of the dispute. As Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ said in Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 573:
 
 'An experienced lawyer would appreciate the ability of a trial judge to ensure that preconceived views do not cause the actual decision to be tainted by prejudgment or bias. The likelihood that the lay observer would not lies at the heart of the requirement of the appearance as well as the reality of impartial justice.'

38 I do not consider that any question of waiver of his Honour's conduct can be imputed to Ms Huang. She was not to know that what his Honour did was extraordinary. Nor did counsel for the University intervene to suggest that what his Honour proposed to do was inappropriate. In Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572 Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ held that waiver was the consequence of a legally represented party failing to object to judicial conduct reasonably capable of being regarded as conveying an apprehension of bias. Their Honours did not explore the position for an unrepresented party but in Preston v Carmody (1993) 44 FCR 1 at 14 Wilcox J referred to the principle they had identified and said:
 
 'But the principle to which their Honours referred is not limited to cases where the relevant party is legally represented. It was applied by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in relation to a litigant in person in Wentworth v Rogers (No 12) (1987) 9 NSWLR 400 at 421-422. Where a person is not legally represented or advised, it will always be necessary to consider whether he/she had the knowledge necessary to found waiver.

40 So much will depend on the facts of the particular case that further generalized discussion by me is not fruitful. In Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 571-572, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ considered how far a trial judge could express preconceived views about expert medical witnesses who frequently in the past had given evidence before him. They said (167 CLR at 571-572):
 
 'On the other hand, there is an ill-defined line beyond which the expression by a trial judge of preconceived views about the reliability of particular medical witnesses could threaten the appearance of impartial justice. In the passage in his judgment in [ Re Watson: Ex parte Armstrong [1976] HCA 39 ; (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 294] to which we have referred, Jacobs J pointed to the undoubted fact that "it is confidence in his own integrity which supports [a judge] not only in his judgment but in all his words and conduct". Knowledge of his or her own integrity can sometimes lead a judge to fail to appreciate that particular comments made in the course of a trial may wrongly convey to one or other of the parties to the litigation or to a lay observer an impression of bias. For example, the appearance of impartial justice could be compromised if the words or actions of a trial judge conveyed the impression that preconceived adverse views about a particular medical witness were influencing the judge's approach to the case to an extent that the judge was entering the arena to denigrate the witness or to oppose the witness' views or that the judge was biased against the party who had called that particular witness or that the judge was likely to be concerned, in the judgment actually deciding the case, to vindicate the preconceived adverse views about the witness by findings contrary to whatever views that witness might express.'

41 Again, this case is different because the material from Ms Frank which the trial judge used confirmed what already appeared to have been established.</text>

Dawson J affirmed that view in Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42 ; (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 684 where he said that Shaw v The Queen [1952] HCA 18 ; (1952) 85 CLR 365 had held that Titheradge v The Queen [1917] HCA 76 ; (1917) 24 CLR 107 was authority for the proposition that no distinction was to be drawn in Australia between criminal trials and civil actions with regard to the power of a judge to call a witness. However, Gibbs CJ and Brennan J, reserved their positions on this issue (152 CLR at 660). Gibbs CJ, Mason, Murphy, Wilson and Dawson JJ returned to the issue in R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38 ; (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575 saying of the conduct of criminal trials:
 
 'Save in the most exceptional circumstances, the trial judge should not himself call a person to give evidence.' 


 
That position appears to have been reaffirmed by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in R v Soma [2003] HCA 13 ; (2003) 212 CLR 299 at 309 [29] .</text>

<text>27 So, it is vital to guard against an absolute prohibition of a judge's power of calling witnesses because some circumstances in which courts exercise jurisdiction are not wholly adversarial. But the power, according to the authorities to which I have referred, exists to prevent, not occasion, a miscarriage of justice which the judge perceives would otherwise occur. Before forming such a view, over the opposition of the parties and, where appropriate, their legal representatives, a trial judge would obviously need to consider whether the conscious choice of the parties not to call the witness properly can be overborne by the court while preserving the appearance and actuality of judicial impartiality. For a judge to use his or her power to override the choice of the parties as to what evidence they will adduce in order that the judge may decide their dispute is a drastic step which must only be available even in civil proceedings '... in the most exceptional circumstances' ( R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR at 575 [5]). The exercise of such a power removes the court from its usual and necessary position outside, and places it within, the forensic arena (cp: Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20).

48 Their Lordships continued that Lord Greene MR had explained in Yuill v Yuill [1945] P 15 at 20: '... that justice is best done by a judge who holds the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations[.] If a judge, said Lord Greene, should himself conduct the examination of witnesses, "he, so to speak, descends into the arena and is liable to have his vision clouded by the dust of conflict".' That was, of course, said in the context in which a judge was not allowed to call witnesses (see Jones v National Coal Board [1957] 2 QB at 64). These considerations may not be entirely apposite for the Federal Magistrates Court if r 15.04 is a valid exercise of the rule-making power. Certainly, as noted above, there will be situations for example (and I do not intend to be exhaustive) in which that court is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction in which it may be necessary or desirable for the court to have information from witnesses, particularly in cases involving the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) where welfare of a child may be in issue and where the relevant parties before the court may each have interests which the court regards as not properly able fully to inform it of what might be in the overall best interests of the child.</text>
