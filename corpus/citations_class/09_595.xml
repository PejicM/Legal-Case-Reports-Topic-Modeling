<tocase>Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharma Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/59.html</AustLII>
<text>Wyeth criticised Dr Rowe's conclusions as no more than a routine literature search, falling short of establishing that what was shown by the documents to which he referred had entered the common general knowledge of those in Australia experienced in the practical working of formulating drugs for therapeutic use. See Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharma Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 59 ; (2002) 212 CLR 411 at [45] and [57].

It is true that Dr Rowe does not, in his several reports, use the words of s 7(2) of the Act "common general knowledge as it existed" in Australia. Nevertheless, on a fair reading of his reports, he does in my view do more than list the matters that he thought could be derived from the publications to which he referred. Dr Rowe first identified the relevant skilled person. He said that during his time at Abbott Laboratories in Sydney in the late 1980s working on new pharmaceutical formulations, he headed a team of six people comprising three analytical chemists and three formulation chemists, as well as several technicians. At the time he had a PhD, and the chemists in the team all had chemistry or pharmacy degrees and between two and fifteen years experience. He said that was the team he considered to be a typical team involved in pharmaceutical formulation, including sustained release formulation, in Australia at the priority date. He went on to say that where in his affidavit he referred to a skilled person, he was referring to what he would have done and what he believed, on the basis of his experiences, other persons with similar experience would be likely to have done at the priority date. Thus, for example, when he later referred (at par 40 of his affidavit) to standard textbooks which he owned "and which would have been routinely referred to by the Skilled Person at the Priority Date", he is to be taken as saying that a team such as the Abbott Laboratories group would have routinely referred to those texts. Throughout his main report (his affidavit) he uses variants of this formulation. Accordingly, when in examining the integers of the various claims, Dr Rowe says that the claims do not "provide anything that is new or surprising or an advance over what was well known and understood by the Skilled Person as at the Priority Date", and that they provide results of routine trial and error testing (at par 78), his opinion is to be understood in the manner I have described.

Aspects of Dr Rowe's evidence were challenged (briefly, "given time constraints") by Professor Charman. See pars 161 to 163 of his affidavit of 19 May 2009. It is not possible on an application such as this to come to a conclusion as to which expert's opinion is preferable. That is a matter for close examination at trial. Even taking into account Professor Charman's criticisms, I remain of the view that Dr Rowe's evidence, understood as I have explained it, raises a prima facie case of invalidity for want of an inventive step.

<tocase>Appleton Papers Inc v Tomasetti Paper Pty Ltd (1983) 3 NSWLR 208</tocase>
<text>I do not agree that damages will be adequate compensation for Wyeth simply because it will be able to recover lost royalties in reliance on the undertaking, or that potential loss to Wyeth Australia is irrelevant. Similar arguments were rejected by McLelland J in Appleton Papers Inc v Tomasetti Paper Pty Ltd (1983) 3 NSWLR 208 ( Appleton ) at 219: 
 The defendant points out that in substance the plaintiff uses its patent to license the manufacture of paper by others and receives a once-only royalty upon manufacture. It is submitted that if an account of sales by the defendant is kept the damage suffered by the plaintiff is precisely quantifiable. It is also submitted that a distinction should be drawn between the plaintiff and other members of the group in which the plaintiff operates and that it is only the position of the plaintiff that matters. It is submitted that loss of sales or loss of market position by parties further down the distribution chain (whether or not connected with the plaintiff) do not bear upon the balance of convenience between the parties to this litigation. I am unable to accept that potential losses to others with whom the plaintiff is in a relevant commercial relationship dependent upon the validity of the patent, and its effectiveness in conferring a monopoly, are irrelevant to the question of the granting of interlocutory relief. The ability of a party to effectively prevent infringements of its patents must necessarily affect the value of those patents and its commercial standing vis-&agrave;-vis others with whom it deals in relation to those patents, and this is not a matter to be ignored, particularly as this kind of injury does not lend itself to ready calculation in monetary terms.

The present case is stronger than Appleton because Wyeth is Wyeth Australia's ultimate holding company. Loss to Wyeth Australia thus feeds through directly to Wyeth itself.

It is likely that Wyeth Australia (and thus Wyeth) will suffer a loss of market share from Sigma's possible acquisition of up to 50% of the market for venlafaxine products at the expense of Efexor-XR. It was common ground that unlike originator companies that market to medical practitioners, generic companies market direct to pharmacies. Ms Braithwaite, Wyeth Australia's Pharmaceutical Business Director, said that in view of the size of Sigma's sales force and the presence it has at the pharmacy level, which is where the decision and incentive to substitute a generic product for Efexor-XR lies, Sigma's product has the ability to quickly take market share from Efexor-XR, "with consequent considerable and irreparable damage to Wyeth's business".

In addition Wyeth Australia is likely to be forced to reduce the price at which it sells Efexor-XR due to discounting by Sigma.

The balance of convenience favours the grant of relief. At best Sigma's trade in Evelexa-XR has just commenced. It launched its product on 1 May 2009, the same day on which Wyeth commenced its cross claim. Sigma has commenced taking orders on the basis that the product will be delivered to pharmacies for sale by 1 June 2009. However there is no evidence that any supply contract has been entered into. On the other hand Wyeth has an established trade. It is much more likely to suffer from a disturbance of the status quo than is Sigma. The relevance of this comparison between a new entrant and an established participant in a market is shown by cases such as Appleton (1983) 3 NSWLR at 219 and Pharmacia Italia SpA v Interpharma Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 397 ( Pharmacia Italia ) at [52].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The general principles to be applied are: 
(a) whether there is a serious question to be tried, or Wyeth has made out a prima facie case in the sense that, if the evidence remains the same, there is a probability that at trial it will be entitled to relief;
 
(b) whether Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm, for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, unless an injunction is granted; and
 
(c) whether the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.

<tocase>B Braun Melsungen AG v Terumo Corporation (2004) 61 IPR 71</tocase>
<text>Even if one looks solely to Wyeth's own potential loss, as Sigma contends one should, its undertaking does not adequately protect Wyeth. The probable scenario, if no injunction is granted, is that other generic companies will enter the market. In 2007 and 2008 there were five applications for ARTG registration of products containing venlafaxine. In March 2009 Alphapharm Pty Ltd obtained registration for a venlafaxine product called Enlafax-XR. I accept Wyeth's submission that if Sigma is not restrained, other generic suppliers are unlikely to be restrained, and will enter the market. Once a post-Sigma entity does so, quantification of Wyeth's loss will become impossible. See B Braun Melsungen AG v Terumo Corporation (2004) 61 IPR 71 ( Braun ) at [29]. Sigma's royalty solution depends on a loss of sales of Efexor-XR translating directly into sales of Evelexa-XR.

Further, detriment suffered by Wyeth Australia because of Sigma's discounting will not be covered by the undertaking, which is limited to lost sales. It does not cover retained, though discounted, sales.

Wyeth's feared loss or damage is summarised at [51] to [58]. Sigma's feared loss is of a different order. It has just entered the market. It has reached that position with its eyes open to the risk. It has incurred setting up and preparation costs well aware of the risk they may be wasted. The evidence is that Sigma has a portfolio of more than 170 products with others planned for launch during 2009 and 2010. Ms Braithwaite's evidence was that Sigma's projected turnover in sales of Evelexa-XR would amount to approximately 0.4% of its total company turnover. In some respects Mr de Alwis' evidence of loss seems exaggerated, such as his claims that Evelexa-XR was to be the jewel in Sigma's crown, that an interlocutory restraint may lead to a decrease in Sigma's share price, and that pharmacists might assume that an injunction reflected adversely on the quality of the product. On this last point, Sigma's own marketing to pharmacists refers to the existence of this patent proceeding and to its undertaking not to list on the PBS until the case is resolved. See also Braun 61 IPR 71 at [30].

As indicated at [56], it is likely that other generic companies will seek to establish their products in the market in competition with Efexor-XR. Ms Braithwaite says that this will lead to intense competition between generic companies. I refer to what I have said at [56] about:

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief.</text>

<tocase>Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd (1968) 118 CLR 619</tocase>
<text>After discovering the Patent on 6 March 2009 Sigma persisted with its commercial preparations for a launch of its product. In very similar circumstances to those here present, the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd (1968) 118 CLR 619 ( Beecham ) dealing with balance of convenience, said at 626: 
 The facts which appear to us to be decisive on this question may be stated quite briefly. In April 1967, after the plaintiff had been building up in Australia a substantial business in ampicillin over a period of several years, the defendant announced its intention of marketing hetacillin in Australia. The plaintiff on 10th May 1967 warned the defendant that if it began to do so proceedings for infringement of the patents would be taken. It was in the face of this warning that the defendant commenced the acts now complained of, and the action was thereafter instituted without delay. Any goodwill the defendant may since have built up for hetacillin would of course be destroyed or damaged by granting an injunction, but that was a risk the defendant took with its eyes open . If it be not restrained, it will presumably take advantage of the time before the hearing to subject the goodwill of the plaintiff's established trade in ampicillin to the prejudice of competition from a product which the defendant maintains has some points of superiority. In no meaningful sense could matters be said to be kept in statu quo if in these circumstances the defendant were left free to pursue its course, merely keeping an account of the profits it makes .

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1485.html</AustLII>
<text>Special considerations apply where, as here, the party seeking interlocutory relief alleges infringement and the other party alleges invalidity. As to this, in Interpharma 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said: 
 In such a situation, it will not be enough to ask whether the applicant has shown a serious question, or a probability of success, on his or her own case. While the answer to that question may be in the affirmative, it will then be necessary to consider whether that answer should be qualified by the apparent strength of the defence. In a patent case, the fact of registration constitutes prima facie evidence of validity: AB Hassle v Pharmacia (Aust) Pty Ltd (1995) 33 IPR 63 at 69-70 ( AB Hassle ); GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 ... at [2]-[6] ... It has been said that it is for the respondent to show that want of validity is a triable question: AB Hassle at 69. This seems clear enough, but, in my opinion, the analysis needs to be taken a step further. Is it sufficient that the respondent does show a triable question on validity? In my view, if that is as far as the respondent goes, then, assuming always that the applicant has shown a triable issue on infringement, absent questions of validity, the conclusion would remain that the latter had a triable question. That is to say, as a matter of analysis, unless the case for invalidity is sufficiently strong (at the provisional level) to qualify the conclusion that, overall, the applicant has a serious question, or a probability of success, the court should move to consider the adequacy of damages, the balance of convenience and other discretionary matters. It is the applicant's title to interlocutory relief which is under consideration, and the bottom-line question, as it were, is whether the applicant has a serious question, or a probability of success, not whether the respondent does in relation to some point of defence raised or foreshadowed.

The purpose of an interlocutory injunction is to preserve the status quo pending trial. What was said by Gyles J in GenRx Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis [2007] FCA 1485 ; (2007) 73 IPR 502 at [15] is applicable here. A new entrant into the market would have an effect which may be both unpredictable and irreversible. Once Sigma is in the market, it is likely that other generic manufacturers will also come in. I doubt whether, if Sigma is not restrained and Wyeth succeeds at trial, Wyeth will ever be able to resume the position it now occupies. Cf Interpharma 79 IPR 261 at [71]. In my view it is likely that Wyeth will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not adequately compensate it, unless an injunction is granted.</text>

<text>Factors (a) and (c) are related in this sense, that whether there is a serious question or a prima facie case should not be considered in isolation from the balance of convenience. The apparent strength of the parties' substantive cases will often be an important consideration to be weighed in the balance: Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 at [416]; Interpharma Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents (2008) 79 IPR 261 ( Interpharma ) at [16].

Special considerations apply where, as here, the party seeking interlocutory relief alleges infringement and the other party alleges invalidity. As to this, in Interpharma 79 IPR 261 at [17] Jessup J said:

<tocase>Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/58.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 40(3) of the Act provides that the claims defining the invention must be fairly based on the matter described in the specification. This requires that there be a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed so that the alleged invention as claimed is broadly described in the body of the specification: Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 ( Lockwood ) at [69]. A lack of fair basis is a ground of invalidity independent and distinct from the others and its determination is a matter of construction for the court: Lockwood at [46]-[48].

Sigma contends that for fair basis purposes it is appropriate to consider the body of the specification prior to its amendment, because any claim supported by material added by the amendment will, because of s 114(1) of the Act, have a later priority date and therefore lack novelty. On this basis Sigma asserts that claims 1 to 17 and 27 are not fairly based on the matter described in the specification insofar as any of them claim the use of a formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride which does not consist of a spheroid core containing microcrystalline cellulose and HPMC together with venlafaxine coated with an ethyl cellulose and HPMC mixture.

For the reasons set out at [21] to [26] I do not accept that fair basis is to be determined by reference to the specification prior to its amendment.

In Lockwood 217 CLR at [68]-[69] the High Court said: 
 Erroneous principles . The comparison which s 40(3) calls for is not analogous to that between a claim and an alleged anticipation or infringement. It is wrong to employ "an over meticulous verbal analysis" ... It is wrong to seek to isolate in the body of the specification "essential integer" or "essential feature" of an alleged invention and to ask whether they correspond with the essential integers of the claim in question ...
 " Real and reasonably clear disclosure ". Section 40(3) requires, in Fullagar J's words, "a real and reasonably clear disclosure"... But those words, when used in connection with s 40(3) , do not limit disclosures to preferred embodiments.

As was said in Lockwood 217 CLR at [69], the words "real and reasonably clear disclosure" do not limit disclosures to preferred embodiments, or I would add examples. The spheroid core example is just that. Sigma's contention cannot be accepted when the specification is read as a whole. The invention is not limited to the example. It relates to a method of treating patients using a single daily dosing formulation of venlafaxine hydrochloride that provides a peak blood plasma concentration of venlafaxine within a defined period or at a defined level.

Under the heading "Brief Description of the Invention" there are consistory style statements, three of which are set out at [10] and [12], that reflect various embodiments of the invention. These provide a description of the invention later claimed. See in particular claims 4 and 9. Nothing in the body of the specification suggests that the description of the invention it contains is wider than the invention claimed. The spheroid example is an example of one embodiment later reflected in a claim upon which Wyeth does not presently rely. See page 4B, lines 17 to 34, page 4C, line 1 and claims 18 and 19. The examples given at page 5 of the specification all deal with coated spheroids and are examples of the formulations referred to at page 4D, lines 5 to 16.

For the foregoing reasons, I do not consider Sigma has a prima facie case for invalidity on fair basis. Novelty</text>

<text>The Court then approved the following passage from Rehm Pty Ltd v Websters Security Systems (International) Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 79 at 95 (Gummow J): 
 The circumstance that something is a requirement for the best method of performing an invention does not make it necessarily a requirement for all claims; likewise, the circumstance that material is part of the description of the invention does not mean that it must be included as an integer of each claim. Rather, the question is whether there is a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the body of the specification of what is then claimed, so that the alleged invention as claimed is broadly, that is to say in a general sense, described in the body of the specification.

The High Court then said (at [69]): 
 Fullagar J's phrase serves the function of compelling attention to the construction of the specification as a whole, putting aside particular parts which, although in isolation they might appear to point against the "real" disclosure, are in truth only loose or stray remarks.</text>
