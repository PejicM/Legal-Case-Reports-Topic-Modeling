<text>13 In those circumstances, for the reasons given in VUAV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1271 at [10] to [13] and NBCM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1150 at [13] , the "Statement Claim" and the information therein fell within s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. I note that an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court in VUAV was refused on 12 April 2006 ( VUAV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA Trans 183). Gummow J specifically said on that occasion that ' no error is apparent in Merkel J's decision upon the applicability of section 424A '. On that basis special leave was refused.</text>
