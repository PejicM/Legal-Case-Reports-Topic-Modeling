<text>22 It is common practice in this Court, as has already been pointed out, for Counsel to orally address the Court by way of closing submissions at the conclusion of evidence, after which some judges require written submissions. Although it is true that the respondents have already filed their written submissions in accordance with my directions, and that I have had the opportunity to read them, any potential disadvantage or unfairness to the applicants from the fact that I have not read their submissions in advance (which is due to the failure of the applicants to file either submissions or a written outline) can be offset by a detailed and comprehensive oral address by their Counsel today, and by the subsequent filing of written submissions. In this way, in my view, justice can be done to the applicant in line with comments of the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146. Where I do agree with Mr Perry is in relation to the importance of hearing submissions from the applicants in this case. It is their case, and their case which they have to prove.

23 In the circumstances, notwithstanding their breach of my orders in relation to written submissions, and the concession by Mr Perry that the applicants have even now not completed written submissions (despite having had almost three weeks to do so), I am prepared in the interests of justice to grant leave to the applicants to file and serve written submissions by 9.30 am tomorrow 6 June 2007.

24 I also grant leave to the respondents to file and serve any written submissions in reply by 4.00 pm 13 June 2007.</text>
