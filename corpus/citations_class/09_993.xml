<tocase>Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCAFC 112</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/112.html</AustLII>
<text>On 31 August 2009 I made orders that the time within which the appellant may file and serve a notice of appeal be extended to 2 April 2009 and that the appeal be allowed. I said there should be no order as to costs. The orders were later varied so as to cure an oversight, by adding an order setting aside the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court and in lieu thereof ordering that the application to that Court be dismissed and that the applicants pay the Minister's costs of the application. Those orders were made in exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ss 25(1AA)(a) and (2)(b). After the pronouncement of the initial orders counsel for the respondents applied for a stay. Not having had the opportunity to read my reasons for making those orders, counsel was unable at the time to formulate the grounds on which he relied for the stay. On my instructions, my associate advised the parties that I would determine the application on the papers. The respondents have now made written submissions in support of a stay pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. They rely on Order 37 rule 10 of the Court's Rules as the source of power to grant the stay. See Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCAFC 112 ( Siminton ). The appellant has not filed submissions and neither consents to nor opposes the grant of a stay.

The respondents accept that the applicable principles are those stated in Jennings Construction Ltd v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd (No 1) [1986] HCA 84 ; (1986) 161 CLR 681 at 685 and Siminton at [7].
