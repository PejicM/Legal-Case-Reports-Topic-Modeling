<text>This is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from a decision of Emmett FM, who had dismissed an application for relief in relation to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision not to grant a protection visa to the present applicant ( SZGSR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 882).

The first matter to be dealt with is the explanation for delay in appealing. The explanation which is given is that the applicant had lost a key to a post box and thus did not receive the copy of the reasons for judgment, although he had been present when judgment was handed down. That is hardly a satisfactory explanation for delay.

The second issue is whether or not there is, in any event, an arguable ground of appeal. The only ground in the draft notice of appeal is that the applicant claims he was deprived of receiving procedural fairness as the Tribunal was influenced by the contradictory information and that the 'Honourable trial judge erred in considering this issue'. That, of course, isolates no ground in any real sense. In what he has said to me today, the only matter of substance that he puts forward is that the learned federal magistrate did not accept the facts as he presented them in relation to his claims which were rejected by the Tribunal.</text>
