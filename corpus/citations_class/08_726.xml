<text>1 This is an appeal from orders made by Scarlett FM on 17 September 2007 dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT"): see SZHFX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1575. On 10 August 2005 the RRT had affirmed a decision by a delegate of the then Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refusing the appellants a protection visa.

2 The appellants, a mother and her three sons, are Bangladeshi citizens. The second appellant made independent claims for protection, although they were based on the same facts as those relied upon by his mother. The third and fourth appellants made no independent protection claims. They relied solely instead upon the claims made by their mother.

3 The appellants arrived in Australia on 30 July 2004. Within a month, they applied for protection visas. On 20 October 2004 the Minister's delegate refused their application.</text>

<text>35 The Minister referred to the recent decision of the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 in support of that conclusion. In that case, the Court held that s 424A was not engaged in circumstances where there was a discrepancy between what the appellant had said in a statutory declaration and his evidence given orally before the RRT. That was because the relevant parts of the statutory declaration were not "information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".

37 The Minister submitted that, as a result of SZBYR, the scope formerly given to the term "information" in s 424A had narrowed. Moreover, by expressly approving the reasoning in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 , the High Court made it clear that disbelief of a claimant's evidence arising from inconsistencies therein could hardly be characterised as constituting "information". In the words of their Honours in VAF (at 477), the word "information":
 
 "... does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc ..."

38 The Minister submitted, by reference to SZBYR, that the Federal Magistrate did not err in finding that the "independent reports" to which the RRT referred were not part of its reasons for decision.

39 The Minister submitted that if contrary to its primary submission, the independent reports did form part of the RRT's reasons for decision, the substance of what was contained in those reports was in fact provided to the appellants by the RRT in its s 424A letter.

40 In my opinion, the RRT's finding that the behaviour, which the first appellant attributed to Jahangir in her claims and which bore no resemblance to the "cunning and ruthless" behaviour ascribed to him in independent reports, was not "information" of a kind that had to be provided in writing pursuant to s 424A(1). The reference to "independent reports", in context, was not intended to suggest that Jahangir's reputation for being "cunning and ruthless" came solely from those reports. Indeed, a fair reading of the material before the RRT in its entirety suggests quite the reverse.</text>

<text>36 In a joint judgment, five members of the Court stated at [15]-[19]:
 
 "This then requires close attention to the circumstances in which s 424A is engaged. Section 424A does not require notice to be given of every matter the tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review. Rather, the tribunal's obligation is limited to the written provision of 'particulars of any information that the tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review'. What, then, was the 'information' that the appellants say the tribunal should have provided? In their written submissions, the appellants appeared to focus on the requisite 'information' as being the 'inconsistencies' between their statutory declaration and oral evidence. However, in oral argument they focused on the provision of the relevant passages in the statutory declaration itself, from which the inconsistencies were later said to arise. 
 
 Four points must be noted about this submission. First, while questions might remain about the scope of para (b) of s 424A(3) , it was accepted by both sides that information 'that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application' did not refer back to the application for the protection visa itself, and thus did not encompass the appellants' statutory declaration. In this regard, the parties were content to assume the correctness of the Full Federal Court decisions in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry and SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs . Accordingly, no occasion now arises for this court to determine whether that assumption was correct. 
 
 Secondly, the appellants assumed, but did not demonstrate, that the statutory declaration 'would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review'. The statutory criterion does not, for example, turn on 'the reasoning process of the tribunal', or 'the tribunal's published reasons'. The reason for affirming the decision that is under review is a matter that depends upon the criteria for the making of that decision in the first place. The tribunal does not operate in a statutory vacuum, and its role is dependent upon the making of administrative decisions upon criteria to be found elsewhere in the Act. The use of the future conditional tense (would be) rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance -- and independently -- of the tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case. Here, the appropriate criterion was to be found in s 36(1) of the Act, being the provision under which the appellants sought their protection visa. The 'reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review' was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light, it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellants' statutory declaration would itself be "information that the tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellants' claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations. Indeed, if their contents were believed, they would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review. 
 
 Thirdly and conversely, if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting 'information' within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute 'information'. Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word 'information': 
 
 
 
 ... does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc ... 
 
 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly 'information' be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself. 
 
 Fourthly, and regardless of the matters discussed above, the appellants' argument suggested that s 424A was engaged by any material that contained or tended to reveal inconsistencies in an applicant's evidence. Such an argument gives s 424A an anomalous temporal operation. While the Act provides for procedures to be followed regarding the issue of a notice pursuant to s 424A before a hearing, no such procedure exists for the invocation of that section after a hearing. However, if the appellants be correct, it was only after the hearing that the tribunal could have provided any written notice of the relevant passages in the statutory declaration from which the inconsistencies were said to arise, as those inconsistencies could not have arisen unless and until the appellants gave oral evidence. If the purpose of s 424A was to secure a fair hearing of the appellants' case, it seems odd that its effect would be to preclude the tribunal from dealing with such matters during the hearing itself."

Moreover, by expressly approving the reasoning in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 ; (2004) 206 ALR 471 , the High Court made it clear that disbelief of a claimant's evidence arising from inconsistencies therein could hardly be characterised as constituting "information".

<text>56 Finally, there is a wholly independent basis for the RRT's decision. See generally VBAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) FCA 965 at [32] - [33] . The RRT found that any threats made by Jahangir were in the nature of criminal acts unrelated to any political motivation. That finding does not turn upon questions of credibility and would inevitably lead to the rejection of the appellants' claim. There is nothing to controvert such a finding, which was open on the material before the RRT. That being so, the appeal must in any event fail.
