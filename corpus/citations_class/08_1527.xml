<text>18 It is convenient to deal first with Apache's jurisdictional objection. It is not in dispute that, in the absence of the claims which are founded on the TPA, Newcrest could not pursue a case based on allegations of breach of contract in this Court. Nor is it in dispute that the Court will lack jurisdiction to deal with a controversy in circumstances in which the only federal claims relied are either colourable (in the sense of not being bona fide but rather relied on solely to attract the Court's jurisdiction) or trivial or insubstantial. In WG &amp; B Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Tesla Farad Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1776 Finkelstein J stated the relevant principles (at [11] to [14]) as follows:
 "[11] This then requires me to determine whether the non-federal claims are justiciable in the Federal Court. The relevant cases show that if a federal claim which is said to enliven the accrued jurisdiction of the court to dispose of non-federal claims is trivial or unsubstantial, that will not be sufficient to attract that jurisdiction. The cases are collected in the judgment of Merkel J in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 165. As Merkel J pointed out, triviality in this context does not require an examination as to whether the federal claim is less likely to succeed than the non-federal claim. Accrued jurisdiction does not depend upon an assessment being made of the strengths of the federal claim; rather the question is whether the federal claim is genuine. If the federal claim is colourable in the sense that it was made for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, of course the jurisdiction of the court is not enlivened: see Fitzroy Motors Pty Ltd v Hyundai Automotive Distributors Australia Pty Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 445. How is the genuineness of the claim to be determined? One way is to ask whether the federal claim is bound to fail, that is to say, to ask whether the claim is unarguable. If the federal claim is hopeless then it is difficult to see how an applicant could contend that it was pursuing the claim bona fide. [12] However, it is not only when a federal claim is colourable that the Federal Court would lack jurisdiction to deal with non-federal matters. In Fencott v Muller (at 609-610) in a joint judgment of Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ, the following was said: 
 
 "However, federal judicial power is attracted to the whole of a controversy only if the federal claim is a substantial aspect of that controversy. A federal claim which is a trivial or insubstantial aspect of the controversy must, of course, itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction, but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to translate to federal jurisdiction the determination of the substantial aspects of the controversy from the jurisdiction to which they are subject in order to determine the trivial or insubstantial federal aspect. Again, impression and practical judgment must determine whether it is appropriate and convenient that the whole controversy be determined by the exercise of federal judicial power." 
 
 [13] In the present case, on balance I am not prepared to conclude that the asserted federal claims are not genuine in the sense that they are colourable and only brought for the purpose of fabricating jurisdiction, but what does seem plain to me is that the cause of action under s52 of the Trade Practices Act is "trivial or insubstantial" in the sense explained by the High Court in Fencott v Muller. This is not a claim that would be appropriately and conveniently determined in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. [14] In the result two things follow. First, the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the non-federal claims. Second, there being no other claims that are relied upon to found jurisdiction in the Federal Court, the proceeding must be dismissed with costs."

19 Newcrest alleges that the respondents expressed opinions and made forecasts without having reasonable grounds to do so. It relies on ss 51A and 52 of the TPA. The particular opinions and forecasts are said to be found in the following documents:
 
&#8226; The late June 2008 press release;
 
&#8226; The 30 July 2008 letter from Apache; and
 
&#8226; The 2 August 2008 letter from Santos.

20 It is said that those documents contain representations that, by mid-August, the respondents would be supplying Newcrest with its full gas entitlement under the contract. Newcrest says that, acting on these representations, it cancelled some temporary arrangements and then was forced to make further alternative arrangements when, in mid-August, full supply had not been restored. This led to Newcrest incurring substantial losses.</text>

<text>31 In St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at 153-154 Hely J summarized a series of propositions which he derived from cases which had considered the construction of O 15A r 6. Those propositions were:
 
 
 "(a) the rule is to be beneficially construed, given the fullest scope that its language would reasonably allow, with the proper brake on excesses lying in the discretion of the Court, exercised in the particular circumstances of each case ..;
 
 (b) each of the elements prescribed in subparas (a), (b) and (c) of the rule must be established ... Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves ...;
 
 (c) the test for determining whether the applicant has "reasonable cause to believe", as required by subpara (a), is an objective one ... The applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case ...;
 
 (d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action ...;
 
 (e) while uncertainty as to only one element of a cause of action might be compatible with the "reasonable cause to believe" required by subpara (a), uncertainty as to a number of such elements may be sufficient to undermine the reasonableness of the cause to believe ...;
 
 (f) the question posed by subpara (b) of the rule is not whether the applicant has sufficient information to decide if a cause of action is available against the prospective respondent. The question is whether the applicant has sufficient information to make a decision whether to commence proceedings in the court ... Accordingly, an applicant for preliminary discovery may be entitled to discovery in order to determine what defences are available to the respondent and the possible strength of those defendants, or to determine the extent of the respondent's breach and the likely quantum of any damages award ...;
 
 (g) whether an applicant has "sufficient information" for the purposes of subpara (b) also requires an objective assessment to be made ... The subparagraph contemplates that the applicant is lacking a piece (or pieces) of information reasonably necessary to decide whether to commence proceedings;
 
 (h) it is no answer to an application under the rule to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a "fishing expedition" ... Indeed order 15A r 6 "expressly contemplates" what once might have been castigated as "fishing" ..."

<tocase>Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC [2008] FCAFC 58</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/58.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In Echo Tasmania Pty Ltd v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC [2008] FCAFC 58 at [43] Black CJ and Sackville J held that Hely J had "correctly summarised" the principles governing the proper construction of O 15A r 6 insofar as his summary dealt with O 15A r 6(a).

33 In his affidavit Mr Brown seeks to establish that each of the conditions, imposed by O 15A r 6, has been met. He deposes that Newcrest believes that it has or may have a right to obtain relief against the respondents on the basis that it believes that the respondents have breached a contractual obligation to provide Newcrest with its fair pro-rated share of gas produced from the Brookes field and that the respondents have made statements which may constitute misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TPA and/or s 10 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA). He says that the attempts made by Newcrest to obtain relevant information have proved fruitless and that he believes that the respondents have or are likely to have relevant documents in their possession.

34 For reasons already given in dealing with Apache's argument relating to jurisdiction, I consider that there is reasonable cause to believe that Newcrest may have a right to obtain relief under the TPA. The evidence suggests that each element of a cause of action under s 52 of the TPA may be present. Moreover, Apache did not seriously contest Newcrest's contention that it had, in addition, a viable cause of action for breach of its supply contract with Apache.</text>
