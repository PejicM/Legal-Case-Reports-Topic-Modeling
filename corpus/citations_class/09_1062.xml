<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434</tocase>
<text>Otherwise, to the extent that the appellant raises an alleged contravention of s 424 of the Act by reason of a failure to comply with s 424(2) , that matter has now been resolved by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434. Section 424(2) does not limit the ability of the Tribunal to get information that it considers relevant by reason of s 424(1). In any event, even if s 424(2) applied, the request to the Department to provide information did comply with s 441A of the Act, as did the two s 424A letters sent to the appellant. Conclusion

It follows that the appellant has not established any basis for, or merit in, any of the grounds of appeal in the notice of appeal or the additional grounds sought to be relied on in the written submissions. Leave to rely upon grounds not raised before the Federal Magistrate is refused. The appellant has not demonstrated any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal or any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

<text>Federal Magistrate Scarlett also discussed a possible breach of s 424B(2) of the Act with respect to the letter sent to the Department requesting documents relating to the appellant's previous application for a visa. His Honour referred to SZLWQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1406 ; (2008) 172 FCR 452 , where Buchanan J concluded that s 424B(2) does not establish an obligation on the Tribunal which could lead either to statutory breach or to jurisdictional error. Notice of appeal

The grounds of appeal in the notice of appeal are in summary: 
(1) That the Federal Magistrate failed to find that the Tribunal decision was "unjust" and did not take into account the "full gravity of circumstance and consequence of the claims";
 
(2) That the Tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by concluding that he was not a credible witness when such a conclusion was not open on the evidence; and
 
(3) That the Tribunal failed to consider "all the materials readily available and/or accessible".

The grounds of appeal are unparticularised. Ground 1 of the notice of appeal</text>

<tocase>SZMTQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FMCA 29</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/29.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant is a citizen of India who arrived in Australia on 15 February 2008. He lodged an application for a protection visa which was refused by a delegate of the Minister. He applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision, which the Tribunal affirmed. He appealed to the Federal Magistrates Court, which dismissed his application to review the decision of the Tribunal ( SZMTQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2009] FMCA 29).

The appellant claimed to fear persecution in India due to his political opinion. He said that he joined the National Students Union of India in 1991 and later became an influential member of the Congress Party (CP). He further claimed that he was a recognised local astrologer and that this, coupled with his political work, resulted in overtures from members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asking that he change party allegiances. The appellant claimed that the BJP believed that he possessed a " karishma" (miraculous power) which could " change the political scenario ". He said that if he did not join the BJP, its supporters would kill him and his family.

Before the Tribunal the appellant raised a further claim relating to his operation of a computer business. He alleged that police had used his email address and internet connection to make enquiries about holders of certain mobile phone numbers and that these enquiries resulted in the arrest of several acquaintances of a Mr Singh, who himself was allegedly a " professional killer ". The appellant claimed that he was blamed for these arrests and that Mr Singh continued to pursue him.</text>
