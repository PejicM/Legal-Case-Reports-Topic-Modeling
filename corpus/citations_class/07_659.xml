<tocase>Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/30.html</AustLII>
<text>25 On 18 January 2007 the applicant filed a purported Notice of Appeal outlining three grounds of appeal:
 
 
 '2. The Single Judge of the Federal Magistrates Court in his Honors judgment delivered on the 21 December 2006 failed to find error of law, jurisdictional error procedural fairness and relief under section 39B of the judiciary Act. 1903. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The grounds and relief is very much similar with a recent High Court judgement Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal; Lie v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 (8 August 2002) 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. Recent High Court judgement ; Plintiff S 157/2002 Commonwealth of Australia [2-3] HCA 1 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. Recent Federal Court of Australia judgement: AGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I will provide more ground after received the judgement.' 
 
 
 
 (Transcribed from the original without alteration)

26 On 30 January the solicitor for the first respondent filed a Notice of Objection of Competency of the Appeal on the ground that the judgment of the Federal Magistrate dated 21 December 2006 is interlocutory and the applicant has not been granted leave to appeal against this judgment pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .

27 At the hearing of the appeal before me the applicant who was assisted by an interpreter elected not to make oral submissions. The first respondent relied upon its filed written submissions.

32 The applicant's second proposed ground points to the decision of Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601. I have considered this case which concerns amongst other things the issue of jurisdictional error arising from a denial of procedural fairness and natural justice where there was an alleged failure to provide an applicant seeking a review of a decision to refuse the grant of a protection visa with an opportunity to respond to adverse material. Its disposition so far as factually based turned on the particular facts of the case. The Federal Magistrate, correctly, in my opinion, upon a consideration of all the material, concluded that there was no denial of procedural fairness. Muin provides no assistance to alter that finding and accordingly no arguable ground of appeal arises.</text>

<text>33 The applicant's third proposed ground points to another case: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. Once again I have considered this case. It concerns matters of the statutory construction and constitutionality of certain provisions of the Act . It provides no assistance to the applicant that is apparent on the papers before me. No arguable ground of appeal arises.</text>

<tocase>SGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous [2004] FCAFC 59</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/59.html</AustLII>
<text>34 The fourth proposed ground refers to AGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs . I take this to be a mistaken reference to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SGDB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 59 , which was an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court. In that case the applicant succeeded on the one ground that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error by failing to consider, in respect to the issue of whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, the risks which he, an Afghan citizen, together with his wife and family, might face should he return to Afghanistan, when travelling from Kabul through other ethnic tribal areas in order to reach their home. [23]-[27] It provides no assistance to the applicant in this case. No arguable ground of appeal arises.

35 Scarlett FM was correct to dismiss the application before him.

36 Accordingly, the applicant has failed to satisfy me that the decision below is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant a grant of leave. For these reasons, the application for leave to appeal ought to be dismissed with costs which I have fixed at $1,200. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.

<text>28 Where an applicant does not raise any arguable ground of appeal or if the judgment below is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant allowing an appeal proceeding, then leave to appeal ought not be granted: SZDGN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1543 at [11] .

29 The "Notice of Appeal" raises a number of "grounds", none of which articulates a comprehensible challenge going to jurisdictional error. No particular findings are challenged. Three authorities are, in effect, said to expose the grounds. No further grounds have been added despite this being foreshadowed. Furthermore, no written submissions have been filed by the applicant.

30 The Court ought not be required, and, in my opinion, has no relevant duty to trawl through authorities cited by a party as in themselves constituting, in effect, both the grounds and particulars of its proposed appeal. Nonetheless I have carefully considered the authorities set out in the purported Notice of Appeal because the applicant is unrepresented and does not speak English.</text>
