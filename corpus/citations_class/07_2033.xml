<text>12 I have concluded that it is appropriate to impose the proposed penalties. In doing so I have had regard to the following matters: 
 
 &#8226; Although there were multiple contraventions by the respondents of the relevant sections of the Act , those contraventions formed part of a single course of conduct which was intended to persuade each of the nine employees to become a party to an AWA.
 &#8226; The monetary penalties imposed distinguish between the contraventions of s 401(1) of the Act on the one hand and the contraventions of ss 337(8) and 337 (9) on the other having regard to the higher maximum penalty applicable for contraventions of s 401(1) and the fact that the contravention of s 401(1) of the Act , was, in each case, the major contributing factor to the employees becoming parties to AWAs.
 &#8226; The consequences for each of the employees were serious. The longer serving members of the group suffered the most. As a group they were deprived of an amount in the order of $149,000 which represented the difference between what would have been payable had their redundancy entitlements been calculated under the certified agreement and the amount to which they were collectively entitled under the AWAs.
 &#8226; There is a strong need for general deterrence of the type of conduct engaged in by the respondents in the present case.
 &#8226; The conduct complained of undermines the legislative objective that AWAs should be the product of free bargaining between the parties.
 &#8226; The totality principle which I explained in greater detail in Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 at [30] and the appropriateness of fixing a total penalty for a course of conduct: as to which see McIlwain v Lamsay Food Packaging Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 158 IR 181 at 216-7.</text>

<text>7 The Court is not bound to accept and impose these proposed penalties but will do so if persuaded that, in all the circumstances, they fall within the permissible range: cf NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-1. In Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543 at 565 Jessup J expressed the view, with which I respectfully agree, that the phrase "permissible range" in this context "refers to a range which would be permitted by the court, that is, a range within which the penalty is neither manifestly inadequate nor manifestly excessive."</text>
