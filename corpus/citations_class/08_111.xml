<text>13 The appellant also refers to the Tribunal's treatment of letters produced by him, purportedly from Maoists demanding money from him and from police stations purportedly reporting what he had reported to the police. The Tribunal commented in the "Claims and Evidence" section of the reasons on the difficulties and deficiencies it saw in those documents. That put into context the conclusion of the Tribunal in the "Findings and Reasons" section that it gave no weight to the documents in support of the appellant's claims. The Tribunal did not repeat its previous comments, which provided the reason for declining to give weight to those documents but that does not amount to a failure to give reasons in the decision as a whole ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ and 291 per Kirby J). Further, having found that the appellant was an unreliable witness, the Tribunal placed no weight on material he provided in support of his claims. This does not mean that the Tribunal's reasons were irrational or illogical ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 58 at [11] [12] per Gleeson CJ, at [49] per McHugh and Gummow JJ).</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>6 Counsel for the appellant raised the same grounds in the notice of appeal to this Court as were raised before the Federal Magistrate. The appellant's primary argument is that the Tribunal did not outline its reasons for reaching its conclusion and the facts it considered material to that conclusion, so that the appellant cannot identify its reasons with certainty (citing Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323). The appellant also refers to s 430 of the Act which obliges the Tribunal to set out its findings on those questions of fact it considers material to its decision and the reasons for that decision.

7 The Tribunal's reasons are brief. That itself does not found jurisdictional error. The Tribunal accepted that the appellant is a Nepalese national and that he was a Kathmandu-based proprietor of a fruit company who had some trouble successfully transporting produce from rural regions in Nepal, which he remedied through import contracts with producers in India and China. The Tribunal did not accept that Maoists had targeted the appellant for donations. The Tribunal rejected the appellant's claims, gave no weight to supporting documentation and expressed itself not satisfied that the appellant was a reliable witness. The "Findings and Reasons" section of the decision did little more than state these conclusions, subject to one matter.

8 The Tribunal did set out some commentary on the veracity of the appellant's claims:
 
 The Tribunal does not accept on the evidence before it that the Maoists have been targeting the Applicant for donations, whether for Convention-related reasons or even just for criminal, mercenary ones. The Tribunal accepts that such a practice has been going on in Nepal but does not accept that it has been happening to the Applicant. 
 

The appellant says that this does not make sense.</text>

<tocase>SZJJA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1498</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2007/1498.html</AustLII>
<text>5 Federal Magistrate Smith concluded that the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently disclosed "the simple reason" why it affirmed the delegate's decision ( SZJJA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1498 at [19] ). This referred to the finding that the appellant was not a reliable witness. He found that the Tribunal sufficiently revealed its reasons for affirming the delegate's decision and that ' it had undertaken a genuine and rational review of the matter before it ' (at [20]). In coming to his conclusions, his Honour observed that it was appropriate to read together the "findings and reasons" and the description of the hearing before the Tribunal as set out in the reasons (at [20]). His Honour was not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to perform a genuine consideration of all of the claims and evidence (at [19]). His Honour dismissed the application.</text>
