<tocase>Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481</tocase>
<text>The operation of O 21 of the Federal Court Rules , as then in force, was considered by Sackville J in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378. The following principles emerge from that decision at [51]-[59] and are relevant to the present form of O 21: 
(a) The power to make an order under O 21 is to be exercised having regard to the fundamental principle that every person has a right of access to the Court to seek remedies in consequence of an alleged infringement of his or her rights and that it is a serious thing to limit or restrict that right.
 
(b) The power to restrict that right of access exists to protect the Court's own processes against unwarranted usurpation of judicial time and resources and to avoid the loss and disruption caused to those who face actions which lack substance. 
 
(c) The terms of O 21 r 1 identify the jurisdictional criteria which must be established before the power to make any order will arise. An application for such an order needs to show that the person against whom such an order is sought:
 
- habitually and persistently;
 
- and without any reasonable cause;
 
- institutes;
 
- a vexatious proceeding;
 
- in the Court [or any other Australian court].
 
(d) The expression "habitually and persistently" implies more than "frequently". "Habitually" suggests that the institution of proceedings is undertaken automatically and without due consideration to the merits of the proceedings. "Persistently" suggests determination and continuation in the face of difficulty or opposition, with a degree of stubbornness.
 
(e) The test of whether a vexatious proceeding has been commenced "without any reasonable cause" is an objective one. The relevant inquiry is whether the legal proceedings in fact can be shown to have had no reasonable basis regardless of the subjective motive or point of view of Mr Tsekouras. 
 
Similar principles were stated by Roden J in Attorney-General v Wentworth (1988) 14 NSWLR 481 which considered the equivalent provision of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) ('the Supreme Court Act ').</text>

<text>I am satisfied that Mr Tsekouras has no reasonable prospects of successfully prosecuting any part of his proceeding. The subject matter of this proceeding has been considered by numerous other courts. Accordingly, Mr Olsen is entitled to summary judgment pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court Act. Further, I am satisfied that Mr Tsekouras' case is hopeless and bound to fail and Mr Olsen would have been entitled to summary judgment under the test under General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. Order 21 of the Federal Court Rules : vexatious litigants

Order 21 rule 1 of the Federal Court Rules relevantly provides: 
 (1) If a person institutes a vexatious proceeding and the Court is satisfied that the person has habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted other vexatious proceedings in the Court or any other Australian court (whether against the same person or against different persons), the Court may order: 

 
 (a) that any proceeding instituted by the person may not be continued without leave of the Court; and 

 
 (b) that the person may not institute a proceeding without leave of the Court. 

 
 (2) An order under this rule may be made: 

 
 (a) on the application of a person against whom the person mentioned in subrule (1) has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings; or 

 
 (b) on the application of a person who has sufficient interest in the matter; ...</text>
