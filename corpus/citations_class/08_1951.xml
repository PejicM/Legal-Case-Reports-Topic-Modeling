<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Jax Tyres Pty Ltd (1984) 5 FCR 257</tocase>
<text>61 Caltex contended that the residual oils were neither "manufactured" nor "produced" according to the ordinary meaning of those words. In reliance on Commissioner of Taxation v Jax Tyres Pty Ltd (1984) 5 FCR 257 ( Jax Tyres ), Caltex said that the essence of manufacturing or producing is that what is made shall be a new and different article having a distinctive character or use from that out of which it is made. The residual oils are not made from crude oil, it said, but are an undesirable material left over at the completion of a process designed to manufacture other products (for example, petrol, diesel and jet fuel). Caltex focussed on the objectives of its refinery operations. It said that far from those operations being directed to making the residual oils, their existence was neither intended nor desired and Caltex at all times sought to minimise their creation. Rather than being manufactured goods, it said, the residual oils are an inevitable consequence of making the goods that Caltex intended for sale.

62 At the core of Caltex's argument was a characterisation of the residual oils as a type of "waste" produced as part of a manufacturing process but requiring "disposal" in some manner. Disposal by burning as a refinery fuel it said was analogous to scrap wood being burnt by a carpenter to heat his or her factory.

63 The Macquarie Dictionary meanings of "manufacture" include:
 [T]o make or produce by hand or machinery, especially on a large scale; to make in any manner; to work up (material) into form for use ...

65 In the context of the sales tax legislation, Lockhart J said in Jax Tyres (at 261):
 The primary meaning of the word "manufacture" when used as a verb is to make something by hand; but since the industrial revolution the word has come to mean manufacture by machinery, often on a large scale and with a division of labour. This accords with the dictionary definition. ... ... To manufacture an article necessarily involves producing a different article from the articles, materials or ingredients from which it was made. As Darling J said in McNicol v Pinch [1906] 2 KB 352 at 361: 
 
 "I think the essence of making or of manufacturing is that what is made shall be a different thing from that out of which it is made." 
 
That passage was approved and applied by Dixon J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jack Zinader Pty Ltd [1949] HCA 42 ; (1949) 78 CLR 336 the leading case in this field. Whether the article which results from the process of manufacturing is a different article from the constituents or ingredients from which it was made is a question of fact: the Jack Zinader case. "Production" ... is a word of wide import; but it still involves the element of producing something different from the materials from which it was made. It is not possible to formulate precise definitions of such general terms as "manufacture" and "production"; but they do not bear a restricted meaning. Whatever answers the description of "manufacture" or "production" of goods according to accepted usage of the English language is within the Act.

66 The courts have attributed an ordinary meaning, within the "accepted usage of the English language", to the terms "manufactured", "manufacture" and "manufactured goods" in a number of cases: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester [1934] HCA 17 ; (1934) 50 CLR 225 at 226 (Dixon J); MP Metals Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1968] HCA 89 ; (1978) 117 CLR 631 at 649 (Menzies J); Jax Tyres at 261; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jack Zinander Pty Ltd [1949] HCA 42 ; (1949) 78 CLR 336 at 344-355 (Dixon J); Commonwealth v 5 Star Foods Pty Ltd (2002) 167 FLR 214. In 5 Star Foods , Byrne J said at 222:
 The cases to which I was referred also emphasise that the word ["manufacture"] should be given its meaning in ordinary everyday language: Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 304-305 per Gibbs CJ. To my mind this meaning comprehends the application of a repetitive process, especially a mechanical process, to a thing or things to bring it or them to a form or condition specified. This process may be directed to producing a thing in a state fit for sale, for consumption by the end user, for attachment to or assembly with other things or for some further process. ...

71 Caltex laid emphasis on the fact that none of the residual oils is an intended object of the activities it undertakes at the refineries. Accordingly it said that to characterise the residual oils as manufactured or produced goods would lead to the strange result that Caltex was unintentionally manufacturing something. However for the purposes of s 5 of the Tariff Act, the critical question in my view is whether objectively speaking the goods in question can be said to have emerged from a process as a "new and different article ... having a distinctive character or use": see Jax Tyres 5 FCR at 264 (Lockhart J). The focus of s 5 is on the extant goods that are made subject to duty, not on the person who manufactures them or that person's stated objectives. Duty is imposed "on" goods by reference to their quality as manufactured goods. It is not imposed with any reference to the relative value of the goods or the subjective intentions of the manufacturer. This is not to say that the principle objectives of a commercial operation will not be relevant to the question of characterisation. They provide the context for the task of characterisation and are an important factor to take into account. They are not however determinative of the question. In any event I do not think it is accurate to say that Caltex unintentionally manufactures the residual oils. They are not the principal products created at the refineries, but it is clear that Caltex intends to bring about all of the known consequences of the refining process, which includes the production of the residual oils. In doing so its objective is to extract as much value as possible from the crude oil. I do not accept Caltex's pejorative characterisation of the residual oils as waste or rubbish. It did not dispose of them as if they were waste; it consumed them in a productive manner.

72 Caltex made a further submission that the residual oils were not "produced" for the purposes of s 5 because the word "produced" is there concerned only with tobacco production. The Excise Act draws a distinction it said between goods manufactured and goods produced, because the Act has distinct licensing arrangements for "licensed manufacturers" and "licensed producers", the latter of which are held only by producers of tobacco: see Division 2 of Part III of the Excise Act . Caltex said that "produced" should be construed with that context in mind and limited to the production of the various tobacco products identified in the Schedule.

73 I cannot accept that the word "production" must be limited in that way. The contention that it should was not developed by Caltex in any detail. It amounted to not much more than an assertion that a narrow construction was required because of the existence of the specific licensing arrangements for tobacco "producers" in Division 2 of Part III. Division 2 regulates the production of tobacco seed, tobacco plant and tobacco leaf by requiring a producer to hold a "producer licence". A "producer licence" is "a licence granted under Part IV , the holding of which authorises the licence holder to produce tobacco seed, tobacco plant or tobacco leaf". There is nothing express in Division 2 of Part III of the Excise Act that could be said to limit the ambit of the word "produced" in the Tariff Act. Further, s 5 of the Tariff Act gives no indication that "produced" is intended to be limited to tobacco production. To the contrary s 5 is in wide terms and applies to " all goods ... manufactured or produced". The Schedule itself reflects the intended width of the term. It describes various goods as "products" including those in issue in this case and refers to some goods (other than tobacco) as having been manufactured or produced (see, for example, item 11(a) describing "diesel fuel produced or manufactured by the process of refining waste oils ..."). The word "produced" is not defined in the Tariff Act, which one would expect if it were to be given the restricted meaning Caltex contends for. In my view it should be given its ordinary meaning.

74 Neither party referred me to the legislative history of Division 2 of Part III or s 5 of the Tariff Act. I note however that the words "manufactured or produced" have appeared in s 5 of the Tariff Act since its inception in 1921 (and the section itself has remained in the same form since then). At that time no equivalent to Division 2 of Part III appeared in the Excise Act . Division 2 of Part III was introduced in the relevant form in 2000 and I see no reason why its introduction at that time should alter the ordinary meaning of "produced" in s 5 of the Tariff Act. Further, it may be observed that the version of the Excise Act in force in 1923 contained specific provisions relating to the "manufacture" of tobacco and included separate licensing arrangements for "producers" of "material". "Material" included "all material used in the manufacture of excisable goods and declared by proclamation to be material within the meaning of this Act". There could be no suggestion that the word "produced" in s 5 of the Tariff Act was to have borne a restricted meaning relevant only to "material", because "produced" in s 5 quite clearly related to "goods dutiable under the Schedule" (excisable goods) and not the more limited concept of "material" or, for that matter, tobacco.

75 Caltex made a number of submissions regarding the constitutional conception of duties of excise, which it said bore importantly on the proper construction of the words "manufactured" or "produced". It submitted that the "essence" of a duty of excise is that it is a tax on a step in the production or distribution of goods that are intended to be passed on by a manufacturer to consumers , that is, third party consumers. Consistently with that understanding, it said, the Tariff Act imposes duties of excise directly on or in respect of goods that are destined for consumption by consumers, the relevant excise step being the step of manufacturing or producing the goods before they are passed down the line to consumers. Accordingly it said the terms "manufactured" and "produced" should be construed as applying only to the step of manufacture or production taken with respect to goods intended to reach third party consumers (i.e. not goods that are consumed by their manufacturer). On that basis Caltex said it does not "manufacture" or "produce" the residual oils because it takes no step to bring them into existence as part of a process that ends in their receipt by third party consumers. Instead they are created because they are an inevitable consequence of the process of producing other goods which are intended to reach consumers.</text>

<text>77 I do not agree that the words "manufactured" or "produced" must be read so as to apply only to goods that are intended to reach a third party consumer or to "go into the market", rather than to goods that might be consumed by a manufacturer itself in the course of its operations. Duties of excise are inland taxes on "a step in the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods": see Ha v New South Wales [1997] HCA 34 ; (1997) 189 CLR 465 ( Ha ) at 490. In Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vict) [1938] HCA 38 ; (1938) 60 CLR 263 ( Matthews ) at 304, Dixon J said:
 To be an excise the tax must be levied "upon goods," but those apparently simple words permit of much flexibility in application. The tax must bear a close relation to the production or manufacture, the sale or the consumption of goods and must be of such a nature as to affect them as the subjects of manufacture or production or as articles of commerce. 
(In Parton v Milk Board (Victoria) [1949] HCA 67 ; (1949) 80 CLR 229 Dixon J qualified this statement to remove the reference to consumption, following the decision of the Privy Council in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd v Conlon [1943] AC 550.)

78 The disjunctive language used in the passages from Ha and Matthews demonstrates that a tax imposed on any one of the steps referred to will qualify as a duty of excise. For example a tax imposed on the sale of goods to consumers would be an excise, as would a tax imposed on the manufacture of goods without any necessary reference to their sale. In support of its contention Caltex relied particularly upon passages in Anderson's Pty Ltd v Victoria [1964] HCA 77 ; (1964) 111 CLR 353 ( Anderson's) and Bolton v Madsen [1963] HCA 16 ; (1963) 110 CLR 264 ( Bolton ), which were followed by the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner for A.C.T. Revenue v Kithock Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1098 ; (2000) 102 FCR 42 ( Kithock ) . In Anderson's , Barwick CJ said at 364:
 [T]he judicial formulation of the nature of a duty of excise within the meaning of the Constitution has progressed over the intervening years. It has now, however, in my opinion, received definitive exposition by this Court, and, however much other views might have been possible at an earlier stage, it ought now to be taken as settled that the essence of a duty of excise is that it is a tax upon the taking of a step in a process of bringing goods into existence or to a consumable state, or of passing them down the line which reaches from the earliest stage in production to the point of receipt by the consumer. (Emphasis added.)

83 Assuming they fall within the Schedule, the impost in this case is levied directly on the residual oils as the "subjects of manufacture" and affects them as commodities in the hands of Caltex. The residual oils are of use to Caltex and serve an economic purpose. Without them Caltex would need to acquire fuel oil from an alternative source at higher cost. The impost is not levied upon the consumption of the residual oils by Caltex. Nor is it a tax on the ownership of the residual oils. It is an excise in the most obvious sense; a tax upon the step of manufacturing or producing a defined good. In my view, to accept the limitation contended for by Caltex would be counter to the trend of the High Court's decision making from the early decision in Peterswald v Bartley [1904] HCA 21 ; (1904) 1 CLR 497 through to Ha [1997] HCA 34 ; 189 CLR 465 , which has been to enlarge the field of permissible steps of taxation in the context of duties of excise.

84 Further, Caltex's argument arrives at a position whereby excise duties would be limited to taxes bearing the characteristics of an indirect tax a tax levied on a person with the expectation that that person will not bear the financial burden of the tax but pass it on to another. The indirectness or otherwise of a tax has been rejected as a necessary element of an excise: see Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria [1960] HCA 10 ; (1960) 104 CLR 529 ( Dennis Hotels ) at 583, 585 and 590 (Menzies J); see also Ha 189 CLR at 509. The effect of adopting Caltex's position would be to reject the step of manufacture or production as an occasion in itself for the imposition of an excise and necessitate an inquiry into the subjective intentions of the relevant manufacturer. As I have said the cases demonstrate the stand alone nature of each permissible taxation step and it would not be consistent in my view to introduce a limitation focussed on intention. In this connection, I adopt what Menzies J said in Dennis Hotels 104 CLR at 583:
 I find nothing in the language of the Constitution which would exclude from the categories of duties of customs or duties of excise, duties to be borne as well as paid by the importer or manufacturer. In other words, unless it be by the use of the words "customs" and "excise" themselves, the Constitution does not adopt the distinction between direct and indirect taxes so that, unless the usage of the words otherwise requires, an import duty on goods imported for use or consumption by the importer would be a customs duty, and a duty upon the production of goods for the producer's own use or consumption would be an excise duty, and both would be beyond the power of the Parliament of a State. 
In my view a thing capable of description as a manufactured good, and consumed or otherwise applied by its manufacturer in that manufacturer's commercial operations, is capable of being the subject of an excise duty.</text>

82 As Dixon J said in Matthews 60 CLR at 303-304:
 The basal conception of an excise in the primary sense which the framers of the Constitution are regarded as having adopted is a tax directly affecting commodities. ...

(Emphasis added.)

81 Each of the cases relied on by Caltex involved impugned taxes concerning goods ultimately intended for sale to third party consumers. The question of self-consumption did not arise in any of the cases and I was not referred to any cases in which the conception of a duty of excise had been limited in the manner contended for by Caltex. The Commissioner said that the statement of the Chief Justice in Anderson's 111 CLR 353 was intended to do no more than identify three ways of locating the incidence of an excise duty: the steps of (1) bringing into existence, (2) bringing to a consumable state or (3) passing them down the line to the point of receipt by the consumer. I agree. The passage is consistent with the understanding that an excise may be imposed on discrete steps taking place with respect to goods, without it being necessary that every step take place. The passage does not articulate a principle that excise duties are only those taxes that affect goods destined for consumption by parties other than the original manufacturer or producer. Similarly the emphasis placed by the Full Court in Kithock on the position of consumers was necessary to explain, by way of exclusion, that goods already in circulation amongst consumers cannot be the subject of an excise duty. It is by now clear that consumption taxes are not excises. While it is an essential characteristic of an excise that goods have not yet passed into consumption, I do not accept that it is essential that goods are intended to pass into a market or to be sold to a third party, even though that will be the ordinary occurrence.</text>

<text>78 The disjunctive language used in the passages from Ha and Matthews demonstrates that a tax imposed on any one of the steps referred to will qualify as a duty of excise. For example a tax imposed on the sale of goods to consumers would be an excise, as would a tax imposed on the manufacture of goods without any necessary reference to their sale. In support of its contention Caltex relied particularly upon passages in Anderson's Pty Ltd v Victoria [1964] HCA 77 ; (1964) 111 CLR 353 ( Anderson's) and Bolton v Madsen [1963] HCA 16 ; (1963) 110 CLR 264 ( Bolton ), which were followed by the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner for A.C.T.

 [T]he judicial formulation of the nature of a duty of excise within the meaning of the Constitution has progressed over the intervening years. It has now, however, in my opinion, received definitive exposition by this Court, and, however much other views might have been possible at an earlier stage, it ought now to be taken as settled that the essence of a duty of excise is that it is a tax upon the taking of a step in a process of bringing goods into existence or to a consumable state, or of passing them down the line which reaches from the earliest stage in production to the point of receipt by the consumer.

<text>78 The disjunctive language used in the passages from Ha and Matthews demonstrates that a tax imposed on any one of the steps referred to will qualify as a duty of excise. For example a tax imposed on the sale of goods to consumers would be an excise, as would a tax imposed on the manufacture of goods without any necessary reference to their sale.

(Emphasis added.)

80 In Kithock [2000] FCA 1098 ; 102 FCR 42 , the Full Court held that a state tax imposed on used or second-hand motor vehicles was not an excise because it was a tax imposed on goods after they had reached the hands of consumers. The Court stated at 48:
 In [Bolton], the authoritative pronouncement of what is an excise was made by a unanimous High Court constituted by Dixon CJ, Kitto, Taylor, Menzies, Windeyer and Owen JJ (at 271): 
 
 "It is now established that for constitutional purposes duties of excise are taxes directly related to goods imposed at some step in their production or distribution before they reach the hands of consumers ." (Emphasis added.) 
 
This formulation does not refer to the "ultimate" or "final" or "intermediate" consumer, but is expressed by reference to the plurality of consumers and therefore is a reference to the first consumer. In our opinion, this formulation is the authoritative test which this Court is bound to apply, with the consequence that the tax in question in this case is not an excise.

81 Each of the cases relied on by Caltex involved impugned taxes concerning goods ultimately intended for sale to third party consumers. The question of self-consumption did not arise in any of the cases and I was not referred to any cases in which the conception of a duty of excise had been limited in the manner contended for by Caltex. The Commissioner said that the statement of the Chief Justice in Anderson's 111 CLR 353 was intended to do no more than identify three ways of locating the incidence of an excise duty: the steps of (1) bringing into existence, (2) bringing to a consumable state or (3) passing them down the line to the point of receipt by the consumer. I agree. The passage is consistent with the understanding that an excise may be imposed on discrete steps taking place with respect to goods, without it being necessary that every step take place. The passage does not articulate a principle that excise duties are only those taxes that affect goods destined for consumption by parties other than the original manufacturer or producer. Similarly the emphasis placed by the Full Court in Kithock on the position of consumers was necessary to explain, by way of exclusion, that goods already in circulation amongst consumers cannot be the subject of an excise duty. It is by now clear that consumption taxes are not excises. While it is an essential characteristic of an excise that goods have not yet passed into consumption, I do not accept that it is essential that goods are intended to pass into a market or to be sold to a third party, even though that will be the ordinary occurrence.

140 I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption for the purposes of the Excise Act . The Excise Act does not refer to delivery to a person but adopts the more ample language of delivery for or into home consumption. While I accept that the typical case of delivery will involve the movement of excisable goods from one person or place to another, the language of the Excise Act is sufficiently broad in my view to apply to the less typical case of consumption by a manufacturer at its own premises. The contention that the Excise Act necessarily requires the physical removal of goods from one place to another seems to me to give the concept of delivery for home consumption a restricted meaning not warranted either by the breadth of the language used or the evident purpose of the legislation, namely to tax manufactured goods consumed in Australia. In my view the use of the words "for" and "into" demonstrates a focus by the Excise Act on the status of excisable goods (that is, their readiness for consumption) rather than whether they have necessarily been transferred between people or places.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1960/10.html</AustLII>
<text>84 Further, Caltex's argument arrives at a position whereby excise duties would be limited to taxes bearing the characteristics of an indirect tax a tax levied on a person with the expectation that that person will not bear the financial burden of the tax but pass it on to another. The indirectness or otherwise of a tax has been rejected as a necessary element of an excise: see Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria [1960] HCA 10 ; (1960) 104 CLR 529 ( Dennis Hotels ) at 583, 585 and 590 (Menzies J); see also Ha 189 CLR at 509. The effect of adopting Caltex's position would be to reject the step of manufacture or production as an occasion in itself for the imposition of an excise and necessitate an inquiry into the subjective intentions of the relevant manufacturer. As I have said the cases demonstrate the stand alone nature of each permissible taxation step and it would not be consistent in my view to introduce a limitation focussed on intention. In this connection, I adopt what Menzies J said in Dennis Hotels 104 CLR at 583:
 I find nothing in the language of the Constitution which would exclude from the categories of duties of customs or duties of excise, duties to be borne as well as paid by the importer or manufacturer. In other words, unless it be by the use of the words "customs" and "excise" themselves, the Constitution does not adopt the distinction between direct and indirect taxes so that, unless the usage of the words otherwise requires, an import duty on goods imported for use or consumption by the importer would be a customs duty, and a duty upon the production of goods for the producer's own use or consumption would be an excise duty, and both would be beyond the power of the Parliament of a State. 
In my view a thing capable of description as a manufactured good, and consumed or otherwise applied by its manufacturer in that manufacturer's commercial operations, is capable of being the subject of an excise duty.</text>

<tocase>K &amp; S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48 ; (1985) 157 CLR 309</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/48.html</AustLII>
<text>92 The words must of course be construed in context and by reference to the policies and objectives of the Tariff Act as a whole: K &amp; S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48 ; (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 315 (Mason J); s 15AA Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). The context here requires a consideration of the processes involved in petroleum production and the effect those processes have on their subject matter crude oil. I do not see any reason however why the ordinary meaning of "refined" ("freed from impurities"; "purified"; "made purer or of finer quality") should not be given to that word as it appears in the Schedule. This is especially so where the refining of petroleum is provided as an example of the ordinary dictionary meaning (see [90] above).

93 When that is done, it follows in my view that none of the residual oils can be said to be "refined" or "semi-refined", for the following reasons. Firstly, they are not themselves freed from impurities or extraneous matter, nor are they purified or clarified. They have not been in any sense made purer or of finer quality. I do not agree that Caltex's other products should be put to one side when characterising the residual oils. A comparison is useful because those other products (kerosene, jet fuel, diesel fuel) are freed from impurities, in that the heavier, less desirable hydrocarbons and the naturally occurring contaminants in the crude oil are separated from the lighter hydrocarbons that make up those products. Those lighter streams are then treated so as to further reduce the level of contaminants and convert them into saleable products. Whereas those products are made purer or of finer quality, the residual oils are essentially the original impurities themselves.

94 Secondly, while it may be correct to say, as the Commissioner suggests, that the residual oils are not impure when considered as discrete goods, this does not mean that they are or have been purified or made finer in quality. The mere fact that they have been produced in a refinery is not sufficient in my view to give them the quality of a "refined" product. Similarly, I do not consider the fact that they have a commercial use makes them a "refined" product. Commercial value or use does not seem to me particularly relevant to whether something should be properly described as "refined".</text>

<tocase>Attorney-General v The Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd (1900) 26 VLR 83</tocase>
<text>95 In Attorney-General v The Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd (1900) 26 VLR 83 , Madden CJ considered the construction of the term "molasses refined" in Victoria's pre-Federation customs and excise duties legislation. At 84 his Honour said:
 The evidence shows that the process which "molasses" undergoes at the defendant company's works practically amounts to a straining, by which foreign matters, debris, and rubbish are extracted, and nothing more. It also appears that when sugar is refined this is a preliminary part of the process it passes through, but that in the case of sugar when this is done the sugar is treated with phosphoric acid in order to eliminate certain matters, and the acid is then eliminated by the use of alum. Subsequently the sugar is submitted to other treatment, which is specifically termed in trade "refining," viz., passing it over charcoal beds, so as to eliminate from it substances naturally in it, that is intrinsic as distinguished from extrinsic impurities, and when this is done the sugar is said to be "refined." This passing over charcoal is the test which constitutes refinement as distinguished from straining and other processes. (Emphasis added.) 
Later, at 85-86 his Honour said:
 The International Dictionary, which Webster revised, gives "refined" as "freed from impurities or alloy, purified, polished, cultured, delicate, as refined gold, refined language, refined sentiment." Nobody speaks of the refinement of the gold when only separating the quartz and other like substances in which it is found, but which form no inherent part of it, from the metal. One only refines when one comes to retort the gold and the inherent alloys, silver, copper, etc., are extracted from it. Therefore we may take from the meaning in the dictionary that the refining of sugar or molasses stands in the same category as refining of gold, of silver, or of wine. I think that refinement must mean here as sugar is refined, and that the word "refined" would not be properly applied to a mere straining or filtering.

96 Accordingly his Honour held that the molasses, which similarly to the residual oils here was produced as a consequence of the refining of a raw sugar, could not be characterised as "refined" as a result of it being strained to remove extrinsic impurities (frogs, brickbats and nails) that had found their way in during storage. As is evident from his Honour's decision, some form of purification in the sense of removing intrinsic impurities was central to the concept of refinement or "refined" as it was held to have been used in the relevant Victorian legislation. Contrary to the Commissioner's submission, I do not consider that the process of separating the crude oil into different components in and of itself means that each separated component therefore has the character of a "refined" product. This is especially so where the component in question is essentially removed from the whole because of its inferior or impure nature.

97 It follows from what I have said that none of the residual oils fall within item 11(a) of the Schedule and are consequently not dutiable. However, in case I am wrong on this point, I intend to deal with all remaining issues, which were fully argued. This includes whether the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil is a "liquid" petroleum product.

98 It was common ground that both the Kurnell Residual Slop Oil and CLOR Residual Slop Oil are properly described as liquids and thus would fall within item 11(a) if they are "refined" or "semi-refined" products. Caltex contended however that the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil was not a liquid, for the reasons set out at [20]. It said that the "standard" reference point for determining whether something was a liquid was a temperature of 20deg.C and pressure of 101.3kPa. As I have found at [27] and [28], the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil is a solid at those standard temperature and pressure conditions but a liquid when it is produced, stored and then consumed as a burner fuel.

99 I do not accept Caltex's submission. Neither the Schedule to the Tariff Act nor the Tariff Act itself contains any stipulation that the relevant "refined or semi-refined" petroleum products in item 11(a) must be liquid at standard temperature or pressure . By contrast, the Tariff Act does in respect of other goods prescribe certain physical properties by reference to specific temperatures and pressures. For example, s 3(4) prescribes the physical characteristics of "fuel oil", which include a density and a minimum kinematic viscosity measured at 15deg.C and 50deg.C respectively. Moreover, the prescription of a standard temperature and pressure for the determination of a liquid state is used elsewhere in the Excise Act . "Condensate", for example, is defined in s 4 of the Excise Act as either:
 (a) liquid petroleum; or (b) a substance: 
 
 (i) that is derived from gas associated with oil production; and
 (ii) that is liquid at standard temperature and pressure .

<tocase>Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285</tocase>
<text>112 I agree with the Commissioner's construction of par (d). Item 11(I) is divided into three paragraphs of increasing generality. The word "other" is used in a number of places see 11(I)(1)(b), 11(I)(2) ("other, in packages not exceeding 210 litres"), 11(I)(3) ("Other") and 11(I)(3)(d). On an ordinary reading of item 11(I), it seems to me that the word "other" as it is used in each case is intended to describe goods that come within the general item description ("other refined or partly refined petroleum products ..."), other than those that fall within any of the preceding, more specific, paragraphs. In other words, products that do not come within item 11(I)(1) ("recycled petroleum products not elsewhere specified") or 11(I)(2) ("Other, in packages not exceeding 210 litres"), would therefore fall to item 11(I)(3) ("Other"). Similarly, par (d) of item 11(I)(3) seems plainly to apply to any product within item 11(I)(3) that is not covered by pars (a), (b) or (c). A similar construction of the word "other" as it appears in the Customs Tariff Act 1982 (Cth) was adopted in Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1988) 78 ALR 285 at 300 (Burchett J). On that construction, item 11(I)(3)(d) applies to any 'refined or partly refined petroleum product' that:
 
&#8226; is not covered by either of the preceding paragraphs, 11(I)(1) or 11(I)(2);
 
&#8226; is not for use in an internal combustion engine; and
 
&#8226; does not contain the required chemical marker.
 
Assuming they are "refined" products, the description just given is applicable to each of the residual oils.

113 Without more, it is difficult to read par (d) in the manner contended for by Caltex. Beyond reference to the extrinsic material, no explanation was offered as to why Parliament would not have clearly identified in the drafting that par (d) was to be limited to non-fuel uses. If "other" means anything, it means other than (a), (b) or (c). Between them, (a), (b) and (c) cover all possible uses. Putting to one side combustion engine fuel (dealt with by (a)), the only remaining discriminant between (b) and (c) on the one hand and (d) on the other is the inclusion of the marker. In my view this accords with precisely what Parliament had in mind when it introduced par (d). It appears from the passages in the extrinsic material quoted above that the marker was to be the "cornerstone" of the regime introduced in 1998. It was given a critical function, in that concessional status, or "free" status for non-fuels, would only apply to products if they contained the marker. This is made clear from the discussion of the proposed item 11(I) in the explanatory memorandum to the 1997 Bill. At page 12, the explanatory memorandum states:
 The new subitems of item 11 generally have a three tiered excise tariff rate based on the intended use of the products. Products for use otherwise than as fuels and containing the prescribed proportion of marker are dutiable at the rate of "Free". Products for use as a fuel otherwise than in an internal combustion [engine] and containing the prescribed proportion of marker are dutiable at a concessional rate. Products containing no marker and, generally, which are for use in an internal combustion engine are dutiable at the highest rates.

114 Further, the 1997 Act did not include item 11(I)(3)(d), but item 11(I)(1) was as follows:
 (1) Recycled petroleum products 
 
 (a) Diesel fuel, and gasoline, on which customs or excise duty has been paid, recovered by a recycling process not being a process of refining Free 
 (b) other 
 
 (i) containing at least the prescribed proportion of the marker for use otherwise than as a fuel in an internal combustion engine Free 
 (ii) other $0.34697/L (Emphasis added.)</text>

<tocase>R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1906/17.html</AustLII>
<text>135 Caltex submitted that the residual oils were at no time "delivered" for home consumption because the concept of delivery in the Excise Act signifies a transfer of actual or constructive possession from one person to another. In this case, it said, there was no such transfer because it used the residual oils itself at its own premises. Caltex relied on a passage from O'Connor J's judgment in R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770 ( Lyon ), where his Honour in the context of the customs legislation dealt with the provision for customs control over goods "until delivery for home consumption or exportation" (which provision is mirrored in s 61 of the Excise Act ). His Honour stated at 784:
 The object of that provision, if it were necessary to give any reasons for its enactment, is obvious; if once goods go into home consumption, that is, into circulation, it becomes almost impossible to trace them.

136 According to Caltex, goods such as the residual oils which never leave its premises cannot be said to "go ... into circulation" and cannot therefore have been "delivered" for home consumption.

139 The Commissioner's submissions can be summarised as follows:
 
(a) Upon their manufacture, Caltex did not sell or export the residual oils. It dedicated them for its own use as refinery fuel at the relevant premises. Its dedication of the oils for that use is plain on the evidence, which demonstrates that Caltex maintained and consumed the oils for that purpose.
 
(b) The expression "delivered for home consumption" (ss 61 and 61C) is broad and should not be read down as applying only to delivery of goods between individuals or between places. Nor should "home consumption" be limited by reference to the identity of the actual consumer (i.e. whether the consumer is a third party or the manufacturer him or herself).
 
(c) The concept of delivery for home consumption is critical to s 61(1) because it determines the period of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods. In s 61(1), the concept exists to distinguish between two places for consumption Australia (home) or overseas (export). The use of the preposition "for" in the phrases "delivered for home consumption" and "delivered for exportation", demonstrate the section is concerned more broadly with the place of consumption rather than the transfer of possession between parties.
 
(d) The phrase "go into circulation" used by O'Connor J in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 was intended to explain the concept of home consumption not delivered for home consumption. That much is clear from the context in which his Honour used the phrase, being an explanation of the customs authorities' control over goods as a form of security until payment of the required duty. Here, Caltex's premises are in Australia and consumption of the residual oils within those premises is sufficient for the oils to "go into circulation".
 
(e) The residual oils were delivered for home consumption in a manner provided for by the Excise Act . They were delivered pursuant to Caltex's permissions under s 61C and that delivery gave rise to a deemed entry for home consumption: see s 61C(2). Accordingly, Caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty.

141 Another way of considering this is by reference to s 61. Section 61 renders all excisable goods "subject to [the Commissioner's] control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever occurs first". The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth's excise revenue: see Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Collector of Customs (New South Wales) v Southern Shipping Co Ltd [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 ( Southern Shipping ). The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation. In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal (home) consumption and all exports. Historically, excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods. In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises (Victoria) [1989] HCA 38 ; (1989) 167 CLR 399 at 427, Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth (1901):
 The fundamental conception of the term [excise] is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury, as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country; and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies, and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

143 Contrary to Caltex's submissions, I do not accept that the reference in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 to goods going into circulation necessitates a more restricted construction of "delivered for home consumption". Justice O'Connor's reference to going into circulation was used to explain how effective security over goods is lost once they have entered home consumption. His Honour was not there describing the concept of delivery nor, more importantly, intending to limit its scope. He was drawing attention to the policy of the customs legislation and the importance of the customs authorities' having a form of security over imported goods to ensure the payment of duty. I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex's dedication of the residual oils for consumption by it at its premises is sufficient, in the sense O'Connor J had in mind, for the oils to "go into circulation".

144 Similarly I reject Caltex's submission that the words "from a place" in s 61C mean that excisable goods must be removed from that place before they can be considered "delivered" for home consumption. Again, while Caltex's construction accords with what will occur in the typical case, the section is not limited to that situation. The section also accommodates and is consistent with a delivery for home consumption constituted by a use of the relevant goods at that place. Furthermore, the reference to a place in s 61C seems to me to be more concerned with the manner in which the Commissioner's control can be effectively exercised. Section 61C follows ss 61 , 61A and 61B , each of which concern itself with the Commissioner's control and the granting of permissions. In the case of s 61C , it seems to me that it is a necessary or at least convenient measure in permitting deliveries into home consumption without formal entries, that such activity is authorised only in respect of certain specified premises at which the Commissioner's control and supervision can be effectively exercised.

145 For these reasons, I consider that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption pursuant to its s 61C permissions. Accordingly, if I am wrong on the "refined" point, then Caltex was obliged to account for the residual oils in its weekly returns and is liable to pay the requisite duty on them.

154 In relation to (b), Caltex's submission has the effect that s 60 could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption. The Commissioner submitted that s 60 applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption. He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid (relying on Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279) and the obligations imposed by s 60 are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment (relying on Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579). More particularly the Commissioner said that s 60 is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession, which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised, principally where there is no payment of duty.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1287.html</AustLII>
<text>137 As an extension of this argument, Caltex said that s 61 which renders excisable goods subject to the Commissioner's control "until delivered for home consumption or exportation" demonstrates that "delivery" occurs only upon an entry pursuant to s 58 or a "deemed delivery", as it put it, pursuant to s 61C. It referred to the fact that s 61 contains penalty provisions which prohibit interference with goods that are subject to control, and said that delivery for home consumption, which brings that control to an end, can only occur in a manner provided for by the Excise Act . Reliance was placed on Moama Refinery v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2001] FCA 1287 ; (2001) 115 FCR 205 ( Moama ) where Ryan J referred to the regime in ss 58 , 59 , 60 and 61 and stated at [22]:
 There can be no suggestion, on the facts of the present case, that the subject fuel had ever been "entered" for home consumption as contemplated by s 58(1)(a) of the Act. Without such entry, or authorisation, they could not have been "delivered" for home consumption and, accordingly, by force of s 61(1) they remained subject to Customs control.

138 As the final step in its argument, Caltex submitted that s 61C (there here being no "entry" of the residual oils) makes it clear that excisable goods can only be delivered for home consumption upon being removed from the manufacturer's relevant premises. This was said to be because s 61C permits a manufacturer to "deliver for home consumption from a place specified in the permission" (emphasis added).

161 In my view there was no doubt about the whereabouts of the residual oils or whether they had been, at least on the Commissioner's construction of s 60(1)(a) , kept safely. This is not a case where the location of the goods (and therefore whether they had gone into home consumption) was unknown (cf. Moama [2001] FCA 1287 ; 115 FCR 205) , or a case where the Commissioner only had "evidence which might lead him to form the opinion that excisable goods were not kept safely" (see Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 at [16] ). The facts here were clear the residual oils had been consumed by Caltex at its premises without the payment of any duty.

165 A similar situation arose in Moama [2001] FCA 1287 ; 115 FCR 205. The Commissioner in that case issued a demand on the basis of s 60(1)(b) only, but sought at the hearing, as an alternative, to validate the demand in reliance on s 60(1)(a). After referring to Revlon Manufacturing Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 63 FCR 535 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wade [1951] HCA 66 ; (1951) 84 CLR 105 , Ryan J found that the demand could be justified on the basis of s 60(1)(a) , even if s 60(1)(b) had not been available. His Honour stated at [40]:
 In my view, the amenability of Moama to the issue of a demand under s 60(1) did not depend on the exercise of any power by Customs (other than the issuing of the demand itself). It arose, as Wilcox J said in Revlon out of the operation of the Act itself. There was, accordingly, no scope for Moama to be under any misapprehension as to the basis upon which it was asked to pay duty on the subject fuel.</text>

<text>141 Another way of considering this is by reference to s 61. Section 61 renders all excisable goods "subject to [the Commissioner's] control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever occurs first". The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth's excise revenue: see Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Collector of Customs (New South Wales) v Southern Shipping Co Ltd [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 ( Southern Shipping ). The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation. In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal (home) consumption and all exports. Historically, excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods. In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises (Victoria) [1989] HCA 38 ; (1989) 167 CLR 399 at 427, Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth (1901):
 The fundamental conception of the term [excise] is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury, as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country; and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies, and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

147 This however is to misconstrue the section and its intended operation. Liability under s 60 is "collateral and not substitutional" for the liability to pay excise duty that may be incurred under other provisions of the Excise Act : see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 288 (Dixon CJ); see also s 60(4) of the Excise Act . Section 60 is an alternative recovery mechanism open to the Commissioner in appropriate cases where the circumstances set out therein are met. Subject to what I say below (at [158]-[162]), it was open to the Commissioner to rely on s 60 in making the request, regardless of whether he also maintained an alternative position that Caltex was liable for excise duty having delivered the residual oils for home consumption.

148 While I was not taken to the parties' correspondence on this point in detail, I note that the Commissioner both prior to (in its Advice) and after making the request (in its objection decision) maintained a claim that Caltex had delivered the residual oils for home consumption for the purposes of s 61C. In those circumstances, I do not consider that the request amounted to any form of concession that the Commissioner accepted that the residual oils had not been delivered. In any event, a proper construction of s 60 in my view would permit the Commissioner to rely on s 60 even where the relevant excisable goods have been "delivered for home consumption", where such delivery is not accompanied by the payment of duty. For reasons I shall explain below in dealing with the s 60 point, I consider that s 60 is capable of application to excisable goods that (1) have been subject to the Commissioner's control but (2) have not been kept safely by virtue of their delivery into home consumption without the payment of duty.

149 I now turn to the Commissioner's alternative basis for Caltex's liability under the s 60 demand. The Commissioner relied on both ss 60(1)(a) and (b) in the demand. The demand stated:
 [Caltex] owes the Excise Collector of the Australian Taxation Office ... the amount of $48,676,126.13, being the amount of the debt described in the Schedule.

152 Caltex has sought to have the demand set aside for invalidity, on the following grounds:
 
(a) The residual oils are not "excisable goods" and s 60 has no application to them.
 
(b) Section 60 applies only to excisable goods that are "subject to the [Commissioner's] control". If as the Commissioner contended the residual oils were delivered for home consumption, then they were thereupon no longer subject to the Commissioner's control and s 60 does not apply.
 
(c) Caltex did not "fail to keep [the residual oils] safely". The safety with which s 60(1)(a) is concerned is that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty. It is not directed at the protection of goods from damage or destruction (relying on Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 296 (Taylor J) and 299 (Menzies J)). As the residual oils were "destroyed" by Caltex and did not and were never intended to find their way into home consumption, there was no failure to keep them safely for the purposes of s 60(1)(a). 
 
(d) The Commissioner was not entitled to make a request pursuant to s 60(1)(b) nor to rely on that paragraph in the demand as a basis for liability. Section 60(1)(b) may only be invoked when there is doubt about the whereabouts of goods or doubt as to whether they have been kept safely (relying on Sidebottom v Giuliano [2000] FCA 607 ; (2000) 98 FCR 579 ( Sidebottom )). There was no doubt as to whether Caltex had failed to keep the residual oils safely. The Commissioner was aware that the residual oils had been burnt at Caltex's refineries. In particular, he acknowledged that the residual oils had been "used to generate energy within Caltex's refineries" in the purported request he made under s 60(1)(b). 
 
(e) Even if the Commissioner was entitled to make the s 60(1)(b) request, Caltex properly accounted for the residual oils by explaining that they had been used to generate heat, which thereby demonstrated they had not gone into home consumption.
 
(f) The demand is invalid because it claimed payment of a "debt". Liability under s 60(1) only arises upon the due making of a valid demand. Accordingly Caltex could not have owed the amount demanded prior to the making of the demand and its description as a debt renders the demand invalid.

154 In relation to (b), Caltex's submission has the effect that s 60 could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption. The Commissioner submitted that s 60 applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption. He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid (relying on Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279) and the obligations imposed by s 60 are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment (relying on Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579). More particularly the Commissioner said that s 60 is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession, which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised, principally where there is no payment of duty.

157 In relation to the failure to keep safely point at (c), the Commissioner relied on the decision of Finkelstein J in Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 and his Honour's discussion of the purposes of s 60 as explained by the High Court in Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279. What is clear from each of those cases is that s 60 imposes an essentially absolute duty to keep goods safely and to ensure they do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty. Where that does occur, the goods will have found their way into home consumption "irregularly", that is, in a manner not authorised by the Excise Act , and s 60 will apply in order that the revenue might be protected. The Commissioner said that the residual oils found their way into home consumption irregularly when Caltex consumed them without duty having been paid. I agree. As I said earlier, Caltex's consumption of the residual oils at its refineries amounted to "home consumption". It follows that Caltex's dedication of the residual oils as refinery fuel oil, without paying excise duty, and subsequent consumption of them by burning them, means that they found their way into home consumption irregularly. Caltex's consumption of the residual oils in this manner (by burning and thus using them up or "destroying" them) was therefore a failure to keep them safely within s 60(1)(a). As Dixon CJ said in Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 287, the safe keeping comprehended by s 60(1)(a) is the keeping safe from loss or destruction, because "the provision is pointed at the loss of goods involving the loss of excise duty". Caltex relied on the judgments of Taylor J (at 296) and Menzies J (at 299) in Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279 and their Honours' references to damage or destruction. However, their observations were directed not to a case such as the present (where the "destruction" is the consumption of the residual oils as a fuel) but to a rejection of the proposition that the section imposes a duty of care not to permit goods to be damaged or destroyed.

158 I now turn to Caltex's submission at (d). The Commissioner acknowledged that it was entitled to request an account only where the safety of the relevant goods is something less than an "undoubted" fact: see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 305 (Owen J); Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 at [14] (Finkelstein J). It said that the section was directed to an account that shows either:
 
 
 &#8226; an unauthorised relinquishment of possession;
 &#8226; despite an unauthorised loss of possession, that the goods have not gone into home consumption without payment of duty; or
 &#8226; despite a failure to keep them safely, the Commissioner's control over the goods is still effective (see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 299 (Menzies J))

163 If I am wrong in that conclusion, I would reject Caltex's submission at (e) above that it had accounted for the residual oils. Its statement that residual oils were used as fuel in generating the required heat for the refineries was an accounting for their consumption, not an accounting "for the goods". It did not demonstrate that the residual oils had been dealt with in a manner authorised by the Excise Act or that, despite an unauthorised relinquishment of possession, the goods had not got into home consumption without duty being paid, or that despite a failure to keep them safely, the Commissioner's control was still effective over the residual oils: see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 299 (Menzies J). The purported account simply recited the facts, which showed that the residual oils had not been kept safely within the meaning of s 60(1)(a). It was therefore reasonable for the Commissioner not to be satisfied that the goods had been accounted for.

164 As I have found the Commissioner was not entitled to make a request under s 60(1)(b) , a question is raised as to the effect of this on the Commissioner's demand. In the demand, the Commissioner relied on Caltex's failure to keep the goods safely "and/or" its failure to account upon request. For the reasons I have given, it was not open to the Commissioner to rely on a failure to account under s 60(1)(b) to support the demand. Neither party made any submissions as to where this left the demand.</text>

<text>152 Caltex has sought to have the demand set aside for invalidity, on the following grounds:
 
(a) The residual oils are not "excisable goods" and s 60 has no application to them.
 
(b) Section 60 applies only to excisable goods that are "subject to the [Commissioner's] control". If as the Commissioner contended the residual oils were delivered for home consumption, then they were thereupon no longer subject to the Commissioner's control and s 60 does not apply.

The Commissioner acknowledged that it was entitled to request an account only where the safety of the relevant goods is something less than an "undoubted" fact: see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 305 (Owen J); Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 at [14] (Finkelstein J). It said that the section was directed to an account that shows either:

 &#8226; despite a failure to keep them safely, the Commissioner's control over the goods is still effective (see Southern Shipping 107 CLR at 299 (Menzies J))

159 If it were an undoubted fact that Caltex had failed to keep the residual oils safely because it burnt them, then s 60(1)(b) would not be available to the Commissioner: Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579. Conversely, if the position with respect to the residual oils was something less than an undoubted fact, it was open to the Commissioner to invoke s 60(1)(b).

160 It seems to me that it was common ground from the outset that Caltex had consumed all of the residual oils and that no duty had been paid in respect of them. The premise of the Commissioner's conclusion in the Advice that the residual oils had been delivered for home consumption and had not been accounted for (the latter of which, curiously, was not based on any request to account at that stage), was that the residual oils had been burnt by Caltex as a fuel oil. Moreover, in the Commissioner's request under s 60(1)(b) itself, he acknowledged that the residual oils had already been burnt. The only thing that could possibly have remained in any doubt was whether Caltex had paid duty, but that was not the case. The Commissioner had already stated in the Advice that "the [residual oil] that you are manufacturing is no longer present within the licensed premises and duty has not been paid".

161 In my view there was no doubt about the whereabouts of the residual oils or whether they had been, at least on the Commissioner's construction of s 60(1)(a) , kept safely. This is not a case where the location of the goods (and therefore whether they had gone into home consumption) was unknown (cf. Moama [2001] FCA 1287 ; 115 FCR 205) , or a case where the Commissioner only had "evidence which might lead him to form the opinion that excisable goods were not kept safely" (see Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 at [16] ). The facts here were clear the residual oils had been consumed by Caltex at its premises without the payment of any duty.

162 Accordingly I do not consider that the Commissioner was entitled to make the request pursuant to s 60(1)(b): see Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579 at [14] .</text>

<text>83 Assuming they fall within the Schedule, the impost in this case is levied directly on the residual oils as the "subjects of manufacture" and affects them as commodities in the hands of Caltex. The residual oils are of use to Caltex and serve an economic purpose. Without them Caltex would need to acquire fuel oil from an alternative source at higher cost. The impost is not levied upon the consumption of the residual oils by Caltex. Nor is it a tax on the ownership of the residual oils. It is an excise in the most obvious sense; a tax upon the step of manufacturing or producing a defined good. In my view, to accept the limitation contended for by Caltex would be counter to the trend of the High Court's decision making from the early decision in Peterswald v Bartley [1904] HCA 21 ; (1904) 1 CLR 497 through to Ha [1997] HCA 34 ; 189 CLR 465 , which has been to enlarge the field of permissible steps of taxation in the context of duties of excise.</text>

Where two constructions of an instrument are equally plausible, upon one of which the instrument is valid, and upon another of which it is invalid, the court should lean towards that construction which validates the instrument: see Langston v Langston [1834] EngR 190 ; (1834) 2 Cl &amp; Fin 194 ; 6 ER 1128 at 1147; In Re Solomon; Solomon v Solomon [1946] VLR 115 at 120-121; Multiplex Constructions (UK) Limited v Honeywell Control Systems Limited (No. 2) [2007] EWHC 447 at [57].</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>

<text>171 Further, it seems to me doubtful that invalidity would necessarily follow if Caltex's construction of the demand were adopted. By analogy with the approach taken in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [93] , I would ask whether it was a purpose of s 60(1) that to wrongly describe "an amount equal to the amount of the Excise duty which would have been payable ..." as a debt, when it is quite clear what is being demanded and why, should result in invalidity. Caltex did not advance any argument as to why such an error should result in invalidity, whether on a Project Blue Sky approach or otherwise.

172 As I have found the residual oils not to be "refined" or "semi-refined" products, they are not subject to excise duty under item 11 of the Tariff Act. Accordingly the Commissioner's objection decision the subject of the tax appeal must be set aside, together with the demand made by the Commissioner pursuant to s 60(1) of the Excise Act . The Commissioner should pay Caltex's costs of the tax appeal.

173 The s 39B proceeding is in substance dealt with by the result of the tax appeal. But for the agreement referred to at [44] it would have been necessary to fashion orders dealing with the numerous declarations contained in the application. The applicant would have obtained ten of the declarations. The Commissioner would have successfully resisted five other declarations. In the circumstances, the appropriate order is that the proceeding be dismissed and the applicant recover 66 per cent of its costs.

 I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy-three (173) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.
