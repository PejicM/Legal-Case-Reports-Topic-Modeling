<tocase>Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASCA/2000/27.html</AustLII>
<text>131 Whether the parties to an instrument intend to enter into a contract binding at law in the terms of the instrument is a question of fact to be determined objectively: Thompson v White &amp; Ors [2006] NSWCA 350 ; (2007) NSW Conv R 56-171 at [99] , [100] per Tobias JA (Ipp and McColl JJA agreeing). In Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101 , Ipp J (as he then was) referred to the qualities or characteristics of 'completeness' and 'certainty' of the terms of the instrument in question, saying at [23]:
 'Where some terms are uncertain or where terms which one would expect to be in a contract of the kind entered into are missing, inferences may be drawn that the parties lacked the requisite intention to contract.' 
Earlier, his Honour had said at [23]:
 'Thus, in dealing with the overall submission, it is not possible to divorce issues of completeness and uncertainty from the intention to contract.'

132 In undertaking the task of determining, objectively, what the parties' intention was, the Court may have regard to all the relevant circumstances. 'Intention' in this sense means intention to contract, not what the parties intended by the terms of the contract. The relevant circumstances may include prior negotiations or subsequent conduct, although direct expressions of intent made after the contract was arrived at, are not admissible: Bramble Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [26] per Heydon JA; Anaconda Nickel at [26]; Thompson v White at [100].</text>

<tocase>Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1987/15.html</AustLII>
<text>100 As to (1), DFE contends that the warranty was in all circumstances, something so essential to the decision to invest, pursuant to which the deed was being entered into, as to be an essential term of the contract: see Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 632 (reversed on other grounds at (1938) 61 CLR 286) ; Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 556.

102 Additional factors that favour treating clause 5.1(1) as a condition of the contract are (see Ankar, op. cit., [1987] HCA 15 ; 162 CLR 549 at 557):
 
(a) the difficulties in proving quantum of damage as a suitable remedy, as evidenced by the dispute between the experts on this topic;
 
(b) the plain purpose of the clause in facilitating a properly informed decision as to whether to enter into the SSD in the first place; and
 
(c) the special nature of a share subscription deed in the context of an unlisted public company in which an investor legitimately requires that the decision to invest be one that is made on a fully informed basis by way of a contractual obligation on the company, as the repository of the relevant information, to disclose rather than on any obligation for the investor to hunt out and discover. The warranty is only of real utility if it is a condition permitting rescission.

103 To meet this condition, DFE contends that nothing less than provision of a copy of the two heads of agreement, or at least whichever was considered current to Mr Sharp, was required. Indeed, it was of sufficient moment to be annexed to the SSD, but of course then Mr Sharp would not have signed it and he would not have handed over his cheque.

104 As to (2), the accounting experts called on behalf of the parties, Dr Martin Bloom ('Mr Bloom') on behalf of DFE and Mr Paul Carter ('Mr Carter') on behalf of the respondents, appear to be in agreement that if the first heads of agreement constituted a binding agreement, then it should have been disclosed in the financial accounts of APIR for the year ended 30 June 2003: see the common ground referred to in [117] below.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/1999/991.html</AustLII>
<text>174 The pleadings in the SFASC rely on a number of statutory regimes: the regimes under the Corporations Act 2001 ; the ASIC Act; the TP Act and the ACT Act. Section 51AF of the TP Act provides in subs (1) that Part V (Consumer Protection) does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services and subs (2) provides, inter alia , in para (a) that, without limiting subs (1), s 52 does not apply to conduct engaged in or in relation to financial services. The term 'financial services' is defined in s 4 of the TP Act by reference to the meaning it has in Division 2 of Part 2 of the ASIC Act and includes 'dealing' in a 'financial product' (subs 12BAB(1)(b)), which is defined to include a security (subs 12BAA(7)). The term 'dealing' is defined to include applying for or acquiring, or issuing, a security (subs 12BAB(7)). It is clear from these provisions, in my view, that s 52 of the TP Act does not apply to conduct which consists of DFE's application for and APIR's issue of the 200,000 shares at $2.65 per share nor, in my view, to DFE's acquisition of the 81,904 shares in APIR at $2.65 per share from existing shareholders: see Cleary &amp; Anor v Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Ors (Nos. 2 and 3) [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701 per Austin J at [1-107] [1-109]; Re NRMA Ltd; Re NRMA Insurance Ltd [2000] NSWSC 408 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 261 per Santow J at [125] [129].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/16.html</AustLII>
<text>181 Subsection 1041I(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 is predicated on a person having suffered loss or damage by the contravening conduct of another person. Subsection 1325(1) is predicated on a person who is a party to the proceeding having suffered, or likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the contravening conduct of another person. Putting aside that the latter provision also applies where a person is likely to suffer loss or damage, and that the nexus in the former provisions is 'by', and in the latter is, 'because of', there can be no dispute that the loss or damage of which both provisions speak must be an actual loss or damage; risk of loss is not sufficient: Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525. The contravening conduct, while concerned with s 82 and s 87 of the TP Act, is equally applicable to s 1041I and s 1325 of the Corporations Act 2001 in this respect. However, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, in the present context, actual loss meant realised loss and that DFE would suffer no loss, if any, until its shares in APIR were sold; only then would it be possible to say whether or not there is an actual loss. Reliance for this was placed on Wardley Australia, Commonwealth v Cornwell [2007] HCA 16 ; (2007) 229 CLR 519 and Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 , as well as other authorities.

187 The remaining case relied upon by the respondents on this issue, Commonwealth v Cornwell , was a limitation case. It turned on when a loss actually took place in respect of the plaintiff having joined the wrong superannuation fund due to being give the wrong information many years earlier, which he only discovered much later. The High Court found that his actual loss matured only at the end of his service and upon the occurrence of one or more of the statutory contingencies which had to be met for him to be entitled to any statutory benefit at all: at [19]. Until he had an entitlement, which might never arise, he could not suffer a loss in respect of that entitlement.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/22.html</AustLII>
<text>119 The determination of most of the issues in dispute can be achieved without recourse to witness credibility, but by reference to contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. This is helpful because I am mindful of what was said in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [31] for judges:
 '... to reason their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. This does not eliminate the established principle about witness credibility, but it tends to reduce the decisions, where those principles are seen as critical.'

120 There are one or two exceptions where, for one reason or another, such as lack of contemporary documents, recourse to credit is unavoidable in determining the issue in dispute; but even in the case of these exceptions, witness credibility is only one of the determinants. Nevertheless, if only for this reason, I have set out below my general impression of the lay witnesses called on behalf of each party.

121 I was impressed by Mr Sharp and I have no reason not to accept the evidence he gave by way of affidavit or in cross-examination. He was principally cross-examined on issues raised by the cross-claim, but he was also cross-examined on the issue of whether the disclosure of the proposed issue of 50,000 shares to Messrs Hutchings Broso and Riley was made in the context of their becoming employees of APIR and whether he was offered, at least on one occasion, but perhaps on three occasions, a folder of documents described as a 'due diligence folder'. He was forthright and direct in the responses he gave to questions put to him in cross-examination. There was no inconsistency in his recollection and his oral evidence was consistent with such contemporary documentation that was in evidence on the matters upon which he was cross-examined.</text>

<tocase>HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640 </tocase>
<text>183 In HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640 the facts are summarised in the headnote. Before purchasing a small shopping arcade, a prospective purchaser obtained advice from a valuer about the local retail tenancy market, but not the value of the arcade itself. The valuer advised that the construction of a new shopping centre nearby was not likely to affect existing retail tenancy levels adversely. Relying on that advice, in April 1997 the purchaser entered into a contract to purchase the arcade. By March 2000, after the opening of the new shopping centre, the arcade had suffered a collapse in gross rental income with a concomitant fall in value. The purchaser tried to sell the arcade without success.

184 While a central aspect of the decision was the notion that loss was not confined to the loss at the time of acting upon the advice and could include evidence of loss ascertainable later in time but referable to the conduct in issue, the High Court made it clear that if the plaintiff had learned the day after entering into the contract, or the day after completing the contract, that the defendant's conduct had been misleading as later found, it could have started proceedings then and there: at [25] and [28].

185 The High Court, in HTW Valuers , distinguished Wardley Australia on the ground that the case was dealing with risk of loss only: at [29]. That reasoning arises from the fact that Wardley Australia was an indemnity case, so that there was no actual loss unless and until a loss was suffered under that indemnity, which was an event that might never occur. Unlike an asset worth less than was paid for it by reason of misleading or deceptive conduct, an indemnity cannot give rise to a loss until the party providing the indemnity is liable to pay.

188 There is no doubt that when DFE entered into the SSD on 23 January 2004 and paid the sum of $530,000 to APIR in subscribing for 200,000 shares in APIR, it suffered a loss measured by reference to the difference between what it paid in ignorance of the existence of the second heads of agreement and what it, as a rational investor, would have paid, if anything, in the knowledge of the existence of the second heads of agreement; or what was described in HTW Valuers , at [36], by reference to authority, as the 'real value' or 'fair value' or 'what would have been a fair price to be paid ... in the circumstances ... at the time of the purchase'. Similarly, for the 81,904 hares in APIR it purchased from existing shareholders for the sum of $217,045.60.

189 Although the Court is entitled to take into account events after the date of acquisition, when assessing damages by comparing the price and the real value of the asset at the date of the acquisition, in relation to s 82 of the TP Act (see Kizbeau Pty Ltd v W G &amp; B Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4 ; (1995) 184 CLR 281) , it must, as the High Court said in HTW Valuers at [40], '... distinguish among possible causes of the decline in value of what has been bought' and, in doing so, embrace the dichotomy of Dixon J in Potts v Miller (1940) 64 CLR 282 at 298.
 '...If the cause is inherent in the thing itself, then its existence should be taken into account in arriving at the real value of the shares or other things at the time of the purchase. If the cause be "dependent," "extrinsic," "supervening" or "accidental," then the additional loss is not the consequence of the inducement ...'</text>

<tocase>Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1954/72.html</AustLII>
<text>128 The classic statement from Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ, is well known:
 'Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three classes. It may be one in which the parties have reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect. Or, secondly, it may be a case in which the parties have completely agreed upon all the terms of their bargain and intend no departure from or addition to that which their agreed terms express or imply, but nevertheless have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document. Or, thirdly, the case may be one in which the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all, unless and until they execute a formal contract. In each of the first two cases there is a binding contract: in the first case a contract binding the parties at once to perform the agreed terms whether the contemplated formal document comes into existence or not, and to join (if they have so agreed) in settling and executing the formal document; and in the second case a contract binding the parties to join in bringing the formal contract into existence and then to carry it into execution. Of these two cases the first is the more common ...'

130 Such a view is said to have its origin in the High Court's decision in Sinclair Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 317, and has found support in a number of more recent cases. There has been some academic debate on whether a fourth category of case may exist: see, for example, Elisabeth Peden, JW Carter and GJ Tolhurst, When Three Just Isn't Enough: the Fourth Category of the "Subject to Contract" Cases (2004) 20 JCL 156; DW McLauchlan, In Defence of the Fourth Category of Preliminary Agreements: Or Are There Only Two? (2005) 21 JCL 286. It is unnecessary to get involved in that debate. Whether the first heads of agreement falls within the first category of case in Masters v Cameron , or the so-called fourth category of case described in [129] above, it will, in my view, for the reasons outlined below, constitute a binding agreement.

133 Qualification under the first category of cases in Masters v Cameron is predicated on the terms of the instrument being sufficiently complete and certain to evince the requisite intention to contract. In the present case, there was no suggestion that there were terms which one would expect to find in the first heads of agreement which were not there, nor that some of the terms were uncertain. Qualification under the fourth category of cases, if it exists, is predicated on the terms of the instrument being essential to the bargain that the parties wish to conclude, in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract. Here, there was no suggestion that the first heads of agreement did not contain those terms essential to the bargain that APIR and the executive directors wished to conclude, nor could there be.

134 In the present case, the following circumstances, which are relevant by reference to the authorities referred to above, point to a conclusion that the parties, APIR on the one hand and the executive directors on the other, intended to be legally bound by the first and second heads of agreement:
 
(1) The context in which these heads of agreement were negotiated and concluded. Both were negotiated and concluded in the context of efforts by APIR to obtain further capital to deal with its difficult financial position: see [115] above. The first heads of agreement was preceded by the engagement of Newport Capital to provide services directed to raising funds for APIR through various financing strategies (see [9] above) and the resolution offering the executive directors agreements for the on-going provision of their services in accordance with the first heads of agreement, specifically provided that the commencement date of the agreements will be that of the receipt of at least $1,000,000 from new investors. Indeed, further increments in the 'cost of employment' set out in the first heads of agreement were staged by reference to further capital injections; without those, the 'cost of employment' increments could not be met. The negotiations which took place with Mr Gibbon over executive remuneration (see [16] [24] above) were also in the context of Mr Gibbon's proposal to invest in APIR by a subscription for convertible notes and Mr Hutchings Broso's proposed amended resolution 'to the original board Resolution on Exec Remuneration' provided:
 
 
 'The Commencement Date of the Agreements will be the signing of the Convertible Note Deed with new investors sourced by Newport Capital, probably Charles Gibbon and associates.' (see [19] and [20] above.) 
 
 
The second heads of agreement also comes into existence in the context of APIR raising capital, this time from DFE through Mr Sharp. Indeed, the nexus between the heads of agreement and the raising of capital is exemplified in Mr Hennock's first comment on Mr Hutchings Broso's amended proposal on executive remuneration set out in [19] above:
 
 
 'I assume this timing for the commencement of the agreements is so that there is money in the bank to fund them [the executive directors' remuneration packages] rather than the capital raising being a specific milestone which you personally have to achieve.' (see [66] above.) 
 
 
Ultimately, the second heads of agreement was expressed to commence on 1 February 2004, a date by which, it was anticipated as at 14 January 2004, DFE's investment would be on board.
 
(2) The terms of the resolution as recorded in the minutes of the meeting of directors of APIR held on 7 March 2003 (see [10] above), namely:
 
 
 '... RESOLVED by separately executed Resolution last date 4 May 2003 that the two Executive Directors each be offered an Agreement for the on-going provision of their services in accordance with the Heads of Agreement now attached. The commencement date of the Agreements will not be until the receipt of at least $1,000,000.00 from new investors.' 
 
 
(3) The terms of the letter under cover of which the separate resolution and attached heads of agreement were sent to each of the non-executive directors by Mr Riley (see [13] above), in particular the passage:
 
 
 '... The Executive Directors have stated that they are willing to commit to the terms of the suggested Agreement. They have also pointed out that due to the uncertainty surrounding future direction and control of the company, that without an Agreement, they would be put in a position of having no sensible choice but to accept other offers of employment.' 
 
 
(4) The fact that the separate resolution and attached heads of agreement were signed by all five directors of APIR: see [11] and [12] above.
 
(5) The comprehensiveness of the terms of the heads of agreement as to what would be included in the agreement with each of the executive directors and the specificity and certainty with which those terms are detailed: see [12] above.
 
(6) The fact that these documents comprising the first heads of agreement were maintained by Mr Riley in a folder of documents to show to potential investors, which was kept up to date by Mr Riley, at least until 'we got into serious negotiations with Charles Gibbon'. Mr Riley did not remember putting anything into the folder after about September October 2003.
 
(7) The fact that the first heads of agreement was used as the starting point by Mr Hutchings Broso in drafting a 'proposed amendment' to it which was emailed to Mr Gibbon on 6 November 2003: see [18] and [19] above.
 
(8) The communications which took place between Mr Hutchings Broso on the one hand and Mr Gibbon on the other following Mr Gibbon's 'suggested changes' to Mr Hutchings Broso's 'proposed amendment' (see [20] above), in particular, Mr Hutchings Broso's email to Mr Gibbon of 2 December 2003 (see [23] above) where he wrote:
 
 
 '... Given the current state of discussions and the continuing divergence of views, the EDs consider it in their best interests that the framework for these discussions and minimum outcomes be agreed before they step away from the package offered by the existing Board Resolution ...' 
 
 
and Mr Gibbon's letter of 11 December 2003 to Mr Hutchings Broso (see [24] above) in which he wrote:
 
 
 'It appears that there is further need for discussion regarding the legacy issue. For this reason I suggested to Andy (and had reflected in the last version of the Deed) that the remuneration package agreed mid year by the Board be accepted as basis for going forward ...' 
 
 
(9) The fact that the 'proposed amendment' to the first heads of agreement was used as a starting point for having Mr Hennock review and provide his comments on 'ED Remuneration' (see [66] above) and the fact Mr Hutchings Broso's re-write of that draft, incorporating Mr Hennock's comments, became the document circulated to the other directors of APIR on 14 January 2004 under cover of the 'squared away' email (see [69] above) and the second heads of agreement (see [70] above).
 
(10) The fact that the terms of the second heads of agreement were comprehensively embodied, without any change, in the executive employment agreements between APIR on the one hand, and Mr Hutchings Broso and Mr Riley on the other (see [76] above), it being common ground that these latter agreements were binding on the parties to them.

135 The respondents placed some reliance on the following circumstances for the contrary view, that is, that the first and second heads of agreement were not intended to be binding as between APIR and the executive directors:
 
(1) The circumstance that the executive directors were prepared to modify the first heads of agreement in an attempt to accommodate Mr Gibbon in their negotiations with him. At best for the respondents, this circumstance is totally neutral in the objective determination of whether the first heads of agreement was intended to be binding on the parties to it; at worst for the respondents, it carries the inference that the terms of the anterior instrument were binding on the parties.
 
(2) The circumstance that the first and second heads of agreement are expressed to be: 'Subject to shareholder approval ...', and that shareholder approval was not obtained in respect of the first heads of agreement even if the second heads of agreement, in particular the completion payment aspects of it, was discussed and 'sold' to shareholders at the annual general meeting of APIR held on 27 February 2004. But in the case of both heads of agreement, the words: 'Subject to shareholder approval ...' are followed by the words: '... where required ...' and no such approval was required by APIR's constitution. Moreover, even if shareholder approval to the first and second heads of agreement was required by subs 208(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 , failure to obtain it would not invalidate an otherwise binding contract: see subs 209(1).
 
(3) The circumstance that Duesburys Chartered Accountants, Canberra ('the auditors') omitted from the 2003 financial statements any reference to the May 2003 resolution and the first heads of agreement could be seen as an indicia that the first heads of agreement was not binding. The response to this is, of necessity, more convoluted. 
 
 
 (i) First, when conducting the audit, Duesburys must have been told that the deal with Mr Gibbon had already gone ahead to the point of actually executing the first round of convertible notes, because otherwise the error would not have been made in Note 17 to the effect that the convertible notes to the value of $350,000 had been issued and were not just the subject of a term sheet. DFE submitted that this grossly inaccurate information, which survived to the signing of the accounts on or about 28 November 2003 and was not corrected until at least 23 December 2003, casts significant doubt on the accuracy and currency of information that was being supplied to Duesburys. I agree. 
 (ii) Second, for reasons which it is not necessary to delve into, I agree with DFE's submission that it is reasonable to conclude that Duesburys never had the means or the cause to consider whether the May 2003 resolution and the first heads of agreement should have been included in the 2003 financial statements for APIR because they did not know of their existence. At the very least, it would be unsafe to conclude that the 2003 financial statements had omitted from them any reference to the May 2003 resolution and the first heads of agreement because of any considered decision by the auditors that they did not need to be disclosed. 
 (iii) Third, DFE further submitted that had Duesburys been told about the May 2003 resolution and the first heads of agreement at any time up to and including the changes made to Note 17 on or about 23 December 2003, and especially if told about the 12 December 2003 termination of the then current negotiations with Mr Gibbon, that would very likely have resulted in the 2003 financial statements being amended to take this into account. I agree. This is especially so given that Note 17 in its final form included reference to Mr Gibbon's term sheet, despite the negotiations with Mr Gibbon in relation to the convertible notes from the term sheet having been terminated on 12 December 2003.
 (iv) Fourth, Mr Carter suggested, as a matter of 'speculation', that the Note 17 reference to Mr Gibbon's investment may have been promoted by a concern that APIR was not a going concern, noting that APIR had 'a substantial deficit of current assets vis-&agrave;-vis current liabilities but that the auditors' file was silent as to why that note was included'. DFE submitted that Mr Carter's speculation is sound, but that he was in error in suggesting this reason was not revealed in the Duesburys working papers. The auditors' 'going concern' review has a handwritten reference to 'negative working capital' and 'heavy losses' being offset by positive net assets and the $350,000 investment from Mr Gibbon. This was the source of the erroneous Note 17, but still explains the underlying reason for the final Note 17. The final version included not just the mere term sheet (in relation to which negotiations had been terminated) but also other mere negotiations, apparently because of the offsetting impact on 'going concern' worries. DFE submitted that, plainly, even a prospect of incoming investment was considered very important to the auditors in light of the precarious financial circumstances of APIR. It submitted that it is difficult to see why a mere prospect of $500,000 coming in to allay 'going concern' worries would not be at least matched (if not outweighed) by a board resolution and signed heads of agreement providing for $700,000 to be payable in two years if not sooner. Thus the 'going concern' test for inclusion suggested by Mr Carter strongly favours DFE's case as to the first heads of agreement being required to be referred to in the 2003 financial statements even if it was not binding (contrary to DFE's primary position). This also supports the inference that Duesburys did not know about it. I agree with those submissions. 
 (v) Finally, in relation to this circumstance, it is necessary to say something of the note found in the auditors' working papers headed 'Minutes Review' under the further heading '07 March 03':
 'Nothing of audit concern' 
 
 

and that Duesburys were 
 
 
 '... later advised that [the meeting] included consideration of exec contracts put on hold pending negs with potential investor'. 
 
 

DFE submitted that the first heads of agreement was never 'on hold', but nevertheless made the following three observations:
 
 
 (a) No evidence has been led from the respondents as to the precise terms of the communication to the auditors which gave rise to this note. Presumably no evidence could be led by the respondents (or the auditors) that would have assisted the respondents. As to whether the first heads of agreement was in fact 'on hold' is an issue of law and fact to be determined by the Court. The opinion of the person who may have said the first heads of agreement was 'on hold' is not decisive. The evidence in this regard is unsatisfactory in view of there being no precise evidence as to what was actually said. Even if the auditors were expressly told the first heads of agreement was 'on hold', the basis upon which this opinion was expressed is unknown. It all turns upon the intention of the parties. It is the intention of both parties viewed on an objective view of the facts. It is not based upon the subjective view of one of the parties (or an officer of one of the parties).
 (b) The critical issue is whether the parties intended for the first heads of agreement to be binding. It is the respondent's primary position that there was never any such intention. If the auditors were literally informed that the first heads of agreement was 'on hold', at the very least that would mean in all likelihood, contrary to the principal way in which the respondents put their case, there had been a previous intention for the first heads of agreement to be binding. Otherwise, there would be no need for the agreement to be noted as being 'on hold'.
 (c) An unexplained notation of the first heads of agreement being 'on hold' does not (especially if unexplained) impel the conclusion that the parties never intended for it to be binding; nor, viewed in isolation, does it negate the various reasons referred to above as compels a finding that the parties intended for the first heads of agreement to be binding. 
 

I agree with these observations.

136 Finally, even if not as importantly as the circumstances referred to in [125] and [126] above, in cross-examination Mr Hutchings Broso in response to a question that he '... understood from the outset when the heads of agreement were first entered into that that was a binding agreement. Correct?' answered: 'Correct'; and Mr Riley, in response to a question: 'That had the first heads of agreement not been rescinded as you assert, it would have been part of your obligation to reveal to Mr Sharp, as part of the current state of affairs of the company, the first heads of agreement?' answered: 'That's correct.'

137 During the course of cross-examination, Mr Riley gave evidence to the effect that while the first head of agreement was 'valid' (which, for present purposes, I take as synonymous with 'binding') at the time it was concluded (4 May 2003 at the latest), '... it had been tossed out in the course of the negotiation' with Mr Gibbon. A relevant passage from the transcript is instructive:
 'Now, is it the fact that you say that it would have been removed, the May resolution and the heads of agreement, because why would it be removed? What was it that would cause it to be in the due diligence folder to begin with and then removed later on?---Because in early November the discussions with Charles Gibbon had been such that the and it had been agreed at a director's meeting, that the heads of agreement was no longer valid. All right, now, firstly, in the event of their being a resolution by the board that the heads of agreement were no longer valid, there would be a resolution to that effect in writing, wouldn't there? You would agree with that, wouldn't you?---I said it had been agreed by the board. There would be a written minute of the heads of agreement being invalid?---I think in the minutes it says that a new one would have to be drawn up. Yes, well, you were still in the course of negotiating with Mr Gibbon in that regard, weren't you?---Yes, we were. Right, see I would suggest to you that at the very least when you first prepared the due diligence folder, you were of the view that the heads of agreement was binding and valid, that's the reason it was in the folder, that's right, isn't it?---It was there for information for potential investors, yes. And to pick up the language that you've used just a little while ago that at the time you included the heads of agreement and the resolution in the due diligence folder, when you first put it together, you believed, to pick up your words, that it was valid at that time, that's right, isn't it?---That's what I said, yes. Yes and you don't want to change that evidence, do you, because what you told the court was true?---I said it was valid, yes. Yes and I would suggest to you that during the Gibbon negotiation there were proposals to change that valid agreement, wasn't there, the way of melding proposals that you understood had been put by Mr Gibbon?---There was a continuing discussing with Mr Gibbon about executive remuneration and agreements, yes. Yes and that no final agreement was reached between you and Mr Gibbon in respect of a new remuneration agreement, was it?---No, nothing had been finalised, no. And I would suggest to you that you're fully aware that at the time the Gibbon during the course of the Gibbon negotiation, I would suggest to you that your view was that until a new agreement was reached the existing heads of agreement continued to be valid, that's right, isn't it?---I think it had been tossed out in the course of the negotiation. And I would suggest to you that the reason that you had a folder in your possession in November that you say you offered to Mr Sharp which contained, at that time, the heads of agreement, was because at that time, during the course of the Gibbon's negotiation, you knew that those heads of agreement continued to be a relevant, valid document in respect of executive remuneration, didn't it?---No.'</text>

<text>181 Subsection 1041I(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 is predicated on a person having suffered loss or damage by the contravening conduct of another person. Subsection 1325(1) is predicated on a person who is a party to the proceeding having suffered, or likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the contravening conduct of another person. Putting aside that the latter provision also applies where a person is likely to suffer loss or damage, and that the nexus in the former provisions is 'by', and in the latter is, 'because of', there can be no dispute that the loss or damage of which both provisions speak must be an actual loss or damage; risk of loss is not sufficient: Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525. The contravening conduct, while concerned with s 82 and s 87 of the TP Act, is equally applicable to s 1041I and s 1325 of the Corporations Act 2001 in this respect. However, it was submitted on behalf of the respondents that, in the present context, actual loss meant realised loss and that DFE would suffer no loss, if any, until its shares in APIR were sold; only then would it be possible to say whether or not there is an actual loss. Reliance for this was placed on Wardley Australia, Commonwealth v Cornwell [2007] HCA 16 ; (2007) 229 CLR 519 and Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 , as well as other authorities.

186 The High Court also distinguished Murphy v Overton Investments because the contingency upon which the loss was said to arise could never eventuate unless the respondent exercised its discretion to increase the charges above the level disclosed to the applicants, with the undisclosed contingency not having any impact on value such that there was no loss: at [30]. That point of distinction is equally apposite to this case in which any other investor would rationally treat the shares in APIR being worth less with, than without, the binding agreement to issue 20% of its shares to the executive directors.</text>

<text>174 The pleadings in the SFASC rely on a number of statutory regimes: the regimes under the Corporations Act 2001 ; the ASIC Act; the TP Act and the ACT Act. Section 51AF of the TP Act provides in subs (1) that Part V (Consumer Protection) does not apply to the supply, or possible supply, of services that are financial services and subs (2) provides, inter alia , in para (a) that, without limiting subs (1), s 52 does not apply to conduct engaged in or in relation to financial services. The term 'financial services' is defined in s 4 of the TP Act by reference to the meaning it has in Division 2 of Part 2 of the ASIC Act and includes 'dealing' in a 'financial product' (subs 12BAB(1)(b)), which is defined to include a security (subs 12BAA(7)). The term 'dealing' is defined to include applying for or acquiring, or issuing, a security (subs 12BAB(7)). It is clear from these provisions, in my view, that s 52 of the TP Act does not apply to conduct which consists of DFE's application for and APIR's issue of the 200,000 shares at $2.65 per share nor, in my view, to DFE's acquisition of the 81,904 shares in APIR at $2.65 per share from existing shareholders: see Cleary &amp; Anor v Australian Co-operative Foods Ltd &amp; Ors (Nos. 2 and 3) [1999] NSWSC 991 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 701 per Austin J at [1-107] [1-109]; Re NRMA Ltd; Re NRMA Insurance Ltd [2000] NSWSC 408 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 261 per Santow J at [125] [129].</text>

<text>130 Such a view is said to have its origin in the High Court's decision in Sinclair Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 317, and has found support in a number of more recent cases. There has been some academic debate on whether a fourth category of case may exist: see, for example, Elisabeth Peden, JW Carter and GJ Tolhurst, When Three Just Isn't Enough: the Fourth Category of the "Subject to Contract" Cases (2004) 20 JCL 156; DW McLauchlan, In Defence of the Fourth Category of Preliminary Agreements: Or Are There Only Two? (2005) 21 JCL 286. It is unnecessary to get involved in that debate. Whether the first heads of agreement falls within the first category of case in Masters v Cameron , or the so-called fourth category of case described in [129] above, it will, in my view, for the reasons outlined below, constitute a binding agreement.</text>

<text>131 Whether the parties to an instrument intend to enter into a contract binding at law in the terms of the instrument is a question of fact to be determined objectively: Thompson v White &amp; Ors [2006] NSWCA 350 ; (2007) NSW Conv R 56-171 at [99] , [100] per Tobias JA (Ipp and McColl JJA agreeing). In Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101 , Ipp J (as he then was) referred to the qualities or characteristics of 'completeness' and 'certainty' of the terms of the instrument in question, saying at [23]:
 'Where some terms are uncertain or where terms which one would expect to be in a contract of the kind entered into are missing, inferences may be drawn that the parties lacked the requisite intention to contract.' 
Earlier, his Honour had said at [23]:
 'Thus, in dealing with the overall submission, it is not possible to divorce issues of completeness and uncertainty from the intention to contract.'

132 In undertaking the task of determining, objectively, what the parties' intention was, the Court may have regard to all the relevant circumstances. 'Intention' in this sense means intention to contract, not what the parties intended by the terms of the contract. The relevant circumstances may include prior negotiations or subsequent conduct, although direct expressions of intent made after the contract was arrived at, are not admissible: Bramble Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [26] per Heydon JA; Anaconda Nickel at [26]; Thompson v White at [100].</text>

<text>181 Subsection 1041I(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 is predicated on a person having suffered loss or damage by the contravening conduct of another person. Subsection 1325(1) is predicated on a person who is a party to the proceeding having suffered, or likely to suffer, loss or damage because of the contravening conduct of another person.

185 The High Court, in HTW Valuers , distinguished Wardley Australia on the ground that the case was dealing with risk of loss only: at [29]. That reasoning arises from the fact that Wardley Australia was an indemnity case, so that there was no actual loss unless and until a loss was suffered under that indemnity, which was an event that might never occur. Unlike an asset worth less than was paid for it by reason of misleading or deceptive conduct, an indemnity cannot give rise to a loss until the party providing the indemnity is liable to pay.</text>

<text>172 Only (a), (c) and (d) are relied on in the SFASC, but (d), correctly in my view, was not pressed. There is no evidence of any conspiracy between the executive and non-executive directors as groups or among them individually. Moreover, each of (a) and (c) requires a level of knowledge, not necessarily the same level, but absent which a conclusion that a person is involved in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, cannot be sustained. A person will not have aided or abetted such conduct unless it is proven that the person had actual knowledge of the essential elements of such conduct and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 in the joint judgment at 666 669. The words 'party to a contravention' refer to a person who participates in, or assents to, the contravention. To be regarded as participating, a person must have actual knowledge of the essential elements constituting the contravention: Yorke v Lucas at 670. At the same page in the joint judgment, their Honours said: 
 '...There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention. ... In our view ... [in order to be knowingly involved] ... a party to a contravention [needs] to be an intentional participant, the necessary intent being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention.'

173 While the extent of knowledge required to determine that a person is 'knowingly concerned' in a contravention has not been settled, my findings in [157] and [164] above impel the conclusion that none of the non-executive directors satisfied any of the relevant criteria to sustain a conclusion of being involved in the misleading or deceptive conduct of APIR and the executive directors referred to in [170] above.</text>
