<tocase>Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/26.html</AustLII>
<text>More recently the High Court in Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 considered the risks in imputing meaning to a legislative provision, which meaning is not apparent on the face of the provision. As Gibbs CJ said (at 304-305): 
 
 It is an elementary and fundamental principle that the object of the court, in interpreting a statute, "is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used": River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743 , at p 763. It is only by considering the meaning of the words used by the legislature that the court can ascertain its intention. And it is not unduly pedantic to begin with the assumption that words mean what they say: cf. Cody v. J. H. Nelson Pty. Ltd . [1947] HCA 17 ; (1947) 74 CLR 629 , at p 648. Of course, no part of a statute can be considered in isolation from its context - the whole must be considered. If, when the section in question is read as part of the whole instrument, its meaning is clear and unambiguous, generally speaking "nothing remains but to give effect to the generally speaking "nothing remains but to give effect to the unqualified, words": Metropolitan Gas Co. v. Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union [1925] HCA 5 ; (1925) 35 CLR 449 , at p 455 There are cases where the result of giving words their ordinary meaning may be so irrational that the court is forced to the conclusion that the draftsman has made a mistake, and the canons of construction are not so rigid as to prevent a realistic solution in such a case: see per Lord Reid in Connaught Fur Trimmings Ltd. v. Cramas Properties Ltd . [1965] 1 WLR 892 , at p 899; (1965) 2 ALL ER 382 , at p 386. Examples of that sort of case may be found in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes , 12th ed., (1969), at p. 228 et seq., and Craies on Statute Law, 7th ed., (1971), at p. 520 et seq. However, if the language of a statutory provision is clear and unambiguous, and is consistent and harmonious with the other provisions of the enactment, and can be intelligibly applied to the subject matter with which it deals, it must be given its ordinary and grammatical meaning, even if it leads to a result that may seem inconvenient or unjust. To say this is not to insist on too literal an interpretation, or to deny that the court should seek the real intention of the legislature. The danger that lies in departing from the ordinary meaning of unambiguous provisions is that "it may degrade into mere judicial criticism of the propriety of the acts of the Legislature", as Lord Moulton said in Vacher &amp; Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; (1913) AC 107 , at p 130; it may lead judges to put their own ideas of justice or social policy in place of the words of the statute. On the other hand, if two constructions are open, the court will obviously prefer that which will avoid what it considers to be inconvenience or injustice. Since language, read in its context, very often proves to be ambiguous, this last mentioned rule is one that not infrequently falls to be applied.</text>

<tocase>Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd. (1978) 1 WLR 231</tocase>
<text>Similarly, Aickin J observed (at 336-337): 
 
 In Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd . [1978] 1 WLR 231 ; (1978) 1 All ER 948 , five members of the House of Lords dealt with this question and although their speeches differ in emphasis they were united in declining to read words into the Act there in question. Viscount Dilhorne, with whom Lord Fraser of Tullybelton agreed, said [1978] 1 WLR, at pp 234-235; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 951: 
 

 
 
 
 It is now fashionable to talk of a purposive construction of a statute, but it has been recognised since the 17th century that it is the task of the judiciary in interpreting an Act to seek to interpret it "according to the intent of them that made it" (Coke 4 Inst. 330). 
 
 

 
 
 
 If it were the case that it appeared that an Act might have been better drafted, or that amendment to it might be less productive of anomalies, it is not open to the court to remedy the defect. That must be left to the Legislature. 
 
 

 
 
 
 The appellants contend that in view of the anomalies which they say would result from the interpretation the respondent seeks to have placed on the paragraph, to have paragraph 8(2) read as if it said: "who also took part and at the date of the dismissal were taking part in that action". As Stephenson L.J. said in the Court of Appeal, the paragraph does not so provide. 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 "It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do" said Lord Mersey in Thompson v. Goold &amp; Co. (1910) AC 409, at p 420. ". . . we are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself" said Lord Loreburn L.C. in Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim Ltd. v. Evans (1910) AC 444 , at p 445. 
 
 
 

 
 
 Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed with Viscount Dilhorne but added some further observations. After referring to the rule in Heydon's Case [1584] EngR 9 ; (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a , (76 ER 637) his Lordship said [1978] 1 WLR, at p 236; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 953: 
 

 
 
 
 "The final task of construction is still, as always, to ascertain the meaning of what the draftsman has said, rather than to ascertain what the draftsman meant to say. But if the draftsmanship is correct these should coincide. So if the words are capable of more than one meaning it is a perfectly legitimate intermediate step in construction to choose between potential meanings by various tests (statutory, objective, anomaly, etc.) which throw light on what the draftsman meant to say."

At 338-339 Aickin J also endorsed comments of Lord Scarman in Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd . [1978] 1 WLR 231 at 239 where his Lordship said: 
 
 If the words used by Parliament are plain, there is no room for the "anomalies" test, unless the consequences are so absurd that, without going outside the statute, one can see that Parliament must have made a drafting mistake. If words "have been inadvertently used", it is legitimate for the court to substitute what is apt to avoid the intention of the legislature being defeated: per MacKinnon L.J. in Sutherland Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd . [1938] Ch 174 , at p 201 . This is an acceptable exception to the general rule that plain language excludes a consideration of anomalies, i.e. mischievous or absurd consequences. If a study of the statute as a whole leads inexorably to the conclusion that Parliament has erred in its choice of words, e.g. used "and" when "or" was clearly intended, the courts can, and must, eliminate the error by interpretation. But mere "manifest absurdity" is not enough: it must be an error (of commission or omission) which in its context defeats the intention of the Act.

Turning now to the terms of item 2 in the table in s 7.1 of the Principles, I consider that the meaning of the words "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" is plain. There is no ambiguity to warrant further exploration in an attempt to identify the intention of Parliament. The intention of Parliament appears clearly in the words used a reconsideration decision is reviewable when the accreditation body varies (either up or down) the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited. A reconsideration decision where the accreditation body simply confirms its original decision in relation to the period of accreditation is not a decision which "varies" that period and it is not reviewable. To read into "variation" a meaning which includes " no variation" strikes me as absurd, and in stark contradiction to the specific language of s 7.1.

The second respondent submitted that an interpretation which excludes review of a reconsideration decision which merely confirms the original decision of the applicant is potentially artificial and irrational. However an interpretation the result of which is surprising, even illogical, does not mean that that interpretation is not sound or that Parliament did not intend that outcome.</text>

<tocase>The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone (1906) 2 IrR 164</tocase>
<text>The fact that "vary" imports the notion of change in some form has also been endorsed by Courts in different contexts. I note, for example, the following comment of Andrews J in The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone (1906) 2 IrR 164 at 170: 
 
 The Court of Quarter Sessions, it will be observed, is empowered, on hearing the appeal, to confirm, vary or reverse the order appealed against. I think each of these three words has a separate and appropriate meaning. "Confirm" requires no explanation; "vary" in my opinion, means alter in part , as distinguished from discharging the entire order appealed against , and making a wholly different one; and "reverse", in my opinion, imports more than discharge , and means " changed to the contrary ". (emphasis in original)

In R v Industrial Court (S.A.); ex parte Mount Gunson Mines Pty Ltd (1982) 2 I.R 336 at 340, after considering The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone Mitchell J (King CJ and White J agreeing) observed:

<tocase>Vacher &amp; Sons Ltd v London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; [1913] AC 107</tocase>
<text>There is long tradition of Courts assuming that Parliament, through the enactment of legislation, intends what is enacted. As Lord Atkinson said in Vacher &amp; Sons Ltd v London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; [1913] AC 107 at 121-122: 
 
 If the language of a statute is plain, admitting of only one meaning, the Legislature must be taken to have meant and intended what it has plainly expressed, and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be enforced though it should lead to absurd or mischievous results. If the language of this sub-section be not controlled by some of the other provisions of the statute, it must, since its language is plain and unambiguous, be enforced, and your Lordships' House sitting judicially is not concerned with the question whether the policy it embodies is wise or unwise, or whether it leads to consequences just or unjust, beneficial or mischievous.

More recently the High Court in Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 considered the risks in imputing meaning to a legislative provision, which meaning is not apparent on the face of the provision.
