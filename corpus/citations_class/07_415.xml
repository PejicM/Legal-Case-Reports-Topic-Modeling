<text>88 (16) The applicants relied on McLaurin v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1961] HCA 9 ; (1961) 104 CLR 381 (" McLaurin "); Allsop v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1965] HCA 48 ; (1965) 113 CLR 341 (" Allsop "); CSR Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) 171 ALR 392 (" CSR ") (a decision affirmed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v CSR Ltd [2000] FCA 1513 ; (2000) 104 FCR 44) and Advanced Prosthetic Centre Pty Ltd v Appliance &amp; Limb Centre (Int) Pty Ltd (2002) ATR 33 (" Advanced Prosthetic "). These cases were concerned with undissected lump sums paid in settlement of litigation. In all of them it was held, in substance, that where part of the lump sum was clearly received on capital account, it was not open to the Commissioner to bring to tax part of the lump sum as income. The questions that Part IIIA requires to be answered are, however, different. In particular, s 160ZD(4) expressly addresses the situation in which an undissected consideration relates in part only to the disposal of a particular asset. It requires that in these circumstances there must be a determination of "so much of that consideration as may reasonably be attributed to the disposal of the asset".

102 The applicants submit that the Apportionment Agreement was irrelevant. I agree. However, I do not accept their submission that the result in the present case is governed by McLaurin , Allsop , CSR and Advanced Prosthetic (discussed at [88] above), although these cases at least recognise the uncontroversial starting point that absent an apportionment by the parties of the Deed we cannot say that any particular part of the sum of $8,835,083 was paid for any particular asset. They were not cases involving the application of Part IIIA. The starting point of a Part IIIA inquiry is the identification of a "disposal" of an "asset", in each case as defined in that Part.</text>

<tocase>Calverley v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1984) 155 CLR 242</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1984/81.html</AustLII>
<text>64 However, the Tribunal accepted the Commissioner's submission that where joint holders had made unequal contributions to the acquisition of an asset, there being no presumption of advancement, a resulting trust is presumed for them as tenants in common in proportion to the values of their respective contributions to the consideration. The Tribunal referred to Calverley v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1984) 155 CLR 242. The Tribunal said that while there was some evidence as to the value of Claude Cassegrain's possible claim in defamation which he never "commenced", its value was by no means close to $4.25 million. The Tribunal accepted that the onus was on GCC and CFE to establish the value of Claude Cassegrain's rights, and that since they had not done so, it was reasonable to attribute the entire consideration of $9.5 million to the rights given up by GCC, pursuant to s 160ZD(4) of the Act , noted at [60] above.

65 The Tribunal noted that Claude Griffith had given evidence that GCC had claimed deductions for most of its expenses incurred in the joint venture and Cassiro's activities, including concessional deductions for research and development under s 73B of the Act , and that Claude Cassegrain's evidence was that an important objective of the settlement was to recover the amount that GCC had invested in Cassiro. The Tribunal considered that it "would be double counting to allow those costs to be included in the cost base of the asset (rights) given up by GCC" (at para 41). Consequently, the Tribunal found that the cost base of GCC's rights disposed of in the settlement by reason of s 160M(3)(b) (which, the Tribunal observed, effectively treated a release of GCC's rights as a disposal of the rights) was nil, given that the acquisition costs were "either not capital in nature or would be double-counted".

66 In the result, the Tribunal concluded that a capital gain of $9.5 million accrued to GCC under s 160Z, this being the excess of the disposal consideration over the cost base (nil) of the asset given up to acquire that sum.

77 (6) The applicants contend that "the Tribunal's principal error of law was to ignore the terms of the Deed and to re-write it by reference to the principles of resulting trusts". Although I would not describe the finding of a resulting trust as a rewriting of the Deed, I agree with the applicants that the resulting trust principle, recognised in the case of owners of land as joint tenants at law in Calverley v Green , has no application. The trust in question, whether called properly called "resulting" or "implied", is presumed in the absence of evidence of an intention to the contrary. In all the cases in which the principle has been applied of which I am aware, the trust has arisen from the provision of purchase money in a way that does not correspond with the way in which legal title is taken. Perhaps the principle would also apply if, although not in the form of money, the consideration could be regarded as equivalent to money. In the present case, however, the consideration provided for the payment of $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertaking, consisted of releases and contractual undertakings by GCC and Claude Cassegrain separately and jointly and severally.

78 (7) Arguably, a further reason why a Calverley v Green resulting trust did not come into being is that it would be inconsistent with the intention of at least one party to the Deed that it should do so. By making the Apportionment Agreement, Claude Cassegrain showed an intention that was inconsistent with a presumption that he and GCC were to hold the sum of $9.5 million beneficially for themselves as tenants in common in equity in whatever proportions might turn out to reflect the values of their respective contributions to the consideration provided to the CSIRO Parties.

79 (8) So far as I know, no pre-existing asset disposed of by the Deed was owned by GCC and Claude Cassegrain as joint tenants. Each of them had its or his own separate potential claim against the CSIRO Parties. There were the claims already asserted by GCC alone in proceeding NG 3062 of 1992, with the further claims of conspiracy to cheat and defraud, abuse of process and defamation and injurious falsehood to be introduced by way of the proposed second further amended statement of claim (see [26] above). There was also a possible claim of defamation of Claude Cassegrain that had been obliquely referred to in the Cassegrain Letter (see [21] above). It is noteworthy, in passing, and only by way of interest, that in the Cassegrain Letter the amount claimed for defamation was $5 million, which was approximately one eleventh of the total amount of $56,033,000 claimed in that letter. The remaining $51,033,000 was clearly claimed by GCC alone. The sum of $5 million was not claimed for the defamation of Claude Cassegrain alone: it was claimed for defamation of "GC&amp;Co, Cassegrain Family name, Cassegrain Group of companies and Claude Cassegrain and his family". If the sum of $9.5 million were to be regarded as having been paid in conformity, on a pro rata basis, with the Cassegrain Letter, some $850,000 would be treated as having been paid in respect of the threatened defamation claim, of which, apparently Claude Cassegrain would be entitled to some unidentified part, the other parts being in respect of defamation claims by GCC, other unidentified Cassegrain companies, and other unidentified members of the Cassegrain family. There was, of course, no agreement that the Settlement Sum was related to the different elements identified in the Cassegrain Letter.

80 (9) There is no reason to distinguish between CSIRO's paying $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertakings, as making up the consideration for the Cassegrain Parties' releases and other contractual undertakings. In other words, if it were possible to apportion the value of the Cassegrain Parties' releases and contractual undertakings as between GCC and Claude Cassegrain, it would be appropriate to apply those proportions to the sum of $8,835,083 (and, if it should be relevant, to the value of the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertakings).

90 The second, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth questions of law are:
 Second question of law 
 "Did the Tribunal err in law by not concluding that the deed of settlement entered into on 27 September 1993 between G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited, Claude Cassegrain, the CSIRO and Sirotech Limited ("the deed of settlement"), either alone or when considered with the simultaneous payment of $9.5m thereunder to, or at the direction of, G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly, was the only relevant transaction under which a capital gain accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly for the purposes of Part IIIA ...?" 
 
 Fifth question of law 
 "Did the Tribunal err in law by declining to apply s 160ZN(1)(a), ... to the capital gain which accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited and Claude Cassegrain jointly under the deed of settlement for the purposes of determining the amount of the capital gain which accrued to each of them under that transaction?" 
 
 Sixth question of law 
 "Did the Tribunal err in law when it went behind the deed of settlement in order to re-construct the transaction which it consummated in reliance on the doctrine of resulting trusts and the principle of law enunciated in Calverly v Green [1984] HCA 81 ; (1985) 155 CLR 242 [sic] ?" 
 
 Seventh question of law 
 "Did the Tribunal err in law by concluding that the applicants bore an onus to establish the value of the rights which they surrendered under the deed of settlement in favour of CSIRO and Sirotech Limited for the purposes of Part IIIA , ...?" 
 
 Ninth question of law 
 "Did the Tribunal err in law when it concluded that a capital gain of $9.5m accrued to G Cassegrain &amp; Co Pty Limited pursuant to sections 160M(3)(b) and 160Z ... in consequence of its entry into the deed of settlement and the simultaneous payment of $9.5m under it?"

91 The grounds stated in the notice of appeal that relate to the second question of law are directed against the Tribunal's finding of a constructive trust. I agree that the circumstances did not give rise to a constructive trust for reasons that I gave earlier: the case is not one of purchase money (or perhaps its equivalent) for the purchase of property.

92 Ground 4(e) suggests that the consequence of removing constructive trust from the picture is that we are left with the result that a capital gain accrued to GCC and Claude Cassegrain:
 "jointly, and, in consequence, as tenants in common in equal shares despite the operation of the apportionment agreement as a side agreement and, in particular, despite its operation in re-apportioning that settlement amount as between the two of them"</text>

<tocase>Cassegrain v Cassegrain [1998] FCA 811</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1998/811.html</AustLII>
<text>48 It remains to refer to another proceeding between the members of the Cassegrain family, resulting in a judgment delivered by Davies J on 15 July 1998, Cassegrain v Cassegrain [1998] FCA 811. His Honour declared that the actions of Claude Cassegrain in treating the $4.25 million loan account with GCC as his own entitlement to be drawn down at his will, in drawing upon it as he saw fit, and in causing the passing of a resolution of directors allowing for the payment of retrospective interest thereon, were actions which were oppressive of and unfairly prejudicial to the members of GCC.

49 In the course of his reasons, Davies J referred to the Apportionment Agreement. He found that both Gerard and Claude Cassegrain had a keen eye to the reduction of tax. His Honour noted that Gerard probably looked upon the split between GCC and Claude Cassegrain as a tax reduction device, and that since the rate of capital gains tax was 30 percent or thereabouts, the apportionment, if effective, would save GCC almost $1.5 million in tax.

50 His Honour rejected the evidence of Claude Cassegrain that he could not recall discussing any issue of capital gains tax with his father or with Claude Griffith, the accountant. His Honour was satisfied that the apportionment was agreed to with a view to reducing the capital gains tax otherwise payable on the whole $9.5 million. His Honour was satisfied that Gerard Cassegrain and Claude Cassegrain did not, at the time, regard the sum of $4.25 million as Claude's money. His Honour was satisfied that the sum of $9.5 million was paid to GCC and received by it in settlement of its claim against CSIRO, and that no attempt was ever made to arrive at a genuine estimate of a sum for any personal claim by Claude Cassegrain, including any claim falling within the terms of s 160ZB(1) of the Act .

51 After his father's death, Claude Cassegrain drew down on the funds of GCC on the basis that it owed him the $4.25 million. As well, he alleged that he and his father had agreed that GCC would pay him interest on that sum. Since Davies J rejected Claude Cassegrain's claim that the sum of $4.25 million was his own money, it followed that GCC did not owe him that amount. His Honour concluded that by purporting to draw down and to charge GCC interest on it, Claude Cassegrain acted in a manner oppressive of, and unfairly prejudicial to, the other members of GCC.

52 Section 160AX of the Act identifies the object of Part IIIA as being "to provide for net capital gains to be included in assessable income". The section refers to s 160ZO which provides in subs (1) that where a net capital gain accrues to a taxpayer in respect of a year of income, the taxpayer's assessable income of that year includes that net capital gain. Under s 160ZC, capital gains accrued during the year and capital losses incurred during the year are netted in order to arrive at the net capital gain that is included in the taxpayer's assessable income under s 160ZO.

53 Section 160A(a) provides that, unless a contrary intention appears, in Part IIIA the word "asset" means, relevantly, any form of property, and includes a chose in action and any other right, whether legal or equitable, and whether or not a form of property.

67 As what it described as "an alternative ground" for its decision, the Tribunal considered that the Apportionment Agreement was a sham. It is not clear why the Tribunal described this as an alternative ground, because the first ground, the resulting trust ground, did not depend on the effectiveness of the Apportionment Agreement. For the finding of "sham", the Tribunal relied on the findings made by Davies J in the Cassegrain v Cassegrain oppression suit. The Tribunal noted that that case had run for 12 days, and that his Honour had had the advantage of hearing witnesses including Patrick Cassegrain, a co-signatory with his father to the letter of 6 July 1993 to Mr Garrett.

68 After referring to the parties' submissions and to certain authorities relating to "sham", the Tribunal made a series of findings to the following effect: 
 
 
 &#8226; the Apportionment Agreement was not intended to confer on Claude Cassegrain beneficial entitlement to the sum of $4.25 million; rather, the intention was to maximise the after tax amount of the Settlement Sum (the Tribunal referred, in particular, to GCC's delicate position with the Bank, of which Gerard and Claude Cassegrain were conscious; to the threat of receivership; and to Claude Cassegrain's evidence that he went into the mediation with the intention of being able to pay the Bank around $15 million);
 &#8226; in about early 1993, Claude Griffith informed Claude Cassegrain of the tax consequences of GCC's receiving $15 million, and that money received in respect of personal injury was exempt from capital gains tax (a reference to s 160ZB(1) discussed at [58] above);
 &#8226; Gerard and Claude Cassegrain intended to reduce the level of tax so that as much money as possible would be available to be paid to the Bank;
 &#8226; the apportionment was not intended by Gerard and Claude Cassegrain to have legal effect, and the increase by $4.25 million in the balance of Claude Cassegrain's loan account with GCC was, likewise not intended by them to have legal effect;
 &#8226; Claude Cassegrain had told Mr Griffith that the amount (the $4.25 million) was not his, but was the family's money, and that he was holding it for the family because it was better from a tax point of view to make the net (after tax) sum as large as possible;
 &#8226; on 3 February 1994, Claude Cassegrain wrote to the other members of the family advising that GCC had invested some $7.5 million in Cassiro, and that although it had failed, he did recover $6.8 million (which, he agreed in cross-examination, represented approximately the Settlement Sum less legal fees); 
 &#8226; in his statement of 3 February 2004, Claude Cassegrain asserted that he could have had half of the issued shares in Cassiro allotted to himself rather than to GCC, and he regarded GCC's interest in Cassiro as "more or less as if it were held in trust" for him to do with as he wished; 
 &#8226; there was no real relationship between the amounts agreed and any reasonable entitlements of GCC and Claude Cassegrain respectively, the evidence being that GCC had invested over $7 million in the joint venture, while CSIRO's solicitors considered that Claude Cassegrain would not receive more than $0.5 million in damages for defamation and for the other releases and warranties he was required to provide under the Deed (the evidence of Mr Rares SC, as his Honour then was, was that when the Deed was entered into in September 1993, the highest verdict recorded for defamation in New South Wales was $0.6 million, albeit a verdict that excluded a claim for economic loss which, in Mr Rares's opinion, Claude Cassegrain could have successfully made);
 &#8226; despite a book entry increasing GCC's indebtedness to Claude Cassegrain in his loan account with the company, that entry did not reflect the intention of Gerard and Claude Cassegrain, which was to treat the entire $9.5 million as GCC's money for immediate use in paying down GCC's debt to the Bank;
 &#8226; further support for the conclusion that the Apportionment Agreement was sham is found in the findings of Davies J in Cassegrain v Cassegrain referred to above.

69 The Tribunal then proceeded to consider the position that would have obtained if the Apportionment Agreement had not been a sham. The Tribunal said that it would have found that s 160M(6) of the Act , as amended by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No 4) 1992 (Cth), would have applied to the Apportionment Agreement itself. In summary, on the assumption that the Apportionment Agreement vested a beneficial entitlement to the sum of $4.25 million in Claude Cassegrain, the Tribunal's reasoning was that the effect of ss 160M(6), (6A) and (6B) was that GCC created a right that instanteously vested in Claude Cassegrain, that is to say, GCC created an asset that vested without consideration in Claude Cassegrain enforceable against GCC. According to the Tribunal, under the subsections mentioned, GCC would be deemed to have acquired the right immediately before the making of the Apportionment Agreement and to have disposed of it at the time of the making of that Agreement, the cost base of that asset being nil by reason of s 160M(6A)(c). (This approach to the matter leaves out of account the contractual undertakings given by GCC and Claude Cassegrain in the Deed, and treats the entire $9.5 million as payable for the releases and surrenders of existing potential causes of action, of which any of Claude Cassegrain are treated as being of no value.)

70 For all the above reasons, the Tribunal concluded that the objection decisions should be affirmed because GCC and CFE had not discharged the onus of proving that the amended assessments against them were excessive.

114 The applicants submit that the Tribunal did not apply the test of sham that it identified. The submission is that GCC and Claude Cassegrain must have intended the Apportionment Agreement to have legal effect, because Davies J found in Cassegrain v Cassegrain that Claude Cassegrain's conduct in relation to the recording of GCC as being indebted to him for $4.25 million was oppressive towards other shareholders. The contention is that conduct that is a sham cannot be at the same time oppressive and discriminatory.

115 I disagree. A director who steals from a company oppresses the other shareholders even though title to the thing stolen does not pass at law to the director. The notion of oppressive conduct is a wide one. To record GCC as being indebted to him for $4.25 million and to charge the company interest retrospectively on that sum, does not cease to be oppressive merely because shareholders can obtain a judicial determination that the underlying transaction was a sham, that the company did not become indebted for $4.25 million, and that there is no entitlement to interest.

116 There is no inconsistency between Davies J's declaration that Claude Cassegrain had acted in a manner oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the members of GCC by treating the $4.25 million loan account with the company as his entitlement to be drawn down at his will, in drawing upon it as he saw fit, and in causing the passing of a resolution of the directors allowing for the payment of interest retrospectively on that sum, on the one hand, and the Tribunal's finding of sham, on the other hand.

117 I reject the applicants' further submission that a finding of sham in respect of the purported Apportionment Agreement also required a similar finding in respect of the Deed.

118 The applicants submit that the Tribunal erred in referring to the Apportionment Agreement as an agreement made by Claude Cassegrain and his father. However, it was made between them. Claude Cassegrain's mother, Fran&ccedil;oise Cassegrain, and GCC's solicitor, Andrew Walmsley, were onlookers.</text>

<text>113 There was no error in the Tribunal's identification of the test of a sham. The Tribunal asked itself whether the Apportionment Agreement was intended to have the legal effect that it gave an appearance of having, or, to express the same idea differently, whether the parties took steps having the form of a legally effective transaction, which they intended should not have the legal consequences that such a transaction would have. This was the correct question to ask: see Cranstoun v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 75 FLR 220 at 227 228; Richard Walter Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 67 FCR 243 at 257 258; Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 211 ALR 101 at 111.

This was the correct question to ask: see Cranstoun v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1984) 75 FLR 220 at 227 228; Richard Walter Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 67 FCR 243 at 257 258; Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 211 ALR 101 at 111. The Tribunal supportably answered this question in the negative.</text>
