<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant further submitted that having regarded the information as significant, the Tribunal was bound to accord the applicant an opportunity to deal with it: see Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 95 96. Even if the evidence was given no weight (unlike here), there was a real risk of prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence (see Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 629 and Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Applicant VEAL at 96 - 97). Because the exercise of the statutory power is conditioned upon the provision of procedural fairness, the denial of procedural fairness in this case vitiates the Tribunal's decision (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [59] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ).

The applicant observed that most of the evidence contained in the police intelligence reports and housing department records contained allegations of criminal conduct, such as physical assault and intimidation. Very few of the complaints reportedly made against the applicant and recorded in the documents alleged conduct that was not criminal in nature (such as mere 'verbal abuse'). That being the case, to take that evidence into account, the applicant submitted that the Tribunal was required to determine whether the information was 'logically probative' and 'credible, relevant and significant' (see Applicant VEAL of 2002 at 96). According to the applicant, it was also required to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the criminal conduct had in fact occurred.

The applicant submitted that had the Tribunal applied the correct tests, it would not (and could not) have been satisfied that the evidence proved the commission of criminal offences to the requisite standard. As outlined in relation to ground 1, the evidence contained in the police intelligence reports and housing department records consisted largely of assertions and legal conclusions, hearsay and speculation. Yet the Tribunal took it into account and found that it showed a 'pattern of drug-dealing and lawless violence and intimidation' (at [161]). It follows necessarily, in the applicant's submission, that the Tribunal applied an incorrect standard of proof when assessing that evidence.

The applicant submitted that the heart of the Tribunal's error appears at [168] where it states that 'when there is a substantial number of reports from a wide variety of sources all detailing similar conduct, the probability that the picture created is true markedly increases'. This is said to be impermissible reasoning. According to the applicant, it was not open to the Tribunal, when deciding that evidence showed a pattern of criminal behaviour, to find that the volume of allegations placed before the Tribunal made those allegations true or 'markedly' more probably true.</text>

<tocase>Barbaro (Saverio) v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1982) 44 ALR 690</tocase>
<text>The applicant submitted that while the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence (s 33 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth)), it is well established that the right of the Tribunal to inform itself in such manner as it chooses is subject to compliance with the rules of natural justice (see Collins v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1981] FCA 147 ; (1981) 36 ALR 598 ; Barbaro (Saverio) v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1982) 44 ALR 690 and before the Tribunal (1980) 3 ALD 1 at 5). A rationale for the rules of evidence is that decisions should be reached on the best evidence available and by giving the parties affected a fair hearing. This may mean that evidence that is unreliable should not be admitted or, if admitted, should be given little weight or no weight.</text>

<tocase>Browne v Dunn [1893] 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>Finally the applicant submitted that, as an aspect of the rules of procedural fairness, the rule in Browne v Dunn [1893] 6 R 67 required the Tribunal to put these matters to the applicant.

At the forefront of the Minister's submissions was that the applicant had everything that the Tribunal had. The applicant was served with the police intelligence reports and the housing department records prior to the hearing. They were tendered in evidence at the hearing without objection from the applicant. At no point did the applicant say she did not understand what was contained in them or that she had difficulty in knowing what was alleged against her. Indeed, all of this appears to be common ground.

The Minister makes the point that the applicant was cross-examined on the housing department records (reference hearing transcript pp 35 39 and 104 120) and that at p 115 it was specifically put to the applicant that she was aggressive and violent towards Housing Commission staff and other tenants, had dealt drugs from her rented home and, when she could stay there no longer, invaded the homes of others. The Minister submitted that this was more than sufficient to indicate the nature of the allegations contained in the housing department records, which are in any event self-explanatory.

As the evidence from Detective Inspector Galea was consistent with what had earlier been put to the applicant and he was specifically cross-examined on it on the applicant's behalf, there cannot, the Minister submitted, be any unfairness in this case. The Minister further observed that it was obvious that the applicant would deny being a significant drug dealer in Airds because she had previously denied dealing drugs at all; and her representative in closing submissions specifically denied that the applicant was a 'significant player in the drug trade', or indeed a dealer at all. The Minister submitted that the applicant did not need to be specifically recalled to deny the allegation herself; the rule in Browne v Dunn does not apply to inquisitorial tribunals: Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57] per Gummow and Heydon JJ; and that there was no unfairness in the Tribunal's reception of the evidence from Detective Inspector Galea.

<tocase>Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1994/1074.html</AustLII>
<text>In response to the applicant's claim that the Tribunal was obliged to seek specific comment from the applicant about each allegation contained in the police intelligence reports and the housing department records, the Minister submitted that procedural fairness does not so require; it must have been obvious to the applicant that the Tribunal may rely on the allegations contained in these reports and records as they were in evidence before the Tribunal: cf. Puafisi v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 39 at [14] . Moreover, the gist of the allegations contained therein was put to the applicant, and the Tribunal's conclusions from the reports and records were obvious so as not to require specific disclosure: Commissioner for ACT Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591 592; Pilbara Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Affairs [2000] FCA 1113 ; (2000) 103 FCR 539 at 555 557, referred to with approval in NAOA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [25] [28]; Puafisi at [20] [23]. It follows, the Minister submitted, that neither more particulars of that evidence nor the Tribunal's conclusions based on that evidence were required to be put to the applicant.

The weight to be attached to such evidence is a matter for the Tribunal. Having regard to the provenance and nature of the impugned material, one might expect that the Tribunal would not attach the weight to it that it attached to evidence of the applicant's convictions. In my view, that expectation is fulfilled in the passages from the Tribunal's reasons extracted in [68] and [69] above, but also at [168] of the Tribunal's reasons. But at the end of the day, the weight to be attached to such evidence is a matter for the Tribunal and even if it was obvious, and it certainly is not in this case, that the Tribunal attached greater weight to such evidence than might be thought appropriate having regard to its provenance and nature, that would not constitute a denial of procedural fairness to the applicant on the part of the Tribunal. Contrary to the submission of the applicant, nothing was said in Alphaone at 590 592 to make this 'an orthodox application' of the principles there embraced '... to somewhat unusual facts'.

For these reasons, grounds 1 and 2 cannot sustain the application for review. GROUND 3 
 The Parties' Submissions

The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in relying on the police intelligence reports and housing department records and in its findings in relation to those records in that it applied an incorrect standard of proof. The applicant relied on the submissions made in relation to ground 1 and made the following further submissions under this ground.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35].</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI &amp; Anor [2009] HCA 39</tocase>
<text>Nothing was said in the very recent decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v SZIAI &amp; Anor [2009] HCA 39 (23 September 2009) to clarify when those 'strictly limited' circumstances exist. At [25] in the joint judgment, it was said: 
 
 'Although decisions in the Federal Court concerned with a failure to make obvious inquiries have led to references to a "duty to inquire", that term is apt to direct consideration away from the question whether the decision which is under review is vitiated by jurisdictional error. The duty imposed upon the Tribunal by the Migration Act is a duty to review. It may be that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained, could, in some circumstances, supply a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review. If so, such a failure could give rise to jurisdictional error by constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. It may be that failure to make such an inquiry results in a decision being affected in some other way that manifests itself as jurisdictional error. It is not necessary to explore these questions of principle in this case. ...' (Citations omitted)

The second difficulty with this ground in the present case is that on the hearing of the application, the Minister led evidence (Ex. B) as to the summonses he filed at the Tribunal for issue to various courts for the production of files relating to sentences handed down for offences in respect of which the applicant had been convicted; details of the files that were produced; and to the fact that on review of all the documents produced, none contained any sentencing remarks, by way of mitigation or otherwise, beyond those made by Blanch CJ in an appeal to the District Court in June 2006. His Honour confirmed a conviction of the Sutherland Local Court of nine months with a three month non-parole period but which his Honour suspended on condition that the applicant enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of nine months. His Honour took this course, according to the sentence remarks, because the applicant had not been to gaol previously, and bearing in mind the nature of the facts of the charge; hardly mitigating circumstances. In the face of this, the Minister submitted that it could hardly be contended that it was 'obvious' that there was further 'readily available' material which the Minister or the Tribunal could have, but did not, seek out.

The deponent of the affidavit that was Ex. B was cross-examined on a document headed 'Attorney-General's Department New South Wales Court and Tribunal Transcripts', when it was suggested to the witness that following the procedures in that document may have been more productive of transcript of sentencing remarks than the summonses to produce. He was asked: 
 
 'Would you agree that those summonses to produce were unlikely to yield sentencing remarks?---When the summonses were prepared we were trying to be as broad and as inclusive as possible so rather than limiting any request for documents to simply sentencing remarks, we were being more inclusive and trying to look for court files which, if the transcript did exist, we thought would have been contained in the court file that had been requested. 
 

 
 
 But would you agree that having regard to this document which I have just asked you some questions about, transcripts are not kept as a matter of course on court files?---Reviewing this document after the summonses, it looks like there are transcripts kept at this place, on that database, yes.' 
 

 
Two observations can be made concerning this evidence. First, it does not lead to the conclusion that it is 'obvious' that material centrally relevant to an issue whether the applicant is of good character against the criteria of s 501(6)(c)(i) exists; it may exist, but then again it may not. Second, in the face of what was produced in response to the summons, it was not so unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense for the view to be taken that such material was not readily available. It was not, in my view, 'a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact, the existence of which is easily ascertained' (emphasis added), to use the words from the joint judgment in SZIAI at [25].</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 </tocase>
<text>Clearly, the ability to take such matters into account as 'past and present general conduct' (or indeed as 'past and present criminal conduct' for the purposes of s 501(6)(c)(i)) is dependent on a finding that conduct of that description has occurred. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 , a Full Court of this Court held that it was not necessary, for the purposes of taking such conduct into account, for it to have resulted in a conviction. However, the Full Court concluded at 194 that the forerunner of s 501(6)(c) was: 
 
 '... concerned with a person's conduct either "general conduct" or conduct of a more particular kind, described as "criminal conduct". It is not concerned with whether the conduct has had some temporal result, such as the incurring of a conviction, but with the light that the conduct throws on the actor's character. Of course, in the absence of a prosecution and conviction, satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material: see the interesting note by B Robertson, "Criminal Allegations in Civil Cases" (1991) 107 LQR 194. '

In Baker the Full Court also held that the Tribunal may rely on both kinds of conduct (both criminal conduct and general conduct) in deciding whether a person fails the character test and need not anchor its decision in one of the matters mentioned in subparas (i) and (ii). A later amendment to the provisions has made this abundantly clear by the insertion of the words 'either or both of the following' in s 501(6)(c).

Part 2 of Direction No 21 sets out the considerations to which decision-makers must have regard when, if the non-citizen does not pass the character test, exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia.

Paragraph 2.2 provides: 
 
 ' Weight of considerations 
 
 
 
 
 2.2 The Government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa. In making such a decision, a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations. The primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.3 2.16 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.17 2.24. Decision-makers must have due regard to the importance placed by the Government on the three primary considerations, but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations.'

Reference was made to what Deane J said in Pochi at 685: 
 
 '[T]he Tribunal was bound, as a matter of law, to act on the basis that any conduct alleged against Mr. Pochi which was relied upon as a basis for sustaining the deportation order should be established, on the balance of probability, to its satisfaction by some rationally probative evidence and not merely raised before it as a matter of suspicion or speculation.' 
 

 
and to the Full Court in Baker , that 'satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material'.

The Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35].

It might be otherwise if there were no convictions and there was a finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character test under s 501(6)(c)(i) and (ii) by recourse only to the police intelligence reports and the housing department records. In that context, the caution that came out of Baker referred to in [82] above, that there should not be a finding of criminal conduct on 'slight material', may well be apt. But that is not this case.

The only real issue in the context of this case was whether the Tribunal acted capriciously in taking into account conduct referred to in the police intelligence reports and the housing department records of a kind similar to the conduct which constituted offences for which the applicant had been convicted; Ngaronoa (Jacobson J) at [60]. Clearly it did not and, unsurprisingly, there was no suggestion or submission that it did.

This ground cannot sustain the application for review.

The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in finding that the applicant failed the character test under ss 501(6)(c)(i) and/or 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act by taking into account the police intelligence reports and the housing department records concerning the applicant because in doing so it took into account irrelevant considerations. Those reports and records went into evidence; it was not articulated why the matters contained in them were irrelevant considerations to which the Tribunal could not have regard, particularly when they 'showed a continuing pattern of similar behaviour' (similar to the behaviour constituting the offences upon which the convictions were based) and 'paint a similar picture'. There is certainly no prohibition in the Act, express or implied, against taking such considerations into account. The weight to be attached to them is a different matter; it is a matter for the Tribunal, not for this Court on review of the Tribunal's decision.

In my view, this ground has no merit and cannot sustain the application for review.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1980/85.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant observed that facts relevant to a tribunal decision are required to be established on the balance of probabilities: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Pochi [1980] FCA 85 ; (1980) 31 ALR 666 ; Re Kirby and Collector of Customs (1989) 20 ALD 369. The only reference to an applicable standard of proof in Direction No 21 is in para 1.9(a) dealing with 'past and present general conduct' which refers to 'business activities which fall short of criminal fraud requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, but which, on a more likely than not basis are disreputable ...'. According to the applicant, this suggests that when considering whether criminal conduct (of any kind) can be taken into account for the purpose of s 501 of the Act, the Minister (and the Tribunal) is required to apply the standard of proof known as 'the balance of probabilities'.

Reference was made to what Deane J said in Pochi at 685: 
 
 '[T]he Tribunal was bound, as a matter of law, to act on the basis that any conduct alleged against Mr. Pochi which was relied upon as a basis for sustaining the deportation order should be established, on the balance of probability, to its satisfaction by some rationally probative evidence and not merely raised before it as a matter of suspicion or speculation.'

<text>The Minister submitted that the case put by the applicant on this point is similar to that rejected in Ngaronoa v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 1565 (Jacobson J) at [47] [65], affirmed [2007] FCAFC 196 ; (2007) 244 ALR 119 at [10] [12]. While concerning a decision of the Minister personally, the Court stressed the width of the discretion in s 501 and the fact that weight to be attached to evidence was a matter for the decision-maker, in holding that it was open to consider charges for which an applicant had been acquitted in considering the exercise of discretion under s 501(2). Both Jacobson J at [60] and the Full Court at [10] [12] proceeded on the basis that the real issue was whether the Minister had acted capriciously in taking into account the charges for which the applicant had been acquitted, and concluded that he had not. Still less can the Tribunal here be said to have acted capriciously in taking into account material which was obviously relevant. Analysis</text>

<tocase>Prasad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1985/47.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant, while acknowledging that the Tribunal is under no general duty with respect to making inquiries, referred nevertheless to what was said by Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169 170, that a failure to inquire may, in exceptional circumstances, invalidate a decision. The effect of what Wilcox J said in Prasad at 169 170 is that there may be Wednesbury unreasonableness where it is obvious that there is material that is readily available to the decision-maker that is centrally relevant to an issue for determination. Prasad was subsequently endorsed by the Full Court: Luu v Renevier (1989) 91 ALR 39. See also Tickner v Bropho [1993] FCA 208 ; (1993) 40 FCR 183 at 197 198 per Black CJ; C v T (1995) 58 FCR 1 ; see too Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship v Le (Kenny J) [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [65] [67].

The first difficulty with this ground in the present case is that what was said by Wilcox J in Prasad at 169 170 is to be confined to exceptional circumstances; to circumstances which Wilcox J himself described as 'strictly limited'; where it is obvious that there is material that is readily available to the decision-maker that is centrally relevant to an issue for determination. In other words, there is a dual requirement: first, that it is 'obvious' that there is material centrally relevant to an issue for determination; and second, that that material is 'readily available'. Only if both requirements are satisfied would the 'strictly limited' circumstances exist.

Neither requirement of the 'strictly limited' circumstances in Prasad has been made out and this ground cannot sustain the application for review. GROUND 7 
 Applicant's Submissions

Under this ground, the applicant submitted that the Tribunal's discretion under s 501(2) of the Act miscarried either because it did not properly take into account relevant considerations, namely, the mandatory considerations specified in Part 2 of Direction No 21 (para 2.3), or because it took into account extraneous or irrelevant considerations, namely, police intelligence reports and housing department records concerning the applicant. So submitted, the alternative limb of this ground is the same as the alleged error identified in ground 4 albeit in relation to the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant failed the character test under ss 501(6)(c)(i) and/or 501(6)(c)(ii), whereas the alternative limb under this ground goes to the allegation that the Tribunal's exercise of the discretion miscarried. Analysis

However, as noted in [34] above, this ground as crafted in the amended application for review, is not put in the alternative. It is crafted on the basis that relevant considerations were not properly taken into account because irrelevant considerations were taken into account. So construed it cannot sustain the application for review. I therefore propose to deal with it on the basis pressed in the submissions.</text>

<tocase>R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal; Ex parte Bott [1933] HCA 30 ; (1933) 50 CLR 228</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1933/30.html</AustLII>
<text>Reference was made to what Evatt J said in R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeals Tribunal; Ex parte Bott [1933] HCA 30 ; (1933) 50 CLR 228 at 256, when referring to a provision that the Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence: 
 
 'But this does not mean that all rules of evidence may be ignored as of no account. After all, they represent the attempt made, through many generations, to evolve a method of inquiry best calculated to prevent error and elicit truth. No tribunal can, without grave danger of injustice, set them on one side and resort to methods of inquiry which necessarily advantage one party and necessarily disadvantage the opposing party. In other words, although rules of evidence, as such, do not bind, every attempt must be made to administer "substantial justice".'

The applicant submitted that in the present case, the Tribunal's reliance on a large amount of evidence of a general nature, consisting predominantly of hearsay, is made all the more unfair given the highly prejudicial nature of that material and the inability to adduce evidence to the contrary. Regardless of the reasons for which much of that evidence was de-identified (for privacy reasons, say, or because it referred to an informer), the outcome, the applicant submitted, was that there was a serious denial of procedural fairness.

The applicant submitted that it was not open to the Tribunal, in the exercise of the power conferred by the statute, to consider (or make findings based upon) the truthfulness or the seriousness of the matters for which the applicant had been the subject of complaint on the basis of such objectionable evidence. There was an obligation on the Tribunal to seek specific comment from the applicant about the truthfulness or the seriousness of each of the matters which were taken into account. This was plainly not possible given that the evidence was general in nature and the particulars of the allegations were anonymous. This may partly explain why the applicant was not cross-examined at all in relation to some of the allegations or in a fair manner in relation to others. In the applicant's submission, this does not justify the failure but merely highlights the unfairness of the Tribunal relying on such evidence.

Turning to the allegation in ground 2, that the applicant was denied procedural fairness in relation to police allegations that she was amongst other things 'the head of the drug trade' because such allegations were not put to her fairly or at all, including during her cross-examination, the applicant made the following observations: 
(1) At p 168 line 30 of the hearing transcript, Detective Inspector Galea gave evidence that based on intelligence, although there were 'other persons, obviously, dealing drugs', the applicant was 'a major player, a mid-level dealer' of drugs 'in the Airds area' and that she was 'a predominant player there'. The witness repeated at p 171 line 9 of the transcript that the applicant was a 'significant player' in the drug trade and later under cross-examination that she was 'the head of the drug trade' based on police 'intelligence' (p 174 line 34). The Tribunal referred to this evidence at [129] of its reasons and appeared to accept it (at [161], [191] [192]).
 
(2) The police witness also invited the Tribunal to accept that there had been fewer drug reports relating to Airds since the applicant had been detained in Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, that there had been a reduction in the drug trade and social tension and that violent assault and robbery had ceased altogether (seemingly to bolster the claim that she was the head of the drug trade). The Tribunal was further asked (in final submissions) to infer that the number of intelligence reports impugning the applicant far exceeded the number of charges against her because victims were reluctant to complain for fear of reprisals (at [133] and transcript at p 180 lines 3 22).
 
(3) The Tribunal appeared to accept these propositions (at [191] [192]), notwithstanding that the relevant police witness conceded under cross-examination that he had no statistics to prove those assertions and conceded that intelligence is 'not absolute fact' and said that he could not comment upon, and did not know if any informants had a vendetta against the applicant.

The applicant submitted that there was no cogent evidence before the Tribunal to substantiate these highly prejudicial submissions; nor were these matters put to the applicant during cross-examination. The allegations that the applicant was a 'major player' were only raised in Detective Inspector Galea's evidence towards the end of the hearing. The applicant was given no opportunity to address that evidence, either before the hearing or during the hearing. Although she was taken to her criminal record and it was put to her that she had dealt drugs, it would not have been obvious to her that she was alleged to be a leader of the criminal drug trade. Nor was she legally represented so that submissions could be made about the admissibility or permissible use of that evidence.</text>

<tocase>Re Kirby and Collector of Customs (1989) 20 ALD 369 </tocase>
<text>The applicant observed that facts relevant to a tribunal decision are required to be established on the balance of probabilities: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Pochi [1980] FCA 85 ; (1980) 31 ALR 666 ; Re Kirby and Collector of Customs (1989) 20 ALD 369. The only reference to an applicable standard of proof in Direction No 21 is in para 1.9(a) dealing with 'past and present general conduct' which refers to 'business activities which fall short of criminal fraud requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, but which, on a more likely than not basis are disreputable ...'. According to the applicant, this suggests that when considering whether criminal conduct (of any kind) can be taken into account for the purpose of s 501 of the Act, the Minister (and the Tribunal) is required to apply the standard of proof known as 'the balance of probabilities'.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/57.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicant further submitted that having regarded the information as significant, the Tribunal was bound to accord the applicant an opportunity to deal with it: see Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 95 96. Even if the evidence was given no weight (unlike here), there was a real risk of prejudice arising from the admission of the evidence (see Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 629 and Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in Applicant VEAL at 96 - 97). Because the exercise of the statutory power is conditioned upon the provision of procedural fairness, the denial of procedural fairness in this case vitiates the Tribunal's decision (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [59] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ).</text>

<text>As the evidence from Detective Inspector Galea was consistent with what had earlier been put to the applicant and he was specifically cross-examined on it on the applicant's behalf, there cannot, the Minister submitted, be any unfairness in this case. The Minister further observed that it was obvious that the applicant would deny being a significant drug dealer in Airds because she had previously denied dealing drugs at all; and her representative in closing submissions specifically denied that the applicant was a 'significant player in the drug trade', or indeed a dealer at all. The Minister submitted that the applicant did not need to be specifically recalled to deny the allegation herself; the rule in Browne v Dunn does not apply to inquisitorial tribunals: Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57] per Gummow and Heydon JJ; and that there was no unfairness in the Tribunal's reception of the evidence from Detective Inspector Galea.

<tocase>Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 105 ; (2005) 142 FCR 580</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/105.html</AustLII>
<text>Ground 5 alleges that the Tribunal erred in finding that the applicant failed the character test under ss 501(6)(a) and 501 (7) of the Act on the basis that she had a 'substantial criminal record' for the purposes of s 501(6)(a) by reason of the fact that the applicant had received two suspended sentences of 12 months' imprisonment because a suspended sentence is not 'a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more' for the purposes of s 501(7). This ground was only formally pressed because the applicant's counsel rightly accepted that this Court was bound by the decision of the Full Court in Seyfarth v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 105 ; (2005) 142 FCR 580 at [27] where the Full Court decided that s 501(7)(c) is concerned with the sentence that has been imposed on the person rather than the term of imprisonment actually served. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to return to this ground.

Ground 6 alleges that the decision of the Tribunal was vitiated by the failure of the Minister's delegate and the Tribunal to inquire as to the sentencing remarks in relation to each of the applicant's convictions in circumstances where it was unreasonable for it not to make the straightforward administrative inquiry into those matters.

Ground 7 alleges that the Tribunal's exercise of the discretion under s 501(2) miscarried because it did not properly take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the protection of the Australian community and the expectations of the Australian community; two of the three primary considerations referred to in para 2.3 of Direction No 21 (see [26] above). The way the ground is crafted alleges that these primary considerations were not taken into account because the Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations the police intelligence reports and housing department records concerning the applicant but the applicant's submissions were pressed in the alternative: that the Tribunal's discretion miscarried because it failed to take into account relevant considerations or took into account irrelevant considerations.</text>

<text>The Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35].</text>
