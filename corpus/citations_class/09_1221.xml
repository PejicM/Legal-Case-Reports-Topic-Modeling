<text>It may presently be assumed that O 62 r 11 has been properly invoked. Left to one side is a question as to whether the " preliminary decision " of the Deputy District Registrar, albeit a decision given effect by an order, is a " decision " within the meaning of r 11. Also left to one side is the question as to whether or not the Deputy District Registrar had power to make the decision that she did or to make the consequential order. Left unresolved is whether or not the Deputy District Registrar should have referred any question as to the validity of a retainer agreement to a Judge of this Court for resolution. That was the course which was said to be appropriate by the Family Court in Twigg v McIlwraith (1988) 89 FLR 473. As recognised by that Court, it was expected " [a]s a matter of commonsense as well as convenience to the litigants " that the question referred " be one of substance ". And it may further be assumed for present purposes that the " review " to be undertaken is a hearing de novo : Pacific Dunlop Ltd v Australian Rubber Gloves (unreported, FCA, Olney J, 17 August 1993); Boys v Australian Securities Commission [2001] FCA 1440 per Carr J. Whether such an assumption is correct, given the reservation expressed by Hely J in Cachia v Westpac Financial Services Ltd [2003] FCA 817 , need not be now resolved.

<tocase>Catto v Hampton Australia Ltd (In Liq) [2008] SASC 231</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/2008/231.html</AustLII>
<text>That part of the dispute which presently manifests itself is an application by the Trustee to review a decision of a Deputy District Registrar of this Court. On 18 June 2009 Deputy District Registrar Cujes made orders that: 
 
 1. The full taxation proceed on the basis there exists a valid retainer agreement between the First Respondent (Mr Rickus) and his legal representatives for the purposes of the proceedings. 
 

 
 
 2. The First Respondent is granted leave, pursuant to Order 13 sub-rule 2(1) of the Federal Court Rules , to file and serve an amended bill of costs. 
 

 
Those orders were accompanied by a letter from the Deputy District Registrar also dated 18 June 2009 to the solicitors for both the Trustee and Mr Rickus. The letter recorded (in part) what the Deputy District Registrar referred to as her " preliminary oral decision ... in respect of ... the validity of " a written retainer as between Mr Rickus and his legal advisers. The letter helpfully recorded a finding that " the retainer between Mr Rickus and his lawyers was partly oral, partly written and/or partly to be implied by conduct ". Reference was made by the Deputy District Registrar to s 42 of the Legal Practitioners Act 1981 (SA) and to a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Catto v Hampton Australia Ltd (In Liq) [2008] SASC 231. That decision was relied upon as authority for the proposition that " a successful litigant is entitled to recover from the other party amounts paid by the former in connection with the litigation, notwithstanding the unenforceability of any agreement between the litigant and solicitor... ". The letter concluded:
 
 
 I would continue to strongly urge the parties to attend a confidential conference or mediation with a view to, at the very least, narrowing and refining the issues in dispute, but hopefully reaching settlement on a commercial basis.

The Trustee's application for review invokes O 62 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules which provides as follows: 
 
 Every taxation of costs and every decision of a taxing officer shall be subject to review by a Judge.

In summary form, the Trustee seeks to contend that: the Deputy District Registrar's decision is beyond power; and is, in any event wrong as a matter of law. 
Counsel for Mr Rickus contends that:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1878.html</AustLII>
<text>The litigation between the present parties has been ongoing for a considerable period of time. A number of judgments have already been given: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus [2007] FCA 1878 ; Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus [2007] FCA 2117 ; Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus (No 3) [2008] FCA 1986 , 69 ACSR 264 ; Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus (No 4) [2009] FCA 1085. The facts giving rise to the litigation need not be now repeated.

At the comparative outset of the litigation, on 26 November 2007, orders were made that the Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd ("the Trustee") was to pay the costs of Mr Rickus " forthwith " and that such costs were to be paid on an indemnity basis: Motor Trades Association of Australia Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd v Rickus [2007] FCA 1878.

It gives rise to a considerable degree of disquiet to learn that the making of those orders is still occasioning dispute between the parties.</text>
