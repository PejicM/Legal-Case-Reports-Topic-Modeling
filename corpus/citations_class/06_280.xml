<tocase>SZASD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 472</tocase>

<text>3 Accordingly his Honour dismissed the application for review of the Tribunal's decision, for reasons similar to those framed by Driver FM in SZASD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 472 at [5] .

4 The matter came before me by way of a so-called amended notice of appeal (NSD 2193 of 2005), the purported grounds of appeal being as follows:
 
 
 '1. The Honourable court failed to determine whether there was any jurisdictional error in the purported decision of the Tribunal. 
 
 2. The appellant seeks leave to amend his appeal to challenge the delegate's decision. 
 
 3. The delegate of the Minister failed to have a regard to all of the information provided by the appellant. 
 
 4. The delegate of the Minister breached procedural fairness and natural justice.'

5 No particularity of those grounds was articulated by the appellant in the notice of appeal, nor in the course of his statements from the Bar Table. Without at least particularity or other explanation, those grounds are meaningless. It appears that he had consulted with a migration agent named Mollah, who was identified in the reasons for judgment of Mowbray FM, and that those grounds were provided by that migration agent to the appellant.</text>
