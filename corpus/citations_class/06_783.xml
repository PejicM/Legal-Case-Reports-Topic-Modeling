<tocase>Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Australia) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110</tocase>
<text>105 In Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Australia) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117 ('Integrated Computer Services') , McHugh JA (Hope JA and Mahoney JA concurring) observed:
 
 '...a contract may be inferred from the acts and conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words:...The question in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances shows a tacit understanding or agreement. The conduct of the parties, however, must be capable of proving all the essential elements of an express contract:...Care must also be taken not to infer anterior promises from conduct which represents no more than an adjustment of their relationship in the light of changing circumstances.'

106 Further, at 11,118, his Honour observed:
 
 'Moreover, in an ongoing relationship, it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled. Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties' subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties. In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms. It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed.' (Authorities omitted)

108 The assessment of whether the conduct of the parties gives rise to a concluded contract is to be made by reference to the objective standard ( Meates v Attorney General [1983] NZLR 308 at 377; Integrated Computer Services at 11,118).

113 In this regard, the position of the applicant is to be distinguished from the position where the content of one of the party's conduct can provide a basis from which an inference can be drawn that an agreement has been reached, in the sense that the conduct evidences the performance of one or other of its provisions. The position is distinguishable from that in Integrated Computer Services , where McHugh JA said at 11,118:
 
 'By the end of October 1983, I think that the parties had entered into a contract which embraced the seven matters to which I have referred. The terms of the June 1983 arrangement may not have been specific enough to be enforceable. But by June 1984 when access to the VAX was cut off, the parties had acted under the arrangement and given effect to it. What they did is explicable only on the basis of a binding agreement. ...' (emphasis added)

114 Secondly, I accept the submissions of counsel for the respondent that the subsequent conduct of the respondent did not point to the existence of the pleaded variation to the consultancy agreement. The memorandum of 10 July 2000 from Mr Brand to Mr Punch was not, in my view, an item of subsequent conduct evidencing the pleaded variation to the consultancy agreement. In fact, the contrast between the way in which Mr Brand in the memorandum describes the termination payment provisions in relation to Mr Hayes, on the one hand, and the reference to the respondent's 'standard' provision on termination in relation to Mr Rutherford and Mr Jones, on the other, supports an inference that there was a different regime in place for the payment of a termination payment to the applicant when compared to the other consultants. Indeed, the evidence of Mr Lindsay that he had seen the consultancy agreements and they all contained an express clause providing for payment of four weeks' fee for each year of service, serves further to distinguish the contractual position of the applicant (which did not have such a clause in its contract) from that of the other consultants.

115 Thirdly, I do not find that the notation in the respondent's Annual Report for the year ending June 2000 of a contingent liability of $1 575 853 in respect of termination payments for directors and executives, supports the inference that there was a variation to the applicant's consultancy agreement in the terms pleaded. The evidence as to how that sum was derived was unsatisfactory. During his opening counsel for the applicant tendered as exhibit 5 the document described in [94] on the basis that Mr Lindsay would identify this document as one of the documents which he used in deriving the $1 575 853 contingent liability and which he had sent to the respondent's auditors. However, when he came to give evidence Mr Lindsay did not in fact identify exhibit 5 as being the document referred to at par 21 of his witness statement or as being among the documents which he said he sent to the auditors to explain how the sum of $1 575 853 was derived. Further, in his evidence Mr Lindsay said that the contingent liability figure in the 2000 accounts was calculated by reference to a consultant's termination payment being payable on the basis of two months' base pay plus a payment of one month for each year of service. This method of calculation also does not support the applicant's contention that there was a standard practice of paying consultants' termination payments at the rate of one month's fee for each year of completed service. In any event, even if exhibit 5 had been used by Mr Lindsay in deriving the contingent liability figure in the 2000 accounts, the figure of $119 399 in respect of the applicant does not, for the reasons referred to by counsel for the respondent, support the applicant's contention. Neither is that figure of $119 399 explained by the methodology involving the two months' base pay described by Mr Lindsay. This would have resulted in the applicant being entitled to termination payment based on eight months' fee.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1916/81.html</AustLII>
<text>121 The applicant did not make a specific alternative claim that it was entitled to the payment of the termination payment under cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement. However, it followed that if the Court accepted the case advanced by the respondent, it would find that cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement continued. Accordingly, although there was no alternative plea by the applicant founded on the continued existence of cl 8.6, it was a live issue because it was an incident of the case advanced by the respondent at trial (see, Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd (in liquidation) [1916] HCA 81 ; (1916) 22 CLR 490 at 517-518).

122 Clause 8.6 of the consultancy agreement provides:
 
 'In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement for any other reason other than as stated in clause 8.1 hereof or the Term (as extended or renewed) is not renewed the Company shall pay to the Consultant the Fee for the remaining period of the contract or six (6) months whichever is the lesser period.'

123 After trial I asked the parties for submissions on the proper construction of cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement and in particular, whether in the absence of rectification, the word 'lesser' should be construed as 'greater'.</text>

<tocase>Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 290</tocase>
<text>125 In my view, counsel for the respondent's contention cannot be accepted. It is clear that the contractual intention was to provide the applicant with a termination payment of a minimum of six months, regardless of whether the relationship between the parties ended by the non renewal of the term of the consultancy agreement on the expiry of the existing term or by the termination of the agreement (other than for a reason set out in cl 8.1) during the currency of the term, of the consultancy agreement. This construction is consistent with the presence in the clause of the words 'or the Term (as extended or renewed) is not renewed '. The construction contended for by the respondent is inconsistent with the presence of those words in the clause and renders those words otiose. In my view, it is obvious that there was a mistake by the draftsman in using the word 'lesser' when the word 'greater' should have been used to give effect to the obvious intention of the parties. Where there is an obvious mistake the Court can give effect to the true contractual intention of the parties without there being any need for rectification. The principle was expressed thus by Santow J in the case of Spunwill Pty Ltd v BAB Pty Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 290 at 299:
 
 '...Where a court can discern the intent of the parties from an examination of the document as a whole, words may be supplied, omitted or corrected in the instrument, where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency: Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 at 426-427.

In such cases rectification of the document is not required: Re United Pacific Transport Pty Ltd [1968] Qd R 517; Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (at 346).'

126 In the case of Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420 the word 'inconsistent' was read to mean 'consistent'.

127 I have found below that, on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 June 2001, the term was not renewed. I am of the view that on the non-renewal of the consultancy agreement, the applicant became entitled to a termination payment under cl 8.6 of the consultancy agreement. It follows that, in my view, on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 June 2001, the applicant became entitled to a termination payment in a sum equal to six months' fee measured by reference to the annual consultancy fee of $190 000 (exclusive of GST). I will hear the parties on whether a GST component is to be included in that sum, as I apprehend the applicant to contend.

128 The evidence of Mr Hayes and Mr Brand established that there was an agreement by conduct that the consultancy fee of $190,000 per annum payable to the applicant under the consultancy agreement was from the date of the introduction of GST to be a fee that was to be free of GST. In other words, the applicant was entitled to earn that fee exclusive of GST and so it could add the amount of GST payable on the fee to the invoice furnished to the respondent. Such an agreement can also be inferred by the respondent's practice in paying the invoices rendered by the applicant and other consultants after 1 July 2001 which invariably included an additional amount in respect of GST.</text>

<tocase>Brambles Ltd v Wail [2002] VSCA 150 ; (2002) 5 VR 169</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2002/150.html</AustLII>
<text>151 In the case of Brambles Ltd v Wail [2002] VSCA 150 ; (2002) 5 VR 169 ('Brambles') , the Court of Appeal (Winneke P, Charles and Batt JJA) held that where the parties to a fixed term contract for the provision of services had, following the expiry of the fixed term contract, continued to deal with each other on the same basis as prior to the expiry of the term of the contract, there could be an implied or tacit agreement that a new contract between the parties was formed on the same terms as the previous contract except as to the term. The new contract would instead be terminable on reasonable notice.

152 In the course of its reasons the Court of Appeal in Brambles at 185-186, at [57] referred with approval to the following statement which appears in Chitty on Contracts 28th ed, (1999), vol i, p 21, para 1-034:
 
 'There may also be an implied contract where the parties make an express contract to last for a fixed term, and continue to act as though the contract still bound them after the term has expired. In such a case the court may infer that the parties have agreed to a newly expressed contract for another term.'

153 The Court of Appeal also considered at some length the North American cases on this issue and also referred with approval (at 186, at [59]) to the following statement in Corbin on Contracts Rev ed, (1993), vol 1, p 60, para 1.19 ('Corbin') :
 
 'Parties who have made an express contract to be in effect for one year (or any other stated time) frequently proceed with performance after expiration of the year without making any new express agreement, of extension or otherwise. From such continued action a court may infer that the parties have agreed in fact to renew the one-year contract for another similar period. Illustrations can be found in leaseholds, employment transactions and contracts for a continuing supply of a commodity...'

162 According to the authorities approved by the Court of Appeal in Brambles , the relevant conduct that is to be assessed on an objective basis, is the conduct between the parties which occurred after the expiry of the consultancy agreement. Whilst it is possible that events prior to the termination date may colour the inferences to be drawn from the post termination conduct, this does not arise on the facts in this case.

163 I do not regard the fact that in late 1999 and early 2000, Mr Brand and Mr Hayes had discussed the prospect of terminating the consultancy agreement as being of any weight in assessing whether a tacit agreement was made after 30 June 2001. The discussions between Mr Brand and Mr Hayes in late 1999 and early 2000 did not lead to any agreement being concluded between the applicant and the respondent. Further and significantly, those discussions were superseded by subsequent events, including, of course, Mr Brand's own letter of 4 August 2000 and the applicant's letters of 7 August 2000, 9 October 2000, 22 December 2000, 20 February 2001, 14 March 2001 and 29 June 2001. All of these letters show that the applicant throughout this period regarded the consultancy agreement as being on foot, and the letter of 29 June 2001 shows that the applicant was prepared to continue to supply services on the then existing terms of the consultancy agreement after the termination of the consultancy agreement. When viewed in its full context this evidence does not support an inference that there was any abandonment by the applicant of the consultancy agreement prior to 30 June 2001. Rather, the evidence demonstrates a dogged insistence on the part of the applicant on the continued existence of the consultancy agreement right up until the termination date of the agreement and a willingness to continue to provide services on the existing terms thereafter. Insofar as the evidence shows that there was a preparedness by Mr Hayes on behalf of the applicant to consider alternative arrangements, it also shows that Mr Hayes was insistent that such alternative agreement be made and recorded, before there would be any abandonment of the consultancy agreement.

164 Likewise, no weight can be placed on the fact that there was a meeting between Mr Elliott and Mr Hayes in February 2001 where Mr Elliott expressed his dislike of consultancy agreements, and discussed with Mr Hayes the possibility of the applicant terminating the consultancy agreement and coming to a different contractual arrangement with the respondent. This conduct also predates termination of the consultancy agreement. Further, after that meeting, Mr Jordan wrote the letter to the applicant which is referred to in [33] above suggesting Mr Hayes had agreed to terminate the consultancy agreement. However, by his letter dated 14 March 2001 and referred to in [34] above, Mr Hayes rebutted the statements made in the letter and asserted the continuance of the consultancy agreement. This evidence must also be assessed in light of all the evidence including the applicant's other letters referred to in the previous paragraph. The comments I made in the preceding paragraph about the overall effect of that evidence, are equally applicable here.

166 I accept that it is relevant that there was no express response by the respondent of the applicant's letter of 29 June 2001. However, I do not regard this fact as undermining the inference that there was a tacit agreement between the parties that their continuing relationship after 30 June 2001 was to be on the same terms as the consultancy agreement save as to the term thereof. The question of 'silence' or the absence of response to that letter which indicated a preparedness by the applicant to continue to provide services on the existing terms of the consultancy agreement, cannot be looked at in isolation. As is illustrated by the authorities referred to in Brambles , the relevant conduct in assessing whether an agreement is to be inferred, is not confined to the words or absence of words, of the parties. What is crucial is how the parties deal with each other in that period after the expiry of the original term. In this case, on the basis of the findings that I have made, the parties conduct after the expiry of 30 June 2001, when viewed objectively, showed that the parties continued to behave towards each other in the same way as before 30 June 2001.

167 In my view, on the facts that I have found, it is to be inferred that the applicant and the respondent tacitly agreed that the applicant was to provide the services of Mr Hayes to the respondent on the same terms as those in the consultancy agreement, save that the agreement was to be of an indefinite duration. I consider below whether it was a term of that contract that it was terminable on reasonable notice. It follows that I reject the contention of the respondent that the post 30 June 2001 contract between the applicant and the respondent was for the supply by the applicant of Mr Hayes' services on a casual basis at the rate of $75 per hour (exclusive of GST).

168 In [145] above, I said that I would defer consideration of the respondent's contention that there was no forbearance by the applicant during the period 1 July 2001 to May 2003 because the applicant agreed to supply the services of Mr Hayes after 1 July 2001 at a rate of $75 per hour (exclusive of GST) - being the amount reflected in the invoices which the applicant furnished after 30 June 2001.

173 The applicant relied on the Brambles case as authority in support of the proposition that the post 30 June 2001 contract was terminable on reasonable notice.

174 Further, the applicant submitted that, in deciding whether the post 30 June 2001 contract was terminable on reasonable notice, an analogy was to be drawn between the position of an employee under a contract of employment and the position of the applicant under a consultancy contract. It was submitted that, at common law, it was an implied term of any employment contract of indefinite duration that the agreement would be terminable on reasonable notice. The applicant argued that, by analogy, such a term should be implied as a term of the post 30 June 2001 contract between the applicant and the respondent.

175 The respondent argued that it was not necessary to imply a term that the contract be terminable on reasonable notice to give the contract business efficiency. Further, counsel for the respondent submitted, that it was not open to the applicant to rely, by way of analogy, on cases involving an employment relationship.

176 There are similarities between the facts in this case and those in Brambles. In the Brambles case the Court was also concerned with an independent contractor agreement. The contract in that case was a written contract whereby the contractor company, Andar Transport Pty Ltd, was to provide services to Brambles for a period of three years. On the expiry of the term the parties continued to deal with each other in the same way as they had before the term expired. The implication of the reasonable notice term in the successor agreement was necessary to accommodate the circumstance that the initial fixed term had expired and that it was necessary for there to be some procedure for the termination of the agreement. Likewise, in this case, by providing that the consultancy agreement would terminate on the expiry of the fixed term, the parties manifested an intention that the contract, which was essentially a contract for the provision of personal services by Mr Hayes, would be of limited duration. In other words, there was no intention that the respondent would engage Mr Hayes's services through the applicant, for the duration of Mr Hayes' working life. In light of my findings that parties did not transform the contractual relationship after 30 June 2001 into a casual contractor relationship, and, in the absence of an express agreement as to a further fixed term, it is necessary to imply the term that the successor contract be terminable on reasonable notice to give effect to the common intention that the contract was to be terminable in circumstances other than by way of mutual agreement.</text>

<tocase>Martin-Baker Aircraft Co Ld v Canadian Flight Equipment Ld [1955] 2 QB 556</tocase>
<text>177 In my view, it was also open to the applicant to rely, by analogy, upon the position of employees under contracts of indefinite duration. In the case of Martin-Baker Aircraft Co Ld v Canadian Flight Equipment Ld [1955] 2 QB 556, McNair J considered whether a 'reasonable notice' term was to be implied into an agreement, which he characterised as an agency agreement, between a company and an individual. The agreement required the agent to work full time to promote the interests of the company. In deciding whether to imply a reasonable notice clause into the agreement, the learned judge had regard to the nature of the agent's duties and the restrictions imposed upon him. At 581-582 McNair J determined that there were similarities between the duties of, and the restrictions on, the agent and those of an employee. He held that, by analogy, with the implication of a reasonable notice term into an employment contract of indefinite duration, such a term should be implied into the agency agreement. In this case, also, Mr Hayes provided services on a full time basis to the respondent and the analogy with an employee was apt.

178 I find, therefore, that the post 30 June 2001 contract between the applicant and the respondent contained an implied term that the contract was terminable by either party giving to the other party reasonable notice of termination. It also follows from this finding that the provisions in cl 8 of the consultancy agreement, which are premised on the absence of any power in the respondent to terminate the agreement by notice, did not form part of the post 30 June 2001 contract.</text>

<tocase>Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia) Ltd [2000] VSCA 75 ; [1992] 1 VR 567</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2000/75.html</AustLII>
<text>179 The question of what period of notice is reasonable must be assessed at the date when the notice is given, not when the contract is entered into ( Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia) Ltd [2000] VSCA 75 ; [1992] 1 VR 567 ('Quinn') ).

180 As to the question of what period of notice would be reasonable, the applicant relied upon the following observations of Ashley J at 580-581 in Quinn :
 
 'It was common ground that the content of "reasonable notice" is to be determined as at the date when notice is given, not when the contract is entered into. In this context matters occurring antecedently to the making of and in the course of the performance of the contract up to the date of termination are not irrelevant. 
 
 Macken et al Law of Employment , pp 157-8, lists certain pertinent considerations. Thus, for example: the duration of the hiring; industry practice, the seniority of the position held; the importance of the position held; the size of the salary; the worker's age; the worker's length of service; what the worker gave up to come to the present employer; the worker's prospective pension or other rights. 
 
 In the present case I regard as principally important the worker's age when he entered the August 1985 contract, the seniority and importance of, and salary commanded by that position, the fact that the parties would have envisaged in August 1985 as they did in January 1985 that the job would be a long term one, the fact that the plaintiff had given up security to enter the defendant's employment in January 1985 (albeit that this was under a different contract) and the fact that the plaintiff's reasonable expectation of getting superannuation protection was destroyed by the termination which was effected.'

181 The applicant argued that taking into account the senior position Mr Hayes held with the respondent, the consultancy fee payable, the applicant's length of service and Mr Hayes' age, a reasonable period of notice was six months.

182 The respondent argued that such notice as was given to Mr Hayes by Mr Jordan in his conversation with Mr Hayes in April 2003 was reasonable in all the circumstances, and the applicant was, accordingly, not entitled to any greater notice of termination than he received.

183 The factors mentioned by Ashley J related specifically to an employment contract. This was a consultancy agreement. The factors there mentioned are of some assistance as a guide to assessing what would be reasonable notice in a consultancy contract, but each case must be assessed by reference to its own circumstances. Another factor which has been held to be relevant in assessing reasonable notice in a commercial context is the time that it would take for a party to make alternative contractual arrangements (see Crawford Fitting Co v Sydney Valve and Fittings Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 438 at 444-445).</text>
