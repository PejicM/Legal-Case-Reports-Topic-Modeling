<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/63.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The threshold for a serious question to be tried is not particularly onerous. It is not a phrase that contemplates some kind of prediction of the probability of the outcome of the trial; it simply obliges the Court, as a first step in considering the grant of interlocutory relief, to be satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in the principal proceeding and that the interim relief sought will go in aid of the vindication of some legal right asserted by the action. Thus, the serious question must relate to the grant of relief that is sought in the action: see Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 (' Lenah Game Meats' ).

28 The purpose of an injunction pending trial is sometimes described in terms of preserving the status quo. In Lenah Game Meats , Gleeson CJ said at 217 [12] that:
 
 'The justice and convenience of imposing interim restraint, pending the hearing of the final action, if it exists, lies in the need to prevent the practical destruction of that right before there has been an opportunity to have its existence finally established.' 


The applicant's claim for interim relief falls squarely within the scope of this principle, as she seeks to prevent the destruction of her right of internal review in both a legal and practical sense.</text>

<tocase>Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd (2001) 107 IR 117</tocase>
<text>29 It is also relevant for the Court to consider whether damages are an adequate remedy. The summary dismissal without notice of an employee solicitor is a very grave matter. Necessarily, it will have a detrimental effect on her reputation, and may impose a stigma that adversely affects her future career prospects: see Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd (2001) 107 IR 117 (' Rankin' ) at 142 [247]-[252] per Gillard J. For this reason, the applicant contends that damages will not be an adequate remedy.

30 As both counsel have accepted and as some of my questions have made clear, the Court does not embark on anything resembling a trial of the action when it deals with an application for interlocutory relief. The Court will not ordinarily attempt to reach any conclusion as to the facts or matters in dispute, beyond satisfying itself that there is a serious question to be tried, and possibly making other preliminary findings that may bear upon the balance of convenience or the exercise of discretion. That is the course which I will adopt here.

31 Although a number of serious questions were relied on, the case was most strongly put by reference to the rights that were said to arise for the benefit of the applicant under both the Act and the Regulations. The applicant did not lead evidence going to the various facts and events that were said to give rise to the allegations of misconduct. Nonetheless, she submitted that, on the evidence as it stood at the moment, there was a serious question whether it was capable of constituting serious misconduct warranting the summary termination of the applicant's employment. In Rankin , Gillard J said at 142 [250]:
 
 'The authorities do establish that the employee's breach of contract of employment must be of a serious nature, involving a repudiation of the essential obligations under the contract or actual conduct which is repugnant to the relationship of employer-employee, before an employer may terminate the contract summarily. Isolated conduct usually would not suffice. Each case must be considered in the light of its particular circumstances, but nevertheless, the seriousness of the act of termination and the effect of summary dismissal are factors which place a heavy burden on the employer to justify dismissal without notice. The circumstances do not have to be exceptional, but nevertheless, must establish that the breach was of a serious nature.'

32 Having reviewed the evidence, I consider that there is a serious question whether the applicant's conduct was such as to provide a proper basis in law for her summary dismissal. However, in the absence of detailed responding evidence from the applicant, I would describe the serious question as a weak one.

33 The applicant's claim for interim relief based on her statutory rights is stronger. On the material and arguments before me, I consider that it is seriously arguable that the provisions of the Act and Regulations, particularly ss 8, 20(3), 33 and 64 and reg 6, are intended to give an employee a right of internal review before being excluded from employment.</text>

<tocase>Concut Pty Ltd v Worrell (2000) 176 ALR 693</tocase>
<text>36 I turn to consider the balance of convenience and discretionary factors. The issue that has occupied my attention most deeply is the well-known principle that an injunction will not ordinarily be granted to continue an employment relationship where one party has acted to terminate it. That is the ordinary, but not the invariable, rule: see Concut Pty Ltd v Worrell (2000) 176 ALR 693 at 705-707 [51].</text>

<tocase>Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Ltd v Watson [1946] HCA 25 ; (1946) 72 CLR 435</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1946/25.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In the present case, the applicant contended that the employer has repudiated her employment contract, but she has not accepted that repudiation as bringing her employment contract to an end. Indeed, the applicant submited that her employment cannot be terminated without first affording her the statutory right of review to which she is entitled. The consequence is said to be that the purported repudiation has not automatically discharged the applicant's contract of employment: see Automatic Fire Sprinklers Pty Ltd v Watson [1946] HCA 25 ; (1946) 72 CLR 435 at 459, 469-472, 473 and 478. I am satisfied that the applicant's employment agreement has not necessarily been brought to an end, and that declarations of invalid termination could be made in due course if that were appropriate: see Automatic Fire Sprinklers v Watson , supra; Vine v National Dock Labour Board [1957] AC 488.</text>

<tocase>Hill v CA Parsons Ltd [1972] 1 Ch 305</tocase>
<text>38 While courts are generally reluctant to grant an injunction to continue an employment relationship where it has been terminated, in a number of cases the courts have, in view of the special circumstances of those cases, granted an interim injunction to restrain an employer from treating a notice of termination as having terminated an employment relationship. One notable case is Hill v CA Parsons Ltd [1972] 1 Ch 305 (' Hill' ), especially at 314 and 320.

39 The same course was taken by Smith J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Reilly v State of Victoria (1991) 5 VIR 1 (' Reilly' ), especially at 11 to 12. There, his Honour granted an injunction restraining the State of Victoria from acting on a notice of termination of a casual public servant. Other cases to similar effect include: Irani v Southampton &amp; South West Hampshire Health Authority [1985] ICR 590 and Dietman v Brent London Borough Council (1988) IRLR 299; [1987] ICR 737 (' Dietman' ). In Dietman at 754, Hodgson J reviewed several cases where injunctions were granted on an interim basis to restrain a termination of employment: see Crisp v Holden (1910) 54 S.J. 784; Smith v Mcnally [1912] 1 Ch 816; Hill ; Chappell v Times Newspapers Ltd [1975] ICR 145; Jones v Lee [1980] ICR 310 and R v British Broadcasting Corporation; Ex parte Lavelle [1983] ICR 99 at 113. These cases recognise that an interim injunction can be granted to restrain an employer treating a dismissal as valid or effective in circumstances where fair processes or natural justice have not been afforded to the employee in accordance with the contract of employment. In Dietman, the employer had dismissed the employee without adhering to contractual processes that needed to be followed in connection with the dismissal. Hodgson J concluded that the Court can intervene by injunction to prevent the implementation of the dismissal until the proper procedures laid down in the contract have been followed: at 755[B].

45 If any difficulties were to arise, a range of solutions could be found within the public service. In Hill, Denning MR said at 314 [H]:
 
 'If the company did not want [an employee] to come to work, the court would not order the company to give [the employee] work, but so long as [the employee] was ready and willing to serve the company, whenever they required his services, the court would order the company to do their part of the agreement...'. 
 

See also Robb v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council, supra, at 520-523. The decision of the High Court in Jarratt v Commissioner of Police for New South Wales [2005] HCA 50 ; (2005) 221 ALR 95 indicates that the right of an employee to procedural fairness under his or her contract of employment is not easily displaced.

46 In short, while the sort of difficulty identified by Dr Jessup is a real consideration, it does not arise in this case in such a way as to warrant the refusal of relief.

47 The respondents did not dispute that the summary dismissal of the applicant would be likely to inflict reputational damage on the applicant. The summary dismissal has been imposed on the applicant before she has had any opportunity of exercising her rights of review under the Act and the Regulations. It is at least reasonably arguable that the review processes and other protective mechanisms in the Act and the Regulations proceed on the footing that irreparable harm, such as reputational damage, should not be inflicted on an employee until that employee has had the chance of exercising his or her rights of review. It also seems to me that the efficacy of the review process will be enhanced if at the time of any review there is an order in force which prevents the employer from treating the notice of termination as an operative one.

48 In my opinion, the balance of convenience strongly favours the grant of interim relief. Without it, the applicant will be deprived in a legal or practical sense of the full measure of her rights to have her termination notice reviewed and potentially reconsidered. She will also have lost the opportunities to continue in employment pending an internal review, and to avoid the reputational and other irreparable harm that is likely to follow from summary dismissal. Success at final trial, and an award of damages for wrongful dismissal, would not be an adequate remedy in these circumstances. On the other hand, the grant of the injunction will not inflict any significant hardship on the respondents. They will be required to make appropriate and workable arrangements to continue the applicant's employment and to carry out the review process that is mandated by legislation.

49 For the above reasons, I consider that there are serious questions to be tried, and that an evaluation of the balance of convenience and discretionary considerations support the grant of interim relief. The applicant has proffered two undertakings, the first being the usual undertaking as to damages, and the second being an undertaking that she will forthwith institute the review process available to her under regs 6 and/or 8 of the Regulations. I will require that these undertakings be given to the Court.

51 The first order sought corresponds with the form of injunction that was granted in Hill and by Smith J in Reilly . I am satisfied that an injunction in this form is appropriate.</text>

In Dietman at 754, Hodgson J reviewed several cases where injunctions were granted on an interim basis to restrain a termination of employment: see Crisp v Holden (1910) 54 S.J. 784; Smith v Mcnally [1912] 1 Ch 816; Hill ; Chappell v Times Newspapers Ltd [1975] ICR 145; Jones v Lee [1980] ICR 310 and R v British Broadcasting Corporation; Ex parte Lavelle [1983] ICR 99 at 113. These cases recognise that an interim injunction can be granted to restrain an employer treating a dismissal as valid or effective in circumstances where fair processes or natural justice have not been afforded to the employee in accordance with the contract of employment.

Hodgson J concluded that the Court can intervene by injunction to prevent the implementation of the dismissal until the proper procedures laid down in the contract have been followed: at 755[B].

41 Dr Jessup referred me to the policy considerations that underlie the law's traditional reluctance to grant injunctions that will perpetuate an employment relationship. In particular, he submitted that the law recognises that it would be problematical to enforce the continuation of the relationship if the employer and employee have lost faith and confidence in each other. These policy considerations are discussed by Smith J in Reilly at 22-23.
