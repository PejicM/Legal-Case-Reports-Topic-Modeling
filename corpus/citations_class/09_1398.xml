<text>The nature and history of the proceeding
 This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in Boglari &amp; Anor v Coadys (a firm) [2008] FMCA 1277. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application by the appellants to set aside a bankruptcy notice. The bankruptcy notice was founded on a judgment of the County Court of Victoria, which was given in default of defence. The federal magistrate refused to exercise the discretion to go behind the judgment. The substantial question in the appeal is whether this exercise of discretion miscarried, because the federal magistrate did not apply the correct principle.

The respondent is a firm of solicitors. The appellants engaged the respondent to act for them in litigation with another party or parties. The details of that litigation are not relevant to this appeal. The appellants paid the respondent three sums of money in respect of costs and disbursements in relation to the litigation. The respondent alleged that the appellants owed further money. The respondent sued the appellants in the Magistrates Court of Victoria. The appellants counterclaimed for alleged negligence by the respondent in the conduct of the litigation. Their counterclaim was for an amount that exceeded the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court of Victoria. The proceeding was therefore transferred to the County Court of Victoria. On 12 December 2006, the proceeding came before a judge of the County Court for directions. The respondent then filed affidavit material and the proceeding came before another judge on 29 January 2007. That judge directed the appellants to file and serve a defence and counterclaim in proper form and adjourned the matter until 23 February 2007. On that occasion, his Honour struck out the defence and counterclaim because they were not properly pleaded. He refused to give judgment for the respondent then and there, without a formal application for judgment. On 16 April 2007, the judge gave judgment for the respondent for $3,211.15 plus interest of $848.68 and ordered the appellants to pay the costs of the proceeding in the Magistrates Court of Victoria and the County Court.

On 9 July 2008, the respondent procured the issue of a bankruptcy notice directed to both appellants, claiming a debt of $4,659.77. This was made up of the total amount of the judgment, $4,059.83, and interest accrued since the date of the judgment of $599.94. The respondent did not claim anything in the bankruptcy notice in respect of the costs of the proceeding in the Magistrates Court of Victoria and the County Court.

The appellants applied to the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 August 2008. Their application specified that they sought the following orders: 
 
 1) Set aside the Bankruptcy Notice 
 

 
 
 2) Set aside the judgment/ orders of the county court [ sic ] CI 06/ 02602 
 

 That the court revisit/ go behind the judgment of the Hon judge [ sic ] Holt of the County Practice Court 
 To set aside/ or dismiss the above mentioned judgment on the basis that : 
 
 
 
 a) the debt is fictional/ non existent 
 
 

 
 
 
 b) the Practice Court was prejudice [ sic ] due to no legal representation 
 
 

 
 
 
 c) Dismissal of counter claim 
 
 

 Dismissal of defense [ sic ] (not even requested by the Plaintiff/ Defendant by counter claim (Coadys Firm)

Not allowing the improved / clearly outlined Defense [ sic ] to go ahead in front of a judge and jury.</text>

<text>The power of a court on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice to "go behind the judgment" on which the bankruptcy notice is based is a discretionary power. In an appeal from a judgment involving the exercise of discretion, the question for the appeal court is not whether it would have exercised the discretion differently from the court below. The basis on which an appeal court is required to act is set out in the well-known passage in the joint judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-555: 
 
 The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.</text>

<text>The nature of the discretion the exercise of which is sought when a recipient of a bankruptcy notice seeks to set aside that notice by going behind the judgment on which it is based is set out in the joint judgment of North and Finkelstein JJ in Jooss&eacute; v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 245 (2004) 137 FCR 576 at [3] : 
 
 The court can go behind a judgment to determine whether it is founded on a real debt because a sequestration order should not be made on the petition of a person who is not a real creditor. The court has a discretion whether or not to go behind the judgment. The discretion is of a limited kind. In Wren v Mahony [1972] HCA 5 ; (1972) 126 CLR 212 , Barwick CJ, with whom Windeyer and Owen JJ agreed, said (at 224-225) that: 
 

 
 
 
 [t]he Court's discretion ... is a discretion to accept the judgment as satisfactory proof of [the petitioning creditor's] debt. That discretion is not well exercised where substantial reasons are given for questioning whether behind that judgment there was in truth and reality a debt due to the petitioner.</text>

<text>It is also unfortunate that the federal magistrate devoted a significant part of his reasoning to defending the position of the County Court judge in the exchange referred to in [9] above. This was but one passage of several in the transcript of the County Court proceeding before the federal magistrate in which the County Court judge appeared to be suggesting that, unless the appellants could afford to engage a lawyer, or could comply strictly with the rules of the County Court, they would lose the case. It would be a pity if, in the 21st century, any court were to take the view that precise pleadings were always necessary. Because of the decline in legal aid, and perhaps for other reasons, there is a plethora of unrepresented litigants in all courts. As the High Court said in Neil v Nott [1994] HCA 23 ; (1994) 121 ALR 148 at 150: 
 
 A frequent consequence of self-representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy. It has been so in this case. It is necessary to focus on the material placed before Tadgell J and to ascertain whether, on that material, a refusal to extend time bespeaks an error of principle affecting the exercise of the discretion to extend time. 
 

 
It may be that, as was the case in Neil v Nott , what the High Court described at 151 as "misconceived advocacy" by the unrepresented litigant made matters difficult for the County Court judge. Nevertheless, it was apparent from what the first appellant told the County Court judge that he claimed to have a defence of the kind outlined above. Even if it could be said that the purported counterclaim of the appellants, based on alleged negligence by the respondent, was so incompetently drafted as to require striking out, it is difficult to see how the striking out of the counterclaim would justify treating the appellants as if they had no defence to the respondent's claim.

For the foregoing reasons, the federal magistrate's refusal to exercise the discretion to go behind the County Court judgment in favour of the appellants should be set aside. Rather than remitting the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court, I should exercise the discretion myself. My finding that there is a substantial reason for questioning whether the County Court judgment is based on an actual debt leads to the conclusion that the discretion should be exercised in favour of setting aside the bankruptcy notice. The objections to competency

Ground 1 of the respondent's notice of objection to competency is said to have been included because there is a conflict of authority as to whether a judgment given on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice is interlocutory or final. If it were necessary to come down on one side or other of this controversy, I should be inclined to hold that the judgment was final. Subject to appeal, it determined the rights of the parties in relation to the bankruptcy notice. It is true that, if there were to be a creditor's petition, based on an act of bankruptcy constituted by a failure to comply with a demand made in the bankruptcy notice by the due time, there would be further proceedings between the two parties. They would be proceedings instituted separately, however, in respect of different rights from those the subject of an application to set aside the bankruptcy notice. It is unnecessary to determine the controversy, however. Any requirement that there be leave to appeal ought not to be allowed to stand in the way of the appellants in the present proceeding. To the extent necessary, an extension of time to seek leave to appeal should be granted, and leave should be granted to appeal, so that the appeal can be heard and determined in their favour.

Ground 2 of the notice of objection to competency attacks the validity of the grounds in the notice of appeal. It is true that the grounds are not in perfect form. It could hardly be expected of a litigant in person whose first language is not English that he display the skill of a legal draftsperson. Following what the High Court said in Neil v Nott , this is another situation which the Court must not have its attention diverted by the misconceived advocacy of an unrepresented litigant, but must endeavour to ascertain the rights of the parties. There is sufficient substance in the complaints made by the appellants in the grounds of appeal to enable the appeal to proceed. The grounds are directed to criticism of the judgment of the County Court. They do contain considerations that I have held the federal magistrate should have taken into account, namely the fact that the County Court judgment is obtained by default and the allegation that the debt on which the County Court judgment was based was not in fact due. There are sufficient grounds to make the appeal competent.

Grounds 3 and 4 of the notice of objection to competency refer to the fact that the notice of appeal seeks orders having the effect of setting aside the judgment of the County Court. Manifestly, this Court does not sit on appeal from the County Court in relation to judgments for debts. The presence of the claim for orders beyond the powers of this Court does not render the entire notice of appeal incompetent. Grounds 3 and 4 of the notice of objection to competency are not proper grounds for dismissing the appeal as incompetent. The orders sought by the appellants, to which grounds 3 and 4 of the notice of objection to competency relate, simply cannot be made. Conclusion

The appellants' notice of motion, filed on 18 June 2009, must be dismissed. To the extent to which it is necessary, time should be extended to enable the appellants to apply for leave to appeal, and leave should be granted to the appellants to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court. The appeal should be allowed and the orders made by the federal magistrate should be set aside. For those orders, there should be substituted an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice.</text>
