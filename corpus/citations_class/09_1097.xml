<text>In Gray v Associated Publishers (Aust) Pty Limited [2002] FCA 1045 , Branson J considered a similar claim for confidentiality where the respondents produced on discovery documents with the identity and personal details of external editors masked. Her Honour accepted that the respondents wished to protect the privacy of the external editors in the belief that they would object to the disclosure of their personal details to the applicant without their prior knowledge and consent. However, her Honour noted at [13] that, as recognised by Lord Wilberforce in Science Research Council v Nasse [1980] AC 1028 at 1065 cited by Spender J in Mackay Sugar Co-operative Association Limited v CSR Limited (1996) 63 FCR 408: 
 
 There is no principle in English law by which documents are protected from discovery by reason of confidentiality alone.</text>

<tocase>Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Company [1993] FCA 557 ; (1993) 46 FCR 428</tocase>

<text>Apotex agreed to discover documents constituting or recording the process description for the synthesis of Intermediate B and the operating procedure for that process. While API is not subject to the obligation of discovery, Servier had raised with Apotex the possibility of a Sabre order ( Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Company [1993] FCA 557 ; (1993) 46 FCR 428). API then voluntarily provided the documents to Apotex, redacted to remove information that would identify the supplier. This provision was on the basis that the supplier's identity would be protected. Apotex produced documents provided to it by API with the name, address and contact details of the supplier redacted ('API documents'). From the correspondence between the parties, it does not seem to be in dispute that Freehills (Apotex's solicitors) have in their possession documents disclosing the identity of the supplier. Freehills has stated in correspondence that it caused the documents to be redacted in accordance with instructions that the supplier does not wish to be identified. In no document provided to Servier has the identity of the supplier been revealed.

API had requested documents, relevant to the discovery categories, from the supplier. For some time no documents were received from the supplier and Servier asked Apotex for the name, address and contact details of the supplier in order to pursue an application under the Hague Convention. Apotex indicated in correspondence that it could not provide the identity of the supplier as that was the confidential information of API and API did not consent to its disclosure. Eventually, the supplier provided two documents to API, which were produced by Apotex on discovery to Servier ('supplier documents'). Both of those documents were provided on a confidential basis and on the assurance by API that the supplier's identity would be kept confidential. Any redactions on the supplier documents were made by the supplier before they were provided to API.

Subsequently, in response to Servier's requests, API made further approaches to the supplier for documents. At one stage, the supplier expressed a willingness to cooperate in providing further documents but subsequently informed API that no further documents will be provided. When the matter first came before the Court, I requested Apotex to make one further request of the supplier for ten batch records for Intermediate B which the supplier had previously indicated it would review and provide. Apotex was also given the opportunity to make contact with the supplier to advise it of Servier's application to obtain its identity and to determine whether any further documentation or information would be provided in the absence of an order of the Court. To date, no further documentation or information has been produced by the supplier. Servier's reasons for seeking the identity of the supplier</text>
