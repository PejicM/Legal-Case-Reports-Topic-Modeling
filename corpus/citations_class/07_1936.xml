<text>41 In Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 45 ; (2005) 221 CLR 612, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ) recognised and reinforced that an equitable mortgage can be effected by the deposit of title deeds if they were deposited with intent that the land to which they relate be security for payment of a debt. As in that case (discussed at 621, [24]), this is not a case where I need to consider whether to presume an intention to create a security from the relationship of debtor and creditor and the delivery of title deeds: see Bank of New South Wales v O'Connor (1889) 14 App Cas 273 at 282 283; In re Wallis &amp; Simmonds (Builders) Ltd [1974] 1 WLR 391 at 395. I have found that an intention to create the security existed.</text>

<tocase>Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987)</tocase>
<text>44 My attention was drawn to Arnick Holdings Limited and Ankar Pty Ltd v Australian Bank Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division), Bryson J, 4 December 1987) by counsel for Mr Callipari. That case turned on the findings of Bryson J on the evidence. Given my findings of fact, I do not think it assists me in the resolution of this case.

45 Finally, counsel for Mr Callipari submitted in the alternative that Web Wealth has acted in a manner by which it unequivocally surrendered its security. The question was asked rhetorically; if Web Wealth held security why did it not raise the issue earlier than it did? I have considered that question when making my findings of fact. I do not consider that there is anything which indicates that Web Wealth surrendered its security, or acted in a way which amounts to a waiver of its rights to enforce the security or to an election to surrender it or not to enforce it.

46 The parties were agreed upon the appropriate form of orders if I were to reach the conclusion I have reached. I think they are appropriate. I accordingly declare that Web Wealth Pty Ltd has an interest in the fund comprising the proceeds of sale of the land described in Certificates of Title Register Book Volume 9983 Folio 505 and Volume 9593 Folio 463 ("the properties") corresponding to the equitable mortgage in its favour created by the deposit of duplicate certificates of title by Helimount Pty Ltd in January 2005. I also order that the liquidator pay to Web Wealth Pty Ltd such sum as represents the proceeds of sale of the properties less the costs and disbursements of the liquidator in realising the properties.</text>
