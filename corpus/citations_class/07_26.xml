<tocase>Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223</tocase>
<text>24 The applicant contends that the Act does not apply to her and therefore the divestiture order is invalid because s 4(6)(a) is not a valid law of the Federal Parliament. In the alternative the applicant contends that if it is a valid law, nevertheless, the power in s 21A(4) was not engaged in this case because the requirements of s 25(1D) were not met and therefore the divestiture order is invalid. The applicant further contends that even if these two contentions fail, the divestiture order made by the respondent is invalid because, before it was made, the applicant was not accorded procedural fairness. In the further alternative, the applicant contends that the order is invalid because the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest within s 21A(4). In her application and statement of claim the applicant also contended that the divestiture order is invalid because the respondent applied a policy and did not genuinely consider the merits of the matter before him or because his decision was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] EWCA Civ 1 ; [1948] 1 KB 223). At the hearing of the application, those two submissions were abandoned.

25 In relation to the applicant's first contention, the contention may be dealt with by reference to the facts stated to this point. In relation to the applicant's other contentions, I will need to set out the facts in more detail when considering the contentions.

26 Notices under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), were given but none of the Attorneys-General sought to intervene. The Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth appeared for the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399</tocase>
<text>73 In those circumstances, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the respondent's alternative submission that in 2004 there was an acquisition within s 21A(4) when the applicant's former husband transferred his interest in the property to the applicant, who then became the sole registered proprietor of the property. The submissions on this issue went no further than the question of whether or not there had been an 'acquisition' within s 21A(4) in 2004. The applicant submits that by reference to general concepts of real property law there was no acquisition in 2004 because the applicant, who was a joint tenant of the property, was already (ie, prior to becoming the sole registered proprietor) seised of the whole of the estate or interest: Bradbrook MacCallum and Moore, Australian Real Property Law (3 rd ed, 2002) 340 [10.02]. It has been said that a joint tenant cannot assign his or her interest but, rather, one of two joint tenants may enter into a transaction by way of release of the estate: Burton v Mayor etc of London Borough of Camden [2000] UKHL 8 ; [2000] 2 AC 399. In response to this submission of the applicant, the respondent referred to s 12A of the Act . That section relevantly provides:
 
 
 '(3) For the purposes of this Act , a person acquires an interest in Australian urban land even if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person acquires the interest jointly with another person or persons; 
 (b) the person has previously acquired an interest in Australian urban land; or 
 (c) the interest is an increase in the amount of an existing interest of the person in Australian urban land.'

74 I think there was an increase in the applicant's interest within the terms of s 12A(3)(c) when she became the sole registered proprietor of the property and therefore an 'acquisition' within the Act .

75 However, there are a number of further matters which arise once this conclusion is reached and these further matters were not the subject of detailed submissions. They are as follows:
 
 1. The respondent was aware of the proposed acquisition in 2004 and, in fact, agreed to it taking place, although he did so on the applicant agreeing to sell the property and without the formal approval procedures prescribed by the Act being followed.
 2. A question may arise as to whether the power to make an order requiring the applicant to dispose of the whole of the property is engaged, having regard to the particular interest acquired by the applicant in 2004.
 3. The minute containing the recommendations adopted by the respondent makes it clear that it was the acquisition in 1995 which formed the basis of the order made by the respondent under s 21A(4). A question may arise as to whether, in those circumstances, the respondent's decision can only be considered by reference to that acquisition.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>99 In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : 
 
 
 "To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair." 
 
 
 Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' 
 

The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591.

100 The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592):
 
 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.'

102 The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted):
 
 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the "pitch" or "balance" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial "lack of balance". 
 Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: 
 
 
 "Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question."'

103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) :
 
 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not "plausible". Was that a conclusion "which would not obviously be open on the known material"? Or was it no more than a part of the "mental processes" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? 
 Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. 
 In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: 
 
 
 "It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material." (emphasis added) 
 
 
 The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited "to give evidence and present arguments relating to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". (emphasis added) The reference to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" is important.' 
 
 

Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]):
 
 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'</text>

<tocase>Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509</tocase>
<text>120 I am not prepared to infer that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. In the notice of the order dated 23 February 2005 ([7] above) the respondent states that he is satisfied that the acquisition 'is contrary to the national interest'. The minute refers to the provisions of s 21A(4) and to that part of the subsection which refers to the national interest. It is clear that it was a matter which was brought to the respondent's attention. It is true that in terms of the minute the particular matters relevant to the national interest are not clearly identified. Furthermore, the respondent did not give reasons for his decision and he did not give evidence. However, care needs to be exercised in this area because of the broad nature of the concept of the national interest. A court will be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest on the ground that a matter not taken into account was relevant to the national interest or a matter taken into account was irrelevant to the national interest: Leisure Entertainment Pty Ltd v Willis (1996) 64 FCR 205 at 220; Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509 at 525. A court will also be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest under the guise of an argument that it should be inferred from the material before the decision-maker that he or she was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition was contrary to the national interest.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/44.html</AustLII>
<text>50 In Cunliffe v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 44 ; (1994) 182 CLR 272 (at 315-316) Brennan J (as he then was) made the following observations as to the aliens power (at 315-316) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'The power to make laws with respect to aliens, unlike the majority of the powers conferred by s 51 of the Constitution , is not a power to make laws with respect to a function of government, a field of activity or a class of relationships: it is a power to make laws with respect to a class of persons. If, in its operation, a law affects a class of persons with respect to whom there is a power to make laws, the law may have the character of a law with respect to persons of that class. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient that the law should change, regulate or abolish the rights, duties, powers and privileges of the relevant class treated merely as members of the general public or of a substantially wider class than the class of persons who constitute the subject matter of the power. For example, a law which requires notification of symptoms of a disease after entry to Australia by aliens and citizens indifferently is not a law with respect to aliens though it may be a law with respect to quarantine. But if and to the extent that the law discriminates between the public at large and the relevant class of persons (whether textually or in its operation), there is an indicium that the law is a law with respect to persons of that class. That indicium may suffice to give the law the character of a law with respect to persons of that class and, if the discrimination is in a matter peculiarly significant to that class, the law will bear that character. In this respect, the aliens power is similar to the corporations power considered in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd . In that case, s 45D(1)(b)(i) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which protected the businesses of trading corporations was held to be supported by s 51(xx) of the Constitution as a law with respect to trading corporations.'

51 A narrower view of the aliens power has been taken on occasion (see Gaudron J in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 57) but I am satisfied that the views expressed by Brennan J in Cunliffe v Commonwealth (supra) are the principles binding on me. The applicant argued the matter by reference to those principles.</text>

<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>97 In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616):
 
 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that "the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case " . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. 
 Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.'

99 In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed.

It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it.

The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1994/9.html</AustLII>
<text>57 Certain laws have been held to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. Examples include laws which impose a fine or penalty or laws effecting or authorising seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. The test for determining if a law falls outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) has been variously stated. In Mutual Pools and Staff Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1994] HCA 9 ; (1994) 179 CLR 155 Brennan J said (at 179-180):
 
 'Although s 51(xxxi) abstracts from other heads of power the power of acquisition which that paragraph itself confers, it does not thereby abstract the power to prescribe the means appropriate and adapted to the achievement of an objective falling within another head of power where the acquisition of property without just terms is a necessary or characteristic feature of the means prescribed. 
 In each of the cases in which laws for the acquisition of property without the provision of just terms have been held valid, such an acquisition has been a necessary or characteristic feature of the means selected to achieve an objective within power, the means selected being appropriate and adapted to that end. Therefore a law which selects and enacts means of achieving a legitimate objective is not necessarily invalid because the means involve an acquisition of property without just terms. What is critical to validity is whether the means selected, involving an acquisition of property without just terms, are appropriate and adapted to the achievement of the objective. The absence of just terms is relevant to that question, but not conclusive. Where the absence of just terms enhances the appropriateness of the means selected to the achievement of the legitimate objective, the law which prescribes those means is likely to fall outside s 51(xxxi) and within another supporting head of power. If it were otherwise, the guarantee of just terms would impair by implication the Parliament's capacity to enact laws effective to fulfil the purposes for which its several legislative powers are conferred. It would be erroneous so to construe grants of legislative power as to fetter their exercise by implying that s 51(xxxi) precluded the enactment of laws under other heads of power where the laws involved an acquisition of property without just terms, even though laws of that kind are appropriate and adapted to the execution of those powers in the public interest.'</text>

<tocase>Patterson, Re; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291</tocase>
<text>121 The applicant submits that the question whether the Treasurer is satisfied that an acquisition is contrary to the national interest is a jurisdictional fact and that it is not made out if the matters the Treasurer took into account do not support a reasonable and rational conclusion to that effect. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Kirby J in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291, in particular at 504-505 [338]. The reasons of Kirby J do seem to support the submission advanced by the applicant, but I would not apply them in this case. None of the other Justices in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (supra) took a similar approach. For example, Gaudron J, who did discuss the concept of national interest, decided the case on the basis that the Minister asked herself the wrong question (at 417-420 [74]-[82]). If there is a jurisdictional fact in this case it is not whether the acquisition is contrary to the national interest but, rather, whether the Treasurer was satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. A question of that nature would not turn, ordinarily at least, on the Court's conclusion as to whether the material before the Minister provided a reasonable or rational foundation for the conclusion reached by the Minister.

122 I reject the applicant's submission that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest.

123 For these reasons I make the following orders:
 
 1. An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order made by the respondent on 23 February 2005 under s 21A(4) of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act') and relating to the land known as 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia, being the said land comprised in File Plan 42, Allotment 6, Hundred: Yatala; Subdivision: Grange ('the property').
 2. An order in the nature of mandamus, requiring the respondent to exercise his discretion pursuant to s 21A(4) of the Act and relating to the property according to law.</text>

<tocase>Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1943/37.html</AustLII>
<text>55 I was referred to the authorities which have considered the circumstances in which a legislative provision which is partially invalid will be read down: Pidoto v The State of Victoria [1943] HCA 37 ; (1943) 68 CLR 87 per Latham CJ at 108-111; Victoria v The Commonwealth (supra) per Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 501-503. But for s 5A there might have been some difficulties in the way of reading down s 4(6)(a) so that it applied only to non-citizens not ordinarily resident in Australia. For example, there would be the difficulty of a law expressed in general terms and arguably no clear guide as to Parliament's intention as to an appropriate limitation. However, I do not think that those types of difficulties arise here, because by providing in s 5A what is in effect a statutory statement or definition of non-citizens who do and do not fall within the definition of natural persons caught by s 4(6)(a) the Federal Parliament has sufficiently revealed an intention that that subsection should operate in relation to non-citizens even if it is otherwise invalid. Section 4(6)(a) insofar as it applies to non-citizens is a valid exercise of the aliens power.

56 The applicant made reference to the Federal Parliament's power to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws (s 51(xxxi)). Initially, the applicant contended that ss 4(6) and 21A of the Act could not be justified by reference to this head of power because, first, the acquisition was not for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament had power to make laws, and secondly, the acquisition of property was not on just terms. At the hearing, counsel for the applicant said that he was prepared to concede for the purposes of the argument that if there was an acquisition of property it was on just terms. The respondent contends first that ss 4(6) and 21A stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi) and, secondly, that in any event, there was no acquisition of property within the terms of s 51(xxxi). In my opinion, both of the respondent's submissions should be accepted.</text>

<tocase>Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/32.html</AustLII>
<text>29 The scope of the external affairs power has been considered by the High Court in a number of recent decisions. Both parties referred extensively to the decisions in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501 (' Polyukhovich ') and Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416 (' Victoria v The Commonwealth ').

30 In Polyukhovich , Dawson J said of the external affairs power (at 632):
 
 '[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word "affairs" is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word "external" is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase "external affairs".' 
 

The reasons for judgment of the other Justices were to similar effect: Mason CJ at 528-531; Deane J at 599-603; Gaudron J at 695-696; McHugh J at 712-714.

31 In Victoria v The Commonwealth, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 485) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'Of course the scope of the legislative power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. The modern doctrine as to the scope of the power conferred by s 51(xxix) was adopted in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth . Dawson J expressed the doctrine in these terms: 
 
 
 "[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word 'affairs' is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word 'external' is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase 'external affairs'." 
 
 
 Similar statements of the doctrine are to be found in the reasons for judgment of other Justices: Mason CJ; Deane J; Gaudron J; and McHugh J. They must now be taken as representing the view of the Court.'

33 Gleeson CJ referred to the plaintiff's argument to the effect that the external affairs power was limited to a power to make laws with respect to relations between Australia and other countries. He said that to accept that argument would involve overruling the decision in Polyukhovich . Gleeson CJ held that Polyukhovich had been correctly decided and he said (at [10]) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'For this argument to succeed, it would be necessary for the Court to depart from the decision in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth , and to decide that the construction placed upon s 51(xxix) by every member of the Court in that case was wrong. In my view, the Court, upon reconsideration, should hold that Polyukhovich was correctly decided insofar as the decision bears upon the question of construction that arises in this case. Insofar as the decision goes beyond that, and bears, for example, upon Ch III of the Constitution , it is not presently relevant and it is unnecessary and inappropriate to say anything further about it. There was a difference between the view of s 51(xxix) taken by Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J, Gaudron J and McHugh J, on the one hand, and the views of Brennan J and Toohey J on the other. That difference does not affect the point presently in issue. Polyukhovich held that the external affairs power covers, but is not limited to, the matter of Australia's relations with other countries. It also includes a power to make laws with respect to places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of, that is, external to, Australia. That conclusion represents the current doctrine of the Court on the external affairs power, and should be maintained because it is correct.'

34 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ said (at [30]) that the modern doctrine of the scope of the power was as expressed by Dawson J in Polyukhovich (at 632).

35 Kirby J identified what he considered to be a number of difficulties with the 'geographical externality principle' and therefore put it to one side. He decided the case by reference to whether the laws were laws with respect to a 'matter of international concern' [66]-[117].

36 It is well established that the grant of legislative power with respect to external affairs, as with other heads of power, should be construed with all the generality that the words admit.

39 The statement by Dawson J in Polyukhovich refers, among other things, to persons outside the geographical limits of Australia.

40 Clearly, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia might come to Australia from time to time, but I do not think that that means the concept of not being ordinarily resident in Australia lacks an element of externality. To say that a person is not ordinarily resident in Australia means that ordinarily that person is outside the geographical limits of Australia.

41 It follows that one matter, namely, a person not ordinarily resident in Australia, is a matter geographically external to Australia and the other matter, namely, the acquisition of Australian urban land is a matter geographically internal to Australia.

42 The question which arises is whether s 21A(4) and s 4(6)(a) must relate only to matters external to the geographical limits of Australia in order to fall within the external affairs power. If so, this law would fail to meet that test because it only operates when conduct is carried out in Australia, namely, the acquisition of urban land in Australia. The applicant submitted that Polyukovich was authority for the proposition that to fall within the external affairs power a law must deal 'entirely' or 'wholly' with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Dawson J (at 641) and Gaudron J (at 695). The law in Polyukovich did deal entirely or wholly with acts, matters and things geographically external to Australia and it was held to be within the external affairs power. Their Honours' observations are to be read in that context and they are not authority for the proposition that a law only falls within the external affairs power if it deals entirely or wholly with a place, person, matter or thing geographically external to Australia.

43 I do not think the mere fact that the law is only engaged if conduct occurs within Australia of itself disqualifies the law from being a law with respect to external affairs. There seems to be no reason to say that simply because the law also relates to conduct in Australia or produces a certain result or effect in Australia that it is not a law with respect to external affairs. I reject the applicant's submission that s 4(6)(a) is invalid because it does not deal entirely with places, persons, matters or things outside the geographical limits of Australia.

44 The applicant submits in the alternative that the relevant provisions are not a law with respect to external affairs because the element of geographical externality is insufficient and because the pith and substance of the relevant provisions is conduct in Australia.

45 The question raised by that submission is not an easy one. It requires a characterisation of the relevant provisions. In Polyukhovich , Deane J said (at 602):
 
 'Whatever may have been the position before the emergence of Australia as a fully independent sovereign State, it should now be accepted that any law which can properly be characterized as a law with respect to any matter, thing or person occurring or situate outside Australia is a law with respect to "External affairs" for the purposes of s 51(xxix). In referring to " a law with respect to any matter ... occurring ... outside Australia" , I intend to include, among other things, what Jacobs J described (see above) as "any matter or thing done or to be done or prohibited to be done outside the boundaries of the Commonwealth". As has been mentioned, that broad view of the scope of the power conforms with settled principles of constitutional construction.'

46 The relevant provisions only operate in relation to a class of persons who are geographically external to Australia. I think this can be said even though the actual criterion is that the person is not ordinarily resident in Australia. They are the only persons affected by the relevant provisions. The location of the class of persons affected by the relevant provisions is an important characteristic of them, albeit that another feature of them is conduct within Australia, that is to say, the acquisition of Australian urban land. In my opinion, for the purposes of determining whether the relevant provisions are a law with respect to external affairs, it is sufficient that the relevant provisions apply only to a class of persons geographically external to Australia.

47 In my opinion, the relevant provisions are a valid exercise of the external affairs power.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>70 An effective notice not having been given, the second question is whether the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. The circumstances in which an act done in breach of a condition regulating the exercise of a statutory power will invalidate that exercise were considered by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-390 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. Their Honours said that the relevant question is not whether the condition is mandatory or directory, but whether, by reference to the language of the relevant provision or provisions and the scope and object of the statute as a whole, it was a purpose of the legislation to invalidate an act done in breach of the condition.

71 In my opinion, by reason of the terms of s 25 , the operation of s 25(1D) is contingent upon the giving of an effective notice. Section 25(1) provides that the section has effect where the Treasurer receives a notice. Section 25(1D) refers to 'advice' given under s 25(1B). The 'advice' is of a decision under s 25(1A) , and a decision under s 25(1A) relates to 'the acquisition ... specified in the notice' and the decision which may be made is that there is 'no objection to the proposal specified in the notice'. Furthermore, the offence of contravening a condition referred to in s 25(1C) is linked to the advice of a decision under s 25(1B). In my opinion, there was no effective decision and therefore advice within the provisions of s 25 because there was no proposal specified in a notice and there was no proposal specified in a notice because the purported notice was not effective for the purposes of s 25(1A).

72 As far as the acquisition which took place in 1995 is concerned, s 25(1D) did not operate as a bar to the respondent exercising the power in s 21A(4). It was the acquisition which took place in 1995 which was relied on by the respondent for the purposes of his decision to make the divestiture order.</text>

<tocase>Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109</tocase>
<text>97 In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616):
 
 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that "the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case " . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. 
 Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.'</text>

 'The power conferred by s 51(xix) supports legislation determining those to whom is attributed the status of alien; the Parliament may make laws which impose upon those having this status burdens, obligations and disqualifications which the Parliament could not impose upon other persons. On the other hand, by a law with respect to naturalisation, the Parliament may remove that status, absolutely or upon conditions.

<text>61 I also agree with the respondent's second submission that in any event the degree of impairment of the applicant's rights with respect to the property is insufficient to attract the operation of s 51(xxxi). In Waterhouse v Minister for the Arts and Territories (1992) 43 FCR 175 the power of a Minister to grant or withhold a permit for an object to be exported to a purchaser under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 (Cth) was held to be an insufficient impairment of the rights of the owner of a valuable Australian painting to attract the operation of s 51(xxxi) (see the discussion of Black CJ and Gummow J at 180-185; Smith v ANL Ltd [2000] HCA 58 ; (2000) 204 CLR 493 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 505 [23]).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) :
 
 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not "plausible". Was that a conclusion "which would not obviously be open on the known material"? Or was it no more than a part of the "mental processes" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? 
 Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. 
 In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: 
 
 
 "It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material." (emphasis added) 
 
 
 The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited "to give evidence and present arguments relating to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review". (emphasis added) The reference to "the issues arising in relation to the decision under review" is important.' 
 
 

Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]):
 
 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'</text>

<text>58 In Re Director of Public Prosecutions; Ex parte Lawler (1994) 179 CLR 271, Deane and Gaudron JJ said (at 285):
 
 'It is not necessary to repeat what we say in Mutual Pools with respect to the effect of the words "for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws". However, it is necessary to elaborate a little on the phrase "acquisition of property on just terms". Because s 51(xxxi) operates as a constitutional guarantee, the words "acquisition" and "property" are to be construed liberally . However, the power conferred by s 51(xxxi) is one with respect to "acquisition of property on just terms". That phrase must be read in its entirety and, when so read, it indicates that s 51(xxxi) applies only to acquisitions of a kind that permit of just terms. It is not concerned with laws in connexion with which "just terms" is an inconsistent or incongruous notion. Thus, it is not concerned with a law imposing a fine or penalty, including by way of forfeiture, or a law effecting or authorizing seizure of the property of enemy aliens or the condemnation of prize. Laws of that kind do not involve acquisitions that permit of just terms and, thus, they are not laws with respect to "acquisition of property", as that expression is used in s 51(xxxi). It follows that a law which effects or authorizes forfeiture of property in consequence of its use in the commission of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth stands outside s 51(xxxi).' 
 

 This passage from the reasons for judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ was cited with approval by five Justices of the High Court in Theophanous v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] HCA 18 at [55] - [56] .

59 
 
The Act controls the acquisition of property in Australia by a foreign corporation or a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia. That control involves power to prohibit a proposed acquisition, to approve a proposed acquisition and, in relation to an acquisition which has taken place without approval, to require a person to dispose of the property acquired. It is difficult to see how the subject matter of the Act could be properly controlled or regulated without the power to make a divestiture order.

60 Having regard to the principles which I have identified, in my opinion ss 4(6) and 21A (4) stand outside the scope of s 51(xxxi).</text>

<tocase>Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416</tocase>

<text>29 The scope of the external affairs power has been considered by the High Court in a number of recent decisions. Both parties referred extensively to the decisions in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32 ; (1991) 172 CLR 501 (' Polyukhovich ') and Victoria v The Commonwealth (Industrial Relations Case) [1995] HCA 45 ; (1995) 187 CLR 416 (' Victoria v The Commonwealth ').

31 In Victoria v The Commonwealth, Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said (at 485) (footnotes omitted):
 
 'Of course the scope of the legislative power is not confined to the implementation of treaties. The modern doctrine as to the scope of the power conferred by s 51(xxix) was adopted in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth . Dawson J expressed the doctrine in these terms: 
 
 
 "[T]he power extends to places, persons, matters or things physically external to Australia. The word 'affairs' is imprecise, but is wide enough to cover places, persons, matters or things. The word 'external' is precise and is unqualified. If a place, person, matter or thing lies outside the geographical limits of the country, then it is external to it and falls within the meaning of the phrase 'external affairs'." 
 
 
 Similar statements of the doctrine are to be found in the reasons for judgment of other Justices: Mason CJ; Deane J; Gaudron J; and McHugh J. They must now be taken as representing the view of the Court.'</text>

<tocase>Waterhouse v Minister for the Arts and Territories (1993) 43 FCR 175</tocase>
<text>61 I also agree with the respondent's second submission that in any event the degree of impairment of the applicant's rights with respect to the property is insufficient to attract the operation of s 51(xxxi). In Waterhouse v Minister for the Arts and Territories (1992) 43 FCR 175 the power of a Minister to grant or withhold a permit for an object to be exported to a purchaser under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 (Cth) was held to be an insufficient impairment of the rights of the owner of a valuable Australian painting to attract the operation of s 51(xxxi) (see the discussion of Black CJ and Gummow J at 180-185; Smith v ANL Ltd [2000] HCA 58 ; (2000) 204 CLR 493 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 505 [23]). In my opinion, similar reasoning can be applied here. The applicant is required to sell the property, but the class to whom she cannot sell the property is very limited (s 21A(7)).</text>

<tocase>XYZ v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 1036</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/25.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In XYZ v The Commonwealth [2006] HCA 25 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 1036 the High Court considered the validity of provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which made it an offence for a person defined as an Australian citizen or a resident of Australia while outside Australia to engage in sexual intercourse with a person under 16 years of age, or to commit an act of indecency on a person under 16 years of age. By a majority of five to two, the Court held that the legislation was valid under the external affairs power. Of the majority, Gleeson CJ and Kirby J each wrote separate judgments and Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ prepared joint reasons. Callinan and Heydon JJ dissented.</text>
