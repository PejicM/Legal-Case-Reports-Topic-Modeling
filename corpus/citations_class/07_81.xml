<tocase>Bassett v French 64 NY St Rep 292 (1895)</tocase>
<text>30 The principle I intend to apply is that if a plaintiff earns any money which he is not able to collect, he is not to be charged with that money. I have not been able to find any Anglo-Australian authority on point but I did come across a decision of the New York Court of Common Pleas that is in point. The case is Bassett v French 64 NY St Rep 292 (1895). The action was for damages for wrongful dismissal. As regards the assessment of damages Pryor J said of the plaintiff:
 
 "He was bound only to reasonable diligence in quest of other employment, and the proof is that he fulfilled the obligation. Having credited the defendant with every dollar he actually received, he is not responsible for money he earned but could not collect." [citations omitted]

31 Although consultancy fees were credited to Mr Hem's account in the books of SSSA, the fees were not paid, the company is no longer in business, and it is unlikely to have assets to discharge the debt. At least Mr Cant, on whom the onus falls, has not shown otherwise. Thus, there will therefore be no deduction from the claim.

32 The appeal will be allowed and Mr Cant will be directed to admit Mr Hem's proof for $75,000. On the question of costs, I think that Mr Hem should have them on a solicitor and client basis save for the costs incurred on 3 October 2006. Not only was Mr Hem successful on the appeal, on the evidence available to Mr Cant he had no basis for rejecting the proof. I have excluded the costs of 3 October 2006 because they were incurred when Mr Hem applied for and was granted leave to reopen his case and tender additional evidence. The costs of that day (also on a solicitor and client basis) should be borne by Mr Hem. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.

<tocase>Blaikie v SA Superannuation Board (1996) 65 SASR 85</tocase>
<text>21 As to the applicable principles I will refer to only two cases. The first is Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd (2001) 78 SASR 489 a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia. There Olsson J (who was in dissent on other grounds) said (at 514):
 
 "First it is necessary to address the concept of constructive dismissal. This was explored by me in some detail in Blaikie v SA Superannuation Board (1996) 65 SASR 85. I adhere to what I there said at pages 102-105. Suffice to reiterate that the notion of constructive dismissal implies the existence of conduct on the part of an employer which is plainly inimical to a continuance of a contract of employment according to its express or implied terms. The authorities establish the concept that there is implied in a contract of employment a term that the employer will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. An intention to repudiate need not be proved. Rather, it is a matter of objectively looking at the employer's conduct as a whole and determining whether its effect, judged reasonably and sensibly, is such that the employee cannot be expected to put up with it."</text>

<tocase>Caulfield v Broken Hill City Council (1995) 60 IR 211</tocase>
<text>24 This brings me to the quantum of Mr Hem's claim. It was not seriously disputed that Mr Hem was entitled to twelve months notice of termination. He had worked for the company for more than twenty years. He was its most senior employee. He received a salary of approximately $62,000 per annum together with a motor vehicle worth $15,000 per annum. He had put his own money into the company's business with the expectation of obtaining a 10 per cent interest. It was anticipated that he would remain with the company for the rest of his life. In the event he left, he would have difficulty finding alternative employment. Cases such as Dyer v Peverill [1979] 2 NTR 1; Quinn v Jack Chia (Australia) Ltd [2000] VSCA 75 ; [1992] 1 VR 567; O'Donnell v GIO Insurance Ltd (1996) 64 IR 297; Caulfield v Broken Hill City Council (1995) 60 IR 211; Rankin v Marine Power International Pty Ltd (2001) 107 IR 117 show that in these circumstances a reasonable period of notice would be twelve months.</text>

<tocase>Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Anderson [1979] IRLR 84</tocase>
<text>23 As regards the application of the principles, there are several instances where a single incident of verbal abuse has given rise to a successful claim for constructive dismissal. So, in Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes [1976] IRLR 413 a director said of his secretary: "She is an intolerable bitch on a Monday morning", leading Bristow J to find there had been a constructive dismissal. In Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Anderson [1979] IRLR 84 an assistant manager said to an employee: "You can't do the bloody job anyway", not believing this to be true. Again constructive dismissal was established. In Robinson v Compton Parkinson Ltd [1978] ICR 401 an employee who was falsely accused of theft was found to have been "constructively dismissed". Likewise in Moores v Bude-Stratton Town Council [2000] IRLR 676 where an employee was called: "a lying toe-rag".</text>

22 The second case is Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 116 IR 186. In that case Allsop J described constructive dismissal in the following terms:
 
 "Constructive dismissal is an unlawful termination of the contract of employment in circumstances where the employee leaves, without an express act or enunciation of 'dismissal' by the employer. It will be taken to be a dismissal (hence the word 'constructive') if the employer has behaved towards the employee in a way that entitles the employee to treat the employment as at an end. How that behaviour of the employer is to be described is at the heart of the matter. One difficulty in a simple enunciation of the common law principle is the existence of legislation and caselaw on closely related topics. However, if one is to approach the matter in straightforward contractual terms there is ample authority for the implication of a term in a contract of employment that the employer will not, without reasonable cause, conduct itself in a manner likely to damage or destroy the relationship of confidence and trust between the parties as employer and employee." [citations omitted]
 
 

Allsop J went on to state that: "Breach of that implied term will entitle the employee to treat himself or herself as wrongfully dismissed. " He cited with approval the judgments of Olsson J in Blaikie v South Australian Superannuation Board and in Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd which he said: "expressed the principle with clarity."</text>

<tocase>Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd [1979] ICR 396</tocase>
<text>19 I do not discount the possibility that Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign. I rather think that something along those lines was suggested. Having accused him of theft it would not be surprising had Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign. By the time of the conversation the ill-will between the two was significant. If Mr Hem had been asked to resign to avoid a dismissal that would be equivalent to an actual dismissal. In Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd [1979] ICR 396, in delivering the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Arnold J said (at 402): 
 
 "It is plain, we think, that there must exist a principle, exemplified by the four cases to which we have referred, that where an employee resigns and that resignation is determined upon him because he prefers to resign rather than be dismissed (the alternative having been expressed to him by the employer in the terms of a threat that if he does not resign he will be dismissed), the mechanics of the resignation do not cause that to be other than a dismissal. The cases do not in terms go further than that. We find the principle to be one of causation. In cases such as that which we have just hypothesised, and those reported, the causation is the threat. It is the existence of the threat which causes the employee to be willing to sign, and to sign, a resignation letter or be willing to give, and to give, the oral resignation. But where that willingness is brought about by other considerations and the actual causation of the resignation is no longer the threat which has been made but is the state of mind of the resigning employee, that he is willing and content to resign on the terms which he has negotiated and which are satisfactory to him, then we think there is no room for the principle to be derived from the decided cases."

20 In the end it is not necessary for me to rule on any of the disputed aspects of the conversation between Mr Hem and Mr Coulson. The reason is that it is not in dispute that during the discussion Mr Hem was accused of being a thief. In the absence of any justification (and none was proffered) that accusation constitutes what in some cases is referred to as a "constructive dismissal".</text>
