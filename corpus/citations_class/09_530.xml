<text>The conclusions and findings of the Tribunal arising out of its evaluation of the evidence were plainly open to it having regard to the reasons identified by the Tribunal for reaching those conclusions. The appellant now contends that the real case having regard to the correct or expanded facts concerning his background circumstances and the full scope of the relevant facts giving rise to a well-founded fear of persecution, were not put to the Tribunal. Two things should be noted in this respect. Firstly, the Court's role on appeal is to determine whether the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia reflects error on the part of that Court. To the extent that the appellant now wishes to contend for error on the basis of the merits of the factual evaluation by the Tribunal, no such ground of appeal is open to the appellant. An adjournment of the hearing would not be of any utility if the purpose of that adjournment is to enable the appellant to mount a challenge to the merits of the Tribunal's decision on the footing that the Federal Magistrates Court fell into error by failing to find error on the part of the Tribunal in the weight and emphasis it attributed to particular facts put before it. The finding made by the Tribunal as to the credibility of the appellant and the creditworthiness of his version of the facts, is an emblematic finding of fact in the sense described in the well known passage from the judgment of McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] .

Secondly, the desire of the appellant to put a consolidating and in some respects new and expansive statement of facts to the Court is not a basis upon which error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court can be made out or jurisdictional error made out on the part of the Tribunal in reaching its decision.

The ground of appeal relied upon by the appellant is that the Tribunal adopted a methodological or procedural approach to the gathering of evidence so as to inform itself about aspects of the appellant's contentions, which was not authorised by the Migration Act . It follows, it is said, that in gathering the evidence, the Tribunal stepped outside its statutory powers and thus exceeded its jurisdiction. The enquiries made by the Tribunal were these. On 31 August 2004, Taran Ramrakha, a senior researcher employed by the Tribunal, wrote to the Dir Area Development Organisation seeking information in relation to aspects of the appellant's claims put to the Tribunal. On 31 August 2004, Taran Ramrakha also wrote to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan and the Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation . By each of these letters, the Tribunal sought to inform itself about aspects of the contentions made by the appellant for the purposes of the review proceeding before the Tribunal. On 6 January 2005, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant pursuant to s 424A giving details of information the Tribunal had received in response from each of these organisations.</text>

<tocase>SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/83.html</AustLII>
<text>Having regard to the decisions of the Court in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 119 , questions might arise as to whether the enquiries made by the Tribunal complied with s 424B of the Act. However, the particular difficulty with the ground of appeal which is reliant upon contended steps taken in excess of jurisdiction, is this. The letters written by the Tribunal to each of the addressees to which there were responses, were considered by the Tribunal in reaching its first decision. However, the first decision of the Tribunal made on 30 May 2005 was set aside by the Federal Magistrates Court on 31 January 2007. The Tribunal, differently constituted, then conducted a review of the decision of the Minister's delegate, according to law. In doing so, the Tribunal on 31 August 2007 reached the conclusions and findings on credibility previously indicated. In doing so, it had regard to the seven topics identified in these reasons ([19]). The Tribunal in reaching its decision on 31 August 2007 did not rely upon the enquiries made of the addressees of the letters by the Tribunal as initially constituted. The Tribunal as reconstituted considered all of the factual contentions put before it by the appellant and his advisers and was unable to be persuaded of the appellant's creditworthiness. The Tribunal as reconstituted identified matters of inconsistency and set those matters out in letters addressed to the appellant pursuant to s 424A of the Act on 18 June 2007 (in relation to the issue concerning the booklet written by the appellant) and 13 July 2007 (concerning the appellant's travel in the months of April and May 2001).</text>

<tocase>Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/58.html</AustLII>
<text>Since the Tribunal did not rely upon any of the earlier enquiries of the third party addressees or responses from them, there can be no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in the exercise of its powers so far as those enquiries or responses to them are concerned. It is true that they became part of the historical record of the Tribunal's information gathering activities. However, in the conduct of the review function by the Tribunal as reconstituted, the enquiries of the nominated third parties and their responses to those letters, upon which the appellant relies as a ground of error on the part of the Tribunal, formed no part of the exercise of the statutory power. Thus, the Tribunal did not fall into error in the exercise of its power in the sense contemplated in Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323. In Yusuf , McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said this at [82]: 
 It is necessary, however, to understand what is meant by "jurisdictional error" under the general law and the consequences that follow from a decision-maker making such an error. As was said in Craig v South Australia, if an administrative tribunal (like the [Refugee Review Tribunal]): 

 
 "falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question, to ignore relevant material, to rely on irrelevant material or, at least in some circumstances, to make an erroneous finding or to reach a mistaken conclusion, and the tribunal's exercise or purported exercise of power is thereby affected, it exceeds its authority or powers. Such an error of law is jurisdictional error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which reflects it". 

 
 "Jurisdictional error" can thus be seen to embrace a number of different kinds of error, the list of which, in the passage cited from Craig, is not exhaustive. Those different kinds of error may well overlap. The circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation of the error identified, for example, as the decision-maker both asking the wrong question and ignoring relevant material. What is important, however, is that identifying a wrong issue, asking a wrong question, ignoring relevant material or relying on irrelevant material in a way that affects the exercise of power is to make an error of law. Further, doing so results in the decision-maker exceeding the authority or powers given by the relevant statute. In other words, if an error of those types is made, the decision-maker did not have authority to make the decision that was made; he or she did not have jurisdiction to make it. Nothing in the Act suggests that the Tribunal is given authority to authoritatively determine questions of law or to make a decision otherwise than in accordance with the law.

In order to try and overcome the obvious difficulty of no reliance by the Tribunal in reaching its credibility findings, on the letters to third parties and responses to those letters, the appellant contended before the Federal Magistrates Court that the Tribunal's second decision was fatally tainted by the steps earlier taken by the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal was reconstituted and exercised its powers in a way which fails to reflect any error in the sense contemplated by Craig v South Australia and Minister for Immigration v Yusuf .</text>
