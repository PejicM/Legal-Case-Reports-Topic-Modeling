<text>2 The factual and procedural background to the present application was set out in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) [2006] FCA 1530 concerning an appeal against a decision by the receivers and managers to refuse to release funds for legal representation of the company in these proceedings. So that these reasons may be self contained, it is convenient to reproduce the bulk of the factual and procedural background set out in the earlier judgment.

3 Forestview was incorporated in February 1994. Its current directors are Norman Phillip Carey, who has been a director since its incorporation, and his sister, Karen Sandra Carey-Hazell, who has been a director since 19 January 1996. The company is trustee of the Matheson Unit Trust. On 8 December 1998 the company granted a fixed and floating charge to Sandhurst Trustees Ltd (Sandhurst). The charge was assigned to Perpetual Nominees Ltd (Perpetual) as custodian of the ING Mortgage Pool for ING Funds Management Ltd as the responsible entity of The ING Mortgage Pool (ING) (ING Charge) on 28 June 2000.

4 Clause 2 of the ING Charge recited that Sandhurst, the mortgagee, had agreed to provide or continue providing credit or financial accommodation from time to time to, or at the request of, Forestview upon the condition that Forestview entered into the mortgage. The money secured by the Charge was defined expansively in cl 4.1.15 and included: 
 
 
 
 '4.1.15.1 any money which at any time the Borrower in any capacity and whether alone or with others:- 
 
 
 
 
 4.1.15.1.1 is actually or contingently liable to pay to the Mortgagee; or 
 
 4.1.15.1.2 may become actually or contingently liable to pay to the Mortgagee in the future pursuant to any transaction or arrangement at any time entered into or made by the Mortgagee with any person;' 
 

Subclauses 4.1.15.2 and 4.1.15.3 are not material for present purposes. The definition was extended in 4.1.15.4 to: 
 
 
 'all moneys expended by the Mortgagee to make good any breach or non-compliance by the Mortgagor of any term, covenant, condition, or agreement on the part of the Mortgagor to be observed or performed under this document and all moneys incurred or spent by the Mortgagee in exercising or attempting to exercise any of the powers under this document together with interest on those moneys from the date of expenditure until repayment at the rate specified in this document and if more than one rate is specified then at the higher rate or if no rate is specified then at the Applicable Rate, and where the context permits means any part of that money;.'</text>
