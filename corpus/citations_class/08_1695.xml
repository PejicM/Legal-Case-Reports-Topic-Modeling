<text>21 As far as Ground 1 is concerned, which is the allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal, it needs to be remembered that this ground was not argued in the proceedings before the learned Federal Magistrate. Such an allegation must be distinctly made and clearly proven (see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507. Rarely will bias on the part of the Tribunal be apparent from the written reasons only (see SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358).</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405</tocase>

<text>19 In oral submissions before me today, the appellant has repeated his contention that the decisions of the delegate, the Tribunal and the learned Federal Magistrate were not fair and did not fairly reflect the merits of his claims. This is a complaint which amounts to the seeking of a merits review of the decisions and, in particular, the decision of the Federal Magistrate and cannot be pursued in this Court on an application such as that presently before me (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 per McHugh J at [67]).

20 I have come to the view that the appellant has not made out a case for overturning the Federal Magistrate's decision or for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.</text>

<text>22 In the present case, there was nothing in the material which is before me which indicates bias. Furthermore, there is no evidence upon which a fair-minded lay observer, properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct of the Tribunal, might reasonably apprehend that the Tribunal may not have brought an impartial mind to the question of determining the application for review (see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 982 at [27] [32]).

23 Ground 1 has not been made out.

24 Ground 2 and Ground 3 should be considered together. There is no particularity to the grounds, as specified in the Notice of Appeal, no evidence to support them and no submissions which justify them. For these reasons, these grounds also cannot succeed.</text>
