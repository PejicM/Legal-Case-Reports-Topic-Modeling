<tocase>Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd (2006) 202 FLR 343</tocase>
<text>20 The next problem was the failure to comply with the requirements of the Corporations Law applicable at the time. The proposal was undoubtedly a "managed investment scheme" as defined in s 9 of the Corporations Law . Whilst this case has concentrated upon three investors, more than 20 investors contributed approximately $4 million in total. Prima facie, registration was required (s 601ED(1)). It could not be established that all of the issues of interests did not need disclosure to investors under Pt 6D.2 when made (see s 706 and s 708). Registration would have required the production to ASIC of documents that did not exist and a responsible entity to operate the scheme being a public company that held a dealer's licence to operate a managed investment scheme. The responsible entity would be subject to a number of statutory obligations. There was no responsible entity. These breaches were admitted in collateral proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and formed the basis of orders made in those proceedings ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd (2004) 183 FLR 294; Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Tasman Investment Management Ltd (2006) 202 FLR 343). It follows that Tosich had none of the protections provided for by the Corporations Law flowing from registration and the existence of a responsible entity. The proposal should not have been made to Tosich (or others) at all by a responsible financial planner.</text>

<tocase>Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/22.html</AustLII>
<text>93 Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue.
 
(1) "Knows" and "known" are strong words. They mean considerably more than "believes" or "suspects" or even "strongly suspects" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259).
 
(2) The "matter" must be known to the insured.
 
(3) On one alternative, the "matter" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] :
 
 
 "Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer." 
 
 
 

Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct. (See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.) 
 
(4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ).
 
(5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer. There is some debate about the meaning of the words "the circumstances". Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8).
 
(6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can "know" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] [89]. Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610 611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA). 
 
(7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353).</text>

<tocase>Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457</tocase>
<text>88 In my opinion, counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting, particularly Stuart Coleman. The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue. Macquarie and Aon are not in the "same camp" and Coleman is not under the control of Aon. In a sense, he was available to both parties. However, only the broker, Aon, had dealings with the potential insurer. The client was not, and would never be, directly in that loop. Between the parties here, it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal. The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants ( Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 per Glass JA at 201 202; Prasad v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 133 ; (1991) 101 ALR 109 at 123; Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 275 ; (1989) 23 FCR 331 at 343 344; Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457 per McClellan AJA at [62] [64]).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1352.html</AustLII>
<text>32 There have been varied opinions as to whether that basis can be applied by Australian courts without the High Court qualifying Poulton 89 CLR 540. As it happens, most negative opinions have been expressed by judges of this Court, eg Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 814 ; National Mutual Property Services (Aust) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 4) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62 ; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1413 ; (2003) 134 FCR 474 ; and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. A number of those and other authorities are analysed by McDougall J, who took the wider view, in Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267.

37 The statutory claims remain to be considered. Counsel for the plaintiffs ultimately conceded that he could find no support for assignability of these causes of action. That is correct. That relieves me from deciding the point. I should say that the concession would follow, directly or indirectly, from a long line of authority in this Court that is against assignment of a claim for damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) commencing with Park v Allied Mortgages Corp Ltd (1993) ATPR (Digest) 46-105. Those cases were recently reviewed and followed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146 at [50] [58] in relation to claims made pursuant to s 82 for breaches of s 52 and s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act .

38 It follows that the purported assignment of each cause of action is ineffective. I should add that if the assignment is ineffective, it is so for all purposes. It follows that Tosich retains the causes of action regardless of the deed. That transaction has no relevant impact upon his claims. There is no evidence as to the arrangements between Tosich and All Saints in the eventuality of the assignment being ineffective. Such evidence would be as irrelevant to this case as would any other side arrangements between parties such as insurance.

39 Aon directly pleads limitation defences. The defendants adopt a "coat-tails" approach. Aon has taken the running on the issue. The starting point is that Tosich was reintroduced to the proceeding as a plaintiff by amendment on 18 May 2007. The next step is that 18 May 2007 is taken to be the date of the commencement of the proceeding by Tosich by virtue of O 6 r 11(3) of the Federal Court Rules . It is then contended that all relevant causes of action accrued on or about 6 November 2000 when the money was paid by Tosich. The last step is that each cause of action is barred, either by particular limitations in the Corporations Law or by the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW), applicable by virtue of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). There is little to recommend such a result. It would be a triumph of form over substance. Tosich commenced the proceeding on 27 November 2003, well within all potential limitation periods. All Saints was substituted for Tosich as plaintiff by order of the Court on 19 April 2006 claiming to be an assignee of the Tosich causes of action. The substantive causes of action remained the same at all times. Thus, the defendants faced the same causes of action at all times. The cross-defendants faced the same cross-claims at all times. However, lack of merit alone is not an answer to the point.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2007/3.html</AustLII>
<text>78 The unexplained omission by Aon to draw the attention of the client to such an important consequence of the overall insurance arrangements that were in contemplation was a breach of the duty of Aon to exercise care and skill in carrying out its role as broker ( Caldwell v JA Neilson Investments Pty Ltd (2007) 14 ANZ Ins Cas 61-724; [2007] NSWCA 3 ; per Ipp JA at [103] [104]). No expert evidence is necessary to come to that conclusion (cf Geoffrey W Hill &amp; Associates (Insurance Brokers) Pty Ltd v Squash Centre (Allawah North) Pty Ltd (1990) 6 ANZ Ins Cas 61-012 per Kirby P at 76768).</text>

<tocase>Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/41.html</AustLII>
<text>33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68] [82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258] [261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case.</text>

<tocase>Cee Bee Marine Ltd v Lombard Insurance Co Ltd [1990] 2 NZLR 1 </tocase>
<text>80 Quantification of damages is a different matter. It has been said that the defendants have to establish that, absent the breach of duty, relevant cover would have been obtained, eg Ferrcom Pty Ltd v Inbush (NSW) Pty Ltd (1997) 9 ANZ Ins Cas 61-339 per Cole JA at 76732. That is so if full indemnity is to be awarded, cf Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 13. The position is different if less than full indemnity is considered. Reconstruction of what would have occurred if the correct advice had been given involves a hypothetical set of past circumstances. As explained in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; (1990) 169 CLR 638 , particularly per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 639 640 and Deane, Gaudron, McHugh JJ at 642 643, this is not decided as if it were an assessment on the balance of probabilities as to whether an event did or did not happen. Furthermore, in considering this case, it is to be borne in mind that Aon prevented the posited situation occurring and that it, not the defendants, was the expert in the field. See, generally, Cee Bee Marine Ltd v Lombard Insurance Co Ltd [1990] 2 NZLR 1 at 5 6. The reconstruction of events in this case does not depend upon what the defendants would have done in a particular situation in the sense discussed by Buchanan JA in Crown Insurance Services Pty Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (2005) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-659 at [9] [14]. It principally (but not entirely) depends upon the assessment as to what others would have done. It is to be noted that the discussion of this question by Ashley J in TBI Pty Ltd v Aon Financial Planning Ltd (2004) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-601 at [213] [218] was tentative obiter dicta.</text>

<tocase>Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710</tocase>
<text>40 The first two steps are common to all causes of action. There has been much debate about amendment and limitation since Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394. Many of the authorities were considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal, presided over by Gleeson CJ, in relation to a rule similar to O 6 r 11(3) in Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710, particularly concerning the relationship between that rule and the New South Wales equivalent of the present O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . In this Court, see eg Zoneff v Elcom Credit Union Ltd [1990] ATPR 41-058 at 51,746 51,747. The introduction of s 59(2B) to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in 1994 and the consequent amendments to O 13 r 2 changed the landscape. Here, no argument was directed to those changes and their significance and, in particular, as to the interplay between O 6 r 11 and O 13 r 2. There was no discussion of the power to dispense with the Rules (O 1 r 8) (cf Karam v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2000] NSWSC 596 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 545).</text>

<tocase>First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 </tocase>
<text>30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired. There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion. However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse. Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394 395). In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property. In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid. The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here.</text>

<text>80 Quantification of damages is a different matter. It has been said that the defendants have to establish that, absent the breach of duty, relevant cover would have been obtained, eg Ferrcom Pty Ltd v Inbush (NSW) Pty Ltd (1997) 9 ANZ Ins Cas 61-339 per Cole JA at 76732. That is so if full indemnity is to be awarded, cf Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 13. The position is different if less than full indemnity is considered. Reconstruction of what would have occurred if the correct advice had been given involves a hypothetical set of past circumstances.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/59.html</AustLII>
<text>25 There can be no doubt that there was a causal connection between the negligence and each of the identified statutory breaches, and the loss making investment by Tosich. Each cause of action is established against Tasman Investments. There is no doubt about Warne's personal liability for all causes of action so established. He was the moving force for Tasman Investments in all respects relevant to the investment in the Queen Victoria Project and is responsible for all acts and omissions giving rise to the liability of the company ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).

26 The deed of assignment was executed on 16 June 2005 between Tosich as assignor and All Saints as assignee. At that time this proceeding was on foot, and a receiver had been appointed to the Queen Victoria Project by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceedings brought by ASIC. The substantive operative provisions of the deed were as follows:
 
 
 "1. The assignee will pay to the assignors by bank or trust account cheque the sum of One-Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) on the exchange of this Deed. 
 2. The assignors hereby transfer set-over and assign to the assignee absolutely all of their right, title and interest both at law and in equity in:- 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the investment in their names in the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital A; 
 (b) all rights to receive any dividend or other monies from or by virtue of the receivership of the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital C; 
 (c) all claims demands causes of action and rights of action maintainable by the assignors or either of them arising out of or connected with the facts matters and circumstances referred to in the statement of claim filed in the Tosich proceedings;"

27 There are other features of the deed to note. The first is that the defendants Tasman Investment and Warne were each party to the deed and gave joint and several warranties as to the financial position of the assignee and Warne. They also (together with the assignee) indemnified the assignors against future legal costs and expenses in the proceeding, and covenant that they will not seek costs or expenses from the assignors in relation to this proceeding. Then there are clauses dealing with later recovery as follows:
 
 
 "11. If the receiver declares and pays a dividend in respect of the Queen Victoria Project prior to the conclusion of the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings, that dividend will be paid to the assignors once the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings have been finally concluded. If the receiver declares and pays a dividend in respect of the Queen Victoria Project once the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings have been finally concluded, that dividend will be paid to the assignors forthwith. 
 12. In circumstances where the assignors become entitled to any further payments consequent upon any award or judgment obtained by it, Tasman and/or Warne, the assignors shall be entitled to a further payment equivalent to: 
 
 
 (a) $125,000; 
 (b) plus interest which is hereby agreed in the amount of $54,225; plus 
 (c) costs and disbursements which are hereby agreed in the amount of $55,000 inclusive of GST; 
 less any amount paid pursuant to this Deed."</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>87 Based upon the evidence, it can be inferred that if Aon had approached Macquarie Underwriting on the basis that the financial planning business was in truth a continuing business, although carried on by another entity, that PI insurance would have been issued as if it were a renewal on terms no less favourable than the quote given as to premium and with retroactive cover to Tasman Investment and Warne to at least the inception of business and on the basis that prior known circumstances would be covered. At the very least, the evidence required an explanation from Aon as to precisely what occurred between it and Macquarie Underwriting. That explanation may, in turn, have required an explanation from Macquarie Underwriting. Counsel for the defendants is on strong ground in relying upon the unexplained failure of Aon to call any witness of its own, particularly either or both of Elia and Kazakova. A clear Jones v Dunkel inference is to be drawn ( Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298). The consequence is that the inference available from the evidence that a renewal on suitable terms to cover the Tasman Investment run off would have been available from Macquarie Underwriting can be more readily, and is, drawn.

88 In my opinion, counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting, particularly Stuart Coleman. The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue. Macquarie and Aon are not in the "same camp" and Coleman is not under the control of Aon. In a sense, he was available to both parties. However, only the broker, Aon, had dealings with the potential insurer. The client was not, and would never be, directly in that loop. Between the parties here, it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal. The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants ( Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 per Glass JA at 201 202; Prasad v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 133 ; (1991) 101 ALR 109 at 123; Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 275 ; (1989) 23 FCR 331 at 343 344; Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457 per McClellan AJA at [62] [64]).</text>

In Martinus v Kidd [1982] HCA 64 ; (1982) 150 CLR 648 it was pointed out that no new cause of action comes into being against the personal representative of a deceased tortfeasor the existing cause of action survives. In that case, time runs for limitation purposes from accrual of the cause of action against the deceased (see per Gibbs CJ, Murphy and Wilson JJ at 652; Mason J at 659). The same principle must be applicable in relation to a cause of action that survives for the benefit of the personal representation of the deceased estate, absent any special provisions. That principle applies to an action by a trustee in bankruptcy to enforce a liability of the bankrupt ( Re Mansell; Ex parte Norton (1892) 66 LT 245). The same principle should apply in the case of the assignment of a cause of action.

<text>93 Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue.
 
(1) "Knows" and "known" are strong words. They mean considerably more than "believes" or "suspects" or even "strongly suspects" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259).
 
(2) The "matter" must be known to the insured.
 
(3) On one alternative, the "matter" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] :
 
 
 "Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer." 
 
 
 

Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct. (See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.) 
 
(4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ).
 
(5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer. There is some debate about the meaning of the words "the circumstances". Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8).
 
(6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can "know" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] [89]. Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610 611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA). 
 
(7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353).</text>

<tocase>Manchester Unity Total Care Building Society v MGICA Ltd (1991) 6 ANZ Ins Cas 61-062</tocase>
<text>103 There could, no doubt, be a case where the circumstances are such that it can be taken that any reasonable insured would know that any insurer would regard them as relevant to cover of the risk proposed without the benefit of evidence from the insurer or broker. It may be that the position arrived at by September/October 2002 would fall into that category so far as PI insurance in relation to run off insurance for Tasman Investments was concerned. A fund raising that was advised to be likely to be in breach of the Corporations Law was clearly failing, with the investors likely to suffer considerable losses. In my opinion, the same cannot be said of the circumstances in March/early April 2002. The likelihood of loss on the investment was not known. The possibility of breaches of the law in relation to the fund raising was known, but that is as high as it reached at that point. That was likely to be academic if the project succeeded. The relevance of that circumstance to a particular insurer needs to be established by evidence. It is conceivable that such evidence could have been led, but it was not. For the Court to fill that gap and make a finding as to that issue would amount to speculation. I conclude that it has not been established that a failure to disclose the pleaded circumstances would have given rise to any relief in relation to the hypothetical Macquarie Underwriting policy. The same reasoning would apply in relation to the application of s 28(3) ( Manchester Unity Total Care Building Society v MGICA Ltd (1991) 6 ANZ Ins Cas 61-062).

104 I am, thus, satisfied that the proper basis for quantification of loss is to assume that a Macquarie Underwriting policy would have issued based upon the proposal it received, including Tasman Investment as an insured with a retroactive date at least back to the inception of the business in 2000. The policy would, thus, have responded to claims made in the period from March 2002 to March 2003 arising from circumstances occurring in June November 2000. Such claims would have clearly fallen clearly within the insured risk and there has been no suggestion of any relevant exception. Allowance will have to be made for the proposed deductible of $20,000 per claim. Some allowance should be made for the higher premium proposed by Macquarie Underwriting. It would not be right in principle to allocate all of that increase to the one claim by Tosich. The amount recovered of $25,608.38 should be deducted. There should also be a modest discount to reflect the possibility that a policy on appropriate terms might not have issued. All in all, the cross-claimants should recover the sum of $70,000 plus interest in relation to Tosich.

105 Little attention was paid to the claims in relation to Roach and Kotwal and no special defence was raised in relation to them. The fact that they were paid out is of no consequence as there was no relevant policy in force at the time. The only distinction is that they were made later than that by Tosich. If proper insurance had been obtained, that should not have been relevant. The quantification of these claims needs to be further considered.</text>

<text>41 However, even if O 6 r 11(3) alone is considered and operates according to its terms, there is a real issue in this case as to the last step the effect of the limitation provisions. In Martinus v Kidd [1982] HCA 64 ; (1982) 150 CLR 648 it was pointed out that no new cause of action comes into being against the personal representative of a deceased tortfeasor the existing cause of action survives. In that case, time runs for limitation purposes from accrual of the cause of action against the deceased (see per Gibbs CJ, Murphy and Wilson JJ at 652; Mason J at 659). The same principle must be applicable in relation to a cause of action that survives for the benefit of the personal representation of the deceased estate, absent any special provisions. That principle applies to an action by a trustee in bankruptcy to enforce a liability of the bankrupt ( Re Mansell; Ex parte Norton (1892) 66 LT 245). The same principle should apply in the case of the assignment of a cause of action. The original cause of action remains the foundation of the action (although not directly applicable, see " The Jordan Nicolov" [1990] 2 Lloyds Reps 11 per Hobhouse J at 19; Lefevre v White [1990] 1 Lloyd's Reps 569 per Popplewell J at 577 citing Post Office v Norwich Fire Insurance Ltd [1967] 2 QB 363 per Lord Denning at 373; cf per Jacobs J in Re Harry Simpson &amp; Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act 1936 [1964-5] NSWR 603 at 605; (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 207 at 209.

<tocase>Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540</tocase>
<text>29 This area of the law is controversial. Choses in action in general are assignable (eg s 12 Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)). However, a bare right to litigate requires special consideration. Although maintenance was referred to in this context, no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993 (NSW) (cf Campbell J in Mid-City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi-Anarak (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [194]). It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first. In 1953 the High Court, in Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, in relation to a claim in conversion, baldly said:
 
 "... according to well-established principle, the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity". 
 

Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 702C:
 
 "Though in general choses in action were assignable, yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character, such as claims for defamation or personal injury, were incapable of assignment..."

30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired. There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion. However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse. Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394 395). In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property. In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid. The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here.

32 There have been varied opinions as to whether that basis can be applied by Australian courts without the High Court qualifying Poulton 89 CLR 540. As it happens, most negative opinions have been expressed by judges of this Court, eg Allstate Life Insurance Company v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1994] FCA 814 ; National Mutual Property Services (Aust) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd (No 4) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62 ; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu v Cridlands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1413 ; (2003) 134 FCR 474 ; and Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 ; (2006) 70 IPR 146. A number of those and other authorities are analysed by McDougall J, who took the wider view, in Rickard Constructions Pty Ltd v Rickard Hails Moretti Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1041 ; (2004) 220 ALR 267.

33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68] [82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258] [261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case.</text>

<text>88 In my opinion, counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting, particularly Stuart Coleman. The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue. Macquarie and Aon are not in the "same camp" and Coleman is not under the control of Aon. In a sense, he was available to both parties. However, only the broker, Aon, had dealings with the potential insurer. The client was not, and would never be, directly in that loop. Between the parties here, it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal. The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants ( Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 per Glass JA at 201 202; Prasad v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 133 ; (1991) 101 ALR 109 at 123; Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 275 ; (1989) 23 FCR 331 at 343 344; Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457 per McClellan AJA at [62] [64]).</text>

<tocase>TBI Pty Ltd v Aon Financial Planning Ltd (2004) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-601 </tocase>
<text>80 Quantification of damages is a different matter. It has been said that the defendants have to establish that, absent the breach of duty, relevant cover would have been obtained, eg Ferrcom Pty Ltd v Inbush (NSW) Pty Ltd (1997) 9 ANZ Ins Cas 61-339 per Cole JA at 76732. That is so if full indemnity is to be awarded, cf Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3 ; (1986) 160 CLR 1 per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 13. The position is different if less than full indemnity is considered. Reconstruction of what would have occurred if the correct advice had been given involves a hypothetical set of past circumstances. As explained in Malec v JC Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20 ; (1990) 169 CLR 638 , particularly per Brennan and Dawson JJ at 639 640 and Deane, Gaudron, McHugh JJ at 642 643, this is not decided as if it were an assessment on the balance of probabilities as to whether an event did or did not happen. Furthermore, in considering this case, it is to be borne in mind that Aon prevented the posited situation occurring and that it, not the defendants, was the expert in the field. See, generally, Cee Bee Marine Ltd v Lombard Insurance Co Ltd [1990] 2 NZLR 1 at 5 6. The reconstruction of events in this case does not depend upon what the defendants would have done in a particular situation in the sense discussed by Buchanan JA in Crown Insurance Services Pty Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (2005) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-659 at [9] [14]. It principally (but not entirely) depends upon the assessment as to what others would have done. It is to be noted that the discussion of this question by Ashley J in TBI Pty Ltd v Aon Financial Planning Ltd (2004) 13 ANZ Ins Cas 61-601 at [213] [218] was tentative obiter dicta.</text>

Although maintenance was referred to in this context, no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993 (NSW) (cf Campbell J in Mid-City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi-Anarak (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [194]). It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first. In 1953 the High Court, in Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, in relation to a claim in conversion, baldly said:
 
 "... according to well-established principle, the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity". 
 

Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 702C:
 
 "Though in general choses in action were assignable, yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character, such as claims for defamation or personal injury, were incapable of assignment..."

30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired. There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion. However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse. Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394 395). In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property. In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid. The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here.

31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property. There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly 158 FCR 444 at [79] [81]). However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule whether the assignee has a "genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a "genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another" (per Lord Roskill at 703D).

33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68] [82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258] [261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case.

34 Did All Saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of Tosich's claim? There is no direct evidence concerning the position of All Saints prior to the transaction. The inescapable inference from all the circumstances, including the structure of the transaction, is that All Saints was under the control of the Warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of Tosich. In particular, it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising Tosich's risk as to costs. It may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their cross-claims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff. That would remove the kind of problem exemplified by CGU Insurance Ltd v AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 36 ; (2007) 237 ALR 420 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1551 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 609. Indeed, as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions. I do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction. All Saints could not profit from the arrangement. It is not "trafficking" in causes of actions in any real sense. Facilitation of cross-claims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such. However, it seems to me that the dicta in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment. The assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to, or regardless of, the assignment. In view of the controversy surrounding the topic, an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge.

35 What, then, of the connection with property? Austin J found that there were property interests created by the scheme. The deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action, including the present. In one sense, there is a clear connection. The intention is to recover the loss of property invested. However, the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction it is to recover the loss by way of damages. In my opinion, that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action, assuming, as I do, that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate. The assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective.

36 In the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received. The Third Amended Originating Process claims, inter alia:
 
 "Orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the Plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the Queen Victoria Project by the First Plaintiff and interest." 
 

The Third Amended Statement of Claim does not include pleading to support that claim and no amendment has been sought. Such a claim can be ignored for present purposes.</text>

<text>88 In my opinion, counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting, particularly Stuart Coleman. The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue. Macquarie and Aon are not in the "same camp" and Coleman is not under the control of Aon. In a sense, he was available to both parties. However, only the broker, Aon, had dealings with the potential insurer. The client was not, and would never be, directly in that loop. Between the parties here, it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal. The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants ( Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 per Glass JA at 201 202; Prasad v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 133 ; (1991) 101 ALR 109 at 123; Turbo Tek Enterprises Inc v Sperling Enterprises Pty Ltd [1989] FCA 275 ; (1989) 23 FCR 331 at 343 344; Ayoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd (2004) 12 BPR 22,735; [2004] NSWCA 457 per McClellan AJA at [62] [64]).</text>

<text>93 Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue.
 
(1) "Knows" and "known" are strong words. They mean considerably more than "believes" or "suspects" or even "strongly suspects" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259).
 
(2) The "matter" must be known to the insured.
 
(3) On one alternative, the "matter" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] :
 
 
 "Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer." 
 
 
 

Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct. (See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.) 
 
(4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ).
 
(5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer. There is some debate about the meaning of the words "the circumstances". Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8).
 
(6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can "know" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] [89]. Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610 611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA). 
 
(7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353).</text>

<tocase>Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394</tocase>
<text>40 The first two steps are common to all causes of action. There has been much debate about amendment and limitation since Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394. Many of the authorities were considered by the New South Wales Court of Appeal, presided over by Gleeson CJ, in relation to a rule similar to O 6 r 11(3) in Fernance v Nominal Defendant (1989) 17 NSWLR 710, particularly concerning the relationship between that rule and the New South Wales equivalent of the present O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . In this Court, see eg Zoneff v Elcom Credit Union Ltd [1990] ATPR 41-058 at 51,746 51,747. The introduction of s 59(2B) to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in 1994 and the consequent amendments to O 13 r 2 changed the landscape. Here, no argument was directed to those changes and their significance and, in particular, as to the interplay between O 6 r 11 and O 13 r 2. There was no discussion of the power to dispense with the Rules (O 1 r 8) (cf Karam v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2000] NSWSC 596 ; (2000) 34 ACSR 545).</text>
