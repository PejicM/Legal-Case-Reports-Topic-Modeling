<text>9 Section 65 of the Act imposes an obligation on the Minister to grant a protection visa to an applicant if satisfied of particular matters. The satisfaction of the Minister is a condition precedent to that obligation. The delegate of the Minister is in the same position as the Minister. The Tribunal exercises all of the powers and discretions conferred on the decision-maker under the Act . By s 420 of the Act , the Tribunal in reviewing a decision, is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. In undertaking the review function, the Tribunal is to pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. By s 424(1) , the Tribunal in conducting a review may obtain information that it considers relevant and must have regard to that information in making the decision on the review. Provisions which confer upon the Tribunal a capacity to inform itself by information it considers relevant and provisions which free the Tribunal from technicalities and the formal rules of evidence are, like s 33 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), facultative provisions ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 628 [49] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J) although the extent of that freedom in any given case might be "another question" ( Eshetu at [49]). Nevertheless, the Tribunal must reach conclusions which have a basis in evidence having rational probative force ( Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Pochi [1980] FCA 85 ; (1980) 31 ALR 666 at 685 per Deane J; Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 367 per Deane J).</text>

11 At common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law ( Bond , per Mason CJ at 356 with whom Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) and, as to inferences :
 ... so long as there is some basis for an inference in other words, the particular inference is reasonably open even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place. [emphasis Mason CJ at p 356]

12 Where a statute requires the decision-maker to discharge particular duties, "irrationality of the kind described by Deane J in ( Bond ) may involve non-compliance with the duty" ( S20/2002 per Gleeson CJ at [9]). In the context of the particular statutory framework relating to protection visas under the Act and the role and duty of the Tribunal, Gummow and Hayne JJ with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 observed at [38] that although the question of whether protection obligations relevantly arose included a consideration of factual matters,
 the critical question is whether the determination [by the Tribunal] was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds ... inadequacy of the material before the decision-maker concerning the attainment of that satisfaction is insufficient in itself to establish jurisdiction error.

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2001) 65 ALD 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/744.html</AustLII>
<text>14 As to inferences, Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; 65 ALD 141 said this:
 
 
 [34] The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law. Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. That is because, before the inference is drawn, there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a difference conclusion. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Even if the reasoning whereby the Court reached its conclusion of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law. A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example, by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.</text>

<tocase>NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/10.html</AustLII>
<text>15 The satisfaction or otherwise of whether the appellant is a person to whom Australia owes protection obligations on the ground of a contended well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason might be determined by the Tribunal in the purported exercise of the statutory review function in a way that reveals a failure to reach findings supported by any evidence or reveals findings based on inferences drawn by the Tribunal from facts that do not support those findings, as a matter of law. Such a determination might be characterised as irrational, illogical, arbitrary, capricious or made according to humour or private opinion rather than by reference to a reason or justice. Such a decision is unreasonable. However, for present purposes, I use each of these terms to describe a decision of the Tribunal based on findings unsupported by any evidence or based upon findings thought to be supported by inferences drawn from primary facts where those inferences are not open as a matter of law. Decisions made by the Tribunal in such circumstances are not made in the performance of the duty imposed on the Tribunal by the Act and thus involve jurisdictional error. Such decisions do not simply reflect insufficiency or inadequacy of evidence but rather an absence of any foundation in fact for the state of satisfaction or otherwise of the Minister or decision-maker. As to the role of independent country information, the Full Court of this Court per Gray, Tamberlin and Lander JJ in NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 , said this at [11]:
 
 
 [11] ... There can be no objection in principle to the Tribunal relying on "country information". The weight that it gives to such information is a matter for the Tribunal itself, as part of its fact-finding function. Such information as the Tribunal obtains for itself is not restricted to "guidance", as the appellants submitted. It may be used to assess the credibility of a claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. It is not, as the first appellant submitted, an error of law or a jurisdictional error for the Tribunal to base a decision on "country information" that is not true. The question of the accuracy of the "country information" is one for the Tribunal not for the Court. If the Court were to make its own assessment of the truth of "country information" it would be engaging in merits review. The Court does not have power to do that.

16 In analysing in NAHI the extent to which the Tribunal relied upon country information in reaching its decision and the relationship between findings on credit and the use of country information, the Tribunal said this at [12]:
 
 
 [12] The appellants' submissions asserted that the Tribunal rejected all of the appellant's claims on the basis of "country information". The Tribunal's reasons for decision do not substantiate this assertion. It is plain that the Tribunal relied to a substantial extent on the inherent probability of some aspects of the first appellant's story, inconsistencies between different parts of his story and the fact of his frequent returns to Sri Lanka and the length of his sojourns there, to form its views about his credibility. In turn, it relied on its assessment of the first appellant's credibility in determining whether it accepted some of the "country information". ... The very function of the Tribunal was to assess the appellants' claims, both as to their inherent credibility and as to their consistency with other information known to the Tribunal about circumstances in the appellants' country of origin. [emphasis added]

17 The central matter therefore is to assess whether there was material before the Tribunal upon which it was entitled to rely as a result of the process it undertook in weighing the merits of the appellant's claims.

18 The appellant arrived in Australia in August 2004 and lodged an application for a protection visa on 16 August 2004 supported by a six page handwritten statement of those matters said to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
