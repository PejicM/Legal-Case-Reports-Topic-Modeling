<text>1 On 4 April 2008 I delivered reasons for judgment ( Hermitage Motel Pty Ltd v P. E. Kafka Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 442) and stood the matter over in order to enable the first applicant to bring in minutes of order to give effect to those reasons. Some issues need to be determined.

2 In principle, the respondents are entitled to costs occasioned by the claim of the second applicant which was not proceeded with. It seems to me that that is likely to be a very slim amount, but that is a matter for agreement, taxation or assessment.

3 The intertwined issues of costs of the adjournment, which took place on 27 November 2006, and the impact upon the running of interest are rather more difficult questions. The case as pleaded and represented by the evidence was a conventional purchase of a business induced by misleading representations, with the evidence on both sides valuing the property purchased at the time of completion. As with other cases in this Court, it is a case-managed proceeding. On the Friday before the hearing, counsel for the respondents raised the spectre of an argument that the proper measure of damage was the difference between the amount paid and the value of the motel at the time of trial, certainly not being the value of the motel at the time of completion. If correct, that would have meant that the applicants had no evidence as to the value at the time contended for. In those circumstances, the applicants sought an adjournment of the proceeding in order that they could meet that potential argument.</text>
