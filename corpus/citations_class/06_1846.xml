<tocase>Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Limited [1976] 1 Ch 55</tocase>
<text>6 Such orders are only made in exceptional circumstances. In Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Limited [1976] 1 Ch 55 at 62 Ormrod LJ identified what he described as 'three essential preconditions for the making of such an order'. They were:
 
 'First, there must be an extremely strong prima facie case. Secondly, the damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant. Thirdly, there must be clear evidence that the defendants have in their procession incriminating documents or things, and that there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before any application inter partes can be made.'

7 In order to satisfy the Court that it is appropriate to make the orders sought the applicant relies on two affidavits, sworn by its managing director, and affidavits of Jian Ping Gao and Chen Ben He.

8 Having read those affidavits and considered submissions made by counsel appearing for the applicant I have been persuaded that the first precondition identified by Ormrod LJ has been satisfied. The pictures appearing on t-shirts being sold by the defendants appear to be identical with those commissioned by the applicant.</text>
