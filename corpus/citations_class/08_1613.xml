<tocase>Farajvand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 795</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/795.html</AustLII>
<text>22 Counsel for the appellants referred to the line of authority of which Farajvand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 795 and Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 (2003) 216 CLR 473 are part. In effect, counsel for the appellants argued that the need, or perceived need, to be seen to restrict activities can itself amount to serious harm. That is not the basis on which those authorities turn. It is abundantly clear, particularly from the passages in [29] and [33] of Allsop J's reasons for judgment in Farajvand , as well as from the judgments in S395 itself, that a person will only be seen to have a well-founded fear of persecution if there is a need, or a perceived need, to curtail activities in order to avoid persecution. Given that s 91R of the Migration Act equates serious harm with persecution for this purpose, it will be necessary to show that a person must adopt, or perceives the need to adopt, restrictions on that person's activities in order to avoid serious harm. The imposition of restrictions on activities simply to avoid threats, or simply to avoid harm that does not amount to serious harm, will not itself become a form of serious harm. This position is confirmed by the very recent judgment of Dowsett J in SZDTM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1258 , especially at 74.</text>
