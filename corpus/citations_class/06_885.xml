<tocase>Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rotor Work Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 32 ; (1974) 132 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1974/32.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The Court can only make an order under s 588FF(1) if it is 'satisfied' that the relevant payment transactions are voidable under s 588FE. This means, inter alia, that the relevant transactions must be proven to be insolvent transactions and unfair preferences and/or uncommercial transactions. In this case, Scott and Fairbank wish to contest the claims that the relevant payments were transactions within the meaning of s 9 , that they were unfair preferences or uncommercial transactions (as the case may be) within the meaning of ss 588FA and 588FB, and that the company was insolvent at the time when the relevant payments were made. Generally speaking, the right to contest issues that only arise in the principal proceeding are an accepted incident of third party status: see Helicopter Sales (Australia) Pty Ltd v Rotor Work Pty Ltd [1974] HCA 32 ; (1974) 132 CLR 1 per Barwick CJ at 5 and Mason J at 15.</text>

<tocase>Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 130 FCR 275</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/922.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The authorities recognise that directors in the position of Scott and Fairbank should be able to contest the liquidator's claims against the Commissioner: see Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 130 FCR 275 at [4] - [7] (' Crosbie' ); Hall v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 985 ; (2004) 186 FLR 111 at [16] and [21]-[23] (' Hall' ), and Dean-Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 325. In Crosbie , Finkelstein J made an order that the directors have leave to defend the liquidator's claim against the Commissioner of Taxation on terms that they be bound by all decisions made in that action and they be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. In Hall , Barrett J directed that the third parties have leave to appear and take part in the hearing of the plaintiffs' claims and to defend those claims: at [25].

24 When these issues were raised, I made orders in each proceeding in the same form as those made by Finkelstein J in Crosbie . Specifically, I ordered that the third parties have leave to defend the plaintiff's claim against the Commissioner on terms that: (a) they each be bound by all decisions made in those actions; and (b) they each be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. This order was not opposed by either the plaintiff or the Commissioner.

25 In Crosbie , Finkelstein J also expressed the view, which was not necessary to his decision, that the Court should not act on the parties' admissions as to insolvency without satisfying itself on the evidence as to the correctness of that admission. In his Honour's view, this conclusion followed from the fact that the Court can only make an order under s 588FF if it is satisfied that a transaction of a company is voidable under s 588FE. Subsequent cases have rejected this view, and held that the Court can reach the requisite satisfaction on the basis of the parties' agreement: see Wanted World Wide (Australia) Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 (' Wanted World Wide ') and Young v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 56 ACSR 654 (' Young' ). As I see it, no practical significance attaches to the issue in this case, notwithstanding the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, because the claims made by the plaintiff as to solvency and other matters were contested by Scott and Fairbank. However, if and to the extent that the issue has any significance for this case, I prefer, and would apply, the views expressed in Wanted World Wide and Young .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/632.html</AustLII>
<text>34 As Sundberg J said recently in Tru Floor Service Pty Ltd v Jenkins (No 2) [2006] FCA 632 at [43] ( 'Tru Floor' ), s 95A mandates a cash flow rather than a balance sheet approach to determining solvency.

39 In the end, it is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of a company's financial position taken as a whole whether a voluntary arrangement with a third party for the provision of funds amounts to a sufficient basis for concluding that the company is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due: see Southern Cross Interiors at 224; Lewis at 572 [79] and Tru Floor at [44]. In Tru Floor at [44], Sundberg J said, correctly in my view, that it must also be borne in mind that the plain words of s 95A ('as and when they become due') require anticipated debts to be taken, to some extent, into account in determining solvency.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2001/621.html</AustLII>
<text>35 The relevant principles were distilled by Palmer J in Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2001] NSWSC 621 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at 224-225 ( 'Southern Cross Interiors' ):
 'In my opinion, the following propositions may now be drawn from the authorities: 
 
 (i) whether or not a company is insolvent for the purposes of the Corporations Act (Cth), ss 95A , 459B , 588FC or 588G (1)(b), is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of the company's financial position taken as a whole: Sandell v Porter, Pegulan Floor Coverings Pty Ltd v Carter (1997) 24 ACSR 651; 15 ACLC 1,293 and Fryer v Powell ; 
 
 (ii) in considering the company's financial position as a whole, the Court must have regard to commercial realities. Commercial realities will be relevant in considering what resources are available to the company to meet its liabilities as they fall due, whether resources other than cash are realisable by sale or borrowing upon security, and when such realisations are achievable: Sandell v Porter , Taylor v Australia and New Zealand Banking , Re Newark and Sheahan v Hertz ; 
 
 (iii) in assessing whether a company's position as a whole reveals surmountable temporary illiquidity or insurmountable endemic illiquidity resulting in insolvency, it is proper to have regard to the commercial reality that, in normal circumstances, creditors will not always insist on payment strictly in accordance with their terms of trade but that does not result in the company thereby having a cash or credit resource which can be taken into account in determining solvency: Bank of Australasia v Hall [1906] HCA 54 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1,514 at 1,528; Re Norfolk Plumbing (at 615; 169); Taylor v Australia and New Zealand Banking (at 784; 811); Guthrie (as liq of ULT Ltd (rec apptd) (in liq)) v Radio Frequency Systems Pty Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 572 at 575; 
 
 (iv) the commercial reality that creditors will normally allow some latitude in time for payment of their debts does not, in itself, warrant a conclusion that the debts are not payable at the times contractually stipulated and have become debts payable only upon demand: Standard Chartered Bank v Antico (at 331); Hall v Press Plumbing ; Melbase (at 199; 832-3); Carrier (at 253; 777-778); Cuthbertson v Thomas (at 320); Lee Kong (at 112; 1,568); 
 
 (v) in assessing solvency, the court acts upon the basis that a contract debt is payable at the time stipulated for payment in the contract unless there is evidence, proving to the court's satisfaction, that: 
 &#8226; there has been an express or implied agreement between the company and the creditor for an extension of the time stipulated for payment; or 
 &#8226; there is a course of conduct between the company and the creditor sufficient to give rise to an estoppel preventing the creditor from relying upon the stipulated time for payment; or 
 &#8226; there has been a well established and recognised course of conduct in the industry in which the company operates, or as between the company and its creditors as a body, whereby debts are payable at a time other than that stipulated in the creditors' terms of trade or are payable only on demand: 
 Newark (at 414-415); Standard Chartered Bank v Antico (at 331); Melbase ; Cuthbertson v Thomas ; Fryer v Powell (at 444-445); 
 
 (vi) it is for the party asserting that a company's contract debts are not payable at the times contractually stipulated to make good that assertion by satisfactory evidence: Fryer v Powell (at 444-445); Melbase ; Cuthbertson v Thomas .'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1964/47.html</AustLII>
<text>36 As Palmer J indicated, the law takes a commercially realistic view in determining what resources are available to a company to enable it to pay its debts as and when they fall due. This has long been recognised. In Rees v Bank of New South Wales [1964] HCA 47 ; (1964) 111 CLR 210 at 218, Barwick CJ said:
 'It is quite true that a trader, to remain solvent, does not need to have ready cash by him to cover his commitments as they fall for payment, and that in determining whether he can pay his debts as they become due regard must be had to his realizable assets. The extent to which their existence will prevent a conclusion of insolvency will depend on a number of surrounding circumstances, one of which must be the nature of the assets and in the case of a trader, the nature of his business.'</text>

<text>35 The relevant principles were distilled by Palmer J in Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2001] NSWSC 621 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at 224-225 ( 'Southern Cross Interiors' ):
 'In my opinion, the following propositions may now be drawn from the authorities:

 (vi) it is for the party asserting that a company's contract debts are not payable at the times contractually stipulated to make good that assertion by satisfactory evidence: Fryer v Powell (at 444-445); Melbase ; Cuthbertson v Thomas .'

37 In Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670-671, Barwick CJ stressed that it was important not to confuse insolvency with a temporary lack of liquidity:
 'Insolvency is expressed in s. 95 as an inability to pay debts as they fall due out of the debtor's own money. But the debtor's own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available. They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances, including the nature of the business, of the debtor. The conclusion of insolvency ought to be clear from a consideration of the debtor's financial position in its entirety and generally speaking ought not to be drawn simply from evidence of a temporary lack of liquidity. It is the debtor's inability, utilizing such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets, to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency. Whether that state of his affairs has arrived is a question for the Court and not one as to which expert evidence may be given in terms though no doubt experts may speak as to the likelihood of any of the debtor's assets or capacities yielding ready cash in sufficient time to meet the debts as they fall due.' 
 

This passage was directed to a definition of solvency which was more restrictive than the definition now found in s 95A of the Act, as the previous section spoke of an inability to pay debts as they fall due 'out of the debtor's own money'.</text>

<tocase>Lewis (as liq of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq)) v Doran (2005) 219 ALR 555</tocase>
<text>38 In Lewis (as liq of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq)) v Doran (2005) 219 ALR 555 at 579 [109]-[110] ( 'Lewis' ), Giles JA (with whom Hodgson and McColl JJA agreed) said: 
 'Particularly when the limiting words are no longer part of the test, there is no compelling reason to exclude from consideration funds which can be gained from borrowings secured on assets of third parties, or even unsecured borrowings. If the company can borrow without security, it will have funds to pay its debts as they fall due and will be solvent, provided of course that the borrowing is on deferred payment terms or otherwise such that the lender itself is not a creditor whose debt can not be repaid as and when it becomes due and payable. It comes down to a question of fact, in which the key concept is ability to pay the company's debts as and when they become due and payable. 
 
 Even before the wording of s 95A , in Re RHD Power Services Pty Ltd (1991) 3 ACSR 261; 9 ACLC 27 McPherson SPJ was prepared to pay regard to ability to borrow without security. Kearney J in Re Adnot Pty Ltd (1982) 7 ACLR 212; 1 ACLC 307 took into account that the company "instead of having to resort to some outside lender, is in the fortunate position of having its fellow member of the group of companies to which it belongs, available in effect as banker to provide funds required to meet any shortfall": at ACLR 217; ACLC 311; the shortfall was until completion and sale of a shopping centre. In Re a Company [1986] BCLC 261 Nourse J declined to find that a company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due although it was being "propped up by loans made to it by associated companies and possibly by others": at 262; his Lordship noted at 263 that he had evidence from a director to the effect that there was no question of the loans being withdrawn, the loans not being repayable for some 18 months.' (The emphasis appears in the judgment.)
 

Giles JA went on to add that solvency can be established even though the arrangement under which funds are to be provided by a third party is entirely voluntary.

39 In the end, it is a question of fact to be ascertained from a consideration of a company's financial position taken as a whole whether a voluntary arrangement with a third party for the provision of funds amounts to a sufficient basis for concluding that the company is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due: see Southern Cross Interiors at 224; Lewis at 572 [79] and Tru Floor at [44]. In Tru Floor at [44], Sundberg J said, correctly in my view, that it must also be borne in mind that the plain words of s 95A ('as and when they become due') require anticipated debts to be taken, to some extent, into account in determining solvency.

97 Given my factual findings, the decision in Lewis does not assist the directors. In any event, that was a very different case. There, a corporate reconstruction had resulted in a number of intercompany loans. Following the reconstruction, over a period of slightly more than three years, the company paid all of its debts as and when they fell due with the assistance of funds provided by other companies in the group. Over that period, there was no evidence of any of the usual indicia of insolvency, such as unpaid group tax or payroll tax or other unpaid debts. Most importantly, the funds provided by other group companies were sufficient at all relevant times to enable the company to discharge its debts as and when they fell due: see at 570-573 [74]-[82]. The present case is very different, in that the related company was never providing sufficient funds to enable TSI and TSIA to pay their respective debts as and when they fell due.

98 In the first proceeding, the liquidator alleges that each of the claimed payments was an unfair preference within the meaning of s 588FA. In the second proceeding concerning TSIA, the liquidator alleges that six payments, totalling $66,827.05, were unfair preferences.

99 To establish these contentions, the liquidator must establish three things: (1) the payments were transactions; (2) the Commissioner received the payments in his capacity as a creditor; and (3) each payment resulted in the Commissioner receiving in respect of an unsecured debt more than he would receive if he proved for that debt in the winding up.</text>

<tocase>FAI Insurances Limited v Gold Leaf Interior Decorators Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 643</tocase>
<text>96 I am also satisfied that the funds actually advanced by Swift Malaysia directly, or via Swift Australia, to TSI and TSIA were not sufficient to enable either TSI or TSIA to pay their debts as and when they fell due. On the contrary, there is clear evidence that TSI and TSIA never had sufficient funds, whether from Swift Malaysia or elsewhere, to pay all of their debts as and when they fell due. It does not avail the directors to say that they used funds provided by Swift Malaysia to pay some of the larger and more pressing debts of TSI and TSIA, especially those, such as the debt to the Commissioner, which might expose the directors to personal liability. As Kirby P said in FAI Insurances Limited v Gold Leaf Interior Decorators Pty Ltd (1988) 14 NSWLR 643 at 649, a company's failure to pay a small debt may often be the best possible evidence of the company's insolvency.</text>

<tocase>D'Aloia v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 203 ALR 609</tocase>
<text>107 In my opinion, the payments in question were uncommercial transactions. They conferred no benefit on TSIA. Indeed, the payments conferred only detriments on TSIA in that they had the effect of increasing the outstanding liabilities of TSI to TSIA in circumstances where there was no prospect that TSI would be able to repay the advances. This conclusion is supported by the decision in D'Aloia v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 203 ALR 609 (' D'Aloia '). In D'Aloia , the issue was whether payments that had been made on behalf of another company for the discharge of its taxation debts were uncommercial transactions within the meaning of the Act. In return for making the payment, there was a reduction in the loan account of the company making the payment. Merkel J held that the transaction was uncommercial. His Honour said (at 613):
 'The only benefit to Damark from making payments totalling in excess of $36,000 on behalf of Gralyn appears to have been the reduction in the loan account to Gralyn in the sum of $3775 and, possibly, the use of some of Gralyn's motor vehicles. However, the evidence is to the effect that the benefit to Damark was minor compared to the amount it paid. I am not satisfied that, having regard to the matters set out in s 588FB(1), a reasonable person in Damark's circumstances would have made the payments. Accordingly, subject to any defence under s 588FG(2), I am satisfied that the three payments in question constituted uncommercial transactions .'
 

The present is a stronger case than D'Aloia . Neither Scott nor Fairbank pointed in evidence, or in submissions, to any benefit to TSIA in making these tax payments on behalf of TSI.

108 The payments made by TSIA to discharge TSI's tax liabilities to the Commissioner were insolvent transactions within the meaning of s 588FC; they were uncommercial transactions which were entered into when TSIA was insolvent.

109 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that each of the payments challenged by the liquidator is voidable because of s 588FE. Each payment in question was an insolvent transaction of the relevant company and it was entered into during the six months ending on the relation back day. It is unnecessary to consider the longer relation back period relating to uncommercial transactions.</text>

 '"Expectation", as required by s 588H(2), means a higher degree of certainty than "mere hope or possibility" or "suspecting": 3M Australia Pty Ltd v Kemish (1986) 10 ACLR 371 at 378; Dunn v Shapowloff [1978] 2 NSWLR 235 at 249; (1978) 3 ACLR 775. The defence requires an actual expectation that the company was and would continue to be solvent, and that the grounds for so expecting are reasonable. A director cannot rely on a complete ignorance of or neglect of duty ( Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Lewis (1986) 11 ACLR 122 at 129) and cannot hide behind ignorance of the company's affairs which is of their own making or, if not entirely of their own making, has been contributed to by their own failure to make further necessary inquiries: Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd v Morley (1990) 2 ACSR 405; Morley v State Wide Tobacco Services Ltd [1993] 1 VR 423; (1992) 8 ACSR 305.'</text>

<tocase>Metropolitan Fire Systems Pty Ltd v Miller (1997) 23 ACSR 699</tocase>
<text>114 The operation of the defence was described in similar terms by Einfeld J in Metropolitan Fire Systems Pty Ltd v Miller (1997) 23 ACSR 699 at 711:
 'The onus of proof for these defences is on the director seeking to rely on them who must establish the elements of the defences on the balance of probabilities. The grounds on which the director forms the view as to the company's solvency or otherwise must be reasonable. This implies an objective consideration of the grounds viewed against all circumstances and not whether, when looked at from the point of view of the director in question, the grounds appear reasonable. 
 
 The defences under s 588H require that there be reasonable grounds to "expect", as opposed to "suspect", solvency as provided in s 588G. From the cases in which the meaning of these words has been considered, it would appear that to "suspect" something requires a lower threshold of knowledge or awareness than to "expect" it: see a discussion on "to suspect" by Kitto J in Queensland Bacon Pty Ltd v Rees [1966] HCA 21 ; (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303; [1966] ALR 855; and 3M Australia at 192. The expectation must be differentiated from mere hope in order to satisfy this defence: Dunn v Shapowloff [1978] NSWLR 235; (1978) 3 ACLR 775. It implies a measure of confidence that the company is solvent. The directors must have reasonable grounds for regarding it as likely that the company would at the relevant date have been able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.' 
 

Einfeld J also said at 703 that the requirement for objectively reasonable grounds must be judged by the standard appropriate to a director of ordinary competence: 3M Australia Pty Ltd v Kemish (1986) 10 ACLR 371 at 373.</text>

<tocase>Superior Press Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 55 ATR 541</tocase>
<text>117 I have already indicated that I do not accept the evidence given by Scott and Fairbank concerning the asserted payment arrangements with creditors such as the SRO, Swinburne, and MBA. Scott's unsubstantiated assertions about these payment arrangements are not capable of discharging the onus that falls on the directors to establish the defence set out in s 588FGB(3): see Superior Press Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 55 ATR 541 (' Superior Press ')at 546-547.

118 I am also satisfied that the financial support that was provided by Swift Malaysia did not provide Scott and Fairbank with reasonable grounds to expect that TSI and TSIA were solvent during the six months ending 15 May 2003, and that they would remain solvent even if they made the payments to the Commissioner with the support of Swift Malaysia. I refer to my earlier findings: the July agreement does not contain any obligation or undertaking by Swift Malaysia to provide funds to TSI and TSIA on a continuing basis to enable those companies to discharge their liabilities as and when they arose; and the funds actually advanced by Swift Malaysia and/or Swift Australia to TSI and TSIA were ad hoc loans and were not sufficient to enable either company to pay its debts as and when they fell due.

119 I also consider that there was no evidence establishing that Scott and Fairbank could reasonably rely upon Swift Malaysia to provide all of the funds necessary to enable TSI and TSIA to pay their debts, on a continuing basis, as and when they fell due.

123 The first part of the submission was that any order against the Commissioner requiring it to repay amounts that were paid to the Commissioner in respect of ITW liabilities would simply involve unwinding preferential payments that the Commissioner had no entitlement to receive. On this basis, it was submitted that the Commissioner would not suffer any loss or damage. I disagree. By the order I propose to make in favour of the liquidator, the Commissioner will be required to repay amounts it received in payment of debts that were outstanding to the Commissioner. To the extent that those debts relate to ITW liabilities, an order requiring that the amounts in question be paid to the liquidator will cause loss or damage within the meaning of s 588FGA(2). Instead of retaining payments amounting to $29,260.82 in the case of TSI's ITW liabilities, and $107,329.99 in respect of ITW liabilities owed by TSIA, the Commissioner will have to prove in the winding up of TSI and TSIA respectively. As the liquidator said in evidence, unsecured creditors will not receive any distribution in the winding up of those companies. Consequently, the orders sought against the Commissioner will result in loss or damage: see Superior Press , per Byrne J at 548 [35]-[37].

124 In the first proceeding, the Commissioner has agreed to submit to an order that he will pay the liquidator the sum of $16,865.33 in respect of interest and costs. The corresponding order in the second proceeding does not make any provision for interest or costs. Scott and Fairbank argue that interest and costs paid by the Commissioner to the liquidator forms no part of the loss or damage resulting from the s 588FF order.

125 In Superior Press , Byrne J accepted that interest that the Commissioner is ordered to pay to the liquidator pursuant to s 588FF will constitute loss and damage suffered by the Commissioner within the meaning of s 588FGA(2), or at least it will do so when payment is made: at 549 [38]. However, Byrne J took into account the fact that the interest ordered under s 588FF related to all of the impugned payments, whereas the indemnity under s 588FGA only relates to those payments which were made in respect of ITW liabilities. Accordingly, Byrne J adjusted the amount of interest to reflect the ratio of total tax payments recovered by the liquidator to the ITW tax payments that attracted indemnity. I propose to adopt a similar course. In TSI's case, the ITW liabilities of $29,260.82 represented 76.36 per cent of the payments totalling $38,319.55 which will be the subject of the order under s 588FF; and in TSIA's case, the ITW liabilities of $107,329.99 represented 67.15 per cent of the payments totalling $159,815.12 which are to be the subject of orders under s 588FF.

126 Scott and Fairbank also submitted that any costs that the Commissioner might be required to pay to the liquidator of TSI pursuant to s 588FF should not attract indemnity under s 588FGA(2). In Superior Press , Byrne J accepted that if the Commissioner is ordered to pay costs to the liquidator in an appropriate amount, that will form part of the Commissioner's recoverable loss and damage under s 588FGA(2): at 549 [39]-[40]. I agree.

127 For these reasons, I reject the argument that the Commissioner has not suffered any recoverable loss or damage resulting from the order I propose to make in each proceeding under s 588FF. To the extent that the Commissioner is ordered to pay an amount to the liquidator in each case, representing the amount of payments it received in respect of ITW liabilities, and amounts in respect of interest and costs, those amounts can properly be the subject of an indemnification order. I am satisfied that the figure agreed for interest and costs in the first proceeding of $16,865.33 is an appropriate sum, and less than the figure that might have been awarded in the absence of agreement. I will, however, adjust this figure so as to take account of the ratio of ITW payments to total payments.

128 At the commencement of these reasons for judgment, I set out the orders which the liquidator seeks in each proceeding as against the Commissioner. I propose to make orders in each proceeding in the form sought by the liquidator.</text>

<tocase>Ferrier v Civil Aviation Authority (1994) 55 FCR 28</tocase>
<text>131 While I consider that the liquidator is entitled to recover costs from Scott and Fairbank, it would be too harsh to run the calculations from 14 November 2005. The more appropriate date from which to calculate costs is 13 December 2005, being the date upon which Finkelstein J made directions for the contested hearing of these two proceedings. Aside from the settlement agreement between the liquidator and the Commissioner, the liquidator would have been entitled to recover interest from the Commissioner in each proceeding pursuant to s 51A(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In the ordinary course, interest would relate to the period from the date of demand by the liquidator for the repayment of the preferences until the date upon which such preferences were repaid: Ferrier v Civil Aviation Authority (1994) 55 FCR 28 at 92-93. In these proceedings, however, the liquidator did not advance any claim for the recovery of interest from the Commissioner, save and to the extent that the orders proposed in the first proceeding include an agreed amount of $16,865.33 in respect of interest and costs. The liquidator has not advanced any cause of action against Scott and Fairbank that would entitle him to recover interest directly from them. Furthermore, the Commissioner has not made any claim for the recovery of interest from Scott and Fairbank. The Commissioner's only entitlement against Scott and Fairbank is for an indemnity under s 588FGA and as the Commissioner is not exposed to any liability for interest in respect of the period after 14 November 2005, there is no basis for claiming interest against Scott and Fairbank in respect of that period. In my opinion, it is not appropriate to order that Scott and Fairbank make any payment of interest to the liquidator.

132 As for the order that Scott and Fairbank pay $46,126.15 to the Commissioner, the figure has two components. The first component represents that part of the total payments of $38,319.55 that reflects the payment of ITW liabilities, namely $29,260.82. The second component represents the sum agreed between the Commissioner and the liquidator for interest and costs of $16,865.33. In my opinion, the second component is excessive. As I have explained, it needs to be reduced to take account of the fact that ITW liabilities represented only 76.36 per cent of the total figure of $38,319.55. Applying this percentage produces a figure of $12,878.37 for interest and costs, which I consider to be the appropriate measure of the Commissioner's loss and damage in this respect.

133 It follows that the order referred to in sub-paragraph (3) above must be adjusted by substituting the amount of $42,139.19 for the sum of $46,126.15 proposed by the Commissioner.</text>
