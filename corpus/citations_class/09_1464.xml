<text>In Auskay International Manufacturing &amp; Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1458 ; (2008) 251 ALR 166 , I struck out the applicant's second amended statement of claim ("the SASC"). I granted the applicant leave to file and serve a further amended statement of claim. The current pleading is its fourth amended statement of claim (the "FASC").

The respondents (other than the second, sixth and seventh respondents) seek the striking out of the whole of the FASC or parts of it under O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or has a tendency to cause embarrassment or delay.

In my reasons for striking out the SASC ("my previous reasons") I explained the nature of the proceeding and the issues in dispute between the applicant and the respondents. I also identified the principles which informed the exercise of the Court's powers under O 11 r 16. I do not here repeat what I have said on those matters. These reasons should be read together with my previous reasons.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1976.html</AustLII>
<text>The law on what constitutes a "market in Australia" is far from settled. One thing that is clear is that a market which is wholly outside Australia is not comprehended by the statutory definition: see Singapore Airlines Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2009) 260 ALR 244 at 254; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Qantas Airways Ltd [2008] FCA 1976 ; (2008) 253 ALR 89 at 112. The existence of a global market which extends into the geographic boundaries of Australia does not, on the other hand, preclude a finding that there exists a "market in Australia". There can, therefore, be no objection to the applicant pleading, as it has done, that there is a global market for air freight services and that part of that market is a "market in Australia", provided that material facts are pleaded which establish the existence of those markets: see Sammy Rosso Supplies Pty Ltd v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-641 at 41-094 per Goldberg J.</text>

<tocase>Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/312.html</AustLII>
<text>One of those material facts, in a case in which s 45A of the TPA is relied on, is the area or areas within Australia in which particular respondents compete with each other and in which they give effect to any anti-competitive agreement to which they are parties. As Middleton J said in Emirates v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 312 ; (2009) 255 ALR 35 at 41: 
 
 "The services the subject of the unlawful provision must be the services supplied by the relevant party to the arrangement in competition with the other party in any market in Australia. Put another way, the area of competition has to coincide with the area of restriction imposed by the unlawful provision: see ss 45A(8) , 4D (1)(a) and (2) ...".

In Emirates , Middleton J referred to the issue in the course of dealing with applications to set aside notices issued under s 155 of the TPA. His Honour held (at 52): 
 
 "... the place of contracting is not determinative of the geographic locality of the relevant market. The references relied upon in Heydon J D, Trade Practices Law (Lawbook Co, subscription service) do not, in context, stand for such a proposition. As the authorities referred to previously indicate, the concept of a 'market' refers to a range of 'competitive activities' relating to the field of actual or potential activities between buyers and sellers among whom there is, or can be, close competition. It involves the 'field of rivalry', not just referrable [sic] to the place of contracting".

It had been submitted to his Honour that some observations which I had made in my previous reasons supported the proposition that there could not be a market in Australia unless contracts between buyers and sellers were negotiated and entered into in Australia. One of the respondents' grounds for seeking to have the SASC struck out was that it did not identify the various routes, to and from Australia, on which the various respondents (or some of them) competed. It was in this context that I said at [21] that: 
 
 "The respondents in the present proceeding are entitled to know where in Australia it is said that they compete with each other named respondent for the provision of international airfreight services. This will depend on where negotiations between the respondents and their customers take place and contracts are entered into. These material particulars are not provided. It cannot be assumed that all or even some of the respondents are in competition, in the necessary sense, in all parts of Australia. In the absence of these material facts the pleadings are deficient in a significant respect".

On reflection, I should have used the word "may" instead of "will" in the second sentence of the quoted passage. It was not my intention to rule, on a pleading summons, that the place or places where the international carriers negotiated and entered into contracts with those who wished to use their services, were or would be determinative of the geographic location of the relevant markets. These were relevant but not decisive considerations. If the only substantial competitive activity which occurred between particular carriers on routes into and out of Australia took place overseas this may have suggested that the relevant market was not "in Australia" even if contracts were signed here. On the other hand, if vigorous competition and negotiations in Australia culminated in contracts being signed overseas the opposite conclusion would be likely. These matters were, therefore, material in determining the geographic parameters of the relevant market and, in particular, whether that market was "in Australia". Those parameters differed between the respondent carriers, because they did not all provide services to and from the same ports or along the same routes.

For present purposes, the applicant's failure to identify where relevant negotiations took place, and where contracts were entered into and signed between the respondents and their customers, does not lead to the conclusion that it has thereby also failed to plead facts which would be determinative of the geographic boundaries of the market. The failure does, however, mean that material facts which must be provided in order to identify the global market and the part of it which constitutes a "market in Australia" have not been supplied.

In its SASC the applicant failed to plead the existence of any relevant market in Australia. It sought to remedy this deficiency, in its FASC, by pleading the existence of multiple markets, variously described. This has served only to create greater confusion. The individual respondents are entitled to know the markets for the provision of international air freight services which are alleged to exist in Australia, and in which of those markets it is alleged that they compete with another respondent or respondents and who those other respondents are. The FASC does not provide this essential information.</text>

<tocase>Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (1976) 8 ALR 481</tocase>
<text>Any attempt to define a "market" with absolute precision confronts serious obstacles. The term "is a metaphor used to describe a range of competitive activities by reference to function, product and geography": see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 193 ; (2003) 131 FCR 529 at 545. The concept was succinctly explained by Fisher J in Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (1979) 26 ALR 609 at 647 where he quoted with approval a passage from a decision of the Trade Practices Tribunal: 
 
 "The Trade Practices Tribunal considered the concept of market in some detail in Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (1975-6) 8 ALR 481 at 517, where the members said: "A market is the area of close competition between firms or, putting it a little differently, the field of rivalry between them ... Within the bounds of a market there is substitution substitution between one product and another, and between one source of supply and another, in response to changing prices. So a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers amongst whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive"...".

As Re Queensland Co-operative Milling and other authorities to which I made reference in my previous reasons make clear, a market for services will exist only if there is strong substitutability between those services on both the demand and supply sides. In its submissions, Cathay Pacific cited a number of hypothetical examples which make good this point. There may be a high degree of cross-elasticity of demand between an international air freight service from Hong Kong to Sydney and an equivalent service from Hong Kong to Melbourne. An increase in the price of the Hong Kong to Sydney service might lead to customers using the Hong Kong to Melbourne service and then using land transport to move the goods within Australia. In such circumstances it could be said that the Hong Kong to Sydney and the Hong Kong to Melbourne services were part of the same market. On the supply side, if carriers were faced with reduced demand for services on the Hong Kong to Sydney route, and an increased demand on the Hong Kong to Melbourne route, the carriers which service both routes could move aircraft and other resources from the Sydney route to the Melbourne route to meet the changed demand. It could, therefore, be said that there was a high degree of cross-elasticity of supply between the services so as to justify treating the two routes as part of a single market.

It would, on the other hand, be far more difficult, if not impossible, to establish the existence of cross-elasticity of demand or supply for international air freight services on the routes from Hong Kong to Moscow and from Dubai to Sydney. The applicant, nonetheless, maintained that the field of rivalry between the respondents, and hence the market, is worldwide.

As has been noted, the material facts relied on by the applicant to establish the existence of a "global market" include the possibility that carriers are able to substitute routes and modes of carriage between hubs and ports when providing services. In some cases this will be suggestive of cross-elasticity of supply. It would not matter to the customer, assuming no material variation in charges or delivery time, whether goods sent from London to Melbourne were routed through Hong Kong or Singapore. That may be accepted and the two routes may be found to form part of the same market. That example, however, deals with but one of a myriad of routes comprehended by the substitutability pleading in paragraph 34. Not all of these routes could possibly be said to form part of the same market. It could not, realistically, be asserted that close competition and strong substitution could be found for the supply of international air freight services between one particular route and every other route in the world. Rather, there are potentially thousands of discrete markets, the existence of which will depend on the type of economic analysis referred to in the authorities.

In order for there to be a "market in Australia", it is necessary for competitive activity to occur within Australia. As I said at [19]: 
 
 "In economic terms "a market is the field of actual and potential transactions between buyers and sellers among whom there can be strong substitution, at least in the long run, if given a sufficient price incentive": see Re Queensland Co-operative Milling Association Ltd (1976) 25 FLR 169 at 190. In the same case a market was also referred to as an "area of close competition between firms": ibid; see also Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 195 (per Deane J); at 199-200 (per Dawson J). Buyers and sellers of goods and services must negotiate and enter transactions in an area in which suppliers are engaged in close competition with each other. That area must be located within Australia".

Competitive activity can take many forms. It may involve advertising campaigns by the suppliers of particular goods or services by which they attempt to attract customers. It may involve the efficiency with which services are provided or attempts to provide higher quality products. Firms may also compete by offering better quality after-sales service, or in ensuring the ready availability of spare parts. These competitive activities may take place within a geographic market even though contracts for the provision of the goods or services are negotiated or entered into elsewhere. In many cases, negotiations between seller and buyer will take place in a competitive environment in Australia and contracts will be signed here. When, however, there is a global or international market of which Australia forms part, it is possible for competitive activity of the kind earlier mentioned to take place in Australia even though contractual arrangements are formalised overseas.

It has yet to be determined authoritatively that a "market in Australia" exists when goods and services are provided on a competitive basis in Australia, but the terms and conditions on which they are provided have been negotiated and agreed upon wholly outside Australia.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/499.html</AustLII>
<text>The retention, within the group definition, of persons who indirectly pay the costs of moving goods by air again raises the "passing on" issue to which I referred at [41] [43] of my previous reasons. The extent of any resultant difficulty is much reduced by the narrowing of the definition to exclude many down-stream members. If the definition is further refined to remove the remaining difficulties, any pleading issue relating to a possible "passing on" defence will be avoided. The applicant will then be able to identify the amounts which it alleges it has paid for air freight services, directly or indirectly, to one or more of the respondents. If need be, further clarification of the amounts allegedly overpaid by reason of the cartel arrangements can be sought by the respondents. The Court would be able to direct the applicant to file a statement setting out how it intends to prove the losses which it and group members are said to have suffered: see Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 499. The respondents will then be in a position to determine whether they may plead a "passing on" defence. Whether or not such a defence is available will be a matter to be determined at trial.

The applicant continues to plead that it and the represented group members suffered loss and damage because the impugned agreements caused prices for international air freight services to be "higher than [they] otherwise would have been" (paragraphs 133 and 134). The applicant has sought to meet the shortcomings which I identified in my previous reasons at [38] by asserting, in particulars subjoined to paragraph 137, that the extent of the loss and damage suffered by the applicant and group members, in part, comprised the fuel and security overcharges paid by each of them.

Despite this, the problems to which I referred in my previous reasons remain. In particular, the allegations in paragraphs 133 and 134 are conclusionary without material facts to support them. The amendments to the particulars subjoined to paragraph 137 are not confined to overcharging in the course of transactions which occurred in a market in Australia. As currently framed, the particulars suggest that the applicant and the group members' loss and damage is to be calculated by reference to any occasion anywhere on which they paid surcharges which were imposed pursuant to the cartel arrangements.</text>
