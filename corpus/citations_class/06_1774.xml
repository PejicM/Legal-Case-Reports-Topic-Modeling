<tocase>Schweppes Ltd v Archer (1934) 34 SR (NSW) 178 at 183</tocase>
<text>27 Alternatively, Mr Tree submitted that review by the Court was constrained in the same way as courts are upon a review of a taxation of costs. In such a case it is said that the Court will only interfere on an error of principle or, on a matter of discretion, "where the taxing officer's discretion appears not to have been exercised at all, or to have been exercised in a manner which is manifestly wrong; and where the question is one of amount only, will do so only in an extreme case": Schweppes' Ltd v Archer (1934) 34 SR (NSW) 178 at 183.

28 Neither submission should be accepted. The power of the District Registrar to determine or review (or "confirm, increase or reduce") the Liquidator's remuneration and expenses comes from the Court's powers under s 473(3) and (5) of the Corporations Act . A power of the Court may be delegated to a Registrar by Rules of Court: Federal Court of Australia Act 1974 (Cth) s 35A(1)(h). The powers in question were delegated by r 16.1(1) of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 (Cth), see sch 2, Pt 1 , item 54. The exercise of a power so delegated may be reviewed by the Court or a Judge: r 16(2). For constitutional reasons (see Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1991) 172 CLR 84), the review of a Registrar's decision must be a hearing de novo : Mazukov v University of Tasmania [2004] FCAFC 159 at [21] - [24] (Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ). For that reason, reviews of taxation of costs in this Court are not limited as in the Schweppes' rule: Cachia v Westpac Financial Services Limited [2003] FCA 817 at [18] - [24] (Hely J).</text>

<tocase>Pantzer v Wenkart [2006] FCAFC 140 ; (2006) 153 FCR 466 at [44]</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/140.html</AustLII>
<text>31 ASIC sought information about the progress of the winding up. ASIC was at pains, both in its enquiries and in the present application to the Court, to make it clear that it was not alleging or suspecting wrongdoing by the Liquidator. It may be doubted that ASIC was exercising its power of enquiry under s 536(1) of the Corporations Act . It never stated that it was. It has never claimed that the Liquidator, in terms of s 536(1)(a) , had not "faithfully performed his duties" or had not "observed a requirement of the Court or of the Corporations Act or of the regulations or the rules". It did not make the Liquidator aware that it was acting as a result of communications from the Trust until 21 March 2006. But in any event, there is no question that ASIC had power to act as it did. Rather the point is whether in responding to ASIC's queries the Liquidator was providing the services contemplated by the Winding Up Order. Put another way, was the provision of information to ASIC an incident of the Liquidator acting as such, charged with the responsibility of winding up the Scheme (cf Pantzer v Wenkart [2006] FCAFC 140 ; (2006) 153 FCR 466 at [44] ). In my opinion, both questions must be answered in the affirmative.

38 In Pantzer the Full Court of this Court upheld a claim for remuneration by a trustee in bankruptcy. In his capacity as a former trustee the appellant had been drawn into litigate to assert a claimed amount which the respondent had not challenged by seeking taxation. Nothing in the judgment of the Full Court would appear to be inconsistent with the conclusion I have reached. Mr Tree was correct in submitting that (i) Pantzer provides no support for an additional requirement that to qualify for remuneration a liquidator's work must also "add value" to the liquidation, and (ii) the present case is stronger in that the Liquidator's work was not just "unavoidable, in a practical sense" albeit for his own benefit (at [43]-[44]) he was lawfully compelled by the Winding Up Order to perform it.

39 There will be an order that Barry Keith Hamilton is entitled to be paid by the Solicitors' Trust the sum of $85,639.65. ASIC's application will be dismissed.

40 The parties should file and serve before 10 am on Wednesday 20 December 2006 written submissions as to how the costs of this application should be dealt with. The alternatives seem to be that the costs of all parties be paid out of the proceeds of the winding up, or from the Guarantee Fund, or that ASIC and the Trust pay the Liquidator's costs.

<tocase>Venetian Nominees Pty Ltd v Conlan (1998) 20 WAR 96 at 102-106</tocase>
<text>32 Mr Abbott, counsel for ASIC, relied on a number of authorities. In Venetian Nominees Pty Ltd v Conlan (1998) 20 WAR 96 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia set aside a Master's approval of a provisional liquidator's remuneration. However, this was on the ground that the provisional liquidator had not provided "adequate evidentiary material" to enable the Court to determine whether the amounts claimed were fair and reasonable: at 102-106. In the present case, as noted above, quantum is not in issue.</text>

<text>33 Re Korda; in the matter of Stockford Ltd [2004] FCA 1682 ; (2004) 140 FCR 424 (Finkelstein J) was concerned with the validity of resolutions fixing administrators' fees. His Honour also discussed the basis on which the quantum of administrators' and liquidators' remuneration should be assessed. Again, such questions do not arise in the present case.</text>

<text>34 Ide v Ide [2004] NSWSC 751 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 324 was concerned with (hopefully) very unusual circumstances, far removed from the present case. A receiver of a partnership attended at the partnership property. In the course of an argument the defendant fired a rifle and killed the daughter of the plaintiff. The receiver's time spent in assisting police with their enquiries was held by Young CJ to be part of his "greater civic duty" and not recoverable as remuneration.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 133</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/2004/133.html</AustLII>
<text>35 Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Atlantic 3 Financial (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] QSC 133 involved claims for remuneration by investigating accountants appointed by order of the Supreme Court of Queensland to investigate certain managed investment schemes and report to the Court. Mullins J heard detailed objections to the accountants' claims. One claim disallowed (at [26]) was for attending a meeting with ASIC to explain the report. This was on the basis that the obligation of the accountants was to report to the Court and the subsequent conference with ASIC was a matter for ASIC and "cannot be characterised as part of the supervision required to be undertaken by the accountants or as part of the work in preparing the report". Also disallowed (at [35]) were work undertaken on certain loan schemes when the accountants knew the schemes had already been wound up by the date of their appointment. These were purely questions of fact and provide no analogy to the present case where the Liquidator reported to ASIC, pursuant to his obligations under the Winding up Order, express or implied, as to the progress of the winding up.</text>

<tocase>Mirror Group Newspapers plc v Maxwell [1988] 1 BCLC 638</tocase>
<text>36 Mirror Group Newspapers plc v Maxwell [1988] 1 BCLC 638 supports the conclusion I have reached. The Court appointed receivers of the estate of the notorious Robert Maxwell. Questions rose over the remuneration of the receivers, including their costs of time spent in responding to a report of a committee of the House of Commons, the Select Committee on Social Security. The committee had been investigating pension funds. When it became apparent, soon after Mr Maxwell's death, that pension funds of companies associated with Mr Maxwell had been "plundered to the extent of hundred of millions of pounds" (at 658) the committee turned to investigate the receivers and other sets of administrators of the affairs of Mr Maxwell and his companies. The receivers devoted substantial amounts of time and incurred substantial expenditure in dealing with the requirements of the committee (at 659). They also spent time dealing with enquiries from the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the prosecution of Mr Maxwell's son. Ferris J said (at 659-660):
 "These activities are highly unusual ones for receivers to have become involved in. But they would not have arisen but for the fact that the receivers held the office to which the court had appointed them. Moreover the participation of the receivers was not initiated by them, nor was attendance before the select committee and the provision of information to it voluntary in any true sense, because physical, as well as moral, sanctions might have been applied if the receivers had ignored the requests for assistance made by the select committee. My present view is, therefore, that at least the initial response of the receivers to the requirements of the select committee and probably the entirety of their dealings with the Serious Fraud Office were wholly proper, even if also extraordinary, acts done in the course of the receivership. So far as I have residual doubts, these are attributable to the absence of full information about what has been done. In particular I am concerned that a significant part of the time and effort which the receivers have devoted to satisfying the requirements of the select committee may have been attributable to the receivers defending their conduct from criticism rather than merely providing information. If this were the case I would wish to give further consideration to the question whether the cost (whether in the form of remuneration for time spent by the receivers themselves or in disbursements paid to third parties) is properly to be paid out of the estate."

37 The present case is stronger in that the provision of information to ASIC was not extraordinary but rather an obligation expressly required by the Winding Up Order itself and indeed the very sort of obligation one would expect when a winding up occurs on the application of ASIC. Further, given the tenor of ASIC's enquiries, and particularly its letter of 20 December 2005, the essence of the Liquidator's response was the provision of information, not justification or answers to accusations.</text>
