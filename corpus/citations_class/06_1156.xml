<tocase>House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>6 In the context of the issues raised on the appeal, the respondent contends that the above considerations provide a basis for the findings of Federal Magistrate Coker and result in the exercise of a discretion, conferred by s 30 of the Act, to fix the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the trustee on a basis thought appropriate. Consistent with the familiar passage in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 (and particularly the passage at p 505 of the judgment of their Honours Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ), the exercise of the discretion ought not to be disturbed. The respondent in oral submissions also relied upon s 179 of the Act as the source of the power to fix the amount of the costs (expenses and remuneration) at $15,000.00. The appellant contends that s 179 was not relied upon by the respondent in the proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker; was raised for the first time in oral submissions in the hearing of the appeal; and the respondent ought not to be allowed to now rely upon s 179 as that section contemplates a particular process which is inconsistent with the conduct of the respondent's application and had the respondent relied upon s 179 , the appellant would have conducted its response to the application differently. Supplementary written submissions have been directed to the question of s 179.

7 In resolving these competing contentions it has been necessary to closely examine considerable material concerning the precise chronology of events inherent in the administration and the various propositions put to the trustee and the trustee's response. In dealing with the questions raised on the appeal, it is not the role of the appellate court to resolve contested questions of fact. However, in determining whether the exercise of a power or discretion (if conferred) miscarried, it is necessary to look at the evidence before Federal Magistrate Coker and consider the material in the context of the matters that influenced his Honour to exercise the power in a particular way or to reach particular conclusions.

8 The appellant seeks leave to amend the notice of appeal and relies upon two affidavits of James Nicholas Conomos filed 23 November 2005 and 29 November 2005 respectively which exhibit an amended notice of appeal and a further amended notice of appeal. Although Mr Laurie, counsel for the respondent, objects to the lateness of the amendments, Mr Laurie concedes that the respondent has suffered no prejudice by reason of the late notice of the proposed changes. The proposed changes to the amended notice of appeal are not significant. Accordingly, leave is given to amend the notice of appeal in terms of the document described as Exhibit 'JNC1' to the affidavit of James Nicholas Conomos filed on 29 November 2005.

9 On 20 June 2003, the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Ms Townsend. The application was made by Ms Townsend's former partner as a result of an unpaid costs order made against Ms Townsend in family law proceedings. It seems the solicitors for Ms Townsend's former partner were instructed to take all necessary steps to recover the amount of the assessed costs. The affidavit evidence suggests that Ms Townsend's former partner did not anticipate that such action would result in a sequestration order. Nevertheless, the amount of the costs remained unpaid after service of the certificate, service of a bankruptcy notice and service of an application for a sequestration order. The costs remained unpaid at the date of the hearing of the application. At the hearing, Ms Townsend contended that she was solvent as the value of her assets exceeded the amount due and payable to her creditors (including the amount of the costs order).

10 It is not clear whether any undertaking to discharge the debts within a particular period, or, by recourse to support from a third party, supported by an affidavit to that effect, was offered as an element of a request for an adjournment of the hearing of the application. In any event, the Registrar was satisfied that there was a proper basis for making a sequestration order presumably on the ground that the material in support of the application and the history of a failure to pay or compromise the unpaid costs claim established that Ms Townsend could not pay her debts as and when they fell due for payment notwithstanding the contended surplus of assets over liabilities.</text>

<tocase>Duncan v McVeigh &amp; Anor FMCA 759</tocase>
<text>72 His Honour reached these conclusions:
 
 
 (a) his Honour was not satisfied that a declaration could be made that the trustee had deliberately contributed to the imposition of excessive charges [8];
 (b) his Honour was of the view that 'there is certainly in my view, power to fix a sum in relation to costs in respect of the administration of the estate' [8];
 (c) it is not possible to make an order pursuant to s 153A or direct the trustee to issue a certificate [10] [12];
 (d) had the financial circumstances of the respondent been properly considered at the time of hearing the creditor's petition, there would have been some consideration given to adjourning the petition [16];
 (e) the contention that the value of Ms Townsend's assets exceeded her identified liabilities makes it 'clear that the applicant was in a position of solvency'. His Honour relies upon the decisions of Reithmuller FM in Duncan v McVeigh &amp; Anor FMCA 759 and Spender J in Re McDonald; ex parte The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 33 ATR 1. Those decisions, of course, both recognise the importance of an undertaking to pay the costs of the trustee's administration and the need for the court to be satisfied that by reason of any asset surplus, the bankrupt is able to pay his or her debts [17] [22];
 (f) within a short period of time, the debts due to creditors had been paid by the bankrupt and some clarification of the position with regard to securing an annulment was sought [22];
 (g) during the administration, a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and Ms Townsend occurred;
 (h) at [23], [24] and [25], his Honour quotes extensive passages from the trustee's letter dated 10 February 2004 to Ms Townsend and in reliance upon, at least in part, those passages, his Honour concludes that: 'it is most disturbing that a certificate has not issued pursuant to s 153A notwithstanding that the creditors have been paid [26] ; the trustee's position is that it is impossible to issue a certificate whilst the possibility of a private prosecution or complaint remains outstanding [26] ; the actions of the trustee are unprofessional [27] '; and as an apparent explanation of that conclusion, his Honour says the proper course on the part of the trustee 'would have been to bring the matter to a prompt finalisation' [27] and that result was not reached because the approaches by the applicant 'to a serious extent were unable to be dealt with as a result of the trustee's very determined efforts to ensure that no complaint could be brought in relation to the conduct by him of the administration' [27] ; 
 (i) the trustee by reason of the letter of 10 February 2004 'quite obviously' attempted to 'force any consideration by the applicant of the proceedings now before the court, not to be brought because of the financial influence and effect of those proceedings' [28].
 (j) 'extremely excessive costs have been incurred as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion' [29]; and
 (k) At [29] and [30], these observations: 
 
 
 '[29] I am concerned as to further costs being incurred in relation to these proceedings and to what I consider to have been extremely excessive charges incurred, as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion. I am mindful of the terms of the letter of 10 February 2004 and, in particular, the indications as to costs expended and expectations in relation to future to costs. In my view, that was the appropriate time to bring this matter to an end. To suggest that the bankruptcy could never be annulled whilst there was some possibility of a disgruntled client complaining as to the administration of the estate, is bullying in the extreme and is inappropriate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 [30] I intend to fix the trustee's costs in relation to the administration of the estate at $15,000.00 taking into consideration the amounts already paid and the estimates contained within the correspondence of 10 February 2004.'

73 His Honour concluded that the respondent was then and at all times solvent and the proper course was to annul the bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B of the Act.

74 The immediate difficulty with his Honour's conclusions and findings is that they do not arise out of an exposed analysis of the evidence no doubt because his Honour was seeking to expeditiously dispose of a controversy with a long history.

75 However, there are two reasons on the evidence why the trustee had refused to reach a state of satisfaction required by s 153A of the Act. The first was that notwithstanding the payment of $10,000.00 by Ms Townsend (or those assisting her) having regard to the letters of 25 November 2003 (see [33], [34] and [35]), 27 November 2003 [36], 28 November 2003 [37] and 10 February 2004 [41], a further amount as at 10 February 2004 of $2,300.00 would be required to meet the cost of work undertaken from 13 December 2003 to that date and the additional tasks necessary to finalise the administration. The second consideration involved the question of whether further costs would be incurred by the trustee in responding to complaints and allegations and a threatened private prosecution or other proceedings.

76 As to the first reason, the trustee on 10 February 2004 said that remuneration for work done from 13 December 2003 (having regard to the fact that the report to creditors was dated 12 December 2003 and the completion of the earlier billing period was 11 December 2003) was approximately $1,300.00 (plus GST), plus $580.00 for expenses (plus GST); that is, approximately $2,068.00. The trustee suggested a further amount of $2,200.00 would fairly represent the value of that work.

77 In addition, further identified steps to complete the administration would be necessary (see paragraph 3 of the letter of 10 February 2004 [41]). The trustee said in the letter of 10 February 2004 that he held $1,100.90 (being the $10,000.00 received, less remuneration of $8,099.10 and less the 8% ITSA realisation fee of $800.00) and upon receipt of a further $2,300.00 (including GST, the Government charges on re-transmitting Ms Townsend's land and the 8% ITSA charge) the trustee 'could draw down all or the major part of the cost to complete, prepare or lodge any land transfer forms and issue an annulment certificate under s 153A of the Bankruptcy Act )' . In other words, a total amount of $3,400.90 would complete the administration, satisfy all relevant costs, charges, expenses and remuneration and result in an annulment certificate. Having regard to the $10,000.00 already paid and its application, the additional $2,300.00 would result in an annulment certificate based upon costs, charges, expenses and remuneration (including GST, Government charges and ITSA charges) of $12,300.00, in all.

78 Ms Townsend refused to pay any further contribution and on 24 February 2004 filed the application the subject of these proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Bellin v Pattison (Trustee) [1999] FCA 51</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/51.html</AustLII>
<text>90 His Honour concluded that the matters set out in the final five paragraphs of the letter of 10 February 2004 (as set out at [41]) represented an attempt to force any consideration of Ms Townsend's application to the court to be brought to an end and represented the expression of extreme and inappropriate bullying. Those conclusions cannot stand in the face of the evidence for a number of reasons. First, Ms Townsend had indicated that her disposition was not to press complaints so as to facilitate the resolution of the administration and accordingly the formulation of the costs at 10 February 2004 by the trustee of an additional $2,300.00 recognised that no costs would be incurred in the administration in connection with any matters of complaint. Had those monies been paid, a s 153A certificate would have duly issued effecting an annulment. Secondly, although the response of the trustee to the allegations of complaint might be regarded as robust, the trustee was nevertheless entitled to respond to complaints which he perceived to be misconceived and unmeritorious either because the assessment by the bankrupt of the reasonableness of proposed fees was not founded upon any proper basis or because allegations of abuses were not, in the trustee's view, correct (see Bellin v Pattison (Trustee) [1999] FCA 51 at [18] to [22]).

91 A bankrupt concerned about the conduct of a trustee might invoke an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee pursuant to s 179 and seek to bring the scope of the trustee's conduct within the supervision of the court. In undertaking such an inquiry, the court might form a view that particular conduct involved a breach of duty and make an order that the trustee be removed from office or make an order disentitling the trustee to an indemnity out of the estate assets in respect of any costs, charges and expenses incurred in breach of duty or an order disentitling the trustee to particular remuneration.

92 The proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker sought an annulment of the bankruptcy on the ground that all debts of the bankrupt had been paid and that s 153A of the Act conferred a power upon the court to annul the bankruptcy. Secondly, the respondent contended that because the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the bankruptcy ought to be annulled. No challenge was made to the conduct of the trustee in reliance upon a power in the court to 'inquire into the conduct of the trustee' for the purposes of s 179 of the Act. I accept the submission of the appellant that the relief sought and the foundation for the relief was directed to annulment of the bankruptcy arising out of the contended discharge of all debts of the bankrupt and a contention that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. The application did not proceed nor was it conducted on the footing that the court was conducting an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee. The first aspect of the application involved an order by his Honour that the costs (both expenses and remuneration) of the trustee be taxed to determine the body of fair and reasonable costs in the expectation that a resolution of that matter would, in all probability, result in a position where a certificate might issue thus annulling the bankruptcy by operation of s 153A of the Act. Within the forum of the taxation of the costs, the conduct of the trustee both in terms of the steps taken by him and his staff and the charges allocated for those steps was to be the subject of examination. The proceeding before the court was not, however, an inquiry for the purposes of s 179 of the Act and it is not now appropriate to determine the questions on appeal on the footing of s 179.

93 A third reason why the conclusions reached by his Honour concerning the position adopted by the trustee in relation to existing and future complaints by Ms Townsend cannot stand is that the trustee put the proposition that Ms Townsend might consider withdrawing threats of action or complaint expressly on the basis that if they were to be pursued, the trustee might either apply to the court for a release or, alternatively, apply to the court for directions as to how the allegations might be dealt with. In addition, the trustee recommended that if Ms Townsend thought the suggestion of the trustee that a private prosecution might not be pursued was, in the circumstances, an 'improper suggestion', Ms Townsend may choose to seek legal advice specifically on that matter. The assessment of the costs incurred by the trustee reveal that in the period from 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004 the costs of dealing with complaints lodged by Ms Townsend with bankruptcy regulators amounted to $523.42 subject to the addition of GST and an 8% realisation charge.

94 His Honour relied upon s 153B in making an order annulling the bankruptcy and setting aside the sequestration order based upon a finding that Ms Townsend was at the date of the sequestration order solvent and at all material times remained solvent. Section 154(1)(a) provides that all acts done by the trustee or any person acting under the authority of the trustee before the annulment, are taken to have been validly made or done (subject to considerations of breach of duty) and s 154(1)(b) provides that the trustee may 'apply the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee'. His Honour made a further order fixing the remuneration of the trustee and concluded that the court certainly had power to 'fix a sum in relation to the costs in respect of the administration of the estate' [8] although the source of that power was not identified. Whatever the source of the power may be, the foundation for the exercise of the power was that the trustee ought to have concluded the administration on or about 10 February 2004 and that having regard to that circumstance, the costs ought to have been $15,000.00.

95 No such foundation existed and the exercise of the power therefore failed.

96 As to the source of the power, it cannot be found in s 153B or any provision of Division 5 of Part VII of the Act. Division 4 of Part VIII of the Act addresses the topic of 'Control over trustees'. Section 178 of the Act within Division 4 contains the heading ' Appeal to court against trustee's decision ' and is in these terms:
 
 ' 178(1) [Right of appeal] If the bankrupt, a creditor or any other person is affected by an act, omission or decision of the trustee, he or she may apply to the court, and the court may make such order in the manner as it thinks just and equitable. 
 
 178(2) [Time limit] The application must be made not later than 60 days after the day on which the person became aware of the trustee's act, omission or decision.'

97 Plainly enough, the application to the court made by Ms Townsend on 24 February 2004 did not expressly raise the notion of an appeal from a decision of the trustee. Ms Townsend's application was signed on 16 February 2004 and filed on 24 February 2004 within 14 days of the letter from the trustee dated 10 February 2004 seeking a further sum of $2,300.00 in order to bring the administration of the estate to a conclusion and facilitate the issue of a certificate and, in consequence, an annulment of the bankruptcy. Although the precise character of an 'act, omission or decision of the trustee' is not clear, s 178(1) may well be sufficiently broad in its formulation to confer power upon the court to make such order as the court thinks just and equitable in relation to the request by the trustee for the provision of further monies in respect of costs (both expenses and remuneration) incurred from 13 December 2003 to 10 February 2004 and in respect of those costs to be incurred in undertaking steps necessary to complete the administration.

98 Because his Honour failed to have regard to the evidence, no proper foundation subsisted for the exercise of a power to fix costs. The discretion has miscarried but to the extent that the source of the power might need to be identified, it seems to me that s 178(1) may well confer a power to determine or fix the quantum of the costs (both expenses and remuneration) in respect of an administration. In addition, s 30(1)(b) of the Act confers a power upon the court to make such orders as the court considers 'necessary for the purposes of carrying out or giving effect to the Act in any case or matter'. The intersection, however, between the exercise of such powers directed to the subject matter of the trustee's remuneration and the proper application of s 162 of the Act which specifically addresses the mechanisms by which the trustee's remuneration is to be determined, must be carefully considered in any particular case. The trustee's remuneration might be determined by resolution of the creditors or, by a committee of inspection. Where the remuneration of the trustee is not so determined, the trustee is to be remunerated as prescribed by the regulations (s 162(4)). The making of an order to fix or otherwise determine the remuneration of the trustee in the exercise of a power which properly comprehends such subject matter, notwithstanding the preparation of an itemised Bill of Costs and the taxation of those costs, could only arise out of an exposed process of reasoning identifying a proper basis for recourse to such power. There is no such process of exposed reasoning identified.

99 Accordingly, the orders made by Federal Magistrate Coker on 22 April 2005 that 'the costs of the administration of the estate of the applicant including the transfer back to the applicant of any real property, be fixed in the sum of $15,000.00' and that 'there be no order as to costs in relation to the proceedings before this Court' must be set aside. Because the request of the trustee on 10 February 2004 for a further amount of $2,300.00 in order to complete the administration was fair and reasonable having regard to all the evidence with the result that the trustee was entitled to form the view that the debts of the bankrupt had not been fully paid by reason of the controversy concerning the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the administration, it necessarily follows that the rejection of that request and the election to commence proceedings is the true source of the additional costs.

100 Before setting out the proposed orders, it should be noted that the matters before Federal Magistrate Coker on 5 November 2004 and subsequently on 15 February 2005 involved a challenge to the refusal of the trustee to issue a certificate for the purposes of s 153A, an examination of the requests by the trustee for the provision of funds in connection with the administration of the estate and a consideration of whether the bankruptcy ought to be annulled pursuant to s 153B. Although Federal Magistrate Coker determined that the bankruptcy ought to be annulled on the ground of the solvency of the applicant, a substantial part of the proceeding involved a consideration of evidence going to the first limb of the application as to whether a certificate ought to have issued on the part of the trustee and whether the court had power to direct an annulment in circumstances where a factual contention that all debts of the bankrupt including the costs (both expenses and remuneration) had been paid by a certain date, was resolved in favour of the applicant. The applicant was successful on the second limb of the application. Accordingly, any costs arising out of or in connection with the hearing which now might be the subject of an order, ought to be limited to those matters arising out of or in connection with the first limb of the application.</text>
