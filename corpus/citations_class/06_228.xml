<text>8 The order for identity discovery is sought to identify that company. Syngenta resists the order sought. It refers to cases which hold that a material factor in deciding whether to make an order are the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the action against the person whose identity is sought to be discovered: see eg, Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1. It then points out that not only is Monsanto unable to identify a prospective defendant, it is also presently unable to articulate a cause of action against that unknown defendant. Accordingly, so the argument goes, Monsanto is simply not entitled to an order.

9 I accept as correct that in most cases an applicant for identity discovery must show some prospects of success in its proposed action. A defendant's privacy should not be invaded unless there is good cause. But there is no absolute rule that an applicant must show some prospects of success as a condition to obtaining an order. In the first place, r 3 does not contain any such requirement. Second, there may well be cases where the imposition of such a condition would lead to injustice. This case is a good example of one where it would be unjust to refuse an order because the applicant is unable to show prospects of success. The reasons are so obvious they need no further elaboration.

10 The criterion that I would apply is whether Monsanto has shown that it has a claim that is worth investigating. It may be true that two levels of investigation are required -- one to identify the prospective defendant and another to assess the merits of the claim against that prospective defendant. But this should be no bar to an order under r 3.

11 There is no need to spend much time considering whether Monsanto has a claim worth investigating. I think it clear that it has such a claim. First, there is a reasonable basis for believing that Monsanto's patent may have been infringed. Second, it seems clear enough that some company in the Syngenta group is involved. In any event, the order will not cause much inconvenience.</text>

<text>12 In the result, there will be an order for identity discovery and the application for information discovery will be stood over. It is appropriate there be a Sabre order as well: see Sabre Corporation Pty Ltd v Russ Kalvin's Hair Care Company (1993) 46 FCR 428. Monsanto should bring in short minutes of order for me to consider. If there is a dispute about the breadth of what they will seek (as I suspect there might be) I will relist the matter.
