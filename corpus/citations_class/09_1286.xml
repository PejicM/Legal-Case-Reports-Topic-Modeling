<text>The unparticularised bias claim was not put to the Magistrate. There is no substance in the complaint. There is nothing external to the Tribunal's reasons bearing on the claim. There is nothing in the reasons suggestive of bias. The Tribunal accepted parts of the applicant's claims, but rejected others, and gave its reasons for so doing. A bias case is not made out because parts of an applicant's claims are not accepted or are disbelieved. That does not show prejudgment or a closed mind. See SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] and Sun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 361 ; (2002) 194 ALR 749 at [43] - [48] .</text>
