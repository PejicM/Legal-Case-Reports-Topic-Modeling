<tocase>Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115</tocase>
<text>This proceeding was heard concurrently with proceeding VID 337 of 2008; see Piotto v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 1115. Each proceeding arises out of "Newstart participation failures" imposed on Mr Piotto by the respondent and subsequent decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") to affirm those decisions.

The applicant, Mr Piotto, is a long term recipient of a Newstart allowance. In 2008, Mr Piotto received job search and other assistance from MatchWorks, on behalf of Centrelink. Centrelink administers the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ("the Act") on behalf of the respondent and other Commonwealth Government departments.

Centrelink imposed a Newstart participation failure on Mr Piotto in 2008. The Newstart participation failure arose from Mr Piotto's failure to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement on 30 September 2008 ("the Participation Failure"). As a result of the Participation Failure, Mr Piotto's Newstart allowance was cancelled with effect from 26 September 2008.

These reasons should be read in conjunction with the reasons in Piotto and especially in respect of the relevant legislative background which is set out in Piotto at [10] [15].

Mr Piotto seeks an order from this Court overturning the Participation Failure and reinstating his Newstart allowance. Mr Piotto also seeks other orders which are not necessary to traverse.

On 26 May 2009, Mr Piotto filed a notice of motion seeking an order that "The respondent resume Newstart appeal payments for the applicant, from the date they were terminated 26 September 2008 and order that no reporting is required".

In submissions before the Tribunal, the respondent argues that a valid delegation existed by virtue of an instrument executed by the respondent on 27 June 2008, Instrument DEEWR SSL 3 of 2008. That instrument, with effect from 27 June 2008, delegates the respondent's power: 
 
 to each person engaged by an Employment Services Provider to perform functions or to perform services under a relevant arrangement, each of my powers under or referred to in a provision of the Social Security Act 1991 or the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 contained in Schedule 1 of this instrument, subject to the limitations in Schedule 1. 
 

The powers listed in Sch 1 to the delegation include the powers conferred on the respondent by ss 605 and 606 of the Act. Employment Services Providers include an "organisation that performs functions or provides services for the purposes of the social security law" pursuant to the Employment Services Contract 2006 2009 ; see cl 3(b). The instrument of delegation is in the same terms as that discussed in Piotto at [23] [24].

The respondent in its submissions to the Tribunal identified MatchWorks as falling within cl 3(b) of the instrument of delegation, namely that MatchWorks was an organisation which provides services to the respondent pursuant to the Employment Services Contract 2006 2009 .

The ability of Mr Piotto to engage in negotiation of a Newstart Activity Agreement is discussed in Piotto at [32] [33]. Additionally, as noted in Piotto at [37] [39], a failure to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement is not a reasonable excuse for refusing to enter into an agreement for the purposes of s 624(2) (2B) of the Act.

Additionally, Mr Piotto has not demonstrated he had a reasonable excuse for refusing to enter into the Newstart Activity Agreement. As noted in Piotto at [38], the matters which will constitute a reasonable excuse for the purposes of s 624 of the Act are serious matters which have a significant impact on that person's ability to comply with the requirement to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement; see also cl 4(2) of the Social Security (Reasonable Excuse) (DEWR) Determination 2006 (Cth). I do not consider that Mr Piotto's disagreement over which terms were suitable for inclusion in the Newstart Activity Agreement constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purposes of the Act. In this respect, the Tribunal's decision to uphold the Participation Failure imposed on Mr Piotto was correct.

The fourth ground of appeal fails.

The notice of motion filed on 26 May 2009 was not agitated by Mr Piotto at the hearing of this proceeding. The relief sought by Mr Piotto in that notice of motion is not relief which it is within this Court's powers to grant. In any event, in light of the issues discussed above, I see no basis for dealing with Mr Piotto's notice of motion further.</text>

<tocase>Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1752.html</AustLII>
<text>In Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (No 2) [2008] FCA 1752 at [41] , Bennett J observed that there is no requirement for the employees of Employment Service Providers to identify the basis of their delegated power before signing a Newstart Activity Agreement with a job seeker. Justice Bennett considered the crucial issue to be whether a valid delegation had been made.

At [19], Bennett J found that the respondent in Lim had proven that:

In contrast to the circumstances described in Lim , the respondent did not produce evidence before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks provided services to the respondent pursuant to an arrangement described in cl 3 of the delegation, or that the relevant employees of MatchWorks were employed to perform functions and provide services pursuant to that arrangement. In particular, no document was before the Tribunal to show that MatchWorks was an Employment Service Provider within the meaning of cl 3(b) of the delegation. The mere assertion in submissions that such was the case is not tantamount to evidence before the Tribunal.

Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there was any material on which the Tribunal could conclude that a valid delegation from the respondent to MatchWorks was in place at the time of the Participation Failure. The application must be remitted to the Tribunal. Although it is not strictly necessary to do so the Court will deal now with the other issues raised in argument. No negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement

Mr Piotto also alleges that the Tribunal erred in not finding that there was no negotiation of the Newstart Activity Agreement for the purposes of s 605(3) of the Act.</text>

<text>In any event, as French J observed in Despot v Department of Family and Community Services [2004] FCA 140 at [40] in relation to the alleged denial of a right to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement, "This is not a ground which raises any question of law upon which a review of the AAT decision could be based".

<tocase>Re Hewitson and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2002) 71 ALD 231</tocase>
<text>Mr Piotto also contends that the Tribunal erred in finding that the respondent was able to require him to sign the Newstart Activity Agreement. To support this proposition, Mr Piotto relies on Re Hewitson and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (2002) 71 ALD 231.

Hewitson is a decision of the Tribunal and is not binding on this Court. The Tribunal, in Hewitson , found that the relevant question under s 607(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, as it then was, was whether the Newstart recipient has "agree[d] to terms of the agreement proposed by the Secretary". The section of the Act in place at the time of Hewitson dealt with a failure to negotiate an agreement and delaying unreasonably entering into an agreement. The Tribunal found that as Mr Hewitson had evinced an intention to be bound by the terms of the agreement, his signature was not required.

At the time of Mr Piotto's Participation Failure, s 607(1)(b)(ii) of the Act considered by the Tribunal in Hewitson was no longer in force. Rather the Act at the time of the Participation Failure, provided that a Newstart allowance recipient commits a participation failure if the person "fails to comply with a requirement to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement"; see s 624(1)(d) of the Act. Its language differs markedly from that employed in the previous s 607(1). Indeed, a Newstart Activity Agreement must be a written agreement between the Newstart recipient and the respondent; see s 605(4) of the Act. It follows from this requirement that there must be some written indication of Mr Piotto's consent to its terms. There is no material to suggest that Mr Piotto complied with the requirement in s 624(1)(d) of the Act to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement.

The third ground of Mr Piotto's application fails. The Newstart Activity Agreement was "inherently faulty"

Mr Piotto also alleges that the Newstart Activity Agreement offered by MatchWorks was unreasonable and "inherently faulty" as it did not comply with s 606 of the Act. In doing so, Mr Piotto points to what he says is the intention of MatchWorks to unilaterally change the terms of the Newstart Activity Agreement, the requirement to complete ten job searches each fortnight and the requirement that Mr Piotto perform "work for the dole".</text>
