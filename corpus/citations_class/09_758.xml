<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250</tocase>
<text>The Court has an important responsibility of safeguarding the interest of group members as a whole under s 33V(1). There is a danger that when a settlement is reached or a discontinuance is agreed, the interests of the actual parties to the proceedings may receive their paramount consideration while the impact on group members may not be fully or properly addressed. That is why in exercising the power under s 33V(1) to approve a settlement or discontinuance the Court must scrutinise with great care the way in which any order is formulated. In the decided cases the Courts have approached settlements with a keen eye to ensuring that the interests of group members are vouched safe: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258B-C per Branson J; McMullin v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1 at 3C-E per Wilcox J; Courtney 122 FCR at 181 [45] per Sackville J and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 at [64] - [68] per Jacobson J.</text>

<text>Where a party does not wish to continue proceedings but to reserve the right to bring them at a later stage, a discontinuance is an appropriate means of doing so. Under O 22 r 2(1)(a), (b), (c) and r 3 of the Federal Court Rules a party will be liable for the other parties' costs (unless they otherwise agree) by discontinuing as of right before the first directions hearing, or (if the matter proceeded by pleadings) before the pleadings have closed, or by consent of all the parties, if judgment has not been entered. However, under O 22 r 2(1)(d) a party may discontinue at any time with the leave of the Court. There is no usual order provided in the scheme of O 22 in respect of costs where a party discontinues with leave under O 22 r 2(1)(d). The applicants have sought leave under O 22 r 2(1)(d). The terms of O 22 r 2 should not be narrowly construed: Re Tieken: Reg v Tieken [1995] FCA 896 per Burchett, Tamberlin and Kiefel JJ; Cameron v Goldtek Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 72 FCR 274 at 279C per Moore J.</text>

<tocase>Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1960.html</AustLII>
<text>As I observed in Clark v ING Life Ltd [2007] FCA 1960 at [16] it is not the function of the Court to make a prediction as to the outcome of a hypothetical case. Both parties urged on 30 April 2009 that the proceedings cease. At that time, the proceedings were treated by the parties as being under Pt IVA. I was not prepared to grant leave to discontinue on the scant evidence as it then stood or to exercise any power under s 33V(1). After the applicants indicated that they wished to discontinue, it was reasonable for both them and the State to have conducted themselves as they did. I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton acted unreasonably in bringing these proceedings in his own right. Mrs Wotton's position received no separate attention in any party's submissions. I am not in a position to conclude that she acted unreasonably.

It is appropriate to treat Mrs Wotton's position cognately with that of her husband. This is because of her relationship to Mr Wotton, his circumstances as revealed in the evidence and the absence of any suggestion by the respondents that Mrs Wotton in her own right acted unreasonably.

I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton had no reasonable prospect of obtaining an extension of time in respect of his own claims, given his involvement in the criminal proceedings, his subsequent conviction and incarceration. However, that issue has not yet been determined. The proceedings were more complicated than necessary. Because of the overlap of the foreshadowed representative proceedings and the misconceived joinder of the other respondents Mr and Mrs Wotton should bear some costs of those complications but not the costs of the whole proceedings.</text>

<text>An application for leave or special leave to appeal is not an appeal. Rather, it is a proceeding in which an applicant for such leave or special leave is "... no more than an applicant desiring to obtain the Court's leave to commence proceedings in the Court": United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165 at 179 [30] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Gummow JJ, applying Collins v The Queen [1975] HCA 60 ; (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122-123 per Barwick CJ, Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ. In DJL v The Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 248 [47] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: 
 "An application for special leave "is not in the ordinary course of litigation" and, until the grant of special leave, "there are no proceedings inter partes before the Court ( Collins v The Queen [1975] HCA 60 ; (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122). Further, the disposition of a special leave application is not the determination of an appeal ( Attorney-General (Cth) v Finch [No 2] [1984] HCA 40 ; (1984) 155 CLR 107 at 115) . The result is that the refusal of an application for special leave does not produce a final judgment of this Court which forecloses the re-opening of the matter in an appropriate and, necessarily, very special case where the interests of justice so require."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1958/6.html</AustLII>
<text>It follows from what I have held, that s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act does not apply to the application to discontinue. In the event that this conclusion is incorrect, both parties accepted that it was possible to grant leave for the proceedings to be discontinued and an appropriate order made protecting the rights of persons who were intended to be group members from the consequences of allowing that discontinuance. The sources of power to make those orders would be either ss 22 and 23 or (if I were wrong about the proceedings not being made under Pt IVA) ss 33V(2) , 33Z (1)(g) and s 33ZF of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Each of those sections is sufficient to enable the Court to make a declaration protecting the rights of third parties, being those whom the applicants sought to claim were group members. None of those third parties has been heard or joined. They have had no opportunity to protect their interests. Ordinarily (leaving aside cases or statutes excluding the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness) no-one should have his or her rights affected or destroyed without an opportunity of being heard. This principle was illustrated in the great case of Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180 [143 ER 414] and remains applicable today: Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1978) 143 CLR 1 ; Commissioner of Police v Tanos [1958] HCA 6 ; (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395 per Dixon CJ and Webb J.</text>

<tocase>Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 957 ; (2002) 122 FCR 168</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/957.html</AustLII>
<text>A group member is not a party to representative proceedings brought by another person: cf Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria [2002] HCA 27 ; (2002) 211 CLR 1 at 34 [50] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see too at 21-22 [6] per Gleeson CJ (a case dealing with a similar legislative scheme under Pt 4A of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic)); Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 957 ; (2002) 122 FCR 168 at 179 [35] - [36] per Sackville J. But, s 33H(1)(b) and (c) required that one or more of the application or forms 129 or 167 specified the nature of the claims made by the group members and the questions of law or fact common to them. There was no claim made (as referred to in s 33C(1)(c)) by the group members in any of those documents for an allowance of further time to file an application under s 46PO(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act . Nor did any of those documents specify any question of law or fact common to the group members (referred to in s 33H(1)(c)) the subject of the application to allow further time to make the foreshadowed application under s 46PO(1).

The Court has an important responsibility of safeguarding the interest of group members as a whole under s 33V(1). There is a danger that when a settlement is reached or a discontinuance is agreed, the interests of the actual parties to the proceedings may receive their paramount consideration while the impact on group members may not be fully or properly addressed. That is why in exercising the power under s 33V(1) to approve a settlement or discontinuance the Court must scrutinise with great care the way in which any order is formulated. In the decided cases the Courts have approached settlements with a keen eye to ensuring that the interests of group members are vouched safe: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 250 at 258B-C per Branson J; McMullin v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd (1998) 84 FCR 1 at 3C-E per Wilcox J; Courtney 122 FCR at 181 [45] per Sackville J and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 at [64] - [68] per Jacobson J.

And, the power in s 33ZF(1) enables the Court to make any order that it thinks appropriate or necessary to ensure that justice is done in a proceeding under Pt IVA. Wilcox J described the extent of the power in s 33ZF(1) as being "the widest possible" in McMullin 84 FCR at 4C-D. In Courtney 122 FCR at 182-184 [47]-[54] esp at [52] Sackville J examined the scope of the power, and cautioned that s 33ZF(1) should not become a vehicle for rewriting the rest of Pt IVA. This provision, like all provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court, should not be construed narrowly by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in its express words: Owners of the Ship 'Shin Kobe Maru' v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ.</text>

<tocase>Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/27.html</AustLII>
<text>The fact that the Court might refuse an initial application to allow further time under s 46PO(2) would not preclude a further application, although it would be difficult to imagine that, in the ordinary course, any such further application would have any prospects of being granted unless some significant new matter had come to light since the earlier refusal. There is, of course, a distinction between an application for leave or special leave to appeal to a court and one to extend the time within which proceedings under s 46PO(2) might be brought. In the former case the parties' rights have been determined already by the judgment or order which is to be the subject of an appeal if leave or special leave were granted: cp Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516 at 519-520 [3] - [4] per Brennan CJ and McHugh JJ. An order under s 46PO(2) allowing an extension of time in which to make an application under s 46PO(1) , if granted, entitles the affected person to have his or her allegation of unlawful discrimination heard and determined by the Court. If an extension of time is not allowed, then a respondent to the complaint before the Commission cannot be sued under s 46PO in respect of the alleged unlawful discrimination.

Hence, unless and until, the Court allows further time under s 46PO(2) to make an application more than 28 days after the issue of a notice of termination, proceedings of the kind brought by the applicants here are in the nature of a mere application to the Court for permission to commence proceedings. That permission is given if the Court allows further time under s 46PO(2) to file a substantive application alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more respondents. If the Court does not allow further time under s 46PO(2) , there is no application made invoking the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the allegation of unlawful discrimination within the meaning of s 46PO(1) notwithstanding the form of the initiating process or application filed.

Thus, I am of opinion that the applicants have not made an application under s 46PO(1) at this time. Rather, they have made an application under s 46PO(2) seeking further time in which to bring proceedings under s 46PO(1). The jurisdiction that the application filed on 11 March 2009 invoked was confined to the issue in the last clause of s 46PO(2). That jurisdiction required the Court to hear and determine only whether the applicants should be allowed further time (beyond 28 days after 12 September 2007) in which to make an application alleging unlawful discrimination by one or more of the respondents to the terminated complaint.</text>

In addition, the State contended that the proceedings had been couched as representative proceedings for an ulterior purpose. It complained that the applicants' solicitors had claimed that they were acting on behalf of the group members in correspondence in order to achieve a settlement, after having stated that they wished to discontinue.

<text>It follows from what I have held, that s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act does not apply to the application to discontinue. In the event that this conclusion is incorrect, both parties accepted that it was possible to grant leave for the proceedings to be discontinued and an appropriate order made protecting the rights of persons who were intended to be group members from the consequences of allowing that discontinuance. The sources of power to make those orders would be either ss 22 and 23 or (if I were wrong about the proceedings not being made under Pt IVA) ss 33V(2) , 33Z (1)(g) and s 33ZF of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Each of those sections is sufficient to enable the Court to make a declaration protecting the rights of third parties, being those whom the applicants sought to claim were group members. None of those third parties has been heard or joined. They have had no opportunity to protect their interests. Ordinarily (leaving aside cases or statutes excluding the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness) no-one should have his or her rights affected or destroyed without an opportunity of being heard. This principle was illustrated in the great case of Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180 [143 ER 414] and remains applicable today: Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1978) 143 CLR 1 ; Commissioner of Police v Tanos [1958] HCA 6 ; (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395 per Dixon CJ and Webb J.</text>

The result is that the refusal of an application for special leave does not produce a final judgment of this Court which forecloses the re-opening of the matter in an appropriate and, necessarily, very special case where the interests of justice so require."</text>

<tocase>Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/34.html</AustLII>
<text>In my opinion this argument should be rejected. The onus of establishing an abuse of process is a heavy one: Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 529 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ. Most proceedings are brought to obtain a vindication of rights either by a judgment of the Court or a negotiated settlement. I am not satisfied that there has been an abuse of the process of the Court by the applicants in bringing proceedings to seek to achieve such an outcome in the present case. There was no improper purpose of the applicants identified in their submissions, nor any abuse of the process of the Court. If the applicants did have an underlying basis for their claim of unlawful discrimination, they would be entitled to compensation either from a judgment or a settlement. And, merely because the applicants' solicitors recently concluded that the conduct of a representative proceeding would be difficult without the support of the Council, this did not entail that a settlement necessarily could not benefit group numbers.

Next, the State argued that the proceedings had been brought in the New South Wales Registry of the Court when Moore J, in the earlier proceedings brought by Mr Wotton, had ordered the transfer of those proceedings to the Queensland Registry. The State argued that these proceedings should be seen as a continuation of the previous interlocutory application and that Mr and Mrs Wotton had flouted Moore J's direction to transfer the proceedings to the Queensland Registry. I reject this argument. These proceedings are new proceedings. The proceedings before Moore J concerned an early stage in the complaint process prior to the Commission having dealt with the complaint. These proceedings arise out of rights said to flow from the rejection of the complaint.

In addition, the solicitors for the applicants and their counsel, who are in Sydney, are acting pro bono. I infer that it would be more difficult for them at this stage to conduct the proceedings in Brisbane or elsewhere in Queensland, even though they have travelled to Palm Island to assist the applicants in this and other matters. At the moment I am not satisfied that there was any abuse in commencing the proceedings here, although I have considerable sympathy with the proposition, implicit in the State's submissions, that a venue for trial of the proposed representative proceedings in Queensland would be likely to be more convenient and satisfactory than here. I am not satisfied that the State has established any improper purpose for the institution of these proceedings. On the evidence, the applicants appear to have had a proper purpose to vindicate the rights claimed. I reject the application for indemnity costs.</text>

<tocase>Wong v Silkfield Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 48 ; (1999) 199 CLR 255</tocase>

<text>There is a further reason why the application under s 46PO(2) for an extension of time would not amount to representative proceedings. That is because s 33C(1)(c) requires that the claims of all of the group members give rise to a substantial common issue of fact or law. "Substantial" in s 33C(1)(c) means "real or of substance": Wong v Silkfield Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 48 ; (1999) 199 CLR 255 at 267 [28] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ. There is no evidence that the personal circumstances of Mr and Mrs Wotton, or the reasons why they did not make their application (even as a representative proceeding) within 28 days of 12 September 2007 or now seek an allowance of further time to do so, involve any, let alone, substantial, common issue of fact or law that applies to all other group members. The only issues in this matter under s 33C(1)(c) would be factual ones going to why the further time was required. I am not satisfied any substantial common question of fact or law exists so as to satisfy s 33C(1)(c) that the present application to allow further time could be a proceeding under Pt IVA. It has not been argued or suggested that further time could have been allowed because of the late discovery of a factual or legal ground.</text>

<tocase>Wotton v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 280</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/280.html</AustLII>
<text>On 1 March 2007, shortly before his trial was to commence Mr Wotton lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (as the Australian Human Rights Commission was then called). The complaint alleged, among other matters, that the arrest, charging and prosecution of Mr Wotton contravened or would contravene the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). Mr Wotton sought an ex parte injunction under s 46PP of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act to restrain the holding of his criminal trial: Wotton v State of Queensland [2007] FCA 280. Those proceedings purported to be instituted as representative proceedings under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act . In refusing the ex parte relief, Moore J noted that there had been considerable delay in the lodging of the complaint with the Commission: Wotton [2007] FCA 280 at [3] - [5] . His Honour said that he would express no view about whether those proceedings could have been brought as representative proceedings. Subsequently, at his trial Mr Wotton was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

The complaint had been lodged with the Commission on 1 March 2007 by Mr Wotton's solicitors, Messrs Levitt Robinson. It purported to have been made on behalf of Mr Wotton, his co-accused and "all the black residents of Palm Island who were residents of the place on and between 18 and 28 November 2004". The solicitors later supplemented the complaint with further submissions. The Commission accepted the complaint as being a representative complaint made on behalf of class members other than the unnamed co-accused. The complaint was made against the State of Queensland, including the Queensland Police Service, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Queensland Court of Appeal. It is not necessary to outline any matter in relation to the Queensland Court of Appeal since nothing was raised in the present proceedings in respect of that court. Some allegations made by Mr Wotton to the Commission were, subsequently, withdrawn by him.

On 12 September 2007, the then President, the Hon John von Doussa QC, signed a notice of termination pursuant to s 46PH(2) of the Act on the grounds that he was satisfied that some aspects of the complaint were lacking in substance and or misconceived, in relation to one aspect of the complaint, some other more appropriate remedy was reasonably available to each of the complainants and the subject matter of one aspect of the complaint had been dealt with adequately by another statutory authority. He terminated the complaints against the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Queensland Court of Appeal on the basis that he was satisfied that those complaints were respectively lacking in substance and misconceived.</text>
