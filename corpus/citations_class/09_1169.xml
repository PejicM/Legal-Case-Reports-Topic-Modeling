<text>Following a hearing at which ICM and Mr Young were represented by counsel, I ordered on 19 February 2009 that the appeal be allowed, the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court be set aside, and in lieu thereof it be ordered that the application to that Court be dismissed.

<tocase>International Alpaca Management Pty Ltd v Ensor [1999] FCA 72</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/72.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 5(2) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a person is solvent if, and only if, the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable. Section 124(3)(a) speaks of a person's being unable to pay that person's debts as they become due from that person's own money. In International Alpaca Management Pty Ltd v Ensor [1999] FCA 72 ( Alpaca ), Katz J referred to these provisions and to the well known discussions of the concept of solvency in Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514 at 1527-8 and 1542-3 ( Hall ); and Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 670-671 ( Sandell ). From the former, his Honour seemed to draw a conclusion that one should consider whether the debtor would be able to pay debts as they fell due in the reasonably near future, not simply those that were immediately payable; from the latter, that where the provision refers to debts being able to be paid from the person's own money, that money may extend to cash realised from sale, mortgage or pledge of the person's assets within a relatively short time, subject to considerations relating to household necessities (see [72] below). Ultimately, however, the approach taken by Katz J to the interpretation of s 52(2)(a) depended on the construction of the provision which the debtor accepted before his Honour.

In Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 ; (2006) 155 FCR 531 , in a passage with which Sundberg and French JJ did not disagree, Cowdroy J noted at [104] a number of cases, including Alpaca, in which the passages from Sandell and Hall referred to above had been treated as applicable to s 52(2)(a). The decision of a Full Court of this Court in Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 (see [29]-[30] of that decision) is one such case.

<tocase>Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/608.html</AustLII>
<text>There is some authority relating to the construction of the generally similar provision in s 95A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). That section defines solvency as requiring that "the person is able to pay all the person's debts, as and when they become due and payable." Like s 52(2)(a) of the Act, the provision does not include the words "from his or her own money". In Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385 , Palmer J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales concluded that the omission of those words from s 95A "leaves the Court free to determine insolvency, whether retrospective or prospective, as a question of commercial reality having regard to the particular facts of the case" (at [111]). The New South Wales Court of Appeal affirmed his Honour's decision ( Lewis (as liq of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq)) v Doran [2005] NSWCA 243 ; (2005) 219 ALR 555) and did not express disagreement with his exposition of the relevant legal principles. Giles JA, with whom Hodgson and McColl JJA agreed, suggested at [109] that "there is no compelling reason to exclude from consideration funds which can be gained from borrowings secured on assets of third parties, or even unsecured borrowings" provided that the company is capable of repaying this loan as and when it falls due. Giles JA noted (at [110]) that even before the introduction of this wording of s 95A, in a number of decisions courts had been prepared to pay regard to the ability to obtain unsecured borrowings.</text>

<tocase>Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148</tocase>
<text>First, the Seed, which is part of the Assigned Property under the Supplementary Deed of Assignment, would have no longer existed as at 12 June 2009 (it existed in 2003). Second, if it still existed somewhere as at 12 June 2009, there is no evidence that it was then the property of AAC. Third, the two "Limited Causes of Action" were not in aid of or incidental or ancillary to the assignment of the Seed: the alleged causes of action arose some six years before the purported assignment of the Seed on 12 June 2009; cf Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 at 151-152 ( Monk ); Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 703 ( Trendtex ). Contrast First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 , in which the causes of action in question were assigned in order to ensure that the assignee enjoyed the property, which was assigned at the same time. This decision was reversed in part by the Court of Appeal, but on grounds not presently relevant see First City Corporation Limited v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265 (and see also the decision of the Privy Council in Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295 ; [1993] 1 NZLR 513).

The question to be asked is: what genuine commercial interest did Mr Young have at the time of any assignment being considered that would be served by that assignment? It is not as if the assignment was necessary in order that the claimed cause of action against ICM be enforced and Mr Young's interest as shareholder be safeguarded. As sole shareholder, director and controlling mind of AAC, Mr Young was in a position to ensure that AAC itself pursued ICM. Apparently Mr Young thought that it would serve his interests as shareholder for AAC to do so. The answer to the question posed is: "none his interest was to become a creditor of ICM and so avoid bankruptcy". This is a personal benefit, not a genuine commercial interest of the assignee of the kind to which Trendtex refers; cf Monk at 152-153.</text>

<tocase>Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 ; (2006) 230 ALR 236 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/470.html</AustLII>
<text>Counsel for ICM referred me to Totev v Sfar [2006] FCA 470 ; (2006) 230 ALR 236 at [37] - [44] ( Totev ) where Allsop J, when a judge of this Court, discussed, inter alia, the matters that a debtor must prove in order to establish "other sufficient cause" within s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act . An appeal relating to that decision, Totev v Sfar [2008] FCAFC 35 ; (2008) 167 FCR 193 , is not of present relevance. Importantly, counsel submitted that I could not be satisfied that the claim made by Mr Young in the 2007 DC Proceeding was likely to be determined at any time in the near future. The fact was that Mr Young wished to file a significantly amended pleading in the 2007 DC Proceeding and counsel for ICM said that this would prompt a request for particulars. His submission was that allowing for amendment of the pleadings, the supply of particulars, a revised discovery in the light of amended pleadings, and preparation for trial, the 2007 DC Proceeding, assuming against ICM that it would succeed, could not be regarded as being likely to yield funds for the payment of Mr Young's creditors in anything like the near future so to overcome his present insolvency.

Time did not permit the hearing to be concluded on 8 July 2009 and the proceeding was stood over to 2.00 pm on Wednesday 15 July 2009.

There was a dramatic change at the resumed hearing on 15 July 2009. Mr J T Svehla of counsel had come to represent Mr Young (without any instructing solicitor). He applied for an adjournment. Mr Svehla said that he had come into the matter only recently and that he wished to achieve the following steps in the interests of Mr Young, both in the Federal Court and elsewhere:

In order to establish "other sufficient cause" (or, of course, ability to pay debts) Mr Young must establish that his claim against ICM is likely to succeed, not merely that he has an arguable claim: see the numerous cases listed in McQuade and Gronow, McDonald Henry and Meek's Australian Bankruptcy Law and Practice (6 th ed, Thomson Lawbook Co, as at 7 October 2009) at [52.2.22], esp Totev at [37]-[44] .

The test is more stringent and demanding than that which applies under s 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act , which relates to the extension of time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where a debtor has applied for an order setting aside that notice on the ground that the debtor has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand of the kind referred to in s 40(1)(g) of that Act. As Allsop J observed in Totev at [45], the context is different under s 52(2)(b). The authorities referred to by his Honour show that the debtor's claim against the petitioning creditor must be one which is "likely to succeed".

For the reasons below and in the Earlier Reasons for Judgment, I am not satisfied that Mr Young's claim is likely to succeed.

The terms of the assignment of 11 December 2007 were previously noted. In my Earlier Reasons for Judgment I held that assignment invalid for the reasons there set out. I will not summarise those reasons beyond saying that I held the purported assignment to be of a bare cause of action which the parties accepted could be sustained only if Mr Young had a "genuine commercial interest" in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit (at [122]). AAC and Mr Young have recently entered into the three deeds of assignment referred to below apparently in an attempt to overcome the problem referred to. Mr Young now seeks to support the assignment of the causes of action as being ancillary to and supportive of an assignment of property as well as on the "genuine commercial interest" ground. The three deeds were executed after the First Sequestration Proceeding was commenced by ICM on 20 March 2009 and after this present sequestration proceeding was commenced by ICM on 5 June 2009.</text>

<text>First, the Seed, which is part of the Assigned Property under the Supplementary Deed of Assignment, would have no longer existed as at 12 June 2009 (it existed in 2003). Second, if it still existed somewhere as at 12 June 2009, there is no evidence that it was then the property of AAC. Third, the two "Limited Causes of Action" were not in aid of or incidental or ancillary to the assignment of the Seed: the alleged causes of action arose some six years before the purported assignment of the Seed on 12 June 2009; cf Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 at 151-152 ( Monk ); Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 703 ( Trendtex ). Contrast First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 , in which the causes of action in question were assigned in order to ensure that the assignee enjoyed the property, which was assigned at the same time. This decision was reversed in part by the Court of Appeal, but on grounds not presently relevant see First City Corporation Limited v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265 (and see also the decision of the Privy Council in Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295 ; [1993] 1 NZLR 513).

Assuming in favour of Mr Young that the assignments could be saved by Mr Young's having had a genuine commercial interest in taking them (see Trendtex ), they would not be saved. Mr Young became the sole shareholder of AAC on 12 June 2009. He did not have a genuine commercial interest as at 11 December 2007 (see the Earlier Reasons for Judgment at [122]-[123]) and the mere fact without more that he was a one hundred percent shareholder in AAC at the time of the subsequent purported assignments on 12 June, 3 July and 15 July 2009 does not support those purported assignments.

The question to be asked is: what genuine commercial interest did Mr Young have at the time of any assignment being considered that would be served by that assignment? It is not as if the assignment was necessary in order that the claimed cause of action against ICM be enforced and Mr Young's interest as shareholder be safeguarded. As sole shareholder, director and controlling mind of AAC, Mr Young was in a position to ensure that AAC itself pursued ICM.

The answer to the question posed is: "none his interest was to become a creditor of ICM and so avoid bankruptcy".

<tocase>Young v ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1065</tocase>
<text>On 25 July 2008, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the Bankruptcy Notice be set aside and that ICM pay Mr Young's costs: Young v ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd [2008] FMCA 1038.

Following a hearing at which ICM and Mr Young were represented by counsel, I ordered on 19 February 2009 that the appeal be allowed, the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court be set aside, and in lieu thereof it be ordered that the application to that Court be dismissed. I also ordered that Mr Young pay ICM's costs of the FMC Bankruptcy Notice proceeding and that he pay ICM's costs of the FC Bankruptcy Notice Appeal: ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd v Young [2009] FCA 109 (Earlier Reasons for Judgment). I will take my Earlier Reasons for Judgment as read.

First, on 17 August 2009, Mr Young and AAC launched proceeding NSD 874/2009 in this Court against ICM. The proceeding was commenced by application supported by a statement of claim. In broad terms, the claims made are in line with those made in the 2007 DC Proceeding. Although the form of application is lengthy, I find it convenient to set out the relief claimed in paras 2 14 of the application (in para 1 the Court's leave was sought for AAC to commence and carry on the proceeding otherwise than by a solicitor: see Young v ICM Agriculture Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1065): A declaration that in or about the period from 26 May 1997 until about 30 July 2009: (a) the Department of Primary Industries (formerly known as the New South Wales Department of Agriculture) for and on behalf of the State of New South Wales (" NSW DPI ") and the Grains Research and Development Corporation (" GRDC "); (b) alternatively, the NSW DPI on behalf of itself and the GRDC, 
 
 was or were the grantee (as defined in section 3(1) of the PBR Act), including on a provisional basis, of the PBR (as defined in section 3(1) of the PBR Act): 
 
 
 (c) with respect to the chickpea (cicer arientinum) variety " Bumper " (the " Product ");
 (d) which Product was the subject matter of an application number 1997/097 pursuant to section 24(1) of the PBR Act to the Secretary (as defined in section 3(1) of the PBR Act) for the grant of PBR in the variety " Bumper" (the " PBR Application ");
 (e) which PBR Application was accepted by the Secretary, pursuant to section 39(1) of the PBR Act, on 26 May 1997 (the " PBR Acceptance "); and
 (f) in respect of which PBR was granted by the Secretary on 19 June 2000.
 
 A declaration that the respondent ( "ICM ") by: (a) refusing to deliver to the second applicant (" AAC ") or as it directed a crop of Bumper chickpeas comprising some 957 metric tonnes or thereabouts (the " Bumper Chickpea Crop ") from at least 11 July 2003 and thereafter; (b) offering for sale the Bumper Chickpea Crop to Agrinational Pty Ltd (" Agrinational ")' (c) selling or purporting to sell the Bumper Chickpea Crop to Agrinational in mid August 2003 and thereafter; (d) receiving at least $458,178.49 exclusive of GST (the " Sale Amoun t") for the Bumper Chickpea Crop; (e) not accounting to and providing to AAC the Sale Amount, 
 
 ("t he ICM Conduct "),
 without or otherwise than in accordance with, authorisation from the grantee of the PBR with respect to the Product (the " Rights "), committed an infringement of the Rights pursuant to section 53(1) of the PBR Act. 
 

 A declaration that NSW DPI and GRDC, alternatively, NSW DPI on its own behalf and on behalf of GRDC, have or has validly and effectively assigned to AAC the Rights, including to commence and continue an action for infringement under section 53(1) of the PBR Act.
 A declaration that AAC has validly and effectively assigned to the first applicant (" Young ") the Rights, including to commence and continue an action for infringement under section 53(1) of the PBR Act.
 A declaration that in the events which have happened Young, alternatively, AAC, is the holder of the Rights pursuant to section 53(3) of the PBR Act.
 An order pursuant to section 56(3) of the PBR Act that ICM pay damages or give an account of profits to Young, alternatively AAC, arising from ICM's infringement of the Rights.
 A declaration that by engaging in all or part of the ICM Conduct, ICM: (a) converted to its own use and benefit the Bumper Chickpea Crop; (b) is required to pay damages in the Sale Amount, alternatively, some other amount to be determined.
 A declaration that by engaging in all or part of the ICM Conduct, ICM: 
 
 
 (a) breached the terms of the one page agreement titled "GROWERS LICENCE TO RECEIVE PLANTING SEED SCHEDULE TO THE CONTRACT FOR COMMERCIALLY GROWING BUMPER CHICKPEA" dated 21 June 2002 to which AAC and ICM were parties (the "Growers Licence" );
 (b) is required to pay damages in the Sale Amount, alternatively some other amount to be determined;
 (c) is required to indemnify under the indemnity contained in clause 5 of the Growers Licence (" ICM Indemnity ") in the Sale Amount, alternatively some other amount to be determined. 
 
 
 
 A declaration that by engaging in all or part of the ICM Conduct, ICM had and received the Sale Amount to AAC's own use and benefit and that ICM is required to account for or pay by way of restitution the Sale Amount, alternatively some other amount to be determined.
 A declaration that in the events which have happened, by one or more instruments between AAC and Young and dated: (a) 11 December 2007 and titled " Deed of Assignment of Cause of Action" ; (b) 12 June 2009 and titled " Supplementary Deed of Assignment"; (c) 3 July 2009 and titled " Further Supplementary Deed of Assignment"; (d) 15 July 2009 and titled " Deed of Assignment of Fruits of the Action "; (e) 30 July 2009 and titled " Assignment Deed ", 
 
 AAC has validly and effectively assigned to Young on the terms therein, AAC's rights and causes of action or the fruits thereof, in respect of AAC's claims against ICM for: 
 
 
 (f) breach of contract (the Growers Licence);
 (g) indemnity under the ICM Indemnity;
 (h) conversion of the Bumper Chickpea Crop;
 (i) money had and received or claim in restitution.
 
 An order that ICM pay Young, alternative, AAC: (a) damages for breach of the Growers Licence in the Sale Amount, alternatively, in some other amount to be determined; (b) the Sale Amount, alternative some other amount to be determined, pursuant to ICM Indemnity; (c) damages for ICM's conversion of the Bumper Chickpea Crop, in the Sale Amount, alternatively, some other amount to be determined; (d) the Sale Amount, alternatively, some other amount to be determined, as money had and received or in restitution; (e) interest. 
 Costs.
 An order that there be set off or deducted from any amount which ICM may be ordered to pay Young or ACC [sic] in this proceeding (including any order for costs) the amount which Young owes or upon determination will owe to ICM in respect of: (a) the judgment made and entered on 16 October 2007 by Judicial Registrar McDonald in District Court of New South Wales proceedings number 3126 of 2004 between ICM (as plaintiff) against Young (as defendant) (" 2004 DC Proceeding ") in favour of ICM against Young and accruing interest thereon; (b) ICM's costs in respect of the 2004 DC Proceeding; (c) ICM's costs in respect of Federal Magistrates Court of Australia Sydney Registry proceedings number SYG 3929 of 2007 between Young (as applicant) and ICM (as respondent); (d) ICM's costs in respect of Federal Court of Australia New South Wales District Registry proceedings number NSD 1267 of 2008 between ICM (as appellant) and Young (as respondent), 
 
 and that the net balance be the amount for which ICM shall be liable to Young or AAC or Young shall be liable to ICM. 
 

 
There has been no suggestion that the State of New South Wales or the GRDC is to be joined as a party, notwithstanding, for example, the relief sought in para 4 of the application. It may be intended, however, that they will somehow indicate their consent to the making of the declarations and orders sought (see [54] above).

Second, on 4 September 2009 the 2007 DC Proceeding was transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceeding number 13822/09, and on the same day the Supreme Court ordered that it be transferred to this Court where it has been numbered NSD 1026 of 2009.

The result of the first and second matters noted is that this Court is now seized of the claims made by Mr Young and AAC against ICM in the 2007 DC Proceeding as well as in the proceeding that they have recently commenced in this Court.</text>
