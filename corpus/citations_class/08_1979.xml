<tocase>Towney v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (1997) 76 FCR 401</tocase>
<text>7 Section 126 has been the subject of little judicial consideration although it has been usefully considered by Sackville J in Towney v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (1997) 76 FCR 401. For present purposes it is sufficient if I note that in that case his Honour indicated that the section contemplated the application of an objective standard. His Honour went on to observe at 414:
 In applying the standard specified by s 126 of the Evidence Act , it is to be borne in mind that the expression "proper understanding" is by no means narrow. The dictionary definition of "proper" includes "complete or thorough"; the definition of "understand" includes "to apprehend clearly the character or nature of" and "to grasp the significance, implications or importance of" (Macquarie Dictionary). It may or may not be correct to say that the test stated in s 126 of the Evidence Act , is, or appears to be, narrower than the principles governing implied waiver under the general law: cf Cross on Evidence (Aust ed), par 25300. Any precise assessment of the scope of s 126 must await further decisions. However, I think it fair to say that, if a privileged document is voluntarily disclosed for forensic purposes, and a thorough apprehension or appreciation of the character, significance or implications of that document requires disclosure of source documents, otherwise protected by client legal privilege, ordinarily the test laid down by s 126 of the Evidence Act will be satisfied.

8 While it is true that each of the invoices on its face requires no explanation of its contents (other than the need for translation from Chinese), the invoices themselves bear upon a number of potential questions. There is sharp disagreement between the parties over the incidence, effects and duration of the alleged parallel importation. The invoices that have been produced relate to a quite confined period in 2001 and 2002. For my own part I am satisfied that the significance properly to be attributed to them can only be discerned if one also is aware of the nature of the request that was addressed on Hamilton's behalf to Lo &amp; Lo. Whether it was quite specific or quite general in character, for example, could markedly affect how one would forensically evaluate the significance of the invoices. Hamilton, having tendered the Lo &amp; Lo emails and attachments, cannot now in my view properly resist putting into evidence its own lawyers' request.

9 In the circumstances I am satisfied that client legal privilege has been lost in relation to that request because the disclosure of the request itself is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the invoices.</text>

<tocase>Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/219.html</AustLII>
<text>15 It is well accepted that the aim of the court's power to amend under O 13 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules is to allow all the issues which arise in a proceeding to be determined and for a decision to be given on the real matter in controversy. Hence it has been emphasised that amendments to pleadings should be allowed if it not be unjust to do so: see Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd v Finishing Services Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 219 at [122] . The imperative in favour of amendment has been long accepted and is illustrated, for example, in the observations of Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ in Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437 at 446 where their Honours said:
 If in the cause of action upon which the plaintiff sued there had emerged at the conclusion of the evidence facts which, if accepted, established that cause of action, then it was the duty of the trial judge to leave the issue of negligence to the jury. The pleadings should have been amended in order to make the facts alleged and the particulars of negligence precisely conform to the evidence which had emerged ... Now, and for many years past, a plaintiff does not fail by being refused leave to amend or through failure formally to apply for amendment, where the evidence has disclosed a case in the cause of action fit to be determined by the tribunal of fact. Particularly is this so when the action finally determines the rights of the parties in the cause of action.</text>
