<text>5 On 16 January 2006 I delivered judgment discharging the examination summons and quashing the decision made by ASIC on 3 August 2005. ASIC and Highstoke were directed to pay the costs of the judicial review proceedings. Costs were reserved until today on the application to discharge the summons. The parties were given an opportunity to make submissions as to the costs in the Examination Proceedings Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13.

6 Hayes Knight seeks an order that ASIC pay two-thirds of its costs in the Examination Proceedings from 8 February 2006, which was the date upon which ASIC intervened. Its submissions were, in substance, as set out at par 15, listing circumstances which it said weighed heavily in favour of an order that ASIC pay two-thirds of its costs in relation to the constitutional matter:
 
 
 '(a) ASIC's charter, under s 1(2) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), is to duly and properly administer the laws conferring functions and powers on it; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) this proceeding, and WAD 281 of 2005 , arose as a result of ASIC having improperly exercised the powers conferred on it; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) ASIC elected to intervene in this proceeding under s 1330(1) of the [Corporations Act], and by virtue of s 1330(2) of the [Corporations Act] is taken to be a party with all the duties and liabilities of a party; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the interpretation of the [Corporations Act] is a matter of public importance and as ASIC is charged with administering the legislation, it was appropriate for ASIC to intervene under s 1330(1) of the [Corporations Act]. However, parliament has seen fit to impose on ASIC, by s 1330(2) of the [Corporations Act], the usual liabilities of a party (including costs) as a consequence of intervening under s 1330(1) of the [Corporations Act]; 
 
 
 
 (e) ASIC aggressively defended its position generally. In this regard: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the Respondents' first submissions on the constitutional matter dated 4 April 2006 set out the legal argument on the constitutional matter in 8 paragraphs (at [16] to [23]; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) ASIC's submissions filed on 2 May 2006 raised detailed arguments concerning the construction of s 596A of the [Corporations Act], as well as detailed arguments on the constitutional validity of the proposed examination; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) ASIC filed supplementary submissions on 18 May 2006; 
 
 
 
 (f) ASIC contentions have been held to be incorrect; 
 
 
 
 (g) ASIC's involvement in this proceeding caused the Respondent to incur substantial, additional costs in responding to ASIC's submissions and additional hearing time; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (h) the Respondents were entirely successful'

7 Highstoke, seeking to spread the burden of the costs in the Examination Proceedings, submits that ASIC and itself should be ordered to pay them, in effect, jointly and severally. It submits that if there is any differentiation to be drawn then ASIC should bear two-fifths of the costs and Highstoke three-fifths. Highstoke, in effect, accepts that any costs order, as against ASIC, should apply to costs incurred after 8 February 2006, the date of ASIC's intervention.</text>
