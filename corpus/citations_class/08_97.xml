<tocase>Adams v Adams [1971] P 188</tocase>
<text>17 Even in the absence of provisions such as s 18 of the 1977 Act and s 78A of the Judiciary Act , the Attorney-General has what has been described as " a right of intervention in a private suit whenever it may affect the prerogatives of the Crown ": Adams v Adams [1971] P 188 at 197. Sir Jocelyn Simon P there held at 197 8:
 
 In my view the Attorney-General has a right of intervention in a private suit whenever it may affect the prerogatives of the Crown, including its relations with foreign states ... and he certainly has in such circumstances a locus standi at the invitation of the court... 
 I think that the Attorney-General also has the right of intervention at the invitation or with the permission of the court where the suit raises any question of public policy on which the executive may have a view which it may desire to bring to the notice of the court.... 

 See also: Auckland Area Health Board v Attorney-General, [1993] 1 NZLR 235; Corporate Affairs Commission v Bradley [1974] 1 NSWLR 391 at 400 2 per Hutley JA (Reynolds and Glass JJA agreeing). Such decisions remain of assistance in providing instances as to those circumstances in which Courts have recognised the right of an Attorney-General to intervene as a party to proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Eastman v Miles [2004] ACTSC 32 ; (2004) 181 FLR 418</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//act/ACTSC/2004/32.html</AustLII>
<text>14 Although the Attorney-General initially sought " leave to intervene ", it is considered that s 18(1) of the 1977 Act confers a right to intervene in proceedings. The right to intervene has been invoked by the Attorney-General upon prior occasions: eg Finch v Goldstein (1981) 55 FLR 257 at 270, 36 ALR 287 at 298. The right conferred by s 78A of the Judiciary Act , it may be noted, is a right frequently exercised by the Attorney-General in Constitutional cases before the High Court of Australia: see Campbell, Intervention in Constitutional Cases (1998) 9 Pub L Rev 255 at 256. Where the Attorney-General seeks to intervene in proceedings in this Court, he is deemed to be a party to the proceeding pursuant to s 18(3): see Eastman v Miles [2004] ACTSC 32 at [92] , [2004] ACTSC 32 ; 181 FLR 418 at 445 6 per Gray J.</text>

<tocase>R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13</tocase>

<text>15 Even had leave been required, leave would have been granted. The basis upon which the Attorney-General sought to intervene was to avoid the prospect of the First, Second and Third Respondents having to " defend " their own conduct or decisions made: cf R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13; 29 ALR 289.</text>

<tocase>Toy Centre Agencies Pty Ltd v Spencer (1983) 67 FLR 458</tocase>
<text>16 The circumstances in which the Attorney-General may exercise the right conferred by s 18(1) to intervene " on behalf of the Commonwealth " are not, however, confined to those in which named respondents may otherwise be placed in the position of having to defend their own decisions or conduct. The ultimate objective of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), it will be recalled:
 
 ...is to ensure that decisions of public servants and others which affect the rights, prospects and property of citizens, are made after giving careful consideration to the questions involved in the particular case, so that it is more likely that the decision will be right and justice done to the persons affected by it: Toy Centre Agencies Pty Ltd v Spencer (1983) 67 FLR 458 at 466 per Lockhart J. 

The manner in which the 1977 Act may impact upon the Commonwealth is thus diverse. Equally diverse are the circumstances in which the Attorney-General may seek to intervene to represent the interests of the Commonwealth. It would thus be far from prudent to attempt to define or categorise in advance those interests of the Commonwealth which would permit the Attorney-General to exercise his right of intervention.</text>
