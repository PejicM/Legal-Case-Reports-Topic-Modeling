<tocase>Re Aplin, Brown &amp; Co Ltd [1902] St R Qd 67</tocase>
<text>68 Uninstructed by authority, I would have assumed that where one of two liquidators ceases to hold office, the other succeeds to the office. Barrett J may have thought similarly: see Vouris at [12]. However, his Honour considered that there was a contrary indication in McPherson's Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, LBC Information Services, 1999) of which Professor Andrew Keay is the author. Footnote 237 at p 297 of that notable work states that where one of two joint liquidators dies, the appropriate course is for the Court to appoint another liquidator to act jointly with the survivor, or, in the alternative, to remove the survivor and reappoint him or her as sole liquidator. The learned author cites in support a decision of Sir Samuel Griffith, then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, in Re Aplin, Brown &amp; Co Ltd [1902] St R Qd 67 ( Aplin ). Barrett J considered that the relevant provisions of the then Companies Act of Queensland were sufficiently similar to those of the Corporations Act to give rise to the conclusion that any difficulties of the kind suggested in that case "also conceivably arise under the present provisions" (at [13]).

71 It is necessary to go back to Aplin . Two persons, Aplin and Brown, were appointed as liquidators in a voluntary winding up, without any determination being made as to the exercise of their powers. They acted in the winding up jointly until Aplin died. For reasons that do not matter, the company in general meeting was not competent to act, and so there was no question of its filling of the vacancy pursuant to s 130 of the Companies Act 1863 (Qld). A representative on behalf of one of the contributories made an application by petition to the Supreme Court of Queensland for an order replacing Aplin or appointing Brown as sole liquidator.

72 Section 123(6) of the Companies Act 1863 provided that when several liquidators were appointed, their powers were exercisable by such one or more of them as might be determined at the time of their appointment "or in default of such determination by any number not less than two". In the circumstances, the effect of this provision was that although there was still a liquidator in place, he was incapable of continuing to exercise the powers of "the liquidators".

73 Until recently, the Corporations Act contained in s 506(4) an analogue of s 123(6) of the Queensland Act of 1863. Section 506(4) provided:
 When several liquidators are appointed, any power given by this Act may be exercised by such one or more of them as is determined at the time of their appointment, or in default of such determination, by any number not less than 2. [my emphasis]

74 I was minded to follow the course established by Aplin and Vouris of removing the continuing liquidator, Mr Condon, and appointing him as sole liquidator. However, the position must now be considered in the light of the recent amendments made by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 (referred to at [61] above). Consistently with the new s 530 (set out at [61] above), s 506(4) of the Corporations Act was repealed by that amending Act (see s 3, Sch1, Pt 3, Item 113.)</text>

<tocase>Re McGrath [2005] NSWSC 506 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 55</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/506.html</AustLII>
<text>60 In Re McGrath [2005] NSWSC 506 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 55 , Barrett J appears to have thought that even where, as in the present case and in the case before him, there is a continuing co-liquidator in office, there is a "vacancy in the office of a liquidator appointed by the Court" where a co-liquidator ceases to hold office, and therefore s 473(1) requires the Court to fill the vacancy (at [5]). His Honour appointed a second liquidator to replace one who had resigned.

61 The questions raised above must now be considered in the light of s 530 of the Corporations Act which was introduced by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 (Cth), s 3 , Sch 1, Pt 3 , Item 114. Section 530 provides:
 If 2 or more persons have been appointed as liquidators of a company: 
 
 (a) a function or power of a liquidator of the company may be performed or exercised by any one of them, or by any 2 or more of them together, except so far as the order or resolution appointing them otherwise provides; and
 (b) a reference in this Act to a liquidator, or to the liquidator, of a company is, in the case of the first-mentioned company, a reference to whichever one or more of those liquidators the case requires.
 
 

This provision has assimilated the position of multiple liquidators to that of multiple voluntary administrators and of multiple administrators of deeds of company arrangement under s 451A(2) and s 451B(2) of the Corporations Act respectively (set out at [84] and [93] below).

62 Clearly, s 530 produced the effect that following Mr Watson's resignation, as prior to it, Mr Condon was entitled alone to perform the functions and exercise the powers that were vested in "the liquidators". In the result, whatever be the correct meaning of the word "must" in s 473(7) , there is only a vacancy in the office of a liquidator for the purposes of that subsection where a sole liquidator or all co-liquidators have ceased to hold office.</text>

<tocase>Re Application of Vouris [2004] NSWSC 384 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 543</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/384.html</AustLII>
<text>53 In Re Application of Vouris [2004] NSWSC 384 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 543 ( Vouris ), Barrett J had occasion to consider the relationship between s 499(5) and s 502 (at [8]-[10]). His Honour treated the s 502 power as an "overarching" power and exercised it in order to avoid the expense and inconvenience associated with the convening of a meeting of creditors (at [10]). Unlike the position in relation to the present five companies, that was a case of the appointment of multiple liquidators by the creditors. Accordingly, in that case, the creditors at least had approved of the identity of the continuing liquidator. Although that was not so in the present case, it was my view that a case was made out for the Court's exercising the power under s 502 and I followed that course.

54 During Mr Watson's time at Condon Associates, he and Mr Condon were appointed as liquidators of each of the nine companies identified in Schedule 4 to the Orders. In the case of eight of the companies, the winding up order and the appointment were by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In the case of the remaining company, Pyoja Pty Ltd, the winding up order and the appointment were made by the Supreme Court of Victoria.

55 As noted at [40] above, s 473(1) of the Corporations Act provides that a liquidator appointed by the Court may resign. I also refer to rule 7.1 of the harmonised corporations rules of court (set out at [42] above). The evidence shows that written resignations signed by Mr Watson were filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Victoria on 3 December 2008, and that notices of the resignations were lodged with ASIC either on that day or earlier. The effective date of Mr Watson's resignations in all nine cases was therefore 3 December 2008.

68 Uninstructed by authority, I would have assumed that where one of two liquidators ceases to hold office, the other succeeds to the office. Barrett J may have thought similarly: see Vouris at [12]. However, his Honour considered that there was a contrary indication in McPherson's Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, LBC Information Services, 1999) of which Professor Andrew Keay is the author. Footnote 237 at p 297 of that notable work states that where one of two joint liquidators dies, the appropriate course is for the Court to appoint another liquidator to act jointly with the survivor, or, in the alternative, to remove the survivor and reappoint him or her as sole liquidator. The learned author cites in support a decision of Sir Samuel Griffith, then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, in Re Aplin, Brown &amp; Co Ltd [1902] St R Qd 67 ( Aplin ). Barrett J considered that the relevant provisions of the then Companies Act of Queensland were sufficiently similar to those of the Corporations Act to give rise to the conclusion that any difficulties of the kind suggested in that case "also conceivably arise under the present provisions" (at [13]).

69 Barrett J took the course of removing the continuing liquidator ( Vouris concerned, not the death of a liquidator but the suspension of the registration of a liquidator for three months by the Company Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board) and reappointing him as sole liquidator in the exercise of the power in s 503 of the Corporations Act .

70 Sections 502 and 503 provide:
 
 
 502 If from any cause there is no liquidator acting, the Court may appoint a liquidator.
 503 The Court may, on cause shown, remove a liquidator and appoint another liquidator.
 
 

 Section 502 did not apply in Vouris because there was still a liquidator acting, and Barrett J considered that s 503 gave only a composite power to remove and appoint, not simply a power to appoint. His Honour noted the question whether the expression "another liquidator" means a liquidator other than the one removed, but concluded that it did not mean this.

74 I was minded to follow the course established by Aplin and Vouris of removing the continuing liquidator, Mr Condon, and appointing him as sole liquidator. However, the position must now be considered in the light of the recent amendments made by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 (referred to at [61] above). Consistently with the new s 530 (set out at [61] above), s 506(4) of the Corporations Act was repealed by that amending Act (see s 3, Sch1, Pt 3, Item 113.)

85 In Re Wallace Smith; National Express Group Australia (Bayside Trains) Pty Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (admins apptd) (2003) 46 ACSR 674, Finkelstein J had to deal with an application for the appointment of a substitute administrator where one of two administrators had resigned. In the present case, however, that is not the relief sought. In passing, his Honour referred to s 449C(6) which provides:
 Where a company is under administration, but for some reason no administrator is acting, the Court may appoint a person as administrator on the application of ASIC or of an officer, member or creditor of the company. 
His Honour observed (at [5]):
 On one view, which may be the correct view, this condition cannot be satisfied when one of two or more joint administrators have ceased to act for, in that event, it cannot be said that "no administrator is acting". 
It will be recalled that Barrett J took a similar view in the context of joint liquidators in Vouris (see [69] above).</text>
