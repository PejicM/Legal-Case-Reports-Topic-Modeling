<tocase>Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405</tocase>
<text>In Tidy Tea Ltd v Unilever Australia Ltd (1995) 32 IPR 405 , which was a case in respect of an application for interlocutory injunctive relief in respect of the earlier intellectual property item known as a petty patent, Burchett J held that the fact that a respondent's product was capable of falling within the terms of the claim of the petty patent, as well as the fact that the Respondent's product was capable of use as an infringing device, meant that there was a serious question to be tried. On the material to hand, it seems to me that there is, in terms of use, an overlap as between the uses of the patented system of Tramanco and that which is marketed by BPW Transpec. It is necessary to sound a cautionary note in respect of that conclusion because of the very general nature of the information available at present in respect of BPW Transpec's system. The point was made on behalf of that company that the product concerned is, first and foremost, an electronic braking system with the feature that has excited Tramanco's interest, being something of an add-on. On the material to hand, that submission is well made, but it does not, in my opinion, affect the reaching of a conclusion that there is a serious question to be tried for the reason which I have given.

There then falls, for separate, but not unrelated, consideration, factors going to the balance of convenience.

Tramanco, by its managing director, Mr Sack, has, through its counsel, offered the usual undertaking as to damages. That undertaking, on the material to hand, is not one without substance. There is evidence in the material read today of the worth of Tramanco. Its assets, in total, amount to $2.3 million. It has no liabilities or encumbrances. It has a cash flow which is, on the material to hand, substantial and likely to increase.</text>
