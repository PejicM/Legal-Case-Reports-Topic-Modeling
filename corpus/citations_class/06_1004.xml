<tocase>Foakes v Beer [1884] 9 App Case 605</tocase>
<text>141 It is well established that mere forbearance by one party to a contract in requiring performance of obligations by the other does not effect a variation of the contract unless supported by consideration or recorded in a deed under seal. In Foakes v Beer [1884] 9 App Cas 605 the House of Lords held an agreement between judgment debtor and creditor that the creditor would not take proceedings on the judgment in consideration of the debtor paying part of it and the residue by instalments, was nudum pactum as without consideration. It did not prevent the creditor after payment of the whole debt and costs from enforcing payment of interest on the judgment. Lord Selborne LC said (at 613):
 
 'If the question be ... whether consideration is, or is not, given in a case of this kind, by the debtor who pays down part of the debt presently due from him, for a promise by the creditor to relinquish, after certain further payments on account, the residue of the debt, I cannot say that I think consideration is given, in the sense in which I have always understood that word as used in our law.' 
 

 Vanbergen v St Edmunds Properties Ltd (1933) 2 KB 223 involved an indulgence solely for the benefit of one party to a creditor/debtor relationship. Lord Hanworth MR, after citing Foakes v Beer, quoted from Smith's Leading Cases, and said (at 232):
 
 
 '... a creditor cannot bind himself by a simple agreement to accept a smaller sum in lieu of an ascertained debt of larger amount, such an agreement being nudum pactum . But if there be any benefit, or even any legal possibility of benefit to the creditor thrown in, that additional weight will turn the scale and render the consideration sufficient to support the agreement.' 
 

In Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ACN 005 357 522) v Ringrong Pty Ltd (ACN 005 496 855) [1995] FCA 722 , Ryan J held (at p 37) that forgiveness of a debt not embodied in a deed and unsupported by consideration was 'ineffectual at law or in equity'.</text>

<tocase>Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110</tocase>
<text>143 Quite apart from the problem that the alleged variation lacked consideration there was uncertainty about its terms. A reduction in fees for an unspecified but temporary period apparently to be determined at the will of one party, does not import certainty of obligation. In answering that question it is necessary not to demand unrealistic precision. As McHugh JA said in Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 (at 11,118): 
 
 '... in an ongoing relationship, it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled. Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties' subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties. In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms. It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed.' 
 

See Brambles Nationwide Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 177 (Heydon JA) and Nationwide Produce Holdings Pty Ltd v Linknarf Limited (2005) Aust Contract Reports 90-424 at 88,509 (Tamberlin J). In Vroon BV v Fosters Brewing Group Ltd (1994) 2 VR 32, Ormiston J accepted that:
 
 
 '... in commercial transactions the court should strive to give effect to the expressed arrangements and expectations of those engaged in business notwithstanding that there are areas of uncertainty and notwithstanding that particular terms have been omitted or not fully worked out.'</text>

<tocase>British and Beningtons, Limited v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd [19232] AC 48</tocase>
<text>153 A longstanding distinction exists in English law between rescission and variation of contracts by subsequent agreements. It has been applied particularly in cases of contracts required by law to be evidenced in writing. A parol variation of a written agreement would, in such a case, be unenforceable. On the other hand where the subsequent parol agreement discharges the earlier agreement it is not affected by the requirement that the original agreement be in writing. In British and Beningtons, Limited v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd [1923] AC 48, which concerned a contract required by the Statute of Frauds to be in writing, Lord Atkinson said (at 62): 
 
 'A written contract may be rescinded by parol either expressly or by the parties entering into a parol contract entirely inconsistent with the written one, or, if not entirely inconsistent with it, inconsistent with it to an extent that goes to the very root of it.' 
 

The earlier decision of the House of Lords in Morris v Baron &amp; Co [1918] AC 1, also a Statute of Frauds case, was relied upon.</text>

The earlier decision of the House of Lords in Morris v Baron &amp; Co [1918] AC 1, also a Statute of Frauds case, was relied upon.

154 It has been said, as a general proposition, that the result of varying the terms of an existing contract is to produce not the original contract with a variation but a new and different contract Williams v Moss Empires [1915] 3 KB 242 at 247 (Sankey J). That approach was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Morris v Baron . Lord Sumner referred to it in British and Beningtons, Ltd (at 68) as possibly correct 'as a matter of formal logic'. However in United Dominions Corporation (Jamaica) Ltd v Shoucair [1969] 1 AC 340, which was a case involving money lenders' legislation in Jamaica, Lord Devlin, delivering the judgment of the House of Lords, said (at 348): 
 
 'The disadvantage of this view is that a minor variation may destroy the effect of the whole of the transaction between the parties. The alternative view, adopted by the House of Lords in Morris v Baron and again in British and Benningtons (sic) Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Company Ltd ... is based on the intention of the parties. They cannot have that which presumably they wanted, that is, the old agreement as amended; so the court has to make up its mind which comes nearer to their intention to leave them with an unamended agreement or without any agreement at all. The House answered this question by rejecting the strict view propounded by Sankey J and distinguishing between rescission and variation. If the new agreement reveals an intention to rescind the old, the old goes; and if it does not, the old remains in force and unamended. 
 

It seems that this distinction was developed in order to address the difficulties generated by requirements for contracts to be in writing, imposed by the Statute of Frauds, and in the United Dominions Corporation case by the Money Lending law of Jamaica.

155 In Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Victoria) Pty Ltd [1957] HCA 10 ; (1957) 98 CLR 93, Dixon CJ and Fullagar J described the distinction made between 'rescission' and 'variation' in the two House of Lords decisions as '... not a satisfactory distinction'. It appeared to be 'a matter of degree' (at 113). Taylor J said (at 144):
 
 'It is firmly established by a long line of cases commencing at least as early as Goss v Lord Nugent [(1833) 5 B &amp; Ad 58] and ending with cases such as Morris v Baron &amp; Co and British &amp; Beningtons Ltd v North Western Cachar Tea Co Ltd and, indeed, including Goss v Lord Nugent itself that the parties to an agreement may vary some of its terms by a subsequent agreement. They may, of course, rescind the earlier agreement altogether, and this may be done either expressly or by implication, but the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by the later agreement.'

156 Taylor J acknowledged that variation might involve partial rescission and cited Salmond and Williams on Contract , 2 nd ed (1945) at 488 and 489: 
 
 'Partial rescission ... does not completely destroy the contractual relation between the parties. It merely modifies that relation by cutting out part of the rights and obligations involved therein, with or without the substitution of new rights and obligations in their place. Partial rescission is not the extinction of the contract but the variation of it.' 
 

And further (at 144):
 
 
 'A contract may be varied (1) by way of partial rescission without the substitution of new terms in place of those rescinded, or (2) by way of partial rescission with the substitution of new terms for those rescinded or (3) by the addition of new terms without any partial rescission at all.' 
 

Taylor J observed that those passages correctly stated the accepted view of the manner in which an agreement by way of variation operates.

157 The distinction between rescission and variation of contracts was indirectly an issue in Dan v Barclays Australia Ltd (1983) 46 ALR 437 (57 ALJR 442). The case concerned the construction of the terms of a guarantee of the payment of up to $500,000 owing under a bill acceptance facility which allowed for a maximum advance of $2 million. The maximum of the bill acceptance facility was increased sometime after its execution. It was held by Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ that the initial bill acceptance facility was significantly different from that subsequently granted and the guarantors were therefore not liable for interest and charges resulting from default under the later facility although, as a matter of construction of the guarantee, they were liable for the principal up to the figure specified in the guarantee. Wilson and Dawson JJ dissented. In their dissent they observed that cases dealing with the circumstances in which variation of a contract would amount to rescission did not necessarily provide the answer to the question of the construction of the guarantee in its application to 'the facility'. However they said (at 448):
 
 'The distinction between rescission and variation is discussed in such cases as Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Vic) Pty Ltd [1957] HCA 10 ; (1957) 98 CLR 93; Morris v Baron and Co [1918] AC 1 and British and Beningtons Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Co [1923] AC 48. Variation of an existing contract, whilst it in one sense always gives rise to a new contract, does not always result in a substituted contract which, in order to operate, must necessarily rescind the contract which is varied. Variation may take the form of rescission of some of the terms of an existing contract but if that is to have the effect of rescission of the whole contract, the rescission must be express or by necessary implication and the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by contract when varied: see Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Vic) Pty Ltd, supra, per Taylor J at 143-4.' 
 

Owen J in Permanent Building Society (In Liquidation) v Wheeler (1993) 10 WAR 109 observed that although the statement in Dan was in a dissenting judgment, the dissent related to the application of the test. There was no reason to doubt the authoritative force of the statement of principle (at 127): 
 
 
 'Many of the cases arise in the area of unenforceability due to non-compliance with a formal requirement such as writing. ... However, the authorities show that the task is to ascertain the intention of the parties as embodied in the contracts.' 
 

It was permissible, in searching for the intention of the parties, 'to look at the extent and completeness of the changes involved in the variation' (127). His Honour said further (at 128):
 
 'That there may be "as a matter of formal logic" a new contract ... is true to a limited extent only.' 
 

In the Permanent Building Society case the parties had expressly confirmed the original agreement and made minor changes. The varied contract was therefore a 'new' contract only to the extent that it contained terms which were not present in the original agreement.</text>

In the Permanent Building Society case the parties had expressly confirmed the original agreement and made minor changes. The varied contract was therefore a 'new' contract only to the extent that it contained terms which were not present in the original agreement.

158 In Commissioner of Taxation v Sara Lee Household &amp; Body Care (Australia) Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 35 ; (2000) 201 CLR 520 at 534 reference was made in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Hayne JJ to the passage from the judgment of Taylor J in Tallerman and its approval by Wilson and Dawson JJ in Dan . The joint judgment in Sara Lee said, in relation to the passage from the judgment of Taylor J, (at 534 [24]):
 
 'It accords with principle and with authority.' 
 

Callinan J also acknowledged that there may be cases in which what is expressed to be a variation of an earlier agreement as a matter of construction cannot be so regarded.

162 A contract under which a person is employed, whether directly or through a corporate entity controlled by that person, may be discharged by sufficiently significant changes to the duties and/or the remuneration of the person so employed. A discharge will occur when the changes are significant, not able to be accommodated by the terms of the original contract and not contemplated by the parties when the original contract was made. Whether there has been a discharge or a variation of the original agreement depends upon the intention of the parties discerned by reference to the terms of their second agreement. It is as Dixon CJ and Fullagar J said in Tallerman 'a matter of degree'.

163 In my opinion, Mr Elliott's appointment as managing director and chief executive officer of Energy on 29 September 2000 and Mr Brand's relinquishment of that office was of itself sufficient to constitute a discharge of the Agreement of May 1999. There was a very substantial difference between the office of managing director and executive director which supports the contention that objectively judged it was the intention of both parties to discharge the Agreement. The complete terms upon which Mr Brand provided his services as an executive director thereafter were never expressly agreed between Martech and Energy. Those terms and conditions would have to be considered in the context of the evolving commercial relationship between Mr Brand and Energy and their respective conduct. Mr Brand played a significant part in defining them himself, not least by unilaterally varying downwards his annual fee.

164 I do not accept the submission by Martech that Mr Brand was 'removed' from office by Energy on 29 September 2000. While the circumstances at the time made the course that he adopted the only practical course to take, that was a judgment he made for himself and to which he assented. I find that the Agreement was discharged consensually.</text>

<tocase>Dan v Barclays Australia Ltd (1983) 46 ALR 437</tocase>
<text>157 The distinction between rescission and variation of contracts was indirectly an issue in Dan v Barclays Australia Ltd (1983) 46 ALR 437 (57 ALJR 442). The case concerned the construction of the terms of a guarantee of the payment of up to $500,000 owing under a bill acceptance facility which allowed for a maximum advance of $2 million. The maximum of the bill acceptance facility was increased sometime after its execution. It was held by Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ that the initial bill acceptance facility was significantly different from that subsequently granted and the guarantors were therefore not liable for interest and charges resulting from default under the later facility although, as a matter of construction of the guarantee, they were liable for the principal up to the figure specified in the guarantee. Wilson and Dawson JJ dissented. In their dissent they observed that cases dealing with the circumstances in which variation of a contract would amount to rescission did not necessarily provide the answer to the question of the construction of the guarantee in its application to 'the facility'. However they said (at 448):
 
 'The distinction between rescission and variation is discussed in such cases as Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Vic) Pty Ltd [1957] HCA 10 ; (1957) 98 CLR 93; Morris v Baron and Co [1918] AC 1 and British and Beningtons Ltd v NW Cachar Tea Co [1923] AC 48. Variation of an existing contract, whilst it in one sense always gives rise to a new contract, does not always result in a substituted contract which, in order to operate, must necessarily rescind the contract which is varied. Variation may take the form of rescission of some of the terms of an existing contract but if that is to have the effect of rescission of the whole contract, the rescission must be express or by necessary implication and the determining factor must always be the intention of the parties as disclosed by contract when varied: see Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise (Vic) Pty Ltd, supra, per Taylor J at 143-4.' 
 

Owen J in Permanent Building Society (In Liquidation) v Wheeler (1993) 10 WAR 109 observed that although the statement in Dan was in a dissenting judgment, the dissent related to the application of the test. There was no reason to doubt the authoritative force of the statement of principle (at 127): 
 
 
 'Many of the cases arise in the area of unenforceability due to non-compliance with a formal requirement such as writing. ... However, the authorities show that the task is to ascertain the intention of the parties as embodied in the contracts.'

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/29.html</AustLII>
<text>165 Martech submitted that it was entitled to the Termination Payment if the Agreement were terminated for any reason other than one of those set out in sub cls 8.1.1, 8.1.3, 8.1.4 and 8.1.5 or cl 8.5. Termination having occurred on 29 September 2000 for none of those reasons it says it was entitled. Energy submitted that, on its proper construction, cl 8.6 did not apply where Martech wished to terminate its services and agreed to termination. The benefit of the notice provision in cl 8.5 could be waived Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 543, 552, 560 and 565.

166 The critical question in considering the Martech submission is whether, on the proper construction of cl 8.6, the entitlement which it creates in a case in which the 'Agreement is terminated for any other reason ...' arises where there is a consensual discharge of the Agreement. That constructional question depends upon a consideration of the words of cl 8.6 and the context in which they appear both within that clause and within other parts of cl 8 and the Agreement as a whole.

167 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'termination' is equivocal. It defines termination relevantly as a transitive verb meaning: 
 
 'bring to an end, put an end to, cause to cease; finish, end (an action, condition etc).' 
 

It is also defined as an intransitive verb meaning, inter alia: 
 
 
 'come to an end (in time); end, cease, conclude ...'</text>

<tocase>Bridge v Campbell Discount Co Ltd [1962] AC 600</tocase>
<text>168 Lord Radcliffe said in Bridge v Campbell Discount Co Ltd [1962] AC 600 (at 620):
 
 '"Terminate" is an ambiguous word, since it may refer to a termination by a right under the agreement or by a condition incorporated in it or by a deliberate breach by one party amounting to a repudiation of the whole contract.' 
 

Lord Denning also adverted to the uncertain scope of 'termination' in the terms and conditions of National Health Service staff contracts:
 
 
 'terminate or termination is by itself ambiguous. It can refer to either of two things either to termination by notice or termination by effluxion of time. It is often used in that dual sense in landlord and tenant and master and servant cases.' 
 

In context, he found it to refer only to termination by notice R v Social Services Secretary, Ex parte Khan [1973] 1 WLR 187 at 189. Karminski and Buckley LJJ agreed. Buckley LJ added (at 191):
 
 
 'As Mr Slynn has pointed out, the verb "terminate" can be used either transitively or intransitively. A contract may be said to terminate when it comes to an end by effluxion of time, or it may be terminated when it is determined by notice or otherwise by some act of one of the parties.'</text>

<tocase>Paal Wilson &amp; Co v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854</tocase>
<text>171 A contract may be abandoned by agreement extinguishing all unperformed primary obligations. It may be abandoned by conduct where the conduct of one party acted on by the other leads to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract. In the alternative, the conduct of one party towards another and the other's action upon that conduct to its detriment may result in the first party being estopped from denying that the contract has been abandoned Paal Wilson &amp; Co v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 914 (Lord Brandon), 915 (Lord Diplock), 924 (Lord Brightman).

172 In summary the word 'termination' when referring to the discharge of a contract has a variety of possible meanings. It may be limited to non-consensual termination by the action of one or other party to the contract. It may extend to discharge of the contract by effluxion of time. That is a consensual termination in the limited sense that it is part of the agreement from the outset. The word may also be construed as applying to a discharge of a contract by agreement or by abandonment which may be taken to amount to the same thing. Its meaning in cl 8.6 depends upon the language of that clause and related clauses of the Agreement. It is also to be construed by reference to the context of the Agreement as a whole.

173 Clause 8.1 of the Agreement concerned the circumstances in which Energy could terminate summarily Martech's services. None of those circumstances applied in this case. Clause 8.2 allowed Martech to terminate the Agreement in the event of Energy suspending payment or compounding with its creditors or assigning its estate for their benefit. That circumstance did not exist either. Clause 8.3 limited the power of both Energy and Martech to terminate for breach of obligation by requiring that the party in breach be served with a notice requiring rectification and allowing 30 days for that to occur. Clause 8.5 allowed Martech to 'terminate its services' on three months' written notice.

174 If the Board of Energy had resolved to dismiss Mr Brand as managing director other than for any of the reasons set out in cl 8.1 that could be taken as a repudiation of the Agreement and, if accepted by Martech, a termination of the Agreement giving rise to the entitlement to a payment under cl 8.6. If Energy declined to renew the term of the Agreement at its expiry, that too would give rise to an entitlement to the fee under cl 8.6. In each of these cases cl 8.6 had work to do. Each involved termination by Energy of its relationship with Martech.

175 The question arises whether by cl 8.6 Martech was entitled to a termination payment in the event of a discharge by agreement. Absent clear words, I do not construe cl 8.6 as extending to such a case. The bases and terms upon which parties to an agreement may agree to discharge it are many and various. The extension of cl 8.6 to mandate a very substantial payment in the event of an agreed discharge of the parties' contractual obligations would impose a requirement on the parties as to the terms on which they may so agree. Even if cl 8.6 expressly applied to a discharge by agreement, it would be open to the parties by agreement to discharge that obligation along with all the others. Indeed so to construe cl 8.6 is to give it, in its application to an agreed discharge, an operation rather like that of an agreement to agree. Such an agreement is not a contract. I accept in so saying that it may theoretically be possible to create an entitlement to a termination payment which vests, pursuant to the Agreement, upon the external event of a later agreement to discharge. I do not accept, however, that cl 8.6 so operated.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2002/171.html</AustLII>
<text>341 It may be accepted for present purposes that Martech and Mr Brand owed Energy and AEE the various duties alleged in the cross-claim. Although the formulations of those contractual, common law, fiduciary and statutory duties vary from one to the other, they are for practical purposes, subsumed in the one standard of reasonable care. As was submitted on behalf of Martech and Mr Brand, the duties which were imposed on directors by s 232(4) of the Corporations Law, which was in force at the relevant time, are essentially the same as the duties of directors under the common law and, a fortiori, in equity. The submission referred to authorities cited by Santow J in Re HIH Insurance Limited (In Prov Liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler and Others [2002] NSWSC 171 ; (2002) 41 ACSR 72 at [372] . Plainly enough a director and, a fortiori , a managing director, may rely on the advice and information of officers of a company whose task it is to provide such advice and information. Reliance may also be placed upon judgments made by officers of the company which fall within their sphere of responsibility. That reliance would, of course, not be reasonable if a director or managing director knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care should have known, any facts which would raise a question about the judgment, information or advice offered.

342 The question whether reliance by a director upon an officer of the company or delegation of a function to such an officer is reasonable falls to be determined in the circumstances of each case. In Re HIH Insurance, Santow J listed, non-exhaustively, factors which may be important in determining reasonableness: 
 
 
 '1. [whether] the function that has been delegated is such that "it may properly be left to such officers"; 
 
 2. the extent to which the director is put on inquiry, or given the facts of a case, should have been put on inquiry; 
 
 3. [whether] the relationship between the director and the delegate, must be such that the director honestly holds the belief that the delegate is trustworthy, competent and someone on whom reliance can be placed...; 
 
 4. the risk involved in the transaction and the nature of the transaction. 
 
 5. the extent of steps taken by the director, for example, inquiries made or other circumstances engendering "trust"; 
 
 6. whether the position of the director is executive or non-executive.'

<tocase>Darvall v North Sydney Brick and Tile Co Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 260</tocase>
<text>343 It was further submitted on behalf of Martech and Mr Brand that Mr Brand's decision to make the reduced milestone payment was an aspect of a wider agreement to vary the terms of the milestone schedule to the Vypeen agreement. This, it was said, was a 'business decision' which involved the balancing of a range of circumstances and factors. It was Energy and AEE which wished, for their own reasons, to revise the milestone schedule and which had to reach a compromise acceptable to Prenergy. It was submitted that courts properly refrain from assuming the management of corporations and substituting their own decisions and assessments for those of directors. Directors can be expected to have much greater knowledge and more time and expertise at their disposal to evaluate the best interests of the corporation, rather than the court Darvall v North Sydney Brick and Tile Co Ltd (1989) 16 NSWLR 260 at 281.

344 In their submissions, Energy and AEE relied upon the formulation of the condition for the making of the milestone payment, namely the satisfaction of 'All applicable State and Central Government of India approvals for alternative fuel for the Vypeen Project'. They submitted that Mr Brand accepted that the law of India effectively prohibited the import of condensate for use in the Vypeen Project and that the way to address that situation was to seek to persuade the Indian Government to change the law. What was necessary was a change in the law generally not just a facilitation for the purpose of the Vypeen Project. The law in relation to importation of condensate did not change between 1998 and 1999 and for that reason applicable approvals had not been obtained. It was also emphasised that no application for approval was ever made. On that ground, it was submitted, that objectively speaking there was no basis upon which the milestone payment should be made.

345 Energy and AEE relied upon Mr Brand's understanding of certain important facts. He knew that the supply of condensate fuel was the most critical component and the key to financing the project. This appeared from the memorandum dated 27 February 1998 which he had received. He also knew from a fax dated 26 March 1998 from Mr Bridgwood that condensate was not then permitted to be imported into India. Of course that fax added that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas would recommend to the Ministry of Power that condensate be approved for importation under the Open General Licence (In fact the position seems to have been the other way round). He was aware of the proposed lobbying of the Ministry of Power and the Ministry for Petroleum and Natural Gas. The text of the brief to the relevant Ministers has been set out earlier in these reasons.</text>
