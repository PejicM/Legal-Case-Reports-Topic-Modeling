<text>27 The notion that a person might become one of the people of Australia by absorption into the Australian community seems first to have been discussed by the High Court in Ex parte Walsh and Johnson; In re Yates [1925] HCA 53 ; (1925) 37 CLR 36. In that case at p 64 Knox CJ took the view that it followed from the opinions expressed in Minehan that:
 ... a person who has originally entered Australia as an immigrant may in course of time and by force of circumstances cease to be an immigrant, and become a member of the Australian community. He may, so to speak, grow out of the condition of being an immigrant, and thus become exempt from the operation of the immigration power.

28 Whether the view expressed by Knox CJ in Ex parte Walsh and Johnson remained the position in 1975 in respect of a person who had entered Australia after the Migration Act came into operation seems to me to be open to doubt. In The Queen v Forbes; ex parte Kwok Kwan Lee [1971] HCA 14 ; (1971) 124 CLR 168 at 172-173 Barwick CJ, with whom all other members of the High Court agreed, stated:
 It was said in O'Keefe v Calwell that immigration as a concept involves two elements (a) entry into the country and (b) absorption into the community of the country. Parliament clearly has authority to legislate with respect to both elements and laws which control those elements can be made under s 51(xxvii). It can say who may enter and it can say on what terms if at all a person so entering may become a member of the Australian community. In the Act Parliament has exercised these powers. It is there provided quite unequivocally that a person who is not already a member of the Australian community may not enter Australia except in pursuance of an entry permit. See definition of "immigrant" s 5(1) ss 5(2), 6(2). If he has no permit and enters Australia he is a prohibited immigrant. It scarce needs saying that a prohibited immigrant may not by any means become a member of the Australian community whilst he is a prohibited immigrant. By the very description he is not a person having any title to remain in the country. (citation omitted)

36 As noted above, the Full Court in Moore referred to a "considerable period of time" being invariably required for absorption. Their Honours' view finds support in Ex parte Walsh and Johnson where Knox CJ spoke of a person growing out of the condition of being an immigrant "in course of time and by force of circumstances" (see [27] above). It seems to me that the period of approximately five months between the arrival of the infant Mr Charlie on Darnley Island and Independence Day was not a "considerable period of time" within the meaning of that expression as used in Moore. Their Honours, in my view, plainly envisaged a period of some years as being required for absorption. The period of approximately five months was, I conclude, plainly insufficient for Mr Charlie, together with his family unit, to have become part of the Australian community by absorption. This is so, in my view, notwithstanding that his parents:
 
(a) intended, as I find, in April 1975 to settle permanently on Darnley Island;
 
(b) did not, as I infer, absent themselves from Darnley Island frequently or for long periods of time;
 
(c) had close family connections with Darnley Island and were connected to the island by Mr Charlie Snr's employment;
 
(d) occupied a home of their own on Darnley Island; and 
 
(e) participated, as I infer, in Darnley Island community activities.</text>

<text>31 The question of the absorption of a child into the Australian community was considered by the Full Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236. At [49] the Full Court noted with apparent approval the following passage from the reasons for judgment of French J in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494 at [45] - [46] :
 In relation to the question of absorption into the community French J said in Johnson at [45]-[46]: 
 
 
 
 '45 The general statements made about the concept of absorption offer little in the way of practical guidance for determining whether a person has become part of the community, either as an adult or as a minor who comes in with a family unit. In Koon Wing Lau v Calwell , Dixon J said (at 577): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... there does not appear to be any general agreement as to the tests for the application of this very vague conception. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The word "absorption" is an evaluative metaphor which invites consideration of a variety of factors relevant to its application. It is important to bear in mind also that it is a metaphor used in aid of the resolution of a question of constitutional fact, namely whether the person to whom it is applied has ceased to be an immigrant. The metaphor must not obscure the primary question. 
 
 46 Having regard to the primary question, factors relevant to whether a person has become a member of the Australian community in the way that that concept was discussed in Potter v Minahan might be thought to include the following: 
 
 
 1. The time that has elapsed since the person's entry into Australia. 
 2. The existence and timing of the formation of an intention to settle permanently in Australia. 
 3. The number and duration of absences. 
 4. Family or other close personal ties in Australia. 
 5. The presence of family members in Australia or the commitment of family members to come to Australia to join the person. 
 6. Employment history. 
 7. Economic ties including property ownership. 
 8. Contribution to, and participation in, community activities. 
 9. Any criminal record. 
 
 
 This list of factors is plainly not exhaustive. Rather, it illustrates the multi-dimensional character of the judgment involved. It is also necessary in making that judgment to avoid narrow mono-cultural assumptions about what constitutes membership of the Australian community. This may not always make the judgment an easy one -- see generally D Wood, "Deportation, The Immigration Power and Absorption into the Australian Community" (1986) 16 Fed Law Rev 288.'</text>

<text>9 Nonetheless, under the Migration Act a person born in Papua after the commencement of the Citizenship Act required an entry permit to be entitled to enter or reside in any of the States or internal territories ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Ame [2005] HCA 36 ; (2005) 222 CLR 439 at [1] ).

 This list of factors is plainly not exhaustive. Rather, it illustrates the multi-dimensional character of the judgment involved. It is also necessary in making that judgment to avoid narrow mono-cultural assumptions about what constitutes membership of the Australian community. This may not always make the judgment an easy one -- see generally D Wood, "Deportation, The Immigration Power and Absorption into the Australian Community" (1986) 16 Fed Law Rev 288.'

32 In Moore at [53]-[54] the Full Court stated:
 The absorption of children into the Australian community will be very much influenced by the absorption or otherwise of their parents. If (say) a boy entered Australia with his parents and his siblings, as an immigrant, when only one month old, different considerations would apply to deciding the question of his absorption than those which would apply if (say) a boy entered Australia as an immigrant with his parents and siblings when he was already 17 years of age. ... Absorption, to be complete, will invariably require the passage of a considerable period of time.

33 It may be assumed that the contrast that the Full Court drew in Moore between a one month old boy and a boy of 17 years of age was between (a) an infant entirely dependent on his parents and incapable of forming an intention of his own to make a home in Australia, and (b) an adolescent approaching adulthood who might well have adopted the Australian way of life for himself and formed an intention to remain part of the Australian community.

34 As mentioned above, as at Independence Day Mr Charlie was less than two years old. During the proceeding six months he would have been entirely dependent on other family members, and in particular his parents. He would have been, by reason of immaturity, incapable of forming an intention of his own of making a home on Darnley Island as opposed to in Papua. I conclude that the question of whether he had been absorbed into the Darnley Island community prior to Independence Day is to be determined by reference to whether his parents had by that time been absorbed into that community.

35 Nothing in the authorities seems to me to provide any support for a contention that Mr Charlie's parents could have become absorbed into the Darnley Island community in the short period of time between April and September 1975. It is to be remembered that a consequence of absorption into the Darnley Island community would probably have been loss of membership of the family's former Papuan community.

36 As noted above, the Full Court in Moore referred to a "considerable period of time" being invariably required for absorption. Their Honours' view finds support in Ex parte Walsh and Johnson where Knox CJ spoke of a person growing out of the condition of being an immigrant "in course of time and by force of circumstances" (see [27] above). It seems to me that the period of approximately five months between the arrival of the infant Mr Charlie on Darnley Island and Independence Day was not a "considerable period of time" within the meaning of that expression as used in Moore.

(b) did not, as I infer, absent themselves from Darnley Island frequently or for long periods of time;
 
(c) had close family connections with Darnley Island and were connected to the island by Mr Charlie Snr's employment;

<tocase>Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63 ; (1908) 7 CLR 277</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1908/63.html</AustLII>
<text>22 The notion of membership of a community with a concomitant right to live in that community was discussed by members of the High Court in Potter v Minahan [1908] HCA 63 ; (1908) 7 CLR 277. That case concerned the right of the illegitimate son of a Victorian woman to return to Australia from China. His original home was in Victoria but he had been taken at the age of 5 years to China by his father. Although he remained in China for 26 years he was found by a majority of the High Court never to have abandoned his original home.

23 In Minahan Griffith CJ at 289 observed:
 ... anterior, both in order of thought and in order of time, to the concepts of nationality and of domicil is another, upon which both are founded, and which is, I think, an elementary part of the concept of human society, namely, the division of human beings into communities. From this it follows that every person becomes at birth a member of the community into which he is born, and is entitled to remain in it until excluded by some competent authority. It follows also that every human being (unless outlawed) is a member of some community, and is entitled to regard the part of the earth occupied by that community as a place to which he may resort when he thinks fit. ... At birth he is, in general, entitled to remain in the place where he is born. ... If his parents are then domiciled in some other place, he perhaps acquires a right to go to and remain in that place. But, until the right to remain in or return to his place of birth is lost, it must continue, and he is entitled to regard himself as a member of the community which occupies that place. These principles are self-evident, and do not need the support of authority.

24 O'Connor J at 306 said:
 What is the scope and purpose of the Act? [ie the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (Cth)] To prevent the entry into Australia of persons from other countries whom the Legislature has determined ought not for various reasons to be permitted to become members of the Australian community. ... That being so, the foundation in law of the respondent's case is the unimpeachable proposition that a person cannot be an immigrant into the country which is his home. Whether at the time of his landing Australia was the respondent's home, is a question of fact ....

25 Isaacs J adopted a similar approach at 308 where his Honour observed:
 ... immigration connotes two facts -- the first, that there is an entry into Commonwealth territory; and the second, that the person entering is not in fact at the moment he enters one of the people of the Commonwealth. The ultimate fact to be reached as a test whether a given person is an immigrant or not is whether he is or is not at that time a constituent part of the community known as the Australian people.

31 The question of the absorption of a child into the Australian community was considered by the Full Court in Moore v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 161 FCR 236. At [49] the Full Court noted with apparent approval the following passage from the reasons for judgment of French J in Johnson v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 137 ; (2004) 136 FCR 494 at [45] - [46] :
 In relation to the question of absorption into the community French J said in Johnson at [45]-[46]: 
 
 
 
 '45 The general statements made about the concept of absorption offer little in the way of practical guidance for determining whether a person has become part of the community, either as an adult or as a minor who comes in with a family unit.

 46 Having regard to the primary question, factors relevant to whether a person has become a member of the Australian community in the way that that concept was discussed in Potter v Minahan might be thought to include the following:

<text>9 Nonetheless, under the Migration Act a person born in Papua after the commencement of the Citizenship Act required an entry permit to be entitled to enter or reside in any of the States or internal territories ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Ame [2005] HCA 36 ; (2005) 222 CLR 439 at [1] ). This was because Papua, as an external Territory, was not part of "Australia" for the purposes of the Migration Act ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Walsh [2002] FCAFC 205 ; (2002) 125 FCR 31 at [15] - [21] cited with approval in Ex parte Ame at [1]).

45 More significantly, in Ex parte Ame , in the majority judgment at [21], the High Court said of the proposition that the applicant in that case was a person who had a right of permanent residence in Australia within the meaning of s 65(4)(a) of the PNG Constitution :
 This is not an abstract or theoretical question. It concerns the meaning of words in an instrument of nationhood and government, dealing with a practical issue affecting the membership of the new Independent State. When the framers of the Papua New Guinea Constitution referred to persons who had a right to permanent residence in Australia, part of the contextual background in which that reference was made was an Australian immigration law which, according to its terms, and as it was administered, denied people such as the applicant a right to permanent residence in Australia in the absence of a specific grant. That background explains the terms of s 64(4).

46 At [22]-[23] in Ex part Ame their Honours stated:
 At the time [ie in 1975], s 6(1) of the Migration Act provided that an immigrant who entered Australia without an entry permit was a prohibited immigrant. ... A right of permanent residence (in practice, a right to re-enter Australia free of the constraints of s 6) could be acquired by a person who was granted a permanent entry permit (s 15). ... The [Migration] Act applied, and was administered on the basis that it applied, to persons entering mainland Australia from external Territories. ... ...The right to permanent residence referred to in s 65(4)(a) is the same as the right referred to in s 64(4)(b), that is to say, the right which a small number of Papuans had received by grant, not a right which all Papuans had by virtue of birth in the Territory of Papua at a time when it was an external Territory of Australia. ...

47 Regulation 4 of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship) Regulations (Cth) was plainly intended to allow the PNG Constitution to govern who became a citizen of Papua New Guinea on Independence Day. It provided, consistently with the PNG Constitution 's rejection in principle of dual citizenship, that a person who immediately before Independence Day was an Australian citizen and who became a citizen of Papua New Guinea on that day ceased on that day to be an Australian citizen. Subject to the retrospective, but for practical purposes, temporary, operation of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship of Young Persons) Regulations (Cth), the effect of reg 4 of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship) Regulations (Cth) was to deprive Mr Charlie of his Australian citizenship (see [15] above).

48 The contention that, as at Independence Day, Mr Charlie was a person who had a right of permanent residence in Australia within the meaning of s 65(4)(a) because he had the permission of the Darnley Island Council to reside on Darnley Island fails.

49 The above conclusion renders it unnecessary to determine whether Mr Charlie and his family were, for a period of time after his arrival on Darnley Island in 1975, prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Migration Act as then in force. Even if it can be assumed that they were prohibited immigrants, and therefore technically subject to removal, it is clear that the Commonwealth did not at that time seek to implement the relevant provisions of the Migration Act in respect of persons residing on Darnley Island.</text>

 ... the Constitution unites into a Federal Commonwealth the people of Australia. The entry into the Commonwealth of a person who at the moment of entering is already one of the people of Australia could hardly be described as an immigration into the Commonwealth; it would in truth be the return of an Australian to his homeland. ...

In The Queen v Forbes; ex parte Kwok Kwan Lee [1971] HCA 14 ; (1971) 124 CLR 168 at 172-173 Barwick CJ, with whom all other members of the High Court agreed, stated:

It scarce needs saying that a prohibited immigrant may not by any means become a member of the Australian community whilst he is a prohibited immigrant. By the very description he is not a person having any title to remain in the country. (citation omitted)

30 However, as no reliance was placed in argument on The Queen v Forbes or on Mr Charlie's status under the Migration Act at the time of his arrival on Darnley Island , I will not consider this issue further.</text>
