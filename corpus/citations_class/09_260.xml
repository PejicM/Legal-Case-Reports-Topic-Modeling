<tocase>Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 184 FLR 454</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/608.html</AustLII>
<text>The approach to assessing insolvency set out by Palmer J in Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 184 FLR 454 at [106] [108] is particularly instructive. Those paragraphs are set out below. They relate to the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act "), but are applicable to like considerations which arise under the bankruptcy legislation. 
 I think that I must approach the application of s 95A [of the Corporations Act ] with two considerations in mind. First, the words of s 95A must be construed as they stand, without addition or subtraction. Second, the law both before and after the enactment of s 95A is unequivocally and emphatically clear that insolvency is, first and last, a question of fact: 

...to be ascertained from a consideration of the company's financial position taken as a whole. In considering the company's financial position as a whole, the Court must have regard to commercial realities. Commercial realities will be relevant in considering what resources are available to the company to meet its liabilities as they fall due, whether resources other than cash are realisable by sale or borrowing upon security, and when such realisations are achievable... 
 
 Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd (in liq) v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2001] NSWSC 621 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 213 at 224 [2001] NSWSC 621 ; ; 164 FLR 430 (citations of authority omitted)... 

 
 The question of a company's solvency may arise retrospectively or prospectively. The question arises retrospectively where, for example, a liquidator is seeking to recover an unfair preference or to set aside an insolvent transaction so that the issue is solvency as at a date prior to the winding up. The question may arise prospectively where a company is sought to be wound up in insolvency and the company's ability to pay its debts must be determined not only by reference to debts payable as at the date of trial but also by reference to its ability to pay debts which will fall for payment some time in the near future. 

 
 Where the question is retrospective insolvency, the Court has the inestimable benefit of the wisdom of hindsight. One can see the whole picture, both before, as at and after the alleged date of insolvency. The Court will be able to see whether as at the alleged date of insolvency the company was, or was not, actually paying all of its debts as they fell due and whether it did, or did not, actually pay all those debts which, although not due as at the alleged date of insolvency, nevertheless became due at a time which, as a matter of commercial reality and common sense, had to be considered as at the date of insolvency. By reference to what actually happened, rather than to conflicting experts' opinions as to the implications of balance sheets, the court's task in assessing insolvency as at the alleged date should not be very difficult.

Transferring the matters referred to by Palmer J to their current context, the following propositions may be stated: The bankrupt's financial position must be considered as a whole, having regard to commercial realities. Resources available to the bankrupt, whether by cash or realisation of assets or by borrowing upon security, are to be taken into account. With hindsight, the bankrupt's ability to pay his debts as and when they fall due is to be assessed.</text>

<tocase>Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1907/78.html</AustLII>
<text>The cash flow test is not simply an assessment of the bankrupt's debts due and cash available to pay them on one day fixed in time, but involves a forward looking assessment of the bankrupt's ability to pay his debts as and when they fall due in the not distant future. Debts are not simply "debts 'then' payable, but...debts 'as they become due' &#8212; a phrase which looks to the future" (Griffiths CJ in Bank of Australasia v Hall [1907] HCA 78 ; (1907) 4 CLR 1514 at 1527).

The identification of the bankrupt's contingent and prospective liabilities as at 10 April 2002 and the extent to which they may be considered as part of his debts, at that time, is a crucial matter for determination. The weight of authority suggests that contingent or prospective liabilities may be included as part of a person's debts provided that there is a real likelihood of them being established.</text>

<tocase>Re Saebar; Official Receiver v Saebar (1971) 18 FLR 317</tocase>
<text>In Re Saebar; Official Receiver v Saebar (1971) 18 FLR 317 , Hoare J was concerned with the predecessor version of s 120. In that form, the exception currently found in s 120(3)(b) was found in s 120(2)(a). The exception provided that the transfer would not be void if the party claiming under the transfer could prove "that the settlor was, at the time of making the settlement, able to pay all his debts without the aid of the property comprised in the settlement". As in the current Act, "debt" was defined to include a liability.

In that case, the prospective liability at issue was a liability to pay damages for a personal injury, where judgment had not yet been entered. The question before Hoare J was whether a liability extended to contingent and prospective liabilities. His Honour held that a prospective liability should be taken into account in determining "all of the debts" of the settlor if, considering the whole of the circumstances, there is a real likelihood of the prospective liability becoming, in due course, an actual liability. According to Hoare J, prospective liabilities may be ignored if they are "purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being established" (at 322).

It should be noted that the test for insolvency at that time was a cash flow test which is the same test required by the current Act and the Corporations Act .

Justice Einfeld in Re Finney; Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Finney (1996) 35 ATR 259 endorsed the decision in Re Cao and also relied on the decisions in Re Saebar and Re Hyams in holding that contingent and prospective liabilities are relevant debts for the exercise of determining solvency pursuant to s 120 of the Act. At 270, Einfeld J said, "[i]t is clear law that a prospective liability for a debt should only be disregarded if it is purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being imposed".

In White Constructions (ACT) Pty Ltd (In Liq) v White [2004] NSWSC 71 ; (2004) 49 ACSR 220 , McDougall J distinguished the circumstances of the case before him from those of both Re Saebar and Re Hyams . White Constructions concerned the solvency of a company for the purposes of the Corporations Act and relying on the definition of solvency in s 95A of that Act. At [317], McDougall J said: 
 The decisions in Saebar and Hyams , and the decisions discussed in those cases, recognise that an unestablished (and unquantified) liability may be required to be taken into account for the purposes of the particular exercise propounded by the legislation. They do not show that a claim for unliquidated damages is a debt, let alone a debt that is due and payable. I therefore do not think that the decisions are of direct relevance to the issue of insolvency as it has been framed.

I am persuaded, having regard to the above analysis, that the proper view of the authorities on this question is that the principles enunciated in the early 1970s in Re Saebar and Re Hyams are still good law and should be applied, as they were in Re Finney . What debts, including contingent liabilities, did John Turner have?</text>

<text>In Re Hyams; Official Reciever v Hyams (1971) 19 FLR 232 , Gibbs J similarly held that when determining the debts of a settlor for the purposes of s 94(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth), contingent liabilities should be considered if there was a reasonable possibility that the settlor would have had to meet them at the time. That case dealt with a contingent liability arising from a guarantee and as such it was a liability that could be easily quantified. In any event, Gibbs J did not limit his relevant observations to cases so quantifiable.

<tocase>Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536</tocase>
<text>Justice Davies' judgment in Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536 provides an interesting analysis of the case law dealing with the inclusion of contingent liabilities in the assessment of insolvency for the purposes of s 120 of the Act. His Honour relied on this extract by Cotton LJ in Re Ridler; Ridler v Ridler (1882) 22 Ch.D. 74 at 82: 
 Then as to the point that the settler was not indebted, but only subject to a liability which might never become a debt. A man is not at liberty to take a sanguine view, but is bound to act upon a reasonable view of what is likely to happen. 

After discussing what his Honour called a "clear line of authorities", his Honour concluded that, "[i]n a determination of the issue whether the settler can pay 'all his debts', it is necessary to take account of contingent liabilities and, if necessary, to make a valuation" (at 6 7).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2006/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents rely on Box Valley Pty Ltd v Kidd [2006] NSWCA 26 as an answer to the authorities reviewed above. That judgment dealt with whether a contingent liability arising from a default clause in a forward sales contract before a default notice has been given constitutes a debt for the purposes of s 95A of the Corporations Act . The New South Wales Court of Appeal determined that it did not because it was an unliquidated claim for damages that was not yet quantified. At [14], Bryson JA said: "The word 'debt' is used in s 95A of the Corporations Act without any supporting definition. An entitlement to claim damages for breach of a contractual obligation to sell and deliver goods is not a debt within the ordinary meaning of that word." Section 95A of the Corporations Act defines solvency and insolvency in the same terms as ss 5(2) and (3) of the Act. In contrast to the Act, the Corporations Act does not define debt to include liability.</text>

<tocase>Law Society of Tasmania v Turner [2001] TASSC 129 ; (2001) 11 Tas R 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//tas/supreme_ct/2001/129.html</AustLII>
<text>It is contended by the applicant that PWB was contractually obliged to refund investors' monies within one month of the investor giving notice of its demand. Justice Crawford, as his Honour then was, made factual findings to this effect in Law Society of Tasmania v Turner [2001] TASSC 129 ; (2001) 11 Tas R 1 at [7] . Investors were provided by PWB with a "PWB Mortgage Register Information Sheet" and with a "Mortgage Investment Form" to sign. Though these forms appear to have changed slightly over time, they are, in all relevant respects, the same. The Information Sheet states that the terms of the investment are contained in the Investment Form and the Information Sheet. The Information Sheet contains a term, under the heading "Withdrawals" that "[o]ne month's notice is required for both partial and total withdrawal of funds".

The respondents contend for an interpretation of this term that is both contrary to the finding of Crawford J and contrary to the plain meaning of the document. They submit that, read in conjunction with another section of the Information Sheet which is headed 'Loan Advances' and states "[l]oan advances are interest only and repayable on demand. Capital repayments are accepted subject to notice", one should understand the 'Withdrawals' term to refer to the loans made by PWB to borrowers on behalf of the investors, not to funds invested with PWB and repayable by PWB.

I do not accept this submission. PWB was liable to investors for the repayment of their monies on one month's notice. Investors had a cause of action for breach of contract against PWB as at April 2002.

As at 10 April 2002, causes of action in breach of trust had accrued in investors. PWB was in a trust relationship with investors in the Fund. PWB was more than an agent, it was a trustee. Investors invested their funds with the Fund, not with a specific borrower. They were, amongst other things, entitled to be informed and kept up to date about the loans in which their money had been invested. PWB engaged in conduct that breached the trust arrangement constituted by the Fund between PWB and the investors. Judgment has not been entered in relation to these claims, but, in accordance with the authorities referred to above, I am satisfied that these claims as at 10 April 2002 were likely to become debts of the bankrupt. I base this finding on the following: PWB regularly substituted investor funds in defaulting loans without advising clients and without client consent. The bankrupt has conceded as much. Justice Crawford found at [37] of Law Society of Tasmania v Turner : 
[i]n my opinion a competent legal practitioner, paying proper regard to a practitioner's duty to investor clients, would have realised long before November 1998 that the firm's practice of substituting clients' funds into defaulting loans, without the authority of the clients, amounted to a breach of that duty.

It is unnecessary to quantify the equitable debts that these breaches of trust gave rise to in light of my finding in relation to the contractual right of investors to their funds. Quantifying the debts of the bankrupt resulting from the breaches of trust is not straightforward. On the evidence, it is in the realm of millions of dollars. Absent the debts of the bankrupt as a result of the breach of contract, I am satisfied the bankrupt would not have had the ability to meet the debts arising from claims in breach of trust. Law Society proceedings

On 19 December 2001, the Law Society of Tasmania applied to the Supreme Court of Tasmania for a declaration that PWB, the firm, was in fiduciary default (proceeding TASC M 377 of 2001). Mr Turner was not named as a respondent to this action because he was not a partner of the firm at that date. An order was made on 1 October 2002 that PWB was "in default". The Solicitors Trust paid $80,216.04 into the Court fund subsequent to that order. That amount increased to $195,601.74 by August 2004.</text>
