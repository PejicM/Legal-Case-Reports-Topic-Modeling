<tocase>Administration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Daera Guba [1973] PGHCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 353</tocase>
<text>37 First, as a general proposition, adjudication by an administrative tribunal is administrative in character and does not create an issue of estoppel : W J &amp; F Barnes Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1957] HCA 23 ; (1957) 96 CLR 294 at 315. And that general approach has been applied in respect of decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Midland Metal Overseas Limited v Comptroller-General of Customs (1991) 30 FCR 87. Hill J there observed at 97:
 
 Where, as occurred in the present case, the decision is remitted to the decision-maker for reconsideration, it is evident that the ultimate decision will be one not made by the tribunal, but by the decision-maker himself. But even where the tribunal substitutes its own decision for that of the original decision- maker, the tribunal in so doing is merely acting in an administrative capacity. Its decision is deemed for all purposes to be the decision of the decision-maker: s 43(6) of the AAT Act. To use the language of Rich and Dixon JJ in Jolly v FCT [1935] HCA 21 ; (1935) 53 CLR 206 at 214 referring to the taxation boards of review, but equally applicable to the tribunal, the tribunal is: "only another executive body in an administrative hierarchy".
 The tribunal's function, like that of the taxation boards of review which it, inter alia, replaced, is, to adapt the language of Kitto J in Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v FCT [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475 at 502, merely to do over again what the decision-maker himself did; not to give a decision which affects the legal situation of the person dissatisfied with the decision but to work out, as a step in administration what the tribunal considers that position to be.
 In relation to the taxation boards of review, Kitto J in W J &amp; F Barnes Pty Ltd v FCT [1957] HCA 23 ; (1957) 96 CLR 294 at 315, said: "The board's decision was not, of course, an adjudication; it was administrative in character, and could not create an issue- estoppel."
 The full court of this court in Commonwealth v Sciacca (1988) 78 ALR 279 ; 17 FCR 476 at 480 had no hesitation in saying: "A finding by an administrative tribunal will not give rise to an issue estoppel."
 

 
 
Hill J then went on to conclude (at 98) that the decision of the High Court in Administration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Daera Guba [1973] PGHCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 353 did not require any contrary conclusion. This decision has since been followed: Lilienthal v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2001] FCA 2 at [20] , 65 ALD 437 at 442 per Katz J.</text>

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>46 It is not considered necessary, however, to resolve any such discrepancies as may have emerged from the differing accounts; nor is it necessary to resolve whether the submissions advanced on behalf of Mr Godwin went beyond the Application filed in this Court, as supplemented by his Outline of Submissions . It is also unnecessary to resolve whether or not submissions which were sought to be advanced were not available to the Applicant by reason of questions not being put to the advocate which should have been put in accordance with the principles of Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 at 70 1 per Lord Herschell LC. For example, the advocate was never asked in cross-examination whether she had deliberately set out to obtain evidence to defeat the eligibility of the Applicant.

47 In the present case there is no basis for concluding -- as submitted on behalf of Mr Godwin -- that the delegate was " off on a frolic to disprove the Applicant's entitlement ". Such reliance as is sought to be placed, on behalf of Mr Godwin, upon the limited instructions given to the advocate in January 2007 does not support any conclusion that the advocate was conducting any review of historical records which was not within the ambit of her instructions. And, even if the solicitor's account of the conversations with the advocate prevail, those conversations do not support any conclusion that there had been an unreasonable exercise of power or an exercise of power in bad faith.

48 On behalf of Mr Godwin it is further contended that the Commission:
 
 ... has, by its decision dated 10 September 2007, decreased the rate of the applicant's pension, relying on section 31(6). In doing so, the Respondent has failed to comply with the provisions of section 31(12) and section 178(1) which prohibits the Respondent from such action within six months of a decision by the Tribunal in respect of the rate of pension. The Tribunal decided the rate of pension for the Applicant on 28 August 2007, less than two weeks before the Respondent's decision.

49 Section 31(12) of the 1986 Act provides as follows: 
 
 This section applies to and in relation to a decision made before or after the commencement of this section but does not apply to or in relation to a decision of the Board referred to in subsection 154(1), or a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal referred to in subsection 178(1), that is binding on the Commission by reason that the period specified in that subsection has not expired.
 

And s 178(1) provides as follows:
 
 Period of operation of certain decisions of Administrative Appeals Tribunal 
 (1) Where, on a review of a reviewable decision, the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal expressly, or in effect:
 (a) assesses a rate of pension or increased rate of pension;
 (b) refuses to grant a pension, on the ground that the extent of the incapacity of the veteran was insufficient to justify the grant of such a pension;
 (c) refuses to increase the rate of a pension; or
 (d) reduces the rate of a pension;
 that decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal shall, subject to subsection (2), be binding on the parties to the proceedings before that Tribunal for a period of 6 months commencing on the day on which that Tribunal makes the decision.

50 The Tribunal on 28 August 2007 concluded that Mr Godwin was entitled to receive a pension at the special rate with effect from 5 May 2005. Pursuant to s 178(1), that decision was " binding ... for a period of 6 months " as from 28 August 2007.

51 The delegate when conducting his s 31 review concluded that:
 
 ... Pension is ... assessed at 10% of the general rate with effect from 2 August 2000.
 
The Tribunal's decision said nothing as to the period prior to 5 May 2005 and s 178(1) has no application to that prior period.

52 Nor did the delegate's decision purport to diminish the effect otherwise given to the decision of the Tribunal pursuant to s 178(1). In any event, the six month period referred to in s 178(1) has expired. The decision of the delegate, it should further be noted, has previously been stayed by an order of this Court.

53 Accordingly, no breach of s 178 has been established.

54 A final submission advanced on behalf of the Commission need not be finally resolved.</text>

<tocase>Davis v Repatriation Commission (1997) 74 FCR 577</tocase>
<text>18 The construction of s 31(4) urged by Mr Godwin was also said to be implicitly supported by the administrative decision-making hierarchy proceeding from the Commission, thereafter to the Board, and finally to the Tribunal. It was understood that the submission advanced was that s 31(4) was to be confined to the initial repository of decision-making authority and not to be extended to decisions which had been exposed to further administrative review. Albeit in the context of s 31(6), the same argument has been rejected: Davis v Repatriation Commission (1997) 74 FCR 577. Sundberg J there observed:
 
 The applicant's alternative argument took as its starting point the hierarchy of decision-making established by the Act. The hierarchy consists of the Commission as primary decision-maker, the Board as the second tier decision-maker, and the AAT as the third tier decision-maker and ultimate forum of merits review. It was said that the review mechanisms provided by s135 and s175 were intended to result in the final disposition of claims. It was submitted that while the word "matter" standing alone would receive a wide construction, in the context of the review provisions as a whole it must be limited to a degree which is necessary to achieve finality in the disposition of claims. If s31(6) is not limited in this manner, the Commission could review decisions of the Board or the Tribunal again and again on any pretext in defiance of the review hierarchy. The limitation contended for was not more precisely formulated than this, but was said to lead to the conclusion that a medical report which merely repeats and endorses the conclusions in other reports based on documented observations, and which contains no new observation, fact, cause, circumstance, information, opinion or contention, is not capable of being a matter which was not before the Board when the decision to grant the pension was made. It was accepted that a medical report which was brought into existence to take into account some change in the facts and circumstances, or facts or circumstances not previously disclosed, might be in a different position.
 I see no reason to limit the ordinary meaning of the words "any matter that affects the payment of a pension ..., being a matter that was not before the ... Board ... when the decision to grant the pension ... was made" in the manner contended for. The "hierarchy" argument, which purports to be based on the structure of the review provisions of the Act, ignores the fact that s31 itself contains no less than seven exceptions to the simple three tier structure on which the submission is based. Far from supporting the contention that s31(6) would, unless narrowed, permit the Commission to review decisions of the Board or Tribunal in defiance of the review hierarchy, a reading of the relevant parts of the Act as a whole shows that the three tier review structure contended for is simplistic. Not only does s31 provide a number of additional grounds of review, but decisions made pursuant to the section are themselves subject to review under s135(3).
 ...
 The fact that s31(6) may be open to abuse (repeated reviews on any pretext), does not in my view require it to be read down. A capricious or unreasonable exercise of the power will be susceptible to review under s5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act .
 

For present purposes there is not considered to be any relevant distinction as between s 31(4) and s 31(6).

19 The alternative submission advanced on behalf of s 31(4) should also be rejected. This alternative argument assumed that s 31(4) did confer a power upon the Commission to undertake a review -- even after a Tribunal decision -- but contended that there was no power to do so in the present proceedings because there was no evidence which was " false in a material particular ". " False ", it was contended, should be interpreted as meaning " deliberately untruthful ".

20 There are at least two difficulties in acceding to this alternative submission.

27 The Applicant concedes that the power conferred by s 31(6) may be exercised after there has been a review by the Tribunal. Given both the terms of s 31(6) and the decision of Sundberg J in Davis , that concession was quite properly made.

28 The Applicant, however, contends that there is in the present proceedings no " matter " which was not before the Tribunal. Reliance is placed upon the following observations of Sundberg J in Davis :
 
 ... The power in s31(6)(a) is available to the Commission only if it is satisfied of the existence of a matter that affects the payment of a pension and which was not before the decision-maker. If the " new material " is no more than a repetition of material that was before the decision-maker, it would not be reasonably open to the Commission to be relevantly satisfied that the material " affects the payment of a pension ".

29 The Applicant has variously identified the " matter ". It is understood that the " matter ", as defined by the Applicant, was whether or not the sampan incident occurred. The contention sought to be advanced is that the material relied upon by the delegate was, presumably, " a repetition of material that was before the decision-maker ".

30 It is considered that this submission should also be rejected for at least two reasons.

31 First, the term " matter " can include new evidence relevant to the manner in which the prior decision was made. Section 31(6)(a) has not been construed, and should not be construed, as precluding an exercise of the power of review where new evidence or other material becomes available which has not previously been considered. And it may not matter that that new material was available even at the time when the Tribunal made its decision. Thus, Sundberg J went on to conclude in Davis as follows:
 
 It was also submitted for Mrs Davis that because Professor Cade's report had been received in time for it to be used by the Commission in support of an application for review of the Board's decision by the AAT, it could not found an exercise of the Commission's power to review the Board's decision under s31(6)(a). A variation of this argument was that the Commission, having had a reasonable opportunity to put Professor Cade's report before the AAT, had not done so, and so was not able to use the report to found an exercise of power under s31(6). These assertions were not developed in argument, and in my view they have no substance. If material becomes available after the relevant decision is made, and it affects the payment of a pension, the power in s31(6)(a) is available to the Commission. It is simply irrelevant that it becomes available at a time when the Commission might seek a review by the AAT. The Commission may engage in conduct which disables it from taking a particular course, but in the absence of any such conduct, it can pursue whichever avenue it chooses. The second argument advanced has overtones of estoppel without any factual basis to support the estoppel.
 

Further, in Repatriation Commission v Richardson [2001] FCA 1626 at [15] [18], [2001] FCA 1626 ; 115 FCR 220 Dowsett J concluded that it was open to the Commission pursuant to s 31(6) to have regard to material of which it was ignorant at the time the original decision was made to grant a pension.

32 Section 31(6) should not be construed as excluding from the term " matter " new evidence, albeit evidence in relation to an area of factual dispute previously resolved. In Davis, it may be noted, the new evidence which satisfied the requirements of s 31(6)(a) was a medical report which " contained an expression of opinion from a highly qualified medical specialist, based on contemporary clinical and laboratory evidence, that persuasively identified the cause of death to the exclusion of other possible causes ".

33 Second, there is the same difficulty as confronted the Applicant with respect to s 31(4), namely that the power conferred by s 31(6) is a power vested in the Commission if it is "satisfied " of the matters there set forth. The contents of the 2007 report provided a basis for reaching that state of " satisfaction ".

34 Section 31(6) was thus also a basis for review open to the delegate.</text>

<tocase>Hanna v Australian Postal Corporation [1990] FCA 153 ; (1990) 12 AAR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1990/153.html</AustLII>
<text>16 The argument, however, ignores the effect given to a decision of the Tribunal. Section 43(6) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) provides as follows:
 
 A decision of a person as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision made by the Tribunal in substitution for the decision of a person, shall, for all purposes (other than the purposes of applications to the Tribunal for a review or of appeals in accordance with section 44) , be deemed to be a decision of that person and, upon the coming into operation of the decision of the Tribunal, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect, or shall be deemed to have had effect, on and from the day on which the decision under review has or had effect.
 

In the present context, a decision of the Tribunal is deemed to be a decision of the Commission " for all purposes ". Where there has been a decision of the Commission which has been reviewed by the Tribunal, as in the present proceedings, the subsequent decision of the Tribunal is nevertheless " deemed " to be a decision of the Commission. Section 31(4) , it is considered, thus includes both a decision of the Commission and a decision of the Commission as altered, varied or affirmed. The effect of s 43(6) of the 1975 Act cannot be confined to simply identifying the date from which a decision of the Tribunal is to take effect. To so construe s 43(6) is to give effect only to the latter part of the provision and is to ignore the " deeming " effect given to a Tribunal decision. To conclude that the power of review vested in " the Commission " by s 31(4) could not be exercised after review by the Tribunal would be to construe s 31(4) as excluding a power of review where there has been a decision which is deemed to be a decision of the Commission itself and deemed to be a decision of the Commission " for all purposes ". A construction of a statutory provision which permits further administrative reconsideration subsequent to a Tribunal decision is not surprising: see, eg, Hanna v Australian Postal Corporation [1990] FCA 153 ; (1990) 12 AAR 511.

17 Irrespective of s 43(6) of the 1975 Act, however, it is further considered that the contrast in language relied upon by Mr Godwin as between s 31(4) and s 31(6) is misplaced. All that the language employed in s 31(6) prescribes are those circumstances in which the Commission may exercise the power there conferred. It may exercise those powers where it is " satisfied " that there is a " matter " that was not before any of the decision-making stages, be the decision one made by the Commission, the Board or the Tribunal. Such a provision provides little if any basis for confining the ambit of the power conferred by s 31(4). The difference in language as between s 34(4) and s 34(6) is not considered to be a sufficient basis to construe s 31(4) as imposing any constraint other than the one prescribed by the legislature, namely that the Commission be satisfied that evidence was " false in a material particular ".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>21 First, the task of determining whether there was evidence which was " false in a material particular " is not a task entrusted to this Court; it is a task entrusted by the Commonwealth legislature to the Commission. Section 31(4) thus confers the power of review where " the Commission is satisfied that evidence before [it] when it made a decision was false in a material particular ". Where a discretionary power is vested in the Commission in such terms, it matters not that others may have reached a different decision and may have done so reasonably, provided that there was some probative material available to support the decision in fact taken by the Commission: cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 at [45] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, [147] per Gummow J, [1999] HCA 21 ; 197 CLR 611.</text>

<text>22 Second, there was indeed material available to the Commission upon which it could reach the state of satisfaction that evidence previously before it was " false in a material particular ".

 Where, as occurred in the present case, the decision is remitted to the decision-maker for reconsideration, it is evident that the ultimate decision will be one not made by the tribunal, but by the decision-maker himself. But even where the tribunal substitutes its own decision for that of the original decision- maker, the tribunal in so doing is merely acting in an administrative capacity. Its decision is deemed for all purposes to be the decision of the decision-maker: s 43(6) of the AAT Act. To use the language of Rich and Dixon JJ in Jolly v FCT [1935] HCA 21 ; (1935) 53 CLR 206 at 214 referring to the taxation boards of review, but equally applicable to the tribunal, the tribunal is: "only another executive body in an administrative hierarchy".
 The tribunal's function, like that of the taxation boards of review which it, inter alia, replaced, is, to adapt the language of Kitto J in Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v FCT [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475 at 502, merely to do over again what the decision-maker himself did; not to give a decision which affects the legal situation of the person dissatisfied with the decision but to work out, as a step in administration what the tribunal considers that position to be.
 In relation to the taxation boards of review, Kitto J in W J &amp; F Barnes Pty Ltd v FCT [1957] HCA 23 ; (1957) 96 CLR 294 at 315, said: "The board's decision was not, of course, an adjudication; it was administrative in character, and could not create an issue- estoppel."
 The full court of this court in Commonwealth v Sciacca (1988) 78 ALR 279 ; 17 FCR 476 at 480 had no hesitation in saying: "A finding by an administrative tribunal will not give rise to an issue estoppel."
 

 
 
Hill J then went on to conclude (at 98) that the decision of the High Court in Administration of the Territory of Papua New Guinea v Daera Guba [1973] PGHCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 353 did not require any contrary conclusion. This decision has since been followed: Lilienthal v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2001] FCA 2 at [20] , 65 ALD 437 at 442 per Katz J.</text>
