<text>13 The first part of the submission was common ground, at least as a matter of words. See Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 44 FCR 450 at 472, Commissioner of Taxation v Chubb Australia Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 557 at 559 and Clean Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2001] FCA 80 ; (2001) 105 FCR 248 at [91] . However the parties differed as to what was entailed in the single composite question, and in particular as to the second part of Cascade's submission.

17 Cascade also sought to derive support from Clean Investments , which concerned a concession for goods "of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes". What was in question was coin operated washing machines. Lindgren J, with whom Lee and Cooper JJ agreed, said at [91]-[93]:
 
 "I respectfully agree with Hill J in Diethelm (at 472) ... that it is preferable to pose the statutory question as a single composite question. 
 
 In some cases it may be misleading to address separately the question of identification of the 'genus' to which the particular goods in question belong, and the question whether that genus meets the description 'ordinarily used for household purposes'. The problem can be indicated by the question 'What kind of kind of goods is the Item speaking of?' Answering the genus question separately as a threshold one will assume, without making explicit, an answer to this question. 
 
 Goods and purposes can be equally correctly described in different ways, in particular, broadly or narrowly, yet the description selected may dictate the answer to the statutory question. For example, an architect's stool, an office chair and a kitchen stool or chair may be described as 'stools' or 'chairs' and their purpose as being 'to provide seating'. Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the architect's stool or the office chair is of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes for no other reason than that, like the kitchen chair, it is ordinarily used for the purpose of providing seating." 
 

(Emphasis in original.)

21 Nor do I think the passage in Clean Investments relied on by Cascade (set out at [17]) discloses any departure from Hygienic Lily . After an elaborate examination of the earlier cases, especially Hygienic Lily (which had not been drawn to the primary judge's attention), Lindgren J distilled the propositions he derived from them. The one preceding the proposition set out at [17] is:
 
 "The statutory question is not whether those goods of the taxpayer will in fact be used for household purposes but whether they are goods 'of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes' (Chubb per Hill J (with whom Tamberlin J agreed) at 571; Diethelm per Hill J at 470)." 
 

Further, in the second paragraph set out at [17] his Honour identified the existence of two questions. He was not saying there was not two questions, but that in some cases it may be misleading to address them separately.</text>

<tocase>Air International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2002] FCA 355 ; (2002) 121 FCR 149</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/355.html</AustLII>
<text>16 In support of the submission at [14] Cascade placed reliance on the observations of Tamberlin J, with whom O'Loughlin J agreed, in Air International Pty Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of Customs [2002] FCA 355 ; (2002) 121 FCR 149 at [53] . Speaking of the words pumps and compressors "of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles", his Honour said:
 
 "It is helpful to look at actual use, if any, when deciding whether goods are of a kind used as replacement components. Where they are so used, then that points to a conclusion that they are 'of a kind' so used. The words 'of a kind' add a further level of generality to the expression 'used' so that even if (to use the Tribunal's expression) the goods are not so used but are within a range of goods of a type which are used, then they satisfy the required description." 
 

This treats the words "of a kind" in item 13 as words of expansion rather than limitation. Air International is a "use" and not a "marketed as" case. However it was said there was no reason why that should make the above passage inapplicable to item 13.

19 In Air International Hill J, dissenting, quoted with approval the decision of the Court of Appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 305, to which Gummow J had referred in Hygienic Lily . The question in the English case was whether couplings and winches were to be classified for value added tax purposes as "Goods of a kind suitable for use as parts of goods within item 1 or item 5". Hill J said at [28]:
 
 "Brown LJ held that the words 'goods of a kind' referred to some class or category or genus of goods which had characteristics in common. That holding is generally consistent with the Australian sales tax cases referred to in Clean Investments." 
 

Hill J then quoted with approval this passage from Megaw LJ's judgment (at 316-317):
 
 "It is not 'the goods' the particular articles, here the couplings and the winch which have to be suitable for use as parts. It is the kind of goods to which these particular articles belong, their genus, which has to be thus suitable. The addition of 'of a kind', would be meaningless if goods which are themselves suitable are necessarily also goods of a kind which is suitable. The question is, first, what is the relevant 'kind of goods' of which they are members; and, secondly, is that kind of goods generically, suitable for use as parts of the goods comprised in items 1 and 5 of Group 3."

20 I doubt that there is any real difference between the cases upon which the parties based their respective approaches to the construction of item 13. In Air International , before the passage set out at [16], Tamberlin J quoted at [47] from Hygienic Lily the passage appearing at [18], introducing it at [46]-[47] with the words:
 
 "In answering the question [whether the fans etc are goods 'of a kind used as replacement components'], it is necessary to construe the quoted expression as a whole. The intent or purpose of the manufacturer or importer is not the criterion to be applied. Nor is it necessary that the goods should in fact have been used or be used as replacement components. It is sufficient if they are 'of a kind' which can be so used. That is to say, if they come within the genus of 'goods used as replacement components'. 
 
 In order to determine whether the goods are within that genus, it is necessary to examine the 'nature quality and adaptation of the goods in the class': see Gummow J in Hygienic Lily ...." 
 

When Tamberlin J went on to say, in the passage relied on by Cascade (set out at [16]), that it is helpful to look at actual use when deciding whether goods are 'of a kind' used in a particular way, because when they are so used, that points to a conclusion that they are 'of a kind' so used, his Honour was not, in my view, intending to depart from the approach mandated by the words of item 13 or that appearing in Hygienic Lily . He was simply saying that the answer to whether goods are of a kind used in a particular way may, depending on the circumstances, be assisted by looking at how they have in fact been used.

61 It will be apparent from what I have said at [46] to [60] that I have initially approached the "of a kind" issue in accordance with Cascade's submission recorded at [14]. The submission derives support from what two members of the Full Court said in Air International . See [16]. On this approach Ultra-C was not principally marketed, in the sense of mainly, chiefly, predominantly or preponderantly, as food for infants, giving that word the meaning appearing at [34].

62 Obviously Cascade's "of a kind" formulation is more advantageous to it than the Commissioner's, because it focuses on its own marketing of Ultra-C. On the Commissioner's approach, Cascade's case more clearly fails. The genus to which Ultra-C belongs is in my view either cordials or blackcurrant concentrated syrups, including in either case Ribena and Bickford's. That group of products does not fall within item 13 (findings (p), (q) and (r)). Accordingly, nor does Ultra-C. If, contrary to my view, Cascade's fall-back genus submission is sound namely that Ultra-C is a genus of its own its case fails because of what I have said at [61].

63 On the approach I have suggested at [22], Cascade's marketing of Ultra-C shows that the product is not of a kind marketed principally as food for infants.</text>

<tocase>Hygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396</tocase>
<text>18 The Commissioner sought to derive support for his contention from Hygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396. The question there was whether waxed paper cups used by McDonald's Restaurants were "goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes". Gummow J at 399 said:
 
 "the setting in which the phrase 'goods of a kind' appears suggests it is directed not to the use for which the particular goods in question were designed or manufactured, nor to the purpose to which it is intended these particular goods shall be put, but rather to the nature, quality and adaptation of goods in the class or genus in question. Thus, goods are 'of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes' if they are to be recognised as members of a class or genus which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) is used for household purposes; cf Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd (1979) 1 WLR 305, at 312-313, 315, 316-317." 
 

At 400 his Honour pointed out that other items in the Schedule there in question directed attention not to goods identified by the purposes for which goods of that kind are ordinarily used, but to the goods in question themselves or to the identity or character of a particular user. He concluded that the cups were of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes because they were "members of a class or genus (paper cups) which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) was used for household purposes (viz the carrying of beverages and the consumption thereof)".

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 68 FCR 566</tocase>
<text>27 It was common ground that the word "infants" in item 13 is to be given its ordinary meaning. That meaning is to be determined by considering the word in its context with the assistance of dictionaries and other books, and not by expert evidence: Telstra Corporation Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 68 FCR 566 at 570.

28 Cascade's submission is that in item 13 the ordinary meaning of infant includes any child up to seven years of age. It relies on several dictionary definitions. Australian Oxford :
 
 "1 a. a child during the earliest period of its life. b. a schoolchild in the first years of school." 
 

 The Oxford English Dictionary :
 
 
 "1 a. A child during the earliest period of life (or still unborn); now most usually applied to a child in arms, a babe; but often extended to include any child under seven years of age." 
 

 The Penguin Pocket Dictionary :
 
 
 "1. in an early stage of development. 2. concerned with or intended for young children, esp those aged 5 to 7 or 8."

29 Cascade also relies on Macquarie's definition of "'infants' school":
 
 "a school, or classes attached to a primary school, for children from about five to eight years of age. Also, 'infant school'."

37 At least implicitly Cascade characterises the meaning I prefer as a narrow construction. It relies on cases which it says establishes that the classification of goods attracting exemptions (eg for sales tax purposes) should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrow construction: Diethelm at 464; Telstra at 569; IGY Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 544 at [14]. In Diethelm at 464 French J said:
 
 "Classifications of goods attracting exemptions or beneficial rates should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrow construction."</text>

38 Totalizator Agency Board v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 69 FCR 311 concerned a sales tax exemption (item 126) for "goods for use by ... an authority that is completely controlled by an Australian government ...". After referring to the passage from Diethelm set out at [37], and a line of cases French J "may well [have] had in mind", Hill J, with whom Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ agreed, said at 322-323:
 
 "Not all of the cases referred to can necessarily be taken as endorsing the proposition.... But be that as it may, the passages cited all stand for the following unexceptionable proposition. Where Parliament has enacted legislation to encourage a particular activity, for example legislation which gives particular concessions to the mining industry, the legislation must be construed so as to promote Parliament's purpose and not so as to detract from that purpose. 
 
 Some items contained in Schedule 1 to the Exemptions and Classifications Act may fall within this rule in that the government has granted exemptions from sales tax in the course of seeking to encourage a specific industry.... But it can hardly be said that an item such as Item 126 is there to encourage any particular activity so that a construction should be given to it consonant with its purpose to promote that activity. Item 126 merely confers exemptions upon a particular kind of body, namely an Australian government or a statutory authority meeting certain tests. Parliament's purpose was to exempt from sales tax goods for use by these bodies. But Parliament's purpose is promoted by construing the exemption item in accordance with its ordinary meaning, not by seeking to give it a particular meaning favourable to the government or authority referred to in it. In my view, there is no general principle of construction that requires items in the Exemptions and Classifications Act to be given a benevolent interpretation in favour of persons or bodies referred to in the Schedule. Rather, each of the items is to be given its ordinary meaning in accordance with ordinary principles of interpretation, save where it is clear that the purpose of the government providing an exemption was to afford encouragement to a particular industry or activity." 
 

His Honour then referred to a passage in Diethelm at 457, in which French J "recognised the significance of the purpose of the relevant exempting item in applying this principle".</text>

Rather, each of the items is to be given its ordinary meaning in accordance with ordinary principles of interpretation, save where it is clear that the purpose of the government providing an exemption was to afford encouragement to a particular industry or activity." 
 

His Honour then referred to a passage in Diethelm at 457, in which French J "recognised the significance of the purpose of the relevant exempting item in applying this principle".

39 Cascade contends that unlike the exemption in Totalizator , item 13 is not directed at a particular body or person, but provides an exemption from GST to particular beverages which are marketed principally as food for infants. It should therefore be implied that item 13 is intended to protect those products, so that the liberal construction principle should apply.

40 The reason for the qualified exemption of food from GST is well known, and was common ground. It was the political compromise reached in order that the GST scheme might become law. The distinction drawn in Totalizator between an exemption directed at a particular person or body and one that encourages a particular activity is applicable here. It is true, as Cascade says, that item 13 is not directed at a particular person or body. But nor is it concerned to encourage any particular activity. It is not intended to encourage the production of beverages or ingredients of any kind. It was the result of a political deal that gave partial exemption to food. In the case of the beverage component of food, the result was that the beverage or an ingredient therefore would be exempt if it was of a kind marketed principally as food for infants or invalids. In accordance with Totalizator , there is no occasion to approach the meaning of "infant" or "invalids" in any manner other than by according the words their ordinary meaning.

41 Cascade pointed out that item 68 of Sch 1 to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 exempted food for human consumption. Beverages were excluded from the exemption except for, amongst others:
 
 "(b) ... 
 
 
 
 (i) beverages of a kind marketed principally as food for infants or invalids; 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (c) goods of a kind marketed principally as ingredients for beverages covered by paragraph (b)."

42 Cascade also relied on the exemption in item 149 of, inter alia, "booster seats ... designed for use exclusively for carrying infants". In this connection it drew attention to Victorian Sales Tax Office Ruling No 2543:
 
 "We had some doubts whether the booster seats are designed for use in carrying infants or older children but in view of the broad dictionary meaning of infant eg children under seven years of age, this condition is considered to be satisfied."</text>
