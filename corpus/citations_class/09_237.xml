<tocase>Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores Holdings Ltd [1998] AC 1</tocase>
<text>A generation later, in Co-Operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores Holdings Ltd [1998] AC 1 at 14, Lord Hoffman, with whom the other members of the House agreed, in the course of a speech which contains much detailed reflection on the subject of considerations relevant to the granting of mandatory injunctions, referred to that passage from Lord Upjohn's speech and stated: 
 Precision is of course a question of degree and the courts have shown themselves willing to cope with a certain degree of imprecision in cases of orders requiring the achievement of a result in which the plaintiff's merits appeared strong; like all the reasons which I have been discussing, it is, taken alone, merely a discretionary matter to be taken into account: see Spry on Equitable Remedies (4th ed.) at p. 112. It is, however, a very important one.

It is not at this interlocutory stage possible to determine whether the merits of the Conservation Council's case are strong and the extent to which, as a matter of discretion, that should influence the framing of any injunctive relief.

In conferring the jurisdiction under s 475 to grant mandatory injunctive relief Parliament has envisaged an exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a court that is one of law and equity. Where a contravention is proved, the granting of a mandatory injunction requires the exercise of a judicial discretion. However, the jurisdiction is statutory, not an incident of the general law of equity.</text>

<tocase>Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/70.html</AustLII>
<text>In Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664 Murphy, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ jointly observed: 
 Pleadings and particulars have a number of functions: they furnish a statement of the case sufficiently clear to allow the other party a fair opportunity to meet it ( Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v. Mount Oxide Mines Ltd. (In liq.) [1916] HCA 81 ; (1916) 22 CLR 490 , at p 517; they define the issues for decision in the litigation and thereby enable the relevance and admissibility of evidence to be determined at the trial ( Miller v. Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572 , at pp 576-577; and they give a defendant an understanding of a plaintiff's claim in aid of the defendant's right to make a payment into court. Apart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issues chosen at the trial, the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings ( Gould and Birbeck and Bacon (1916) 22 CLR, at pp 517, 518 ; Sri Mahant Govind Rao v. Sita Ram Kesho (1898) LR 25 Ind App 195, at p 207 ). But where there is no departure during the trial from the pleaded cause of action, a disconformity between the evidence and particulars earlier furnished will not disentitle a party to a verdict based upon the evidence. Particulars may be amended after the evidence in a trial has closed ( Mummery v. Irvings Pty. Ltd. [1956] HCA 45 ; (1956) 96 CLR 99 , at pp 111, 112, 127), though a failure to amend particulars to accord precisely with the facts which have emerged in the course of evidence does not necessarily preclude a plaintiff from seeking a verdict on the cause of action alleged in reliance upon the facts actually established by the evidence ( Leotta v. Public Transport Commission (N.S.W.) (1976) 9 ALR 437 , at p 446; 50 ALJR 666 , at p 668).

Burnett Water is concerned not to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on the issues so identified. To that end, in November last year it requested the Conservation Council to furnish particulars of the statement of claim. The Conservation Council answered that request but not in a way which Burnett Water submits was sufficient.

That the Court has power to order the furnishing of further and better particulars of a statement of claim is not in doubt. Order 12 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules confers such power. The question is whether in the circumstances that power should be exercised or whether Burnett Water has sought to play what was memorably described in the 12 th (1975) Edition of Bullen &amp; Leake and Jacob's Precedents of Pleadings (at 113-114) as "the particulars game"? The observations then made by the learned authors concerning particulars and that "game" remain true today: 
 The tendency of modern practice is to give full particulars as may be necessary of the matters pleaded, and to respond to a request for further and better particulars of pleading more fully than heretofore. There is a growing understanding among practitioners that giving the necessary particulars of pleading not only helps in preparing a case and in stating it with certainty and confidence but also manifests the strength of a party's case, while withholding particulars suggests a possible weakness in the case and a desire to spring surprise as to the oral evidence at the trial. On the other hand, practitioners are also aware, from their knowledge and experience, that particulars of pleadings beyond those that are really necessary may fetter the hands of a party too closely, or lay on him an increased burden of proof, or may disclose more than is tactically wise of his case at that stage. Hence there quite often develops a struggle, which goes under the popular title of the "particulars game," under which one party seeks to compel the opposite party to reveal more fully the case which he has pleaded and to tie him down to narrower issues, whereas the opposite party seeks to keep the issues as wide and as general as possible and to withhold as much of his own case as he can.

<text>As Burnett Water correctly notes in its submissions, there is ample authority to support the striking out of a pleading of this kind on a strict application of a pleading rule such as O 11 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules : H 1976 Nominees v Galli [1979] FCA 74 ; (1979) 30 ALR 181 at 186-187; Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-115 and McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 418, [23] . Particulars are not a substitute for the allegation of material facts: H 1976 Nominees v Galli [1979] FCA 74 ; (1979) 30 ALR 181 at 186-187. Equally though, as Burnett Water fairly concedes, there is a discernable tendency in modern times against striking out when a pleading even with such a technical fault can be seen fairly to convey when read as a whole, including its so-called particulars, the case which a respondent has to answer: Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd (1999) ATPR 41-691 at 42,827-9.</text>

<tocase>Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/116.html</AustLII>
<text>There are features of the jurisdiction so conferred which set aside considerations which might, under the general law of equity, dispose a court not to grant injunctive relief at all. Thus, s 479(2) provides: 
 Mandatory injunctions 
 (2) The Federal Court may grant an injunction requiring a person to do
 a particular act or thing:
 (a) whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do the act or thing; and
 (b) whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to
 do the act or thing; and
 (c) whether or not there is a significant risk of injury or damage to human beings or the environment if the person refuses or fails, or continues to refuse or fail, to do the act or thing. 

 
In light of this provision Parliament must be taken to have considered that there were public interests arising from the objects of the EPBC Act in the case of, materially, a proved contravention of a condition of an approval for the taking of an "action" which, in particular cases, would transcend the considerations referred to in s 479(2) and, notwithstanding those considerations, warrant the granting of a mandatory injunction. As Black CJ and Finkelstein J reminded in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at 431, [18] , s 475 of the EPBC Act makes provision for a remedy of a kind that has come to be known as a public interest injunction.</text>

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/474.html</AustLII>
<text>In this regard, the EPBC Act is not unique. It is an analogue of s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 . Observations made by the members of the Full Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 are pertinent. Materially, in that case, the following observations, presently pertinent by analogy, were made in relation to the framing of injunctive relief: 
Mr Justice Lockhart, French J agreeing, stated, at 259-260:
 
 Plainly injunctions should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction. Contempt proceedings are not appropriate for the determination of questions of construction of the injunction or the aptness of the language in which they are framed: see Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited [1985] FCA 389 ; (1985) 7 FCR 495 ; Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Pty Limited (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-414; and Commodore Business Machines Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 92 ALR 563. 

 
 Decisions under the Act have applied these principles and the judgments refer to the dangers of orders being cast in broad terms which "train the heavy guns of the law upon the respondent" ( Glo Juice at 418) without giving him adequate guidance. 

 
 As Toohey J. observed in Maclean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Limited (1984) 2 FCR 593 (at 599): 

 
 "Any injunction granted should be in such terms that is reasonably capable of being obeyed. ... (The order sought) would create uncertainty and place the respondent in a position where it would not know with any precision what was required of it. It follows that, faced with an application to enforce such an injunction, the court would be in an equally difficult position." 

 
 See also Trade Practices Commission v Walplan Pty Limited . 

 
 In Commodore a Full Court of this Court said at 574: 

 
 "The injunction sought in the application was in the following terms: 'An injunction restraining (Commodore) from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of the supply of Amiga computers (as defined in the statement of claim) supplied by ( Commodore ).'
 An injunction in that form might be suggested by the relief granted by the Commonwealth Industrial Court in Festival Stores v Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 69 ; (1971) 18 FLR 260. On appeal, reported [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 631-2, Barwick C.J. rejected an attack on the propriety of an order which enjoined a wholesaler 'from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance in respect of tableware marketed ... under the trade name 'Mikasa'.' 

 
 Nevertheless, such an injunction as that sought by the Commission in this case would have been open to the objection that it was of an undesirable width because, in respect of the supply of Amiga computers, it did no more than reproduce, but this time with the risk of sanctions for contempt, that which the Act in terms forbade by s 48. Any practice of awarding injunctions in such a form is to be discouraged. Such injunctions conflict with the general precept, applicable to the exercise of power under s 80 of the Act as much as to the framing of injunctions in aid of legal and equitable rights, that a final injunction should bear upon the case alleged and proved against the defendant, and should indicate that conduct which is enjoined or commanded to be performed, so that the defendant knows what is expected of him as a matter of fact. Further, where the injunction is in the form of an interlocutory order, it is undesirable to frame the injunction in such a way as to leave the issues in the case open for determination on a contempt proceeding, rather than at a final hearing: see generally Epitoma Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union [1984] FCA 202 ; (1984) 3 FCR 55 at 65-6; 54 ALR 730 (Full Court); Trade Practices Commission v Glo Juice Co Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 407 at 412-16 (Burchett J) and Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 331 at 347 (Pincus J)." 

 
 The drafting of injunctions is ultimately a practical question. In some cases it presents no difficulties to the draftsman, but in others the exercise is far from easy. 

 
 Mr Justice Gummow made the following observations (at 266-267): 

 
 In Mr Heydon's work "Trade Practices Law" para. 18.740, the view is expressed that whilst in concept the statutory remedy provided for in s. 80 of the Act is different from the equitable remedy of injunction as administered in the inherent jurisdiction of courts of equity, nevertheless "in many practical respects it is not, however, fundamentally distinct from the equitable remedy." I agree with that observation. 

 
 ... 

 
 Sub-section 80(1) confers upon the Court the power to grant an injunction where it is satisfied that a person has engaged or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute conduct of the description in paras. (a)-(f). The power of the Court to grant an injunction is controlled by the words "in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate." 

 
 Thus, the terms of the injunction will not be "appropriate" if, on its face, it operates upon a range of conduct some of which does, but some of which does not, have the relationship required by s. 80 with contravention of the Act. The injunction should not prohibit conduct falling outside the boundaries drawn by s. 80: Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161. The same limitation applies to mandatory injunctive relief. It is, in my view, no support for the grant of an injunction which, from the outset, has an operation outside the boundaries of s. 80, to say that it is open for the party enjoined to apply under sub-s. 80(3) to vary the injunction so as to bring its operation wholly within proper limits. The party in question should not be placed under any such obligation in the first place. 

 
 In the course of his expressing agreement with the judgement of Lockhart J, French J observed (at 268) of the power to grant injunctive relief conferred by s 80 of the Trade Practices Act , "The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act."

Attention needs to be given to the language of s 475 when considering both the nature of the power conferred and the remedy which may appropriately be granted pursuant to that power. In context, if a failure to do an act namely, the construction of a dam incorporating an installed fish transfer device suitable for lungfish constitutes an offence or other contravention of the EPBC Act because the dam as constructed does not have installed such a fish transfer device, thereby breaching a condition of the approval for the taking of that act, the Court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act, ie to incorporate in the dam a fish transfer device suitable for lungfish. There is no evidence that Burnett Water challenged condition 3 of the Minister's approval on the basis that it was manifestly unreasonable because it required the performance of a task that was impossible or was cast in terms that were so uncertain as to be devoid of sensible meaning. Indeed, had the installation of such a device been impossible, that may, given the objects of the EPBC Act and the protection afforded to the lungfish, have called into question whether the Minister should have approved the construction of the dam at all.

The relief sought by the Conservation Council in para 2 of the application is cast in more precise terms than the terms of condition 3 of the Ministerial approval. It is enough at present that the relief sought bears a reasonably arguable relationship with that which the statute permits the Court to grant and the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, it does. The claim for this relief is neither frivolous nor vexatious nor an abuse of process either for the purposes of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules or for the purposes of s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The proposed relief certainly does more than just recite the terms of the statute. It is more precise than that which in the circumstances of ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission was regarded as appropriate. Whether it is appropriate to grant relief in terms of para 2 of the application, other terms (and that further or other relief was sought was foreshadowed in oral submissions by the Conservation Council) or at all depends on the proof of a contravention, on the construction of condition 3 and on the evidence led at trial. Given that para 2 does not warrant being summarily struck out, it is not appropriate to consider the issues mentioned in the preceding sentence either in the abstract or as a separate question divorced from the evidence at the trial. Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd and ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission are not cases which compel the summary striking out of para 2 of the application.

If the Conservation Council proves those preconditions, a judicial discretion is enlivened. Considerations such as those set out in Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd are, in a non-exhaustive way, relevant to the formulation of injunctive relief in the exercise of that discretion. ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission establishes that injunctive relief granted under a power akin to s 475 of the EPBC Act must bear a relationship with the case alleged and proved and must be cast in terms which admit of an understanding of what is expected of the party enjoined. It does not follow from this that the Conservation Council is obliged to give particulars of what is a suitable fish transfer device for lungfish. It may, if it chooses, lead evidence touching on that subject as part of its case as to why the existing, installed device is unsuitable. If so, that evidence, together with other evidence led at the trial, may well inform how any injunctive relief ought to be cast.</text>

<tocase>Lyons v Kern Konstructions (Townsville) Pty Ltd (1983) 47 ALR 114</tocase>
<text>Of these allegations, allegation (a) would at least require particulars of the alleged unsuitability of the installed device. Particulars may also be required of the facts, matters and circumstances by reference to which it was alleged that Burnett Water was aware of the risk concerned. Were such particulars not to be furnished, a modern pleading rule such as O 12 r 5(2)(a) of the Federal Court Rules would enable them to be ordered, as Fitzgerald J (as his Honour then was) highlighted by reference to English authority in Lyons v Kern Konstructions (Townsville) Pty Ltd (1983) 47 ALR 114 at 124-126.

As to allegation (b), this would at least require particulars of the circumstances said to be known to Burnett Water.

Again, given the disposition of the application, it is unnecessary to decide whether the Conservation Council should be ordered to furnish particulars of the individuals by whose conduct Burnett Water is said to have been reckless. However, the foundation for the request does require comment. That foundation was based on what one might describe as "reverse engineering", grounded in ss 498B(1) and 498B(2) of the EPBC Act. These provide: 
 498B Conduct of directors, employees and agents 
 Bodies corporate&#8212;conduct 
 (1) Any conduct engaged in on behalf of a body corporate:
 (a) by a director, employee or agent of the body corporate within the scope of his or her actual or apparent authority; or
 (b) by any other person at the direction or with the consent or agreement (whether express or implied) of a director, employee or agent of the body corporate, where the giving of the direction, consent or agreement is within the scope of the actual or apparent authority of the director, employee or agent;
 is to be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to have been engaged in also by the body corporate unless the body corporate establishes that the body corporate took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct.
 Bodies corporate&#8212;state of mind 
 (2) If, for the purposes of this Act, it is necessary to establish the state of mind of a body corporate in relation to particular conduct, it is sufficient to show:
 (a) that the conduct was engaged in by a person as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b); and
 (b) that the person had that state of mind.</text>

<tocase>Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd [1970] AC 653</tocase>
<text>Burnett Water drew attention to authority, a notable exemplar of which is Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd [1970] AC 653 , which counsels the framing of injunctive relief requiring the performance of an act in terms which are sufficiently precise to enable the person to whom the injunction is directed to know what is required of him. Such precision also allows those concerned in his performance readily to ascertain whether the act has been performed as ordered. As Lord Upjohn, with whom the other members of the House agreed, put it in his speech in Morris v Redland Bricks Ltd [1970] AC at 666: 
 If in the exercise of its discretion the court decides that it is a proper case to grant a mandatory injunction, then the court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what in fact he has to do and this means not as a matter of law but as a matter of fact, so that in carrying out an order he can give his contractors the proper instructions.

The relief sought by the Conservation Council in para 2 of the application is cast in more precise terms than the terms of condition 3 of the Ministerial approval. It is enough at present that the relief sought bears a reasonably arguable relationship with that which the statute permits the Court to grant and the circumstances of the case. In my opinion, it does. The claim for this relief is neither frivolous nor vexatious nor an abuse of process either for the purposes of O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules or for the purposes of s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The proposed relief certainly does more than just recite the terms of the statute. It is more precise than that which in the circumstances of ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission was regarded as appropriate. Whether it is appropriate to grant relief in terms of para 2 of the application, other terms (and that further or other relief was sought was foreshadowed in oral submissions by the Conservation Council) or at all depends on the proof of a contravention, on the construction of condition 3 and on the evidence led at trial.

<tocase>Wide Bay Burnett Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1900</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1900.html</AustLII>
<text>The background to this case is described in an interlocutory judgement which I delivered on 12 December 2008 in respect of an application by Burnett Water for a stay of the proceedings: Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1900. That application was unsuccessful. The case concerns a dam on the Burnett River known as the Paradise Dam the construction and operation of which, subject to conditions, was approved by a Commonwealth Minister under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act).

Differences have emerged between the parties with respect to a number of issues of practice and procedure.
