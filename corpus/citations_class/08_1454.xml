<text>44 Although the discretionary objects do not have a beneficial interest in any property the subject of a "discretionary" trust prior to a distribution or appointment of income or capital, they are freely referred to as "beneficiaries"; see for example, Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 at 617-618; R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 59 at 79; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) (2006) 152 FCR 509 at [25]-[28]. Provided it can be said with certainty that any particular person is or is not within the class of discretionary beneficiaries, there is a trust, due administration of which can be enforced by discretionary beneficiaries: see In re Gulbenkian's Settlements [1970] AC 508 ; McPhail v Doulton [1970] UKHL 1 ; [1971] AC 424.</text>

<text>43 The word "beneficiary" reaches beyond a person who has a beneficial interest in the trust property. It is possible for the legal estate in land to be vested in "trustees" without equitable ownership being vested in someone else. The trustees must, however, owe fiduciary obligations in respect of the trust property to persons who, although they may have no interest in the trust property and may never have an interest in the trust property, are called "beneficiaries". In CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue of the State of Victoria [2005] HCA 53 ; (2005) 224 CLR 98 , the High Court rejected (at [25]):
 a "dogma" that, where ownership is vested in a trustee, equitable ownership must necessarily be vested in someone else because it is an essential attribute of a trust that it confers upon individuals a complex of beneficial legal relations which may be called ownership. 
That is to say, there can be a trustee who owes fiduciary obligations in respect of trust property to "beneficiaries" without any of the latter having a beneficial interest in the property.</text>

<tocase>Herdegen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 84 ALR 271</tocase>
<text>58 In Stephenson (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Barclays Bank Trust Co Limited [1975] 1 All ER 625, Walton J considered the meaning of the expression "absolutely entitled as against the trustee" under the predecessor of s 46(1), namely, s 22(5) of the Finance Act 1965 (UK). His Lordship said (at 637):
 Now it is trite law that the persons who between them hold the entirety of the beneficial interests in any particular trust fund are as a body entitled to direct the trustees how that trust fund is to be dealt with, and this is obviously the legal territory from which that definition derives. 
Reference may also be made to Tomlinson (Inspector of Taxes) v Glyns Executor &amp; Trustees Co [1969] 1 All ER 700 at 704 and [1970] 1 All ER 381 at 383-384 (per Lord Denning MR), and Herdegen v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 84 ALR 271 at 281. In Herdegen , Gummow J distinguished between "active" and "passive" trusts, and said of a "bare" trust:
 Today the usually accepted meaning of "bare" trust is a trust under which the trustee or trustees hold property without any interest therein, other than that existing by reason of the office and the legal title as trustee, and without any duty or further duty to perform, except to convey it upon demand to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or as directed by them, for example, on sale to a third party. The beneficiary may of course hold the equitable interest upon a sub-trust for others or himself and others ...</text>

<tocase>Kent v "Maria Luisa" (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 93 ; (2003) 130 FCR 12</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/93.html</AustLII>
<text>65 Clause 8.3 is unfortunately only a heading: "Power to Sell and Vary Investments" without any associated text. However, cl 8.4 empowers the Trustees "to make or vary any of the investments authorised under [the] Deed ...". The Trustees had power to sell the Property, as they did only six days after the Trusts were established. Even if Helen had an interest in the half interest the subject of Helen's Trust as at 28 June 2002, the Trustees' power of sale would have made it a defeasible interest: see Kent v SS "Maria Luisa" (No 2) [2003] FCAFC 93 ; (2003) 130 FCR 12 at [71] . It would cease to be defeasible only when the half interest ceased to be part of Helen's Fund and subject to the Trustees' power of sale.

66 Helen was not entitled to the half interest once it was subjected to the Trust. Her only entitlement was to require the Trustees to pay her money once the conditions of her entitlement were satisfied.

67 Clause 5.4 of the Deed provided relevantly, as follows:
 Fund Subject to Relevant Requirements This Deed shall be read and construed on the basis that the provisions of the Relevant Requirements are incorporated in the Deed to the extent that they impose covenants or obligations on the Trustee in order for the Fund to qualify for concessional Taxation treatment and this Deed shall be further read and construed on the basis that where there is any inconsistency between a provision in this Deed and a provision under the Relevant Requirements the latter shall prevail... 
The expression "Relevant Requirements" was defined in cl 4 of the Deed as follows:
 'Relevant Requirements' means any requirements under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 , the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations , the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and any other Acts or Regulations which the Trustee must comply with in order for the Fund to qualify for concessional Taxation treatment as a Complying Superannuation Fund including the requirements under any other proposed requirements, rulings, announcements or obligations which the Trustee believes will have effect retrospectively. 
Clause 26 provided:
 COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT The requirements contained in the Act with which the Fund must comply shall be deemed to be included in this deed and in the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the requirements of the Act and the provisions of this Deed the trustee shall act or refrain from acting notwithstanding anything to the contrary or otherwise contained in this Deed, in order to comply with the requirements of the Act and the relevant provisions of this Deed shall be deemed to be invalid. 
The expression "Act" was defined in cl 4 as follows:
 'Act' means the Income Tax Act and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and any legislation amending or replacing those acts, the Regulations and any other law of the Commonwealth or any State or Territory of Australia (including where applicable any relevant determination ruling or guideline made or issued by any Responsible Authority pursuant to any powers vested in it) with which the Fund and / or the Trustees must comply in order to qualify for the maximum concessions in respect of the Taxation of the income of the Fund in order to obtain what the Trustees consider to be any other relevant concession or to avoid what the Trustees consider to be a relevant penalty or imposition; 
Finally, the expression "Income Tax Act" is defined in cl 4 to mean:
 'Income Tax Act" means the Income Tax Assessment Act (1936) and the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997) and any act amending or replacing those acts and the Income Tax Regulations any regulations amending or replacing those acts;</text>

<text>42 According to the ordinary meaning of the word, a beneficiary is any person for whose benefit a trust is to be administered and who is entitled to enforce the trustee's obligation to administer the trust according to its terms. It is trite that for every trust there must be a "beneficiary" so understood (see, for example, Re Denley's Trust Deed ; Holman v HH Martyn &amp; Co Ltd [1969] 1 Ch 373 at 382-384). A beneficiary is not simply a person who as a matter of fact obtains some practical benefit from the existence of a trust: Sacks v Gridiger (1990) 22 NSWLR 502 at 508.</text>

<tocase>Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115</tocase>
<text>59 The concept of absolute entitlement against the Trustee is related to the well known case of Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115. In substance, it was held in that case that where a beneficiary is absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a trust asset as against the trustee, the beneficiary is entitled to terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the asset to him or her or at his or her direction. In order to invoke the rule, multiple beneficiaries can come together so that their beneficial interests exhaust the beneficial entitlement to the asset. For example, the rule could be invoked by a life tenant and the remainder man: since their interests in combination exhaust the beneficial interest in the subject property, in combination they are entitled to direct the trustee to transfer the property as they will.

60 In Public Curator of Queensland v Union Trustee Company of Australia Ltd [1922] HCA 28 ; (1922) 31 CLR 66 at 74, Higgins J noted:
 Those who are solely and absolutely entitled to receive money from trustees are entitled to ignore the specific mode and time of payment directed by the testator, to "break the trust", as it is called, and to claim immediate payment without the delay and formalities prescribed by the will (Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav. 115 ; Cr &amp; Ph., 240, Harbin v Masterman (1894) 2 Ch. 184; (1895) A.C. 186 , and other cases).

62 It will be noted that unlike the position under the rule in Saunders v Vautier , subs (5) of s 104-55 and of s 104-60 applies only to trusts of which there is a "sole beneficiary". Moreover, the provision requires the sole beneficiary to be absolutely entitled "to the asset" over which the trust was created. In the present case, the asset over which the trust was created was Helen's half interest in the Property.

63 It is sufficient to say in relation to the absolute entitlement aspect that cll 34.12(b) and (c) are fatal to the applicants' cases. Those provisions were set out at [37] above. As mentioned, I do not agree with counsel for the applicants that the word "may" in cl 34.12(b) means "must".

64 There is no ground for saying that once Helen's Fund was established, Helen was absolutely entitled as against the Trustees to the half interest in the Property that she had owned prior to its establishment</text>
