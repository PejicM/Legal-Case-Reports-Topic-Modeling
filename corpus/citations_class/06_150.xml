<tocase>Tresize v National Australia Bank Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 706</tocase>
<text>1 On 11 August 2005, on the motion of the first respondent, I ordered that pars 79 to 92 of the amended statement of claim (the claim) in this proceeding be struck out. My reasons for so ordering are contained in Tresize v National Australia Bank Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 706 (the earlier reasons).

2 After I made the orders referred to above and published the earlier reasons, Mr Watts, counsel for the applicants, applied for leave to replead the struck out pars. I granted leave and gave the applicants 45 days (that is, until 26 September 2005) to replead.

3 No further amended statement of claim was filed by 26 September 2005.</text>
