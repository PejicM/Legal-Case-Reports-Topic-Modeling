<text>29 The manner in which this Court exercises the discretion conferred by s 17F(1) is informed and assisted by the views expressed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. This Court has long recognised the role played by the Authority and the reliance placed by the Court upon its review of the proposed scheme and its assessment as to whether or not it should oppose an order seeking confirmation. Albeit in the comparable context of a transfer under Part 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) , in Colonial Portfolio Services Ltd v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [1999] FCA 1779 , Mathews J observed:
 [28] It is relevant to note that APRA, which operates as something of a watchdog in relation to transfers under Pt 9 of the Act, had no objection to the confirmation of the scheme. Nor did APRA arrange for an actuarial report on the scheme, as it is entitled to do under s 192 of the Act. It can be inferred that APRA regarded the reports furnished by the applicants as adequate. ... Like comments have also been made in other cases: Re Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 at [23] , [2000] FCA 1259 ; 104 FCR 37 at 40 per Katz J.

<text>10 Section 17C sets out those steps which must be undertaken before an application may be " made " for confirmation. For the purposes of s 17C, it is considered that an application for confirmation of a scheme is " made " at that point in time when a hearing is held which seeks confirmation and not at that point in time when proceedings are filed with this Court: Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 at [30] [37] per Lindgren J, [2004] FCA 524 ; 139 FCR 450 at 458 9.

<tocase>PMI Indemnity Ltd [2005] FCA 1842</tocase>

<text>13 The discretion conferred by s 17F is conferred in general terms and does not specify any criteria to be satisfied. It must, however, be a discretion exercised in a manner which promotes the objects of the Act, including the protection of the interests of policy holders in ways consistent with " the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative insurance industry ". A " critical consideration " is " whether affected policyholders will be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme ": PMI Indemnity Limited (No 2) [2005] FCA 1842 at [24] per Lindgren J.

14 Section 32 of the 1973 Act, it should further be noted, provides that the Authority may also determine " prudential standards " that must be complied with. Of immediate relevance to the present proceedings are three such standards, namely:
 
(i) Prudential Standard GPS 110 -- which deals with " Capital Adequacy " and aims to ensure that the security of policy holder obligations of all insurers is established at an appropriate level by requiring that each general insurer maintain at least a minimum amount of capital;
 
(ii) Prudential Standard GPS 310 -- which deals with audit and actuarial reporting and outlines the roles and responsibilities of a general insurer's Approved Actuary; and
 
(iii) Prudential Standard GPS 410 -- which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of the insurance business of a general insurer.
 
Also of relevance is:
 
(iv) A " Prudential Practice Guide (Draft) " which deals with " Capital Adequacy " and " Capital Management ".

15 The " Summary of the Scheme " in the present proceedings was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and sets out the effect of the Scheme as follows:
 Summary of scheme The following is a summary of the scheme: 
(a) All of the rights, liabilities and obligations of BIC under policies issued or underwritten by BIC in the conduct of BIC's Australian insurance business will be transferred to A&amp;G and become rights, liabilities and obligations of A&amp;G. BIC will be released and discharged from these liabilities and obligations and will cease to operate an insurance business in Australia.
 
(b) A cash amount equal to the value of the liabilities assumed by A&amp;G (net of reinsurance and third party recoveries) will be transferred from BIC to A&amp;G. Reinsurance treaties held for the benefit of BIC will be assigned to A&amp;G.
 
(c) Except for A&amp;G being substituted for BIC as insurer, the transfer will not result in any change to policy benefits or policy terms and conditions under policies issued or underwritten by BIC.
 
(d) The rights, benefits, obligations and liabilities of holders of policies issued by BIC in Australia will be the same as if those policies had been issued or underwritten by A&amp;G instead of BIC. Claims under such policies are to be made to A&amp;G, instead of BIC.
 
(e) BIC will bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer and the scheme.
 
(f) The transfer will take effect on the first business day after the date on which the scheme is confirmed by the Court.</text>
