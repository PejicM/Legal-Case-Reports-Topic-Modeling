<tocase>FCT v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477</tocase>
<text>14 However, the width of the meaning of the term creditor in the Deed is likely to bring SETL within the class of creditors to which s 444D(1) and 444E apply. (See: Smith v Carr (1993) 10 ACSR 427 per Debelle J at 432). The material facts recited in the pleading show that notwithstanding the limited relief sought by SETL against London Partners in this proceeding, it is plainly arguable that SETL may be a person who has a cause of action against London Partners at law or in equity that sounds in damages albeit at this point it may be of uncertain measure. It may be a claim for equitable compensation or compensation under s 1317H of the Act for involvement in a contravention of s 181 that exists independently of rectification of the register, or it may be a contingent claim that, for example, may arise in the event that it is the fact that London Partners holds the securities on trust for a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and is unable to deliver up the securities. In either circumstance it would follow that SETL would be a creditor of London Partners in respect of an unliquidated sum. (See: Re: R L Child &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1986) 10 ACLR 673, per McLelland J at 674; FCT v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477 per Mansfield J at 481; Re McLean (1992) 108 ALR 360; Forshaw v Thompson (1992) 35 FCR 329; Petrochemical Industries Ltd v Dempster Nominees Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 468 per Murray J at 475-476).</text>
