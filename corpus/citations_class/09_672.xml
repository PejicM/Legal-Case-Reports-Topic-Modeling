<text>Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) introduced what might be described as a slightly more exclusionary rule of access to contested trial proceedings than previously obtained under General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 and the earlier authority of Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 in respect of claims made or defences propounded in such a proceeding where the Court is satisfied that the relevant party has no reasonable prospect of successfully maintaining a particular claim or defence whether as to a part only or the entirety of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Swain v Hillman [2001] All ER 91</tocase>
<text>The respondent says that Mrs Vranic's contention as to the question of construction is so lacking in merit or substance as to be not fairly arguable and the phrase "no reasonable prospect of successfully" prosecuting or defending the proceeding (or that part of the proceeding) should be accorded the same construction as that described by Lord Woolf in Swain v Hillman [2001] All ER 91 in respect of the phrase "no real prospect of successfully", as directing the Court to "the need to see whether there is a 'realistic' as opposed to a 'fanciful' prospect of success". For the purposes of s 31A, a proceeding need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success (s 31A(3)).</text>

<tocase>Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/UKPCHCA/1947/1.html</AustLII>
<text>In this application, there are no contested questions of fact which might be resolved one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed in the sense contemplated in Hocking v Bell (1947) 75 CLR 125 , which influenced the approach to s 31A by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352. Finkelstein J in Jefferson Ford v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 246 ALR 465 took the view that the test of reasonable prospect of success was a less stringent test than that proposed by Rares J in Boston Commercial . Plainly, the Court must be cautious not to do Mrs Vranic an injustice by summarily dismissing or foreclosing the proceeding. However, the question is whether as a matter of substance rather than form ( White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 per Lindgren J) Mrs Vranic's construction has no reasonable prospect of success.</text>

<tocase>Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 992</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/992.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the interests of justice are not served by making such a reference as I am satisfied that Mrs Vranic's contention has no serious prospect of succeeding and thus her proceeding would be dismissed. The interests of justice are not served by requiring the matter to proceed to trial and requiring the respondent to prepare an appeal record, retain solicitors on the hearing and brief counsel on the trial, when the costs incurred in doing so represent, in a real sense, public money. The amount in issue is approximately $910.00 and Mrs Vranic has no reasonable prospect of success in the proceeding. There is no prospect of the respondent's costs of the hearing of an appeal being paid by the applicant having regard to unsatisfied orders for costs made against Mrs Vranic in other Federal Court proceedings. (See Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 992 and Vranic v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2004] FCA 1511).</text>
