<tocase>Armorduct Manufacturing Company Ltd v General Incandescent Company Ltd [1911] 2 KB 143</tocase>
<text>26 Section 468 of the Act provides that any disposition of property of a company, other than an exempt disposition, made after the commencement of the winding up of the company by the Court is void, unless the Court otherwise orders. In an application under s 468 or its equivalent, the Court has a discretion to order that a disposition of property is not void. It may be that, where a creditor has been prevented by force or by fraud or trickery from issuing execution or attachment prior to the commencement of a winding up, the Court would order that the execution or attachment is not void (see Armorduct Manufacturing Company Ltd v General Incandescent Company Ltd [1911] 2 KB 143 at 147.

27 However, there is no power given to the Court under s 569 to order that s 569 not apply. In any event, there is simply no evidence before the Court to suggest that there was any fraud or trickery that resulted in any delay in obtaining the garnishee order that resulted in the payment from the Bank to Sandos. Accordingly, there is no basis for suggesting that this ground for setting aside the statutory demand has any substance.

28 Sandos contends that it is, at most, liable to pay the amount received following the garnishee order, less an amount in respect of the costs of the garnishee order. It says that, since that amount has not been determined, it is not possible to determine the amount payable.</text>

<tocase>Bibra Lake Holdings Pty Ltd v Firmadoor Australia Pty Ltd 7 (1992) ACSR 380</tocase>
<text>33 Sandos points out that, in a proceeding under Division 2 of Part 5.7B of the Act, in respect of an insolvent transaction, the liquidator is a necessary party to a proceeding for recovery. Moneys paid in circumstances that create a preference, and which are recoverable under Division 2, are moneys recoverable for the benefit of the creditors of the company generally. Such moneys are not property of the company in liquidation; nor are they moneys owed by the recipient as a debt to the company. Accordingly, a liquidator must sue in his or her own name, in the interest of the creditors, to recover a payment that is void as against the liquidator (see Bibra Lake Holdings Pty Ltd v Firmadoor Australia Pty Ltd 7 (1992) ACSR 380 at 386).

34 An insolvent transaction that is an unfair preference is voidable. There are defences to a claim for payment under Division 2. However, there is no apparent defence to a claim under s 569. It is clear that what is to be paid to a liquidator under that section is the amount recovered by way of attachment, in this case the garnishee order to the Bank. I consider that money received by a liquidator pursuant to s 569 is received by the liquidator as agent for his or her company.

35 Sandos does not contend that the liability that arises by operation of s 569 is not a debt within the meaning of s 459E. Rather, it contends that that debt is owed to the Liquidators and not to Southern. The statutory demand in this case was signed on behalf of Southern by one of the Liquidators in his capacity as one of Southern's joint and several liquidators. Accordingly, it was a demand by Southern and not a demand by the Liquidators.

36 Any moneys received by the Liquidators or received by Sandos will be available as part of the fund available on the winding up of Sandos. While Sandos, notwithstanding that it is being wound up, continues as a separate corporate entity, whose mind is that of its liquidators, there is but one fund available for application in the winding up of Sandos. It is clear enough that the demand related to the sum garnisheed by Sandos from the Bank. Clearly, the demand was being made under s 569 of the Act. I do not consider that the fact the demand purports to be by Southern rather than by the Liquidators is anything more than a formal defect, if it is indeed a defect. I have already concluded that no substantial injustice has been caused by the form of the demand.

37 There is no basis for concluding that there is a genuine dispute between Sandos and either Southern or the Liquidators as to whether s 569 operates. I do not consider that there is a basis for setting aside the demand on this final ground.

38 The application should be dismissed with costs.
