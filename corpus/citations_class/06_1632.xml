<text>20 The distinction between fears based on membership of a particular social group and fears based on revenge for individual actions is conceptually simple but difficult in practice. Many social groups are defined by the actions of their members: whistleblowers ( Zheng v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 670) , informers ( Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417), trade unionists, Muslim women who do not wear traditional dress, parents in China ( Chan v Canada [1995] 3 SCR 593; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225). If a person from such a group fears persecution, it may be difficult to say whether the essential and significant reason for that fear is their membership of the collective or the individual action which causes them to be identified as a member of the collective. The distinction, according to Dawson J in Applicant A (at 243), "may sometimes be an unreal one."

21 However, it is well established that it will be insufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that persecution is feared solely by reason of some act that a person has done, or is perceived to have done: Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417, 420 per Black CJ (with whom French J agreed). The primary focus must be upon what someone is rather than what they have done. This, according to Black CJ, "tells against the argument that a particular social group may be defined by reference to the sole criterion that its members are all those who have done an act of a particular character": (ibid.) It is not permissible to define a "particular social group" by reference to the act that gave rise to the fear of persecution: Applicant A per Dawson (at 243), McHugh (at 263) and Gummow JJ (at 264).

23 While it is vital to accurately identify the "particular social group" ( Applicant A at 401), it is often quite difficult to do so. These difficulties have lead applicants and tribunals into error. In Dranichnikov , the Tribunal defined the group as "businessmen in Russia." It concluded that membership of that group did not give rise to a validly held fear of persecution and so held against the applicant. The High Court explained that the correct social group, as the applicant had eventually argued, was "businessmen in Russia who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals."</text>

<text>22 Furthermore, a group will not be a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention if the only characteristic members have in common is a fear of persecution: Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2003) 217 CLR 387, 400 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ.</text>

<text>27 Similarly, in Balbin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Lindgren J, 7 December 1998, unreported), where the applicant claimed to fear persecution due to her exposure of corruption within the public service of the Philippines, Lindgren J held that the Tribunal had not erred in finding that the applicant's fears were due to her particular individual acts against the corrupt men rather than her membership of a group of "whistleblowers."</text>

<tocase>Canada v Ward [1993] 2 SCR 689</tocase>
<text>24 In Canada v Ward [1993] 2 SCR 689, the applicant was a member of the INLA, a para-military terrorist group committed to the unification of Ulster and the Republic of Ireland. As his first task with the INLA, the applicant was required to guard a group of innocent hostages. On learning that the hostages were to be executed, the applicant allowed them to escape without disclosing himself to his superiors. However, they subsequently learned of his disloyalty and he was captured and tortured. He escaped and fled to Canada with the assistance of the British authorities. His application for refugee status in Canada was partly founded on his membership of a particular social group. However, for a reason that is not clear from the decision, the particular social group pleaded was "members of the INLA" rather than "former members of the INLA who had betrayed the group in order to save innocent lives." The Court concluded (at 744) that "no subsequent disassociation from this group ... had any impact on his fear" and that, therefore, it was not appropriate to say that his "fear was based on his status as a former member of the INLA. The fact that Ward might no longer be a member is merely a result of the persecution feared, not its foundation". This reasoning is difficult. It is not clear whether the Court regarded the group under consideration as being "current INLA members" or "current and former members" and, if it included former members, how the applicant could subsequently disassociate himself from the group. If the group were defined as "former members who had betrayed the group" the Court's reasoning would lose much of its force.

26 In Ward , the Supreme Court of Canada did not need to address the question of whether the applicant belonged to a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention. The final paragraph on this ground of appeal is as follows (at 745): 
 
 "Moreover, I do not accept that Ward's fear was based on his membership. Rather, in my view, Ward was the target of a highly individualized form of persecution and does not fear persecution because of his group characteristics. Ward feels threatened because of what he did as an individual, and not specifically because of his association. His membership in the INLA placed him in the circumstances that led to his fear, but the fear itself was based on his action, not on his affiliation."</text>

<tocase>Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/26.html</AustLII>
<text>14 In Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389, 394 (per Gummow and Callinan JJ, Hayne J agreeing at 408, Kirby J to similar effect at 402-404), the High Court set out a series of steps that the Tribunal must follow when determining whether an applicant fell within the Convention definition of refugee (Article 1A(2)) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution due to membership of a particular social group: "First the tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention. That determination in part at least involves a question of law. If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class. There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well-founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason."

15 The appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of membership of a group described as "journalists or politically-active citizens (such as members of non-ruling parties, including the SNPU) who are prepared to expose corruption." As I have already mentioned, the Tribunal found that the appellant was neither a journalist nor a member of the SNPU. The only way that the appellant could fall within the group to which he claimed to belong was by his involvement in the exposure of the oil racket.

16 However, the Tribunal held that these circumstances do "not relate to the Convention." It found: 
 
 "The criminals' desire for revenge is not motivated by anything other than what [the appellant] has done. It is not because of any political opinion, for example. The Tribunal has asked itself whether the Convention motivation of 'particular social group' may have come into play, but has concluded that it has not. The [appellant] has not claimed, for example, that all employees or all 'inspectors' of the 'Lviv Committee of Citizen Rights Protection" are being targeted by criminals. Not is he claiming that those criminals are targeting any wider hypothetical social group such as 'people exposing criminal actions' or 'people exposing corruption.' Rather, it is clear that the revenge the applicant fears is directed specifically at him because of his actions in uncovering their criminal activities. It is therefore not necessary to deal with the question of whether or not such hypothetical groups exist in Ukraine as 'particular social groups' within the meaning of the Convention."

17 This passage makes clear that the Tribunal considered that the issue of whether the appellant belonged to a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention did not arise because the reason for the appellant's fear of persecution was not related to membership of a particular social group. That is, the Tribunal considered that even if the appellant did belong to a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention, membership of that group is not the reason for his fear of persecution. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that it was unnecessary to follow the steps set out in Dranichnikov.

18 The appellant contended before this court that this was an impermissible line of reasoning. He argued that the steps set out in Dranichnikov must be followed even if the Tribunal is of the view that the applicant's fear is unrelated to the membership of any such group. This is plainly incorrect. Courts will frequently skip over more difficult questions if the main issue can be determined from the answer to a simpler later question: in the law of negligence, there is no need to ask whether there was a duty of care if it is obvious that there has been no damage. In this case, moving to the last step in Dranichnikov was quite proper.

19 That question was whether the membership of a particular social group is the essential and significant reason (s 91 R(1)(a) of the Act) for the appellant's fear of persecution. The Tribunal answered that question in the negative, holding that "the revenge the [appellant] fears is directed specifically at him because of his actions in uncovering their criminal activities."

23 While it is vital to accurately identify the "particular social group" ( Applicant A at 401), it is often quite difficult to do so. These difficulties have lead applicants and tribunals into error. In Dranichnikov , the Tribunal defined the group as "businessmen in Russia." It concluded that membership of that group did not give rise to a validly held fear of persecution and so held against the applicant. The High Court explained that the correct social group, as the applicant had eventually argued, was "businessmen in Russia who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals."

25 It is entirely proper to avoid identifying the appropriate "particular social group" if it is unnecessary to do so. Dranichnikov does not demand otherwise.

29 This is the same reasoning as employed by the Tribunal in this case. It held that the appellant's fear is based on his individual action and not on his affiliation with any particular group. Having made that finding, there was no need to address the test set out in Dranichnikov . For this reason, the appeal fails on this ground also.

30 For the above reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding thirty (30) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.

<tocase>Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417</tocase>
<text>20 The distinction between fears based on membership of a particular social group and fears based on revenge for individual actions is conceptually simple but difficult in practice. Many social groups are defined by the actions of their members: whistleblowers ( Zheng v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 670) , informers ( Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417), trade unionists, Muslim women who do not wear traditional dress, parents in China ( Chan v Canada [1995] 3 SCR 593; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225). If a person from such a group fears persecution, it may be difficult to say whether the essential and significant reason for that fear is their membership of the collective or the individual action which causes them to be identified as a member of the collective. The distinction, according to Dawson J in Applicant A (at 243), "may sometimes be an unreal one."

21 However, it is well established that it will be insufficient for an applicant to demonstrate that persecution is feared solely by reason of some act that a person has done, or is perceived to have done: Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417, 420 per Black CJ (with whom French J agreed). The primary focus must be upon what someone is rather than what they have done. This, according to Black CJ, "tells against the argument that a particular social group may be defined by reference to the sole criterion that its members are all those who have done an act of a particular character": (ibid.) It is not permissible to define a "particular social group" by reference to the act that gave rise to the fear of persecution: Applicant A per Dawson (at 243), McHugh (at 263) and Gummow JJ (at 264).</text>

<text>10 It has been held in several cases that the exposure of corruption can lead to the imputation of a political opinion: C v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1430 ; (1999) 94 FCR 366; Klinko v Canada (2000) 184 DLR (4 th ) 14; Guzman v Minister of Citizenship &amp; Immigration (1999) 93 ACWS (3d) 733; Berrueta v Minister for Citizenship &amp; Immigration (1996) 109 FTR 159; Grava v Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service 205 F 3d 1177 (2000). In Zheng v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 670 , Merkel J reviewed these authorities and said (at [33] [34]):
 
 "It needs to be emphasised that where individual, rather than systemic, corruption is exposed it is less likely that the act of exposure will be one in which a political opinion will be seen to have been manifested. This is because the exposure in that instance is more likely to be seen as the reporting of criminal conduct rather than any form of opposition to, or defiance of, state authority or governance. 
 
 A critical issue will always be whether there is a causal nexus between the actual or perceived political opinion said to have been manifested by the exposure of corruption and the well-founded fear of persecution...In each case the question of whether the nexus has been established is a question of fact for the RRT."

11 The Tribunal, in deciding that no perception of the appellant having a political opinion within the meaning of the Convention would have arisen as a result of his actions, was making a finding of fact. The Tribunal made clear that it considered whether the appellant's activities would have given rise to such an imputation and concluded that they would not. This conclusion was open to the Tribunal and there is no reason to disturb it. The fact that the activities were undertaken as part of the appellant's employment was clearly an important factor in the Tribunal's reasoning but there is no indication, nor any reason to infer, that the Tribunal considered that this precluded an imputation of political opinion. The use of the words "in this instance" in the final sentence of the passage quoted above confirms this view.

12 For these reasons, the appeal on the ground of "imputed political opinion" fails.

20 The distinction between fears based on membership of a particular social group and fears based on revenge for individual actions is conceptually simple but difficult in practice. Many social groups are defined by the actions of their members: whistleblowers ( Zheng v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 670) , informers ( Morato v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 111 ALR 417), trade unionists, Muslim women who do not wear traditional dress, parents in China ( Chan v Canada [1995] 3 SCR 593; Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225). If a person from such a group fears persecution, it may be difficult to say whether the essential and significant reason for that fear is their membership of the collective or the individual action which causes them to be identified as a member of the collective. The distinction, according to Dawson J in Applicant A (at 243), "may sometimes be an unreal one."</text>
