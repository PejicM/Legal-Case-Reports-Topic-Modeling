<text>15 Assuming for the moment that alteration of the Birth Register is a "service", s 22(1) on its face would clearly apply to the Registrar's refusal in this case since it expressly refers to discrimination on the grounds of marital status (s 22(2) provides that the section binds the Crown in right of a State). However, the operation of s 22(1) is limited by s 9. Section 9(4) provides that the prescribed provisions of Pt II (which include s 22) 
 "have effect as provided by ... the following provisions of this section and not otherwise." 
 

The following provisions of s 9 include subsection (10) which refers to "the Convention", earlier identified in s 4 as the " Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ".
 
 Section 9(10) provides:
 
 "If the Convention is in force in relation to Australia [which is in fact the case] the prescribed provisions of Pt II [i.e. including s 22] ... have effect in relation to discrimination against women, to the extent that the provisions give effect to the Convention." 
 

The purpose of s 9 is to ensure that the prescribed provisions have effect in relation to matters falling within the scope of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth: South Pacific Hotels Pty Ltd v Trainor [2005] FCAFC 130 ; (2005) 144 FCR 402 at [19] . Other subsections of s 9 will give effect to prescribed provisions such as s 22 in particular circumstances coming within Commonwealth power, for example when there is discrimination by a trading or financial corporation on the ground of a person's marital status: s 9(11).

16 The issues raised by the present application therefore are:
 (i) Whether, having regard to s 9(4) and (10) of the Sex Discrimination Act , s 22 of the Act applies at all to the Registrar's conduct; and 
 (ii) If it does, whether the Registrar's conduct constituted refusing to provide a service.</text>

<text>17 Giving effect in this context means giving legal effect, creating legally enforceable, rights, duties, powers and privileges: cf Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex Parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] HCA 34 ; (2000) 203 CLR 346 at [209] , [211]. The Convention, being an international instrument, does not apply of its own force as part of Australian domestic law enforceable in Australian courts: Secretary of State for India v K B Sahaba (1859) 13 Moo PCC 22 at 75, 15 ER 9 at 28-29, cited in Queensland v The Commonwealth [1989] HCA 36 ; (1989) 167 CLR 232 at 239. The terms of the Convention do not directly prohibit or mandate conduct by individuals. By the Convention States Parties undertake to take measures, including legislative measures, which will help to eliminate discrimination against women. For example, by Article 2(b)

36 That the definition does not extend to discrimination against all persons, male or female, simply on the ground of marital status, and is confined to discrimination against women, is confirmed by an example of the construction given by the international community (as to the admissibility of such material see Queensland v The Commonwealth , above, at 240). The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 31 July 1995 issued, in the course of its third periodic reports of States Parties to the Convention, the report of the United Kingdom Government. An annexure is a document entitled "Commentary on UK Reservations and Declarations, Statement entered by the United Kingdom on 7 April 1986". At page 126, under the heading "Article 1" there is quoted an earlier reservation of the UK which was in these terms:
 " With reference to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and other applicable legislation, the United Kingdom's acceptance of Article 1 is subject to the reservation that the phrase "irrespective of their marital status" shall not be taken to render discriminatory any difference of treatment accorded to single persons as against married persons, so long as there is equality of treatment as between married men and married women and as between single men and single women. " 


 
It is then said:
 
 " This statement clarifies the UK's understanding of this Article. The UK Government still believes that it is an accurate statement of the Article's meaning. However, the Government accepts that there is no need for this still to be explicitly stated. On this basis the UK Government wishes to withdraw the statement. "

37 Article 2 provides (emphasis added):
 " States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: 
 (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realisation of this principle; 
 (b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; 
 (c) To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; 
 (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; 
 (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organisation or enterprise; 
 (f) To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; 
 (g) To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women. " 


Read together with the Preamble and the definition of " discrimination against women ", the obligations undertaken in Article 2 are clearly confined to acting (and refraining from acting) in relation to disadvantage suffered by women as compared with men.

38 Article 3 requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, in all fields, in particular in the political, social, economic and cultural fields, to ensure the full development and advancement of women for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " on a basis of equality with men ".</text>

<tocase>Richardson v Forestry Commission [1988] HCA 10 ; (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 295-296</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/10.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22. The question is not whether Parliament has made a legislative judgment that a treaty obligation exists, in which case it is enough that " the legislative judgment could reasonably be made " ( Richardson v Forestry Commission [1988] HCA 10 ; (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 295-296). Rather, as Ms Mortimer SC for the Registrar submitted, Parliament has made the legislative judgment. It is expressed in ss 9(4) and (10), and s 22. The Court must construe the language of those provisions. There must be an examination of the Convention to ascertain to what Australia has undertaken to give effect by way of legislation.

20 At the outset the Preamble notes that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person " and in the equal rights of men and women ". It also notes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination, that all human beings are born free and equal, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, " without discrimination of any kind, including distinction based on sex ".

21 The Preamble then notes that States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure " the equal right of men and women " to enjoy all economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights.</text>

<tocase>Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/137.html</AustLII>
<text>54 Mr Lenehan on behalf of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Cth), who was given leave to appear as amicus curiae , supported the applicant's arguments. He also advanced an alternative argument. He submitted that even if marital status discrimination is not covered by Article 1 of the Convention, the application of s 22(1) of the Sex Discrimination Act to marital status discrimination is within the limits of s 51(xxix) of the Constitution (the external affairs power) and thus s 9(10) of the Act. He argued that the proscription of marital status discrimination against women will prevent the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about women and can therefore be seen as a means of " nipping in the bud" conduct which may grow into or foster " discrimination against women " within the meaning of Article 1. He referred to Article 5 ([40] above) and cited the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515.

55 In Toben the appellant had been found by a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have engaged in racial vilification contrary to s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). He contended that provision was invalid because the source of the s 51(xxix) external affairs power relied on, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination , was concerned with the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred whereas s 18C was intended only to proscribe acts which could be characterised as expressions of racial hatred. In other words, as I understand the argument, the Act did not give effect to the relevant Convention because it did not go far enough, it did not fully implement the Convention.

56 Carr J (with whom Kiefel J agreed) at [18] accepted that the Act did not fully implement Article 4 of the Convention because provisions in the Bill which created criminal offences in respect of racial hatred had been rejected by Parliament. However, his Honour at [20] said that it was clearly consistent with the provisions of the Convention that a State Party
 "should legislate to 'nip in the bud' the doing of offensive, insulting, humiliating or intimidating public acts which are done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin before such acts can grow into incitement or promotion of racial hatred or discrimination. ... it is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to a treaty ..."

57 As already mentioned, the present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22. In any event, for the reasons given above, the Convention with which this case is concerned addresses discrimination against women, in the sense defined in Article 1, including discrimination which treats women less favourably than men who have the same marital status. But s 22, which applies to discrimination against men or women, married or unmarried, on the ground of marital status, is not, so to speak, a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only. In so far as s 22 is concerned with stereotypes, it is the stereotype that might arise from a person being married, or unmarried, irrespective of sex.

58 In Toben the nature of the discrimination (racial) was the subject of both the Convention and Act the point was that the prohibition in the latter only extended to less severe forms of discriminatory conduct than the former. In the present case, discrimination on the ground of marital status per se is not some less severe form of discrimination against women. The "nip in the bud" analysis does not apply.

59 Section 9(10) speaks of "giv(ing) effect to the Convention" . A major element, albeit not the only one, of the Convention is the obligation undertaken by States Parties to legislate in a number of areas to proscribe discrimination against women.

60 Section 22 being legislation, and not some other form of governmental activity (such as, for example, public education or governmental employment practices) is part of Australia's discharge of its obligation to legislate as required by the Convention. It is therefore to be construed as prohibiting discrimination against women treating them less favourably than men because they are married. The action of the Registrar in the present case had nothing to do with the applicant's being a woman. Had the applicant been a man, the result of the application would have been the same.

61 Issue (i) must be resolved in the negative. It is not strictly necessary therefore to consider the second issue, but since the matter was fully argued I shall proceed to do so.

62 Ms McLeod submitted that the Registrar contravened s 22 by refusing to consider the application " on its merits ". The Registrar should have gone beyond a " blanket refusal ". The decision involved an "analysis of the factual content, the supporting material, the weighing of relevant discretionary factors and so on ". When it was pointed that this argument did not fit the agreed question, Ms McLeod sought the amendment which appears in [8] above.</text>

<tocase>IW v City of Perth (1997 [1997] HCA 30 ; 191 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/30.html</AustLII>
<text>64 Both arguments seem to me to introduce an unnecessary degree of subtlety into a simple process. The arguments apparently proceeded from a perceived need to accord with what some members of the High Court said in IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1. But that case dealt with a town planning decision, an administrative decision of a very different nature.

65 "Service" involves an "act of helpful activity" or "the supplying of any ... activities ... required or demanded" (Macquarie Dictionary) or "the action of serving, helping, or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary). Altering the Birth Register was an activity. The applicant requested the Registrar to perform that activity. The carrying out of that activity would have conferred a benefit on the applicant. The Registrar, because of the terms of the BDM Act, declined the request to carry out that activity. This was the refusal of a service.

66 An activity carried out by a government official can none the less be one which confers a benefit on an individual. Much of governmental activity today involves the conferring of benefits on individuals. The BDM Act itself recognises this. For example the Registrar may enter into an arrangement for the provision of "additional services" (s 51) and the Governor in Council may make regulation prescribing fees with respect to searches etc and "other services provided by the Registrar" (s 59(1)(a)(iv)).</text>
