<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<text>20 It is common ground between the plaintiffs on the one hand, and the defendants for whom Mr Thomson appears on the other hand, that the test which I should apply in determining the present application is the ordinary test applicable when the Court is considering the grant of an interlocutory injunction in aid of private rights. This test is captured in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 208 CLR 199 at [8] to [21] (pp 216 220) (per Gleeson CJ); at [59] to [61] (pp 231 232) (per Gaudron J); and at [86] to [92] (pp 239 242); at [98] to [100] (pp 244 246); and at [105] (p 248) (per Gummow and Hayne JJ). Gleeson CJ (as he then was) also specifically cited with approval Spry, Principles of Equitable Remedies , 5 th ed (1997) pp 446 56.</text>

<text>18 The plaintiffs submitted that:
 
(a) It is well established that the use of company funds to defend oppression proceedings may, in certain circumstances, constitute oppression (see Re DG Brims and Sons Pty Ltd (1995) 16 ACSR 559 at 591 592; Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733; and Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 495 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 249 at [90] to [99] (pp 267 269); and Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corp Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [250] to [258]).
 
(b) Where the issue has been raised prior to the final determination and there is a significant risk of the company's resources being expended in the defence of the interests of the majority, there is no reason why the Court would not step in at the interlocutory stage and make appropriate orders. In support of this submission, Counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon certain observations made by Brereton J in Grace v Grace (2007) 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [52] and at [61] (second dot point).
 
(c) The normal test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction applies in the circumstances of the present case;
 
(d) The plaintiffs have established a strong case that there is a serious question to be tried; and
 
(e) The balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction because " ... there is a decidedly uneven playing field ... " in the sense that the plaintiffs are compelled to fund the litigation in circumstances where they have no assets of any significance whereas their protagonists, the Buskens, have access to company funds.</text>

30 However, that is not the end of the matter. None of the authorities to which I have been referred involved an application for interlocutory relief founded upon the same ground as the ground relied upon by the plaintiffs in the present application. Further, some of those authorities support the proposition that, because it may be difficult to determine on an interlocutory basis which costs may be regarded as the legitimate responsibility of the corporate defendants over which the oppression suit is being fought, courts are reluctant to make a determination in advance, ie, at an interlocutory stage ( Fexuto [1998] NSWSC 413 ; 28 ACSR 688 at 733; 20 28; Re A Company (No 001126 of 1992) [1994] 2 BCLC 146 at 155 156; Grace 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [49] to [52] and at [59] to [61]). This latter point may not be a very strong point in favour of the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants in the present case but is one that nonetheless needs to be weighed in the balance. It seems to me that the Court is generally reluctant to interfere at the interlocutory stage with the payment of legal fees and expenses unless there is good reason to do so.</text>
