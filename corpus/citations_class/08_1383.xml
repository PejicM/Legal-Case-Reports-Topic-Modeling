<text>8 The applicant applies for leave to appeal from Driver FM's decision. That application was filed out of time. The Minister does not take issue with that fact and I will consider the merits of the application and whether leave to appeal should be granted under the principles in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397.

9 The application for leave to appeal annexes an affidavit and a draft notice of appeal. Looking at the grounds of appeal in substance, they contain assertions without particulars. There is no explanation of what the asserted error on the part of the Federal Magistrate is said to be. One ground of appeal refers to jurisdictional error in the decision of the delegate. I take that to mean jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal but, again, there is no particularisation of any such asserted jurisdictional error.</text>

<text>10 The grounds of appeal do not disclose an arguable case of error on the part of the Federal Magistrate or jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. The applicant, who appears in person assisted by an interpreter, has not been able to point to any such error. I see no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate, nor jurisdictional error by the Tribunal. Indeed, there seems to be no dispute that the Tribunal carried out its functions in providing the required notification under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). In the absence of any suggestion of fraud, SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 does not assist the applicant.

11 It follows that the application for leave to appeal should be refused.

12 The applicant is to pay the first respondent's costs in the sum of $1000.

 I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.

<text>1 The applicant is a citizen of India. He arrived in Australia on 30 March 2007 and applied for a protection visa on 14 May 2007. The applicant's claim for a protection visa was based on a fear of persecution on the basis of his homosexuality. The applicant's application for a protection visa was refused by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. On an application for review, the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision. An application for review of the Tribunal's decision was dismissed by Driver FM ( SZMBN v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 503).

2 The applicant's difficulties in relation to his hearing before the Tribunal arose because he did not receive, or did not receive in time, notification from the Tribunal and the invitation to appear at the hearing. There is no dispute that the Tribunal notified the applicant's authorised recipient, his migration agent, of the hearing. However, it would seem that the migration agent did not, in turn, notify the applicant of the opportunity to attend. According to the decision of Driver FM, it may be that the applicant himself received a copy of the hearing invitation in the mail at his home address but, because he was working away from home at the time, it did not come to his attention until after the opportunity to attend the hearing had passed.

3 In any event, the applicant did not attend the hearing before the Tribunal. Given the lack of detail in the applicant's claims and without the opportunity to test the truthfulness of those claims at the hearing, the Tribunal found that it did not have sufficient evidence and was not prepared simply to accept the applicant's claims. It followed that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.</text>
