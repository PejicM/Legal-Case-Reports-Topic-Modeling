<text>13 The power expressly vested in the Supreme Court by s 4 of the Restraints of Trade Act may be exercised by this Court when determining a controversy within its jurisdiction to which the Act is relevant ( Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559). No party addressed me on the relevance for present purposes of the requirement in s 4(3) of the Act for an application to be made by a person subject to the restraint.

14 Luxottica did not place reliance on s 182 and s 183 of the Corporations Act , or on any alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed by Mr Carr to Luxottica. It relied only upon alleged breaches of his contract of employment.

15 In my view, the evidence placed before the Court was insufficient to sustain an inference that Mr Carr has breached, or threatens to breach, clause 21 of his contract of employment.</text>

<tocase>Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/58.html</AustLII>
<text>7 To obtain the interlocutory relief which it seeks Luxottica must demonstrate three things:
 
 (a) that there is a serious question to be tried; (b) that it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation; and (c) that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief ( Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153 per Mason ACJ). 

To some extent these three things overlap and it is not uncommon for the adequacy of damages as compensation to be considered as an aspect of the balance of convenience.

8 For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that Luxottica is entitled to interlocutory relief against either Mr Carr or Hinkler.

9 Mr Carr signed a contract of employment with OPSM Pty Ltd on 21 June 2005. The contract is governed by the law of New South Wales. The ACN of OPSM Pty Ltd shown on the contract is the ACN of Luxottica as shown on its application. OPSM Pty Ltd must be assumed to have changed its name to Luxottica after 21 June 2005.

20 The degree of likelihood of success in Luxottica's case is a relevant consideration in assessing the balance of convenience ( Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia at 154). The evidence reveals that every existing optometry business in Bundaberg is within a radius of five kilometres of the Sugarland premises. For this reason it is likely to be argued at trial that the maximum geographic restraint sought to be imposed on Mr Carr by clause 23 is unreasonable and constitutes an attempt to prevent his practising at all in Bundaberg other than with Luxottica. The second level of geographic restraint for which clause 23 provides is within a radius of three kilometres of the Sugarland premises. The Hinkler premises are outside this radius.

21 I am not satisfied that, to the extent that Luxottica's case against Mr Carr depends on the five kilometre radius restraint for which clause 23 provides, if the evidence remains as it is, it is probable, as opposed to possible, that Luxottica will be held entitled to relief.

22 Luxottica contended that the quasi-medical nature of optometry renders it likely that Mr Carr's clients will follow him with the result that he, together with Hinkler, will gain an unjustifiable headstart or 'springboard' as competitors of Luxottica unless interlocutory relief is granted. Luxottica also argued that it will be difficult for it to recruit another qualified optometrist.</text>

<tocase>Geraghty v Minter [1979] HCA 42 ; (1979) 142 CLR 177</tocase>

<text>17 However, I accept that there is a serious question to be tried as to the extent of the restraint of trade validly imposed on Mr Carr by clause 23 of his contract of employment and as to whether he is in breach of that restraint. While an employer is not entitled to be protected from mere competition from a former employee, it is entitled to protect the goodwill of its business and, for that purpose, to prevent the former employee from misusing his or her acquaintance with the employer's customers and taking advantage of the employer's trade connections ( Geraghty v Minter [1979] HCA 42 ; (1979) 142 CLR 177). The Restraints of Trade Act will ensure the validity of clause 23 to the extent that it is not contrary to public policy.

18 Luxottica contended that damages will not be an adequate remedy should it succeed in its action against Mr Carr. It argued that its loss and damage will be unquantifiable because of the difficulties that will attend the establishment of a causal link between Mr Carr's breach of clause 23 of his contract of employment and loss of profits by Luxottica.

19 Mr Carr has sworn that he does not have a list of the customers of Luxottica's Sugarland business and does not know who are the customers of that business. He has offered to keep a record of every customer who he examines and a record of all charges rendered in respect of each customer including charges for spectacles. This record will, in my view, go a significant way towards overcoming the problems which Luxottica foresees in establishing its damages should it succeed against Mr Carr at trial.</text>

<tocase>Industrial Rollformers Pty Ltd v Ingersoll-Rand (Australia) Ltd [2001] Aust Contract Reports 90-129</tocase>
<text>12 Section 4(1) of the Restraints of Trade Act 1976 (NSW) provides that a restraint of trade is valid to the extent to which it is not against public policy, whether it is in severable terms or not. Section 4(3) of the Act authorises a person subject to a restraint of trade to apply to the Supreme Court of New South Wales where the operation of a restraint of trade would have a manifestly unreasonable operation. In Industrial Rollformers Pty Ltd v Ingersoll-Rand (Australia) Ltd [2001] Aust Contract Reports 90-129; [2001] NSWCA 111 the Court of Appeal observed that s 4 does not authorise the remaking of the restraint; rather, where there is a postulated breach of the restraint, it permits the Court to enforce the restraint to the extent that is reasonable in the circumstances of the postulated breach.</text>
