<tocase>Abrahams v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 32 ; (1944) 70 CLR 23</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1944/32.html</AustLII>
<text>43 In Abrahams v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 32 ; (1944) 70 CLR 23 at 44 Williams J, sitting as a single Justice of the High Court, considered that the presence of restrictive Articles was not a factor that should depreciate value because directors were obliged to exercise fiduciary duties conferred by the Article in a proper manner, bona fide and for the benefit of the company. Such obligations are enforceable in the courts. Citing the Privy Council case of Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v Revenue Divisional Officer Vizagapatam [1939] AC 302 , as applied by the High Court in Geita Sebea v Territory of Papua [1941] HCA 37 ; (1941) 67 CLR 544 , Williams J said (70 CLR at 44):
 ...the full value to the seller must be ascertained, however limited the market may be, even where there is only one possible hypothetical purchaser. To a prudent purchaser willing to give full value for the shares sooner than fail to obtain them, this restriction should not, to my mind, have many terrors.

44 Subsequently Gibbs J in Gregory v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 2 ; (1971) 123 CLR 547 at 569, another single Justice case, rather departed from the approach of Williams J in Abrahams . Gibbs J said that even though powers given to directors were fiduciary
 that does not mean that the presence of restrictive articles has no effect on the value of a minority holding. From a practical point of view, the possibility of obtaining redress in the courts against a wrongful exercise of a power given by the articles is not a substitute for articles under which the power is not conferred.

45 This issue is extensively discussed by Young J in Mike Gaffikin Marine Pty Ltd v Princes Street Marina Pty Ltd (1995) 122 FLR 294 at 303 et seq. His Honour quoted the view of the leading authority on share valuation in Australia, Mr Wayne Lonergan, in his work The Valuation of Businesses, Shares and Other Equity . The corresponding passage in the current edition (4 th ed, Allen &amp; Unwin, 2003) at 143:
 Few valuers today would share the views of Williams J, and in the light of the significant changes in the world's capital markets and in view of the comments of Gibbs J in Gregory's Case... I believe a modern court would, in the absence of a statutory direction to the contrary, generally discount the value of shares to take account of restrictive clauses. 
While accepting that he would have followed Abrahams were it not for what Gibbs J said in Gregory , Young J (122 FLR 304) made the following points, first in relation to proprietary company shares generally:
 
&#8226; A reasonable purchaser would be influenced by restrictive provisions and there should be some discount;
 
&#8226; Directors have fiduciary duties which can be policed;
 
&#8226; Litigation to enforce compliance with directors' obligations will be expensive;
 
&#8226; But it will also be expensive for the directors, so compromise "somewhere along the line" is likely;
 
&#8226; Each case must be looked at in its own circumstances;
 
&#8226; But a large discount merely because of the presence of restrictive clauses would not be appropriate.
In relation to minority holdings:
 
&#8226; The above remarks also apply to an extent;
 
&#8226; If the holding is of a size less than that required to block a special resolution the holder is "at the mercy of the majority";
 
&#8226; But the courts are still able to contain the wrongdoing of the majority;
 
&#8226; "To a great extent" directors will be able to make determinations as to retention of moneys, dividend policy and the direction of the company;
 
&#8226; But there is an "area outside the line where the courts will exercise control";
 
&#8226; Where the valuation is on an assets backing basis, the smaller the value of the shares (without discount), the greater the discount that should be applied for the cost and risk of litigation.

46 An important element in the present case is the special value the shares would have to the majority shareholder nominally Mrs Weeden but, it is reasonable to infer, a holder under the practical control and direction of Mr Weeden. This factor is mentioned in the passage from Abrahams cited in [43] above. Nothing in Gregory casts doubt on it. In Mordecai , 12 NSWLR at 70, Hope JA, with whom the other members of the New South Wales Court of Appeal agreed, said:
 It is well-established that if property has some special potentiality which only one person would buy, it is to be valued on the basis of a notional sale to that person. The property is not valueless or diminished in value because there would be no other buyers [Vyricherla and Geita Sebea cited]. On this basis the value of Morpak's goodwill is to be determined upon the basis of a hypothetical sale to the only persons to whom, on the appellants' submissions, it could be sold, and to whom the matters which they submit would render the goodwill valueless in any other purchaser's hands would be irrelevant. 
Young J applied the same principle in Mike Gaffikin Marine , 122 FLR at 304.</text>

<tocase>Cannane v Official Trustee (1996) 65 FCR 453</tocase>
<text>27 Ms Rome-Sievers for the respondents referred to observations by Beaumont and Hill JJ, with whom Lehane J agreed, in Cannane v Official Trustee (1996) 65 FCR 453 at 471 et seq. Those observations deal with a quite different setting, a company which had a deficiency of assets. Its controller, Mr Cannane, contemplated using it as a vehicle for a backdoor listing on the stock exchange. The only value from the point of view of a prospective purchaser was "something extraneous to the shares, namely the assurance by Mr Cannane that the benefit of the advantageous back door listing would inure to (the company)" (at 472).

28 I now turn to the issues in dispute between Mr Lipson and Mr Ferrier which go to the quantum of market value.</text>

<tocase>Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gold Estates of Australia (1903) Ltd (1934) 51 CLR 509</tocase>
<text>22 It was common ground that the term "market value" as it appears in s 120(1)(b) is to be construed consistently with the valuation principles stated in Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 82 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 432, 436-437, 440 et seq. As the High Court said in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gold Estates of Australia (1903) Ltd (1934) 51 CLR 509 at 515:
 The supposition must be made that a sale is not forced, and that the owner is willing to sell on reasonable terms, and negotiates with a person willing to buy, that the one is not so anxious to sell and the other to buy, as to disregard the effect of any business consideration, and that each is equipped with knowledge of the existing relevant circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/4.html</AustLII>
<text>30 Ms Rome-Sievers referred to a passage in the judgment of Aickin J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336 at 396 where his Honour said:
 Where no individual shareholder can procure liquidation and where there is no likelihood of the holders of four out of the five shares joining together in the foreseeable future to wind up the company it can seldom be appropriate to use s. 18 (2) (c). 
That case concerned liability for Commonwealth gift duty. Section 18(2)(c) of the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1942 (Cth) provided in effect that where a gift included shares in an unlisted company, the Commissioner might, in his discretion, adopt as the value of those shares the sum the holder would receive in the event of the company being voluntarily wound up on the date when the gift was made. On the facts of that case (see the passage from the judgment of the trial judge, Sheppard J, cited at 146 CLR 395) all the members of the Court, except Murphy J, held that it was unnecessary to adopt a winding up basis because the shares were properly valued on an earnings basis.

31 In the present case, as already noted, neither valuer suggested an earnings basis would be appropriate. In any event, the notional winding up in the present case assumes an order made on an oppression petition: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 232 , or on the just and equitable and related grounds: s 461(e) , (f), (g) and (k), not the voluntary winding up predicated by s 18(2)(c) of the Gift Duty Act as relevant in St Helens Farm .

32 If, as both valuers agree, a liquidation basis is appropriate, how would the notional purchaser, properly advised, assess the prospects of obtaining a winding up order?

33 Ms Rome-Sievers points to the history and circumstances of the Weeden Companies. They are closely held family companies. They do not carry on any business, their sole economic worth being the potential receipt of trust distributions as beneficiaries of trusts within the wider Weeden Group. However, the directors of trustees of the relevant trusts have stated that they do not intend to make any distributions in the foreseeable future, and have not done so for some time. No dividends have been declared by the Weeden Companies since 1988 and are not likely to be declared in the future.</text>

<text>37 A controlling majority which diverts assets and opportunities of the company to other entities under its control, and from which it will benefit, will be acting oppressively. This is essentially the kind of conduct held to be oppressive in Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer [1959] AC 324 and a breach of fiduciary duty in Mordecai v Mordecai (1988) 12 NSWLR 58. Similarly, an inflexible policy of not declaring dividends can constitute oppression: Shamsallah Holdings Pty Ltd v CBD Refrigeration and Airconditioning Services Pty Ltd (2001) 19 ACLC 517 at [51]-[56]. It would be no answer to say that such conduct happened to suit the interests of the Weeden family. In Gambotto v WCP Limited [1995] HCA 12 ; (1995) 182 CLR 432 the High Court has reaffirmed the willingness of the courts to protect minority shareholders albeit in the context of a majority seeking to amend Articles of Association.</text>

<tocase>Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474</tocase>
<text>47 It might be suggested that the Explanatory Memorandum ([21] above) is inconsistent with this principle insofar as it disregards "any sort of discount or incentive". However, the Memorandum is not to be taken too literally. For example, a range of "kerbside valuations" would hardly be a determination of market value binding on a court. In any event, an Explanatory Memorandum, however helpful, is not an expression of the will of Parliament and cannot prevail when a statute uses an expression, such as market value, to which courts of the highest authority have given a clear meaning. While Explanatory Memoranda are explicitly included in the extrinsic materials to which a court may give consideration under s 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), there may still be something to be said for the trenchant view expressed by Lord Halsbury LC in Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474 at 477:
 ... I believe the worst person to construe (a statute) is the person who is responsible for its drafting. He is very much disposed to confuse what he intended to do with the effect of the language which in fact has been employed.

48 Mr Ferrier has applied a 10 per cent "minority discount". To some extent that overlaps with a further discount for litigation risk which he fixes at 25 per cent.

49 Mr Ferrier's figures quoted in [18] above do not take into account this latter discount because his instructions were to assume as a fact that the applicants (strictly speaking, that should be a hypothetical purchaser) would be able to establish oppression and obtain a winding up order. Mr Lipson's corresponding discount is 92.5 per cent, ie he assumes the chance of success at 7.5 per cent. The estimate of the prospects of success in litigation is probably not something within the specialised knowledge of a Chartered Accountant: see Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 79.</text>

<tocase>Jenkins v Enterprise Gold Mines NL (1992) 10 ACLC 136</tocase>
<text>35 The concept of oppression and the relevant authorities are discussed extensively by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Jenkins v Enterprise Gold Mines NL (1992) 10 ACLC 136 at 143-147 in a passage too lengthy to set out, but which I respectfully adopt and incorporate in these reasons. I particularly note what their Honours said at 145-146:
 In our opinion the application of the test involves a question of fairness. It is for the court to decide whether in balancing the interests of the company as a whole against minority interests the directors have acted so as to unfairly prejudice the interests of the minority. The court decides this "according to ordinary standards of reasonableness and fair dealing". Whether the conduct is unfairly discriminatory will be judged on standards which reasonable directors with such skills as directors should have, acting bona fide, would think to be fair.

36 The respondents' defence in a hypothetical oppression and winding up application would necessarily be that the assets of the Weeden Companies can be used for the exclusive benefit of the controllers, through the medium of the Related and Associated Entities. The minority shareholder in the Weeden Companies can expect nothing by way of income and nothing by way of capital for the indefinite future. If the net assets of the Weeden Companies were $100 million and the minority interest were 20 per cent, the unfairness of such conduct would be unarguable. It does not become any less unfair when the minority is smaller.</text>

<tocase>Re Lowes Park Pty Ltd; Headlam v Lowes Park Pty Ltd (1994) 62 FCR 535</tocase>
<text>38 A hypothetical purchaser, properly advised, is to be credited with an awareness of the foregoing matters. The price a willing buyer would pay for the shares would reflect the availability of remedies for oppression and entitlement to a winding up order. Such a purchaser is not to be fixed with previous acquiescence in the policies of the controllers of the Weeden Companies. Rather the reasonable assumption is that the purchaser would be entitled to the rights conferred at law by the holding of the shares acquired. Cases such as Re Lowes Park Pty Ltd; Headlam v Lowes Park Pty Ltd (1994) 62 FCR 535 where the minority shareholder had accepted the conduct complained of for many years (see 62 FCR at 548, 550, 553) are distinguishable.

39 The Articles of Association of the Weeden Companies contain pre-emptive rights (Article 37-41) and also confer an "absolute discretion" on the Directors to refuse to register any transfer without being bound to assign any reason for such refusal: Article 36.

40 Mr Peters SC for the applicants pointed out that s 1072C of the Corporations Act confers rights on the trustee in bankruptcy of a shareholder who becomes bankrupt. Pre-emptive rights are effectively removed (sub-s (6)) and consent to a transfer of the bankrupt's shares must not be unreasonably withheld (sub-s (5)). It was put that the surrounding circumstances in the present case include the imminent bankruptcy of Mr Weeden. A willing seller in the position of Mr Weeden, in answer to a buyer's argument that the restrictions in the Articles warranted a lower price, would point out that the next day a trustee in bankruptcy could sell them without any such restrictions.</text>

<text>22 It was common ground that the term "market value" as it appears in s 120(1)(b) is to be construed consistently with the valuation principles stated in Spencer v The Commonwealth [1907] HCA 82 ; (1907) 5 CLR 418 at 432, 436-437, 440 et seq. As the High Court said in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Gold Estates of Australia (1903) Ltd (1934) 51 CLR 509 at 515:
 The supposition must be made that a sale is not forced, and that the owner is willing to sell on reasonable terms, and negotiates with a person willing to buy, that the one is not so anxious to sell and the other to buy, as to disregard the effect of any business consideration, and that each is equipped with knowledge of the existing relevant circumstances.

23 It is central to the respondents' case that there was in fact no prospective purchaser for Mr Weeden's shares (apart from Mrs Weeden, a circumstance to which I shall return). The relevance of that fact, if it be a fact, needs to be considered in the light of a passage from the judgment of Griffith CJ in Spencer , a case which concerned compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land.

24 Griffith CJ dealt with the very situation where actual buyers of the property in question are likely to be hard, or impossible, to find. His Honour at 5 CLR 431 noted that, in the case of chattels which are the subject of frequent sale or purchase, the value of the articles is taken to be the current price. Someone wishing to sell such articles can readily find a purchaser at a price which is fairly certain and, conversely, a would-be buyer can find a seller at about the same price. In many cases the same considerations apply to land, where the price per acre is "as definitely fixed as the price of wheat or sugar". His Honour continued (at 431-2):
 But in the case of a new port, in a new State, where the area of land is limited, and each piece differs in many of its characteristics from the rest, it is impossible to apply any such rule. Bearing in mind that value implies the existence of a willing buyer as well as of a willing seller, some modification of the rule must be made in order to make it applicable to the case of a piece of land which has any unique value. It may be that the land is fit for many purposes, and will in all probability be soon required for some of them, but there may be no one actually willing at the moment to buy it at any price. Still it does not follow that the land has no value. In my judgment the test of value of land is to be determined, not by inquiring what price a man desiring to sell could actually have obtained for it on a given day, ie, whether there was in fact on that day a willing buyer, but by inquiring "What would a man desiring to buy the land have had to pay for it on that day to a vendor willing to sell it for a fair price but not desirous to sell?" It is, no doubt, very difficult to answer such a question, and any answer must be to some extent conjectural. The necessary mental process is to put yourself as far as possible in the position of persons conversant with the subject at the relevant time, and from that point of view to ascertain what, according to the then current opinion of land values, a purchaser would have had to offer for the land to induce such a willing vendor to sell it, or, in other words, to inquire at what point a desirous purchaser and a not unwilling vendor would come together.

25 Mr Lipson pointed out some unattractive features (for a purchaser) of the shares in question: they were a small minority, they were subject to pre-emptive rights in the Articles of Association and a directors' discretion to refuse registration, there was a long-subsisting policy of not declaring dividends, etc. However, these are matters going to the quantum of market value. They do not deny the existence of market value. Indeed, Mr Lipson implicitly recognised this. In his report of 24 September 2008 he said that he did not believe there was a "deep and identifiable market" for the shares in the Weeden Companies. It follows that, in his opinion, there was a market, albeit one which did not have the desirable attributes mentioned. In re-examination he was asked:
 
 
 Q. And (senior counsel for the applicants) suggested that this often happens; that a minority shareholder in a closely held family company often seeks to sell the shares to outsiders on the would you say that happens that does happen often?
 
 A. It rarely happens in private companies within family groups. It rarely, rarely happens. I can it is not something that would be in the normal in the normal course of events. ... It is very rare that in a closely held family context that a minority shareholder will seek to dispose of their interest to an outsider or stranger.
 
 

So whether or not such sales happen often, the fact remains that they can, and do, happen.

26 In this context, at least in the circumstances of the present case, we are not concerned with the definition of a market in the competition law sense. It is rather a question whether the transfer impugned under s 120 was a transfer of property which has value because it can be bought and sold. Minority shares in proprietary companies in Australia by their nature can be, and are in fact, bought and sold.

41 I doubt whether the circumstance of Mr Weeden's dire personal financial situation is a factor which legitimately can affect the assessment of market value of the shares. In Spencer , 5 CLR at 436-7, Barton J said that a claimant for compensation for resumption of land 
 is entitled to have for his land what it is worth to a man of ordinary prudence and foresight, sight, not holding his land for merely speculative purposes, nor, on the other hand, anxious to sell for any compelling or private reason, but willing to sell as a business man would be to another such person, both of them alike uninfluenced by any consideration of sentiment or need.

42 However, the existence of restrictive provisions in a company's Articles of Association does not indicate that a minority holding has no market value; rather it is a factor which may call for an appropriate discount.</text>

<text>43 In Abrahams v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1944] HCA 32 ; (1944) 70 CLR 23 at 44 Williams J, sitting as a single Justice of the High Court, considered that the presence of restrictive Articles was not a factor that should depreciate value because directors were obliged to exercise fiduciary duties conferred by the Article in a proper manner, bona fide and for the benefit of the company. Such obligations are enforceable in the courts. Citing the Privy Council case of Vyricherla Narayana Gajapatiraju v Revenue Divisional Officer Vizagapatam [1939] AC 302 , as applied by the High Court in Geita Sebea v Territory of Papua [1941] HCA 37 ; (1941) 67 CLR 544 , Williams J said (70 CLR at 44):
 ...the full value to the seller must be ascertained, however limited the market may be, even where there is only one possible hypothetical purchaser. To a prudent purchaser willing to give full value for the shares sooner than fail to obtain them, this restriction should not, to my mind, have many terrors.</text>
