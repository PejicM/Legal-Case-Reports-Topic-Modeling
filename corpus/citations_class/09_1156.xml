<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The decision under s 9 of the Protection Act has lapsed. The Minister has made a decision under s 10 but Mr Dates has not made that decision the subject of his application. In order to obtain an injunction, Mr Dates must show that there is a serious question to be tried ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [19] per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J) in the sense explained in O'Neill at [65] per Gummow and Hayne JJ and also address the balance of convenience, in the sense of competing inconvenience and injury. The evidence before me and the Minister's reasons relate to the application under s 9 of the Protection Act.

In any event, I will consider whether there is a serious question to be tried in respect of the application to this Court concerning the s 9 decision.

As to the significance of Alum Mountain as an Aboriginal area for the purposes of s 9 of the Protection Act, the Minister found that the upper slopes and ridge crest outcrops are significant as part of Aboriginal tradition within the meaning of the Protection Act because they are associated with men's business. That finding is not challenged.</text>

<tocase>Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1992) 178 CLR 408</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SASC/1992/3851.html</AustLII>
<text>It was pointed out in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1992) 178 CLR 408 by Brennan J at 433 that s 16(1)(d) does not enable the Court to make an order against a party in litigation where no ground for relief under the general law is established against that party. There must, his Honour said, be " legal reference points by which to steer ". The power is in addition to the power to quash or set aside an impugned decision ( Park Oh Ho v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 54 ; (1989) 167 CLR 637 at 644). It does not enable orders to be made against persons who were not in any way involved in the processes or procedures which led to the decision under review and who benefit from the decision, if at all, only indirectly; those persons are, in that sense, strangers to the decision ( Johns at 459 per Gaudron J). Johns was applied by Wilcox J in Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage (2003) 74 ALD 124 (' Williams No 1 ') to refuse relief by way of a restraining order against a joined third party under s 16(1)(d) of the ADJR Act, even after a refusal to make a s 9 declaration was declared invalid and set aside. His Honour concluded that such an order was beyond power. On the application for interlocutory relief following the decision of Wilcox J, Lindgren J expressed the view in Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage [2003] FCA 627 ; (2003) 199 ALR 352 (' Williams No 2 ') at [31] that there was not an arguable case that Wilcox J had erred in his view that Johns obliged him to refuse the interlocutory injunction. That is, Lindgren J expressed the view at [40] that a party seeking an injunction under s 16(1)(d) of the ADJR Act must establish a "right" to it under general law principles. Specifically, his Honour concluded at [44] that the general law does not recognise an Aboriginal person as having an interest in the specified area in an application under the Protection Act, protectable by injunctive relief. The right given by s 9 is to apply for a ministerial declaration and that does not constitute such an interest.

On appeal in Williams , Gray J with whom Tamberlin J agreed, expressed the view, arguably in obiter dicta, that such power does exist ( Williams v Minister for the Environment and Heritage [2004] FCAFC 58 ; (2004) 132 LGERA 368 at [29] , [30] and [40]). Justice Ryan, in Carter v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [2005] FCA 667 ; (2005) 143 FCR 383 at [39] - [41] , expressed the view that, as Wilcox and Lindgren JJ concluded, Johns compels the conclusion that such interlocutory relief against the third party is not available.

In the present case, where the declaration has not been made and the Minister's decision has not been set aside, it is not necessary for me to consider that matter further. However, like Ryan J, I see much force in the reasoning of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ. Johns does not allow for the interlocutory order as sought. The Judiciary Act

Section 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act confers jurisdiction on the court in any matter arising under a law made by the Parliament. This would include the Protection Act. However, the limitation is that the matter must arise under that Act. The Federal Court Act and Rules</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The powers of the Federal Court under the ADJR Act are set out in s 16 of that Act. Section 16(1) provides that, on an application for an order for review of a decision, the Court may make certain orders. Subsections (a) to (c) relate to the decision itself, in this case a refusal to make a declaration. If that decision were set aside, it does not follow that the Court is empowered to substitute its own decision as to the making of a declaration for that of the Minster; it is not ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40 per Mason J).

Section 16(1)(d) provides that the court may make an order: 
 
 Directing any of the parties to do, or to refrain from doing, any act or thing the doing, or the refraining from the doing, of which the court considers necessary to do justice between the parties. 
 

 
Mr Dates relies upon s 16(1)(d) as the basis for the orders sought against the RTA, if joined.

Mr Dates' complaints go to the merits of the decision and the weight accorded by the Minister to evidence that contradicted the evidence he presented. His complaint is that the Minister came to the wrong conclusion but that does not amount to reviewable error. Not every consideration that a decision-maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re-exercised according to law. A factor may not be significant and a failure to take it into account could be seen not to have materially affected the decision ( Peko-Wallsend at 40). I am not satisfied that, for example, the unspecified archeological sites, if not taken into account, could have materially affected the Minister's state of satisfaction in the light of the matters referred to in the reasons.

The application asserts a denial of procedural fairness in the making of the decision and manifest unreasonableness. This was not elaborated on the hearing of the motion and I am not satisfied that the particularisation of those grounds in the application discloses a serious question of reviewable error. The Minister, in his reasons, explained why he was satisfied as to the upper parts of Alum Mountain but not satisfied as to the lower parts. To repeat, the Protection Act requires a positive state of satisfaction as to areas and objects of particular significance to Aboriginals in accordance with Aboriginal tradition.

Even if there were power to make an order against the RTA as sought in the notice of motion to preserve the subject matter of the s 9 application, Mr Dates has not established, at a prima facie level, that the Minister's decision should be the subject of orders under s 16(1) of the ADJR Act.</text>

<text>Section 23 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') provides that the Court has power, in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction, to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as the Court thinks appropriate. The section does not itself confer jurisdiction. Where jurisdiction is conferred by an Act that provides an exhaustive code of available remedies or otherwise limits the power of the courts to grant relief, s 23 does not provide a basis for transcending that limitation. ( Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v the Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161; Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [27] - [28] ). Section 23 will not generally be read as giving power to grant additional remedies of a kind already specifically provided for in other legislation which is to be seen as a comprehensive statement of the remedies there available. This presents a difficulty to an applicant seeking broader orders than those provided in the ADJR Act: " the stream cannot rise higher than its source " ( Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Msilanga [1992] FCA 41 ; (1992) 34 FCR 169 at 177, 179 per Beaumont J, with whom Black CJ agreed).</text>

<text>Section 23 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') provides that the Court has power, in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction, to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as the Court thinks appropriate.

( Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v the Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150 at 161; Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [27] - [28] ). Section 23 will not generally be read as giving power to grant additional remedies of a kind already specifically provided for in other legislation which is to be seen as a comprehensive statement of the remedies there available. This presents a difficulty to an applicant seeking broader orders than those provided in the ADJR Act: " the stream cannot rise higher than its source " ( Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Msilanga [1992] FCA 41 ; (1992) 34 FCR 169 at 177, 179 per Beaumont J, with whom Black CJ agreed).

The Court also has inherent power, as a superior court of record and as a court of law and equity, to make an interlocutory order which is necessary to enable it to perform its function as such as court. This includes the power to make an order directed to preserving the subject matter of litigation ( Williams No 2 at [16] per Lindgren J). That power exists independently of the power in s 23 ( Williams No 2 at [18]).

Mr Dates contends that an injunction is necessary to preserve the subject matter of the litigation, namely the untouched parts of Alum Mountain asserted to be of Aboriginal cultural significance. The Minister and the RTA point out that such an order extends beyond that envisaged by the relevant statutes. If the Court were to grant such an injunction it would, as the RTA submits, usurp the decision of the Minister and make, in effect, a s 9 "emergency" declaration. Further, as the RTA observes, the Protection Act provides for injunctions that would preserve the subject matter of a declaration but the precondition is the making of a declaration.

Thus, the statutory regime does not envisage an injunction pending the making of, or the determination of a challenge to a refusal to make, a declaration under s 9 or s 10.

The RTA submits it is neither a proper contradictor, nor a person whose evidence will assist in the determination of whether the Minister's decisions to refuse to make the s 9 and s 10 declarations should be set aside. The RTA submits that it is, relevantly, a stranger to the Minister's decision under review. This is not affected, for the purposes of s 16(1)(d), by the fact that the RTA made submissions or submitted a report to the Minister which he took into account in making his decision. The question is whether Mr Dates is otherwise entitled to injunctive relief against the RTA, whether or not it is joined as a party ( Williams No 2 at [43] per Lindgren J).

The right given by s 9 (or s 10) of the Protection Act to any Aboriginal person to apply for a ministerial declaration does not constitute a right to claim injunctive relief against a third party nor does the general law recognise an Aboriginal person as having an interest in the specified area protectable by injunctive relief. The right given to any Aboriginal person by s 9 of the Protection Act does not constitute such an interest. ( Williams No 2 at [44]).

Joinder for the purpose of granting an interlocutory injunction to prevent the RTA from proceeding with the works would afford Mr Dates rights greater than those available under the Protection Act, which does not provide for injunctions per se and in the absence of a declaration. Joinder would also afford rights greater than those under the ADJR Act which, if Mr Dates were successful, could at its highest result in remittal to the Minister for redetermination of his decision.

The Minister submits that the RTA may be proper but not a necessary party to the substantive proceedings but that it is not a proper or necessary party to the motion if there is no power in the Court to grant the injunctive relief sought in the notice of motion.</text>
