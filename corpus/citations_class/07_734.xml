<tocase>Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; [2006] 231 ALR 663</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/55.html</AustLII>
<text>8 One of the claims in the first category is that the Federal Magistrate who heard the case did so in a way which demonstrated actual bias or reasonably apprehended bias. In Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 231 ALR 663, the High Court of Australia dealt with a claim, which had been upheld by the Full Federal Court of Australia, that a judge of that court had conducted himself in a way which would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. In the course of giving their judgment in the appeal, Crennan and Kirby JJ, with whom Gummow ACJ agreed on the point, stated at [117]: "An intermediate appellant court dealing with allegations of apprehended bias, coupled with other discrete grounds of appeal must deal with the issue of bias first". Accordingly, I must deal first with the bias claims made on behalf of the appellant. I note, however, that it is the second group of claims which address the question of whether the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal is tainted with appealable error. Were I to uphold the claim of bias (see Concrete at [117]), it would seem that the proper course would be for me to send the matter back for reconsideration by the Federal Magistrates Court rather than to deal with the substantive issue relating to the validity of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

9 I propose to say at the outset that I think that the claim of bias, whether actual or apprehended, is entirely without foundation. I have read large parts of the transcript which has been put before me and I have, in particular, read all the parts of the transcript that were specifically referred to by the appellant's solicitor and to the parts of the transcript that are reproduced in the appellant's written submissions. I had played to me a substantial section of the recording of the hearing and had the opportunity to listen to that while I read through the recorded parts as they appeared in the written transcript. My first impression of my reading of the transcript and of listening to the recording of the hearing was that the proceeding took place in a way which is entirely normal and acceptable and in a way which occurs in courts in Australia every day of the week.

10 I particularly thought that in the way she addressed the appellant's solicitor, the learned Federal Magistrate proceeded with moderation. I did not notice her at any stage to raise her voice in any way that was untoward. The appellant has urged upon me that from time to time she interrupted. All I can say about that is that if interruptions by judges of counsel can give rise to a claim of apprehended bias, then there would be very many such claims that could be made. I noticed, although the appellant's solicitor did not refer to it, that there were occasions when he interrupted the Federal Magistrate.</text>

<tocase>Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCA 18</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/18.html</AustLII>
<text>12 I accept that such orders should be made only in the rarest of circumstances where serious lapses of proper conduct have occurred for such an order to be justified. Like Mansfield J in Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No. 2) [2004] FCA 18 , I am conscious of the fact (and think it is quite a significant matter) that the moment a personal costs order is made against a lawyer, a problem of conflict immediately arises between the lawyer and his client. Such conflicts do not assist the administration of justice. It therefore seems to me that it is not generally appropriate, except in a serious case and even then only when an application is made by a party, that consideration should be given to the imposing of a personal costs order. I am not, of course, saying that it is not open to the court to impose a personal costs order of its own motion. However, the Federal Magistrate did not proceed in this case to impose any personal costs order and so no consequence arises in that regard. It seems to me, having read carefully the material and having listened to the recording, that in the way in which the Federal Magistrate dealt with the matter, even if she might have desisted from raising the matter unless an application had been made, her conduct fell a very long way short of anything that could amount to actual or apprehended bias.

13 The appellant did raise some other matters specifically on the issue of bias. I have given consideration to all of those matters and again I think that they have no substance. One particular matter was the fact that, apparently, the Federal Magistrate had read the first of the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal, rather than the second decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, prior to the hearing and understood that that first decision was the decision under review. I have read the parts of the transcript relating to that matter and it seems to me that, again, it does not give rise to any claim of bias.</text>

<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; [2001] 179 ALR 425</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/28.html</AustLII>
<text>14 Submissions were put to me as to the precise test which applies in a case of bias. The appellant contended for a passage in the decision of the High Court of Australia in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex Parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; [2001] 179 ALR 425 at page 434 as the appropriate test. That test is "whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided". The conclusions I have arrived at apply if that is the correct test. However, whatever the correct test is, I still arrive at the same conclusions.

15 Another issue raised before me was whether the question of bias could be raised in this appeal, it having not been raised before the Federal Magistrate. In the light of my decision on the substance of the matter, I do not need to deal with this question.

16 The actual issues relating to bias are framed in grounds in the amended notice of appeal which are reproduced in the appellant's written submissions. Lest it should be thought by my summary approach to the issues that I have not considered the detail of those matters, I will now refer to the particular grounds, which are as follows:
 
 
 1. The decision of the Federal Magistrate should be set aside as there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Federal Magistrate in the way her Honour conducted the hearing. 
 
 2. The decision of the Federal Magistrate should be set aside as her Honour was biased against the Applicant's solicitor advocate.

17 The bias claims formed part only of grounds associated with the conduct of the hearing. There were two further grounds related to procedural fairness. They were as follows:
 

 
 
 3. The decision of the Federal Magistrate should be set aside as her Honour denied procedural fairness to the Applicant's solicitor advocate. 
 
 4. The decision of the Federal Magistrate should be set aside as there was a reasonable apprehension of serious negligence on the part of the Federal Magistrate in the way her Honour failed to prepare herself to conduct the hearing that might have caused a reasonable lay observer to conclude that the solicitor advocate's client that is the Appellant (a) might not get justice and/or (b) might not have his case properly dealt with by the Magistrate. Further, this also caused apprehension on the part of the Appellant's solicitor advocate that her Honour was not familiar with the case and thus did not fully grasp the issues and therefore the Appellant's case was not properly inquired into.

18 Although ground 4 is described in terms of serious negligence, when he was putting submissions to me, the appellant's solicitor said that this ground should be really understood as a further ground of denial of procedural fairness. For much the same reason as I have found that there is no basis for a claim of bias, it seems to me that both of these grounds should fail.

19 Ground 4 particularly raises the issue of the Federal Magistrate having read the wrong decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. I note, however, that her Honour specifically said to the parties that they should proceed on this basis, by which she must have been understood to have been saying that they should address her on the basis that at the time of the hearing she was not familiar with the terms of the reasons of the Refugee Review Tribunal. I also note that her Honour reserved her decision so that she had ample opportunity to read the reasons before giving judgment.

20 It is not, to my mind, any basis for a breach of procedural fairness to say that a judge has not read or fully understood the case to be put prior to coming on the bench. Indeed, my career at the bar extends back far enough to remember a time when that was usually the moment when judicial officers first learnt about a case that was before them.

21 It follows from the above that the four grounds relating to the conduct of the trial must fail.

22 I turn now to four grounds relating to the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. As my introductory remarks foreshadowed, it seems to me that this is a case in which, although the applicant had the opportunity to put a case on the facts a number of times to different bodies, namely the departmental delegate and to two differently constituted Refugee Review Tribunals, the reality is that he failed on these occasions to make out his case. I frankly think that the present grounds of appeal are really an attempt to cavil with the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal on the facts. If that is the case, then it is not surprising if they are unsuccessful. Nevertheless, I will address the particular claims that are made.</text>

<tocase>Syan v Refugee Review Tribunal (1995) 61 FCR 284</tocase>
<text>29 The crux of the argument put on behalf of the appellant is that before the second step was taken there should have been a positive determination on the first question as to whether there was detention or not. I do not agree that that is a necessary prerequisite to a consideration of relocation. In many cases it may be desirable for decision-makers to address the first question to conclusion, but I do not think that failure to do so gives rise to any relevantly appealable error. In coming to this conclusion I appear to be supported by the decision of this Court in Syan v Refugee Review Tribunal (1995) 61 FCR 284 and particularly some observations made by Beazley J at 288 and 290-291. It follows that the fifth ground of appeal cannot succeed.

30 The sixth ground of appeal is associated with the seventh and eighth grounds of appeal and I will set them out together:
 
 
 6. The learned Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it failed to ask two important questions in making a finding critical to its ultimate lack of satisfaction. 
 
 7. The learned Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find that in making a finding that the Tribunal may not accept that he would be even interested in legitimately expressing his political opinion in a manner that would bring him to the adverse attention of anyone should he return to India the Tribunal failed to ask an important question and thus made a jurisdictional error. 
 
 8. The learned Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find that in making the finding "I may not accept his alleged convictions were sufficiently strong such that their disregard may constitute persecution for him" the Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it: (a) failed to take relevant matters into consideration and; (b) took irrelevant matters into consideration.

31 So far as grounds 6 and 7 are concerned, they really depend upon an argument that the Tribunal did not address sufficiently what might be the process of reasoning flowing from findings relating to detention for two or three days and findings relating to the comparative level of political motivation of the appellant and his family. I must say I think these are classic examples of attempting to revisit the facts.</text>
