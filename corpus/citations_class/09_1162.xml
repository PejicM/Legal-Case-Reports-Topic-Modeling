<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/14.html</AustLII>
<text>As the Federal Magistrate noted at [16], the Tribunal did not consider that "businessmen in Nepal" constituted a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention but accepted that there might be some targeting of wealthy landowners or businessmen with anti-Maoist political affiliations by the YCL. The Tribunal concluded that, as the appellant did not claim to be a royalist or to have anti-Maoist affiliations, he was not at risk. This represents a fair summary of the Tribunal's reasons. This finding was open to the Tribunal based upon the evidence before it, including the country information to which the Tribunal referred in its decision. It was open to the Tribunal on material before it to determine whether or not there was a social group of "businessmen in Nepal" per se ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 at [81] ). The Tribunal did not fail to properly identify the social group to which the appellant belonged.

At the hearing of the appeal the appellant appeared in person assisted by an interpreter. He stated that he had claimed to be a Monarchist. However, there was no reference to such a claim in the Tribunal decision and the appellant could not show that any such claim had been advanced to the Tribunal. The appellant did claim in his protection visa application that he was accused of being a Monarchist; the Tribunal dealt with the appellant's claim that he was perceived as being a royalist. Ground 2 alleged breaches of ss 424 , 424A and 424B of the Act</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434</tocase>
<text>The procedural restrictions on the specific power to issue an invitation to give additional information under s 424(2) do not qualify the Tribunal's general power in s 424(1) to "get any information that it considers relevant" ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434 at [48]). Therefore, there was no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in the way in which it obtained the information. In any event, the request for information from DFAT was not a request for "additional information" from a "natural person" ( SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407). The first request or invitation to DFAT resulted in the provision of the information that the newspaper article was not genuine. The second request or invitation was made through DFAT to Mr Sharma. Insofar as it was a second request to DFAT, it was not from a natural person; to the extent that it was from Mr Sharma, it was not additional information. Consequently there was no breach of s 424(2) of the Act or, it follows, of s 424B.

In response to the s 424A letters and the provision of the DFAT documents which contradicted the appellant's documents, the appellant did not, by himself or through his migration agent, seek a further opportunity to give oral evidence. He was, however, given the opportunity to respond in writing ( SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434 at [51]).

Whether the relevant issue is the credibility of the appellant or the incident which the appellant originally said occurred on 28 January 2007, the subsequent documentation submitted to the Tribunal after the hearing did not raise a fresh issue. Where a document is submitted after the Tribunal hearing in relation to a pre-existing issue, either on request from the Tribunal or volunteered by an applicant, that does not, of itself, constitute a new issue. It is additional information about an extant issue ( SZKTI (2009) 258 ALR 434 at [51]). The contrary outcome would mean that, by proffering fresh documentation to the Tribunal, there would, of necessity, be a never-ending series of additional hearings required pursuant to s 425(1). That cannot be what that section envisaged.

The issues on the review conducted by the Tribunal in light of the documents submitted after the hearing remained the same as those that had been identified by the delegate and dealt with at that hearing and which, in turn, formed the focus of the hearing before the Tribunal. That was the credibility of the appellant's claims to persecution and the certainty of the dates upon which the incident on which those claims were based had allegedly occurred. The documents provided by the appellant, which the Tribunal found to be fraudulent, merely provided another particular of the appellant's lack of credibility on that issue.

At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant also alleged bias on the part of the Tribunal. When asked to give a basis for such an allegation, he said it was because the Tribunal rejected his claims. That does not establish bias.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>Federal Magistrate Raphael accepted that the Tribunal had miscalculated the date between the appellants' arrival in Australia and the making of the application for protection visas but did not accept that this constituted jurisdictional error, as it did not go to an integer of the appellants' claims ( Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [84] ).

Federal Magistrate Raphael concluded that the Tribunal's findings on credibility were opened to it. His Honour was satisfied that the relevant claims had been considered by the Tribunal.

The grounds of the notice of appeal are as follows: The Federal Magistrate erred by not finding that the second respondent had made jurisdictional error by finding that businessmen in Nepal did not constitute a particular social group by reference to persecution on the grounds of political opinion and without reference to the tests for the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of a "particular social group" as determined by High Court authority. The Federal Magistrate erred by not finding that the second respondent made jurisdictional error by failing to comply with ss 424 , 424A and 424B of the Act in relation to information obtained from Pokhara Daily Hotline in Nepal. The Federal Magistrate erred by not finding a breach by the second respondent of s 425 of the Act upon the basis of the statements of the Full Court of the Federal Court in SZKTI at [56].

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/63.html</AustLII>
<text>In any event, the question is whether the subject of the s 424A letters was part of an issue that had previously arisen and whether the appellant had an opportunity to deal with it during the hearing. The Minister submits that the issues arising on review before the Tribunal should be characterised as those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the appellant ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [35] ). The relevant issue, the Minister says, is whether the appellant had suffered the incident, which was also an issue before the original decision-maker, the delegate. The Minister submits that it is not appropriate to describe the issue as the authenticity of the documents submitted by the appellant. If that were the case, the Minister concedes that that issue, having been raised after the hearing, would have entitled the appellant to a fresh hearing pursuant to s 425 and the Tribunal decision would be affected by jurisdictional error.</text>

<text>At the end of the judgment, his Honour raised and addressed the application of ss 424 , 424A and 424B of the Act in relation to the information obtained by DFAT. His Honour referred to the decisions of the Full Court in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ; (2008) 168 FCR 256 and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 119 ; (2008) 170 FCR 236. His Honour concluded that the case before him could be distinguished from SZKCQ because ' here the information provided by the DFAT was crystal clear, and the basis upon which it had been obtained, namely the letter from the editor of the newspaper, was provided to the applicant. There is nothing more that the applicant could have gained from knowing what questions were asked of the editor by DFAT '. His Honour held that the s 424A letters complied with that section. His Honour's reasons indicate that he did not consider that s 424 of the Act applied to the information obtained by DFAT. Even if there had been a breach of s 424 , it is apparent from his Honour's reasons that he understood that the provision of the letters from the Tribunal to the appellant complied with obligations to afford procedural fairness. It followed that relief should be refused ( SZBYR v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] ).

To the extent that this ground of appeal may be referring to evidence given by the appellant's wife to the Tribunal, that has not been raised by the appellant. In any event, none of the evidence given by the appellant's wife could be said to constitute "information" that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision that was under review, the delegate's decision to reject the appellant's claims. The Tribunal merely found that it did not accept her claims and that she ' was prepared to fabricate her evidence in order to support the [appellant]'. The Tribunal's thought processes and appraisals of the evidence of the appellant's wife do not constitute information for the purposes of s 424A ( SZBYR at [18]). Ground 3 s 425 of the Act

This ground of appeal relates to the provision of the DFAT documents to the appellant after the oral hearing. The appellant contends that he should then have been invited to a further oral hearing to give evidence on the issue of whether the documents he submitted to the Tribunal were fraudulent.</text>

<text>At the end of the judgment, his Honour raised and addressed the application of ss 424 , 424A and 424B of the Act in relation to the information obtained by DFAT. His Honour referred to the decisions of the Full Court in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ; (2008) 168 FCR 256 and SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 119 ; (2008) 170 FCR 236.

It followed that relief should be refused ( SZBYR v Minister of Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] ).

It would seem by this ground that the appellant is referring to an issue raised by Raphael FM at the hearing, namely whether or not the information received by the Tribunal from DFAT (the newspaper article and the letter from Mr Sharma) was of the types of information considered in SZKTI or in SZKCQ .</text>

<tocase>SZMHU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1243</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/1243.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellants are citizens of Nepal who arrived in Australia on 22 April 2007. On 1 June 2007 the appellants lodged applications for protection visas which were refused by a delegate of the Minister on 24 August 2007. The appellants applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. The Tribunal upheld the decision of the delegate. On appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court, Raphael FM dismissed the appellants' application for review of the Tribunal decision ( SZMHU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1243).

The appellants are husband and wife. The appellant wife makes her claims as a member of the family unit of her husband ('the appellant'). The appellant claimed to fear persecution in Nepal on the basis of his imputed political opinion as a perceived Monarchist and his membership of a particular social group, being a businessman in Nepal. He claimed that he was a successful businessman and that, because of this, he became the subject of extortion threats from Maoists in Pokhara. He says that he was targeted by the Young Communist League ('YCL'), a Maoist offshoot, for extortion due to his perceived wealth. He claimed that he initially made the contributions but eventually decided to stop making any more contributions. As a consequence, his face was tarred and he was paraded around the town as a public humiliation ('the incident'). He claimed that an attempt to relocate to Kathmandu was not successful in avoiding the Maoists who discovered him there and subjected him to further extortion. He also claimed that the authorities were unable to protect him.

The delegate noted that the appellant claimed persecution on the grounds that he was perceived as an active Monarchist by the Maoists, that he belonged to the particular social group "businessmen in Nepal" and was targeted by Maoists for extortion. However, the delegate concluded that the appellant's claims lacked credibility and sufficient specific detail for him to be satisfied that the appellant faced a real chance of persecution because of his membership of a particular social group or because of an imputed political opinion. The reasons given by the delegate were, in summary: The appellant's passport had indicated that he departed Nepal on two different occasions and returned in July 2006 and in 2007. His voluntary return to Nepal suggested that he did not have a real fear of persecution in Nepal. The passport appeared to indicate that the appellant had returned to Nepal on 31 January 2007. It was therefore unlikely that his claim to have been harmed by the YCL in the incident on 28 January 2007 was true. The appellant's claims to have fled Pokhara because of threats from the Maoists were inconsistent with a document he provided which showed that once he left Pokhara, his brother took over the business and appeared to run it profitably.</text>
