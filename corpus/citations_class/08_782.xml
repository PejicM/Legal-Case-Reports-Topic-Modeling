<text>5 The Grounds of Appeal , it is considered, are but an impermissible attempt to review the factual merits of the decision reached by the Tribunal and should be rejected. A court conducting judicial review of an administrative decision must " beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision ": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The " weight " to be given to the evidence or particular pieces of information is for the Tribunal to assess: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [197] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 580. Justice Kirby there observed, in the context of those proceedings:
 [197] It may be accepted that, as the applicant submitted, much of the Tribunal's statement of reasons focuses upon what the applicant said about her husband's arrest and whether what she had said on that subject was to be believed. But it did this in the context of assessing whether her claims that she had been persecuted in the past should be accepted. The Tribunal's reasoning does not reveal any failure to take account of relevant matters or any taking into account of irrelevant matters. In the end, the criticisms made by the applicant of the Tribunal's reasoning are criticisms of the factual findings it made and are criticisms that fasten upon the weight that the Tribunal attributed to various pieces of information that it had available for consideration. But what weight the Tribunal gave to those various pieces of information was for it to say. 
The task of making findings of fact, including findings as to credibility, is for the Tribunal alone: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 552, 559.</text>

<text>11 These findings of the Tribunal were based upon a consideration of the entirety of the evidence which was placed before it, including the evidence advanced by the now Appellant. Those findings of the Tribunal were open to it to be made. Clearly, the ultimate findings and reasons were based upon an assessment of the Appellant's credibility. The task of making those findings has been entrusted to the Tribunal, and not the Federal Magistrates Court or (more relevantly) to this Court on appeal: Nguyen v Migration Review Tribunal [2008] FCA 524 at [15] per Logan J. Findings of credibility are findings " par excellence " entrusted to the Tribunal: Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 at [67] , 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J; SZKQQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 242 at [21] per Middleton J; SZEOQ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 257 at [27] per Lander J.</text>

<tocase>SZLHA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 143</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/143.html</AustLII>
<text>3 On 4 February 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the Tribunal's decision: SZLHA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 143. The Appellant now appeals to this Court. The handwritten Notice of Appeal sets forth the Grounds of Appeal as follows (without alteration):
 1. the Tribunal did not carefully consider the information which was in favour of the applicant. 2. the Tribunal no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision. 3. the Tribunal failed to grant to me a visa without any proper grounds or any proper investigation.

4 The Appellant appeared before the Court this morning unrepresented, but with the assistance of an interpreter.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/178.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In such circumstances it cannot be concluded that there was any failure on the part of the Tribunal to make a " proper investigation ". Nor was such a contention advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court. It should further be noted that even had the Appellant requested that a witness be called before the Tribunal, the Tribunal was under no duty to allow such evidence to be given: Migration Act 1958 (Cth), s 426(3). As was the like conclusion in VJAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178 , there is not considered in the present proceedings to be any reason to find that an obligation was imposed upon the Tribunal to call or to hear further evidence from the fellow Falun Gong practitioner referred to by the now Appellant.

22 The final ground is thus also rejected.

23 An Affidavit was filed in Court on the day of hearing seeking a fixed costs order in the event that the appeal was dismissed. That Affidavit sought a fixed costs order in the sum of $2,200. There is no reason to question that quantification.</text>
