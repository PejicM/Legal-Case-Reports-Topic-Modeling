<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1996) 85 A Crim R 500</tocase>
<text>15 The case for the Commission was, and remains, that the mischief involved is similar to that which was disclosed in Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd &amp; Anor (1996) 85 A Crim R 500. So it is that the submission of the Commission is that the following passage from the reasons for judgment in that case, at page 505, is apposite:
 What I need to determine, for the purpose of assessing penalty, is Cue's motive in involving itself in the dual-priced swing tags in the manner in which it did. If [the product manager] truthfully stated that it did not occur to her that members of the buying public would infer from the two prices that the garments had been on sale at the higher prices for any substantial period of time then she is either very naive or recklessly indifferent to the perceptions of the buying public.

16 Then a little later :
 In my opinion, the natural and probable consequence of a dual-priced swing tag is that members of the buying public would assume that the garment had previously been offered for sale at the higher of the two prices and was now available at the lower price.

17 Then a little later still, at page 508:
 I regard the conduct of the defendants as serious breaches of the TPA. It was conduct that preyed on the gullibility of the public.

19 The submission has been made on behalf of the Corporate Defendant that this particular feature of the case, which is not challenged by the Commission in terms of the factual accuracy of the response, is a matter going to mitigation in the sense that this is not a case where a diamond of at least a particular comparability in terms of type had never been offered for sale. I agree, and I do take that into account in mitigation of penalty. That is not to say, however, that there is not a discrete vice revealed by the conduct of the same ilk as that revealed in the Cue case.

20 So far as penalty is concerned, one is constrained to have regard to particular factors by the terms of s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ("Crimes Act") . Other judges of this Court have taken the view that the factors listed in s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act are not exhaustive of considerations that are relevant in the imposition of penalty in respect of a Federal offence. I respectfully agree. In particular, one does not see, in s 16A , a reference to general deterrence as a sentencing consideration, nor does one see reference to having regard to the objects of the statute which makes provision for the particular Federal offence.

21 In this instance, it is relevant to recall that a particular purpose of the Trade Practices Act is consumer protection. Further, offences against the Trade Practices Act are not always easy to detect or, at least, insofar as they are detected, involve a considerable investment in public funds in their investigation and prosecution. The Trade Practices Act also represents a value judgement by the Australian Parliament as to particular standards of commercial morality that should obtain in our country. I bear all of these factors in mind in relation to sentencing, apart from having regard to s 16A(2), list of factors.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Proprietary Limited [2004] FCA 1750</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/1750.html</AustLII>
<text>29 I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Proprietary Limited [2004] FCA 1750 , 30 December 2004, under the heading "Parity", Bennett J, with respect, helpfully, surveyed a number of authorities which dealt with the question of penalty in the context of that case. There was some submission made to me that a like exercise might be undertaken in this case by reference to the circumstances of and the sentences imposed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1343 , and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Proprietary Limited [2002] FCA 1552.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1343</tocase>

<text>29 I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Proprietary Limited [2004] FCA 1750 , 30 December 2004, under the heading "Parity", Bennett J, with respect, helpfully, surveyed a number of authorities which dealt with the question of penalty in the context of that case. There was some submission made to me that a like exercise might be undertaken in this case by reference to the circumstances of and the sentences imposed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Skippy Australia Proprietary Limited [2006] FCA 1343 , and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Proprietary Limited [2002] FCA 1552.

30 It seems to me, though, that the circumstances of this case have a uniqueness which limits the utility of that exercise. I have noted, however, and see force in the submission made on behalf of the Corporate Defendant, that so far as the Allans Music case is concerned, this ought not be approached on the basis that one is sentencing a defendant who has demonstrated market power. Equally, I see force in the submission that there was an additional aggravating quality in the Skippy case, lent by the threat posed to the safety of children by the nature of the conduct in respect of the product in question.

36 It seems to me that were I to impose individual penalties in this case, of an order that would reflect a proportion of the maximum, the aggregate result would be out of all relationship with the gravity of the criminal conduct, having regard to the totality principle. That being so, I have, in reflecting upon the application of s 4K and that totality principle, come to a view that I ought to impose but one penalty and that that penalty should be $220,000. In coming to that view, I have considered those cases in respect of penalty to which I've referred already, namely, the Skippy case and the Allen's Music case although, as I have observed, it seems to me that there is a uniqueness about this case which does limit the utility, even in a proportionality exercise.

37 The submission that was made on behalf of the Commission is that a short time ought to be allowed in respect of the payment of the penalty by way of fine. One aspect of that short tine that was put forward was 14 days, although, I did not detect any particular rigidity in that reference, as opposed to the submission that it should not be so long as to allow the Defendant anything more than a reasonable opportunity to ascertain whether or not it was indeed in a position to meet the amount of the fine. The submission made on behalf of the Defendant was that one ought to allow one month. Given the amount of the fine that I have come to regard as appropriate and the facts - little though they may be - that are known to the Court in relation to the Corporate Defendant, it would be in the interests of justice to allow that slightly longer period of one month. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
