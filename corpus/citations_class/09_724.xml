<tocase>Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1325</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1325.html</AustLII>
<text>Where the Court is informed that each adult member of the representative group has been advised on an individual basis as to the merits of the claim and has expressly consented to the terms of the proposed settlement, the Court need not look beyond that express consent when considering an application under s 33V: Neil v P &amp; O Cruises Australia Limited [2002] FCA 1325 at [8] - [9] . This is the case in the present application.

The trial of the proceedings began on 16 April 2009 and proceeded into the second day on 17 April 2009. After the second day the trial was adjourned and a mediation was conducted on 28 April 2009 by Registrar Moore. At that session an offer was made by the first, second and third respondents (the said respondents) that caused the mediation to be adjourned until 20 May 2009.

Following the first session of the mediation, the solicitors for the applicant sought advice from counsel in relation to the settlement offer made by the said respondents. A written advice was provided by counsel and was supplied to all 19 group members. The group members were also given the opportunity to ask questions of and consult with their lawyers regarding the litigation.</text>

<tocase>Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) (2000) 180 ALR 459 ; [2000] FCA 1925</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1925.html</AustLII>
<text>The involved parties have gone further to seek to persuade the Court in oral and written submissions by senior counsel for the applicant that, on the merits, the agreement is indeed fair and reasonable: see Williams v FAI Home Security Pty Ltd (No 4) (2000) 180 ALR 459 ; [2000] FCA 1925 at [19] . A number of matters were advanced in support of this conclusion.

The first matter was the consent of the group members to the settlement in the circumstances outlined above. Next it was contended that the complexity and potential duration of the litigation made it reasonable to settle. The trial had at least 10 more days to run with the attendant costs.

Then, the applicant pointed to the risk of failing to establish liability. Even if liability were established, in relation to quantum there were alternative bases proposed in the applicant's case upon which damages could be assessed. On one measure, taking the difference in capital value as the basis of the assessment of damages, the damages would have amounted to a little over a million dollars. On the alternative basis of assessing the shortfall in return as against the promised return made in the alleged representations, the range of outcomes would have been from around $292,000 to $814,000. The settlement figure falls approximately just under halfway within the range.</text>
