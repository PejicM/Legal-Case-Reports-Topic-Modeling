<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/67.html</AustLII>
<text>In Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 a Full Court observed (at [24]-[25]) that existing authority established that in determining whether particular proceedings are in fact vexatious, a court may take account of proceedings in other courts where, for example, they have authoritatively resolved the particular issue against the person instituting the proceedings. The Full Court also noted that the expression "habitually and persistently" implies more than "frequently", and suggests a degree of stubbornness on the part of the person in question. The element "without any reasonable ground" is of course to be determined objectively. It is immaterial that the person may believe in the justice of his or her argument, and may not understand that the argument has been authoritatively rejected.</text>

<tocase>Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100; (1843) 67 ER 313</tocase>
<text>Mr Singh is therefore confronted with the fact that, by reason of his failure to read the SSAT's reasons for decision, or to have them translated to him, he did not raise, on merits review, an argument that would have been open to him. This brings into play the estoppel discussed in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. There the High Court accepted as correct the extended principle expressed by Sir James Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 at 115; (1843) 67 ER 313 at 319: 
 
 "where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time."

In Anshun , the Court found that the principle laid down in Henderson extended beyond res judicata. That broader form of estoppel applies to this case. I note that Ryan J, in his reasons for directing non-acceptance of process given on 8 March 2006, relied upon Anshun . Had Mr Singh read the 13 May 2002 reasons for decision, he would have seen the sentence to which he now objects. He could then, as part of ordinary merits review, have challenged the correctness of the assertion contained within it, and arguably gained some support for his broader challenge to the 4 November 1999 decision. His failure to read the reasons for decision, whether through "negligence, inadvertence or even accident" led to his not having raised the point at a time when something could have been done about it. He cannot now, years later, having failed at all stages to demonstrate relevant legal error, come back to the Tribunal, and thence to this Court, with a point that should have been raised long before this.</text>

<text>Section 42B(1)(b) must be applied having regard to a fundamental principle of the rule of law. Every person has a right to apply to a tribunal, or a court, to seek remedies in consequence of an alleged infringement of his or her rights. Because a direction given under s 42B(1)(b) denies a person this right, it is a remedy that should not be invoked except in an extreme case.

<tocase>Secretary, Department of Social Security v Cunneen [1997] FCA 1033 ; (1997) 78 FCR 576</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1997/1033.html</AustLII>
<text>The Tribunal summarised Mr Singh's contentions as follows. He claimed that the application that he brought before the SSAT differed from his earlier applications because it raised a new and different issue, namely whether the payment of $129,382.87 (which he received as a lump sum) was a "lump sum compensation payment" or whether it was "arrears payments for the social security purposes". He further claimed that he was seeking, by the current proceedings, to have determined whether a decision of the Federal Court, Secretary, Department of Social Security v Cunneen [1997] FCA 1033 ; (1997) 78 FCR 576, was correct.

The Tribunal concluded that Mr Singh was attempting again to review decisions that had previously been made by Centrelink, by the Tribunal itself, by the Federal Magistrates Court and by this Court regarding his compensation recovery. It found that Mr Singh believed that he had a right to bring this latest proceeding because he was of the view that there had been a "conspiracy and fraud on the part of Centrelink and the Insurer". The Tribunal referred to the various documents lodged by Mr Singh, noting that they contained inflammatory and derogatory references regarding the conduct of officers of Centrelink, the Workers' Compensation insurer and his former solicitors. According to the Tribunal, Mr Singh alleged conspiracy, lies, fraud, betrayal of trust, deception and that innocent injured workers had been cheated.

The Tribunal noted that s 42B of the AAT Act was rarely invoked. It referred to dictionary definitions of the terms "frivolous" and "vexatious" and said (at [35]): 
 
 "I am of the view, having regard to the history of the proceedings initiated by Mr Singh, that his intended application is in fact both frivolous and vexatious."</text>

<text>Mr Singh then appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court seeking to revoke the orders made by consent by Finkelstein J. That appeal was dismissed by Beaumont, Kiefel and Hely JJ on 21 September 2001: Singh v Secretary, Dept of Family &amp; Community Services [2001] FCA 1281.

Following further requests from Mr Singh, Centrelink wrote to him on 22 January 2002 stating that it had reviewed his case and decided not to change its decision to recover a compensation debt of $88,633.34. Mr Singh asked that the matter be referred to an authorised review officer. On 4 February 2002, an authorised review officer informed Mr Singh that he had no power to review the matter as it had already been reviewed by the SSAT, as well as the Tribunal itself. Mr Singh then lodged a further application with the SSAT on 19 February 2002. The SSAT decided on 13 May 2002 to again affirm the decision under review.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1685.html</AustLII>
<text>It is necessary to set out something of the background to this matter. Gray J summarised a large part of that background in his judgment dated 23 December 2004: Singh v Secretary, Department of Family &amp; Community Services [2004] FCA 1685. The Tribunal also summarised the history of this matter in its decision dated 3 July 2006.

Mr Singh was born in 1950. He was employed by the Public Transport Corporation from 1983, initially as a tram conductor, and later as a tram driver.

On 2 January 1991, Mr Singh suffered a work-related injury, which resulted in an ongoing medical condition. Between 12 June 1991 and 30 November 1993, following an admission of liability, Mr Singh received weekly compensation payments from an insurer, pursuant to the Accident Compensation Act 1985 (Vic).

Mr Singh then lodged a further appeal to the Tribunal, which on 17 December 2002 affirmed the decision of the SSAT dated 13 May 2002. On 2 January 2003, Mr Singh appealed to the Federal Court seeking to set aside the Tribunal's decision of 17 December 2002. On 19 March 2003, I ordered that Mr Singh's application be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. On 5 December 2003, Hartnett FM dismissed the appeal with costs: Singh v DFCS [2003] FMCA 566.

<tocase>Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 189</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/189.html</AustLII>
<text>Undaunted, on 6 February 2006 Mr Singh sought to issue a further notice of motion. That matter was heard in chambers by Ryan J who on 8 March 2006, directed the Registrar not to accept the notice of motion: Singh v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2006] FCA 189.

In the interim, on 31 October 2005 Mr Singh wrote to a delegate of the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services requesting a recalculation of the compensation debt. A Centrelink officer refused that request, citing the various decisions previously made by the Federal Court. That decision was affirmed on review by an authorised review officer, and on 22 March 2006, on appeal to the SSAT.

It was against that decision of the SSAT of 22 March 2006 that Mr Singh sought review in the Tribunal. That application resulted in the Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations making an application to the Tribunal to have Mr Singh's application dismissed as frivolous and vexatious, and to have him prevented, without leave, from re-agitating the issues that have given rise to the numerous proceedings identified above.

The Tribunal conducted a hearing on 19 June 2006. Mr Singh applied at the outset to have the Tribunal member, Mr John Handley, disqualified from hearing his application because Mr Handley was not "independent" having previously dealt with one of Mr Singh's many applications in relation to this matter. Eventually, Mr Singh withdrew that application and, as the Tribunal records (at [5]), consented to the matter proceeding before Mr Handley.

In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal set out in some detail the history of Mr Singh's attempts to avoid having to repay the various sums totalling $88,633.34. It noted that he had provided some 300 pages of documents in support of his application to review the decision of the SSAT dated 22 March 2006, and that when he discovered that the respondent would seek to have his application summarily dismissed he wrote attaching another 68 documents. In addition he subsequently provided the respondent with a further 17 page document and, when the hearing commenced, lodged a further seven page document being the contentions upon which he relied.

The Tribunal added that the application brought by Mr Singh was in its view "obviously untenable" and "utterly hopeless". It referred to the "repetitious appeals" lodged by Mr Singh as having no merit, and to the order of Ryan J on 8 March 2006 that the most recent application to this Court not be accepted because it amounted to an abuse of process. It described Mr Singh's constant attempts to re-litigate issues that had been conclusively determined against him as a waste of public resources, involving the harassment of persons, and as an abuse of process.

It formulated its direction preventing him from bringing further proceedings, without the leave of the Tribunal, with some care. Its aim was to ensure that Mr Singh was not precluded from seeking review of decisions that were unrelated to those that were the subject of the numerous challenges brought by him in recent years.

Mr Singh appeared before me without legal representation. He had the assistance of an interpreter, but generally seemed well able to communicate in English.</text>
