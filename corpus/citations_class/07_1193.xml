<tocase>NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1</tocase>

<text>15 The appellant also relied upon the following passages in the Full Court decision in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [55] :
 
 Where the tribunal fails to make a finding on "...a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts" that failure can amount to a failure to accord procedural fairness and a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction... 

And at [63]:
 
 A failure by the tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which, if resolved in one way, would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act and thereby a jurisdictional error.

16 I am prepared to accept that discrimination was raised by the appellant but only in a very general and background way, and not so much as a claim which was a "substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts". I do not characterise, unlike the federal magistrate, the matter of discrimination as a claim which necessarily required the detailed treatment as sought by the appellant. The main focus of the claim was the real chance of persecution and fear of physical harm. The general discrimination complained of by the appellant was to lead to such physical harm. This is the gist of the complaint made by the appellant in his statutory declaration on 1 June 2004 when he declared:
 
 On my return back to Bangladesh, I have real chance of being persecuted because of my community profile. My life will be under threat. There is no safety and security of life in Bangladesh for an activist like me. I shall be arrested and put into jail in relation to the false cases. I have no future in Bangladesh. I shall be discriminated in every walks of my life. My life will be in jeopardy. Under these circumstances I firmly believe that my case has merit to be considered.

17 The question of general discrimination before the Tribunal arose because the appellant confirmed that he believed Buddhists were subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh. The Tribunal said:
 
 The Applicant confirmed that he believed that Buddhists were subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh. The Tribunal confirmed that the Applicant was an ethnic Bengali, and alerted him to independent information from sources such as the United States, United Kingdom, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch which described particular problems for Bangladeshi Buddhists from the Chittagong Hill Tracks ('tribals'). These sources referred to discrimination against minority groups generally, but did not refer to any persecution of Bengali Buddhists. The Applicant said his village in particular was not a good place for Buddhists. There were Muslims and Buddhists living there, but Buddhist religious programs had been threatened.</text>

<tocase>WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630</tocase>
<text>14 The principles of law were not in contention between the parties. In both the appellant's and the first respondent's written submissions, reference was made to the decision of the Full Court in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630, which provides that an inference may be drawn that the Tribunal did not consider a particular issue if it fails to deal directly with that issue in its reasons: at [47]. However, the Full Court also observed:
 
 But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point. It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.

21 Even if one treated the question of general discrimination as being a substantial, clearly articulated argument, as the Full Court cautioned in WAEE 75 ALD at [47], an inference that the Tribunal did not consider such a particular claim is "not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point".</text>
