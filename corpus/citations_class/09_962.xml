<text>It is certainly the case that, traditionally, there is a distinction in the manner in which appellate courts treat an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure as is the case before me and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights (cf Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, In re the Will of FB Gilbert (dec) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323). However I accept the submission of Mr Merrell, supported by Mr O'Grady, that it is incumbent on the appellate court to carefully examine each case before it, and identify whether an error has been made in exercising the discretion. As was observed by Atkin LJ in Maxwell v Keun [1928] 1 KB 645 at 653: 
 The other point that was made by the defendants was that this was a discretionary order and that the Court of Appeal ought not to interfere with the discretion of the learned judge. I quite agree the Court of Appeal ought to be very slow indeed to interfere with the discretion of the learned judge on such a question as an adjournment of a trial, and it very seldom does do so; but on the other hand, if it appears that the result of the order made below is to defeat the rights of the parties altogether, and to do that which the Court of Appeal is satisfied would be an injustice to one or other of the parties, then the court has power to review such an order, and it is, to my mind, its duty to do so.

<text>The decision of a judge to adjourn a hearing is not only an interlocutory decision, it is a discretionary decision ( Aon [2009] HCA 27 at [5] , Goldberg v Morrow [2004] FCA 1490 at [36] , Trivett v Zoccoli [2002] WASCA 138 ). Appeals against an exercise of discretion are governed by established principles: House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504. As Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ observed in the following well-known passage: 
 It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is reasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred. (at 504-505)</text>

<text>There is strong authority that the discretion in respect of ordering or refusing an adjournment miscarries where the refusal of an adjournment results in one of the parties being unable adequately to present his case ( Thornberry v R (1995) 69 ALJR 777).

<tocase>Lennox v Amcor Limited trading as Amcor Cartonboard [2009] FCA 959</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/959.html</AustLII>
<text>Earlier today I urgently granted the applicant leave to appeal from two decisions of a Federal Magistrate in respect of related proceedings. In those decisions his Honour had refused applications, supported by both parties, to adjourn the trial of the substantive proceedings in both cases. The background to the applications before me is set out in detail in Lennox v Amcor Limited trading as Amcor Cartonboard [2009] FCA 959.

Pursuant to s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from a judgment, other than a migration judgment, of the Federal Magistrates Court is to be exercised by a Full Court unless the Chief Justice considers that it is appropriate for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the appeal to be exercised by a single Judge. The Chief Justice has so directed in this case.

In Court this afternoon the applicant filed the notices of appeal in respect of which leave had previously been granted, citing the following grounds of appeal: The learned Federal Magistrate erred in law by not according natural justice to the Applicant. In refusing the application made by the Applicant to vacate prior orders and adjourn the trial, the learned Federal Magistrate erred as a matter of law by failing to take into account: that the Court had been appraised of the parties' non-compliance with the pre-trial directions orders on or by 4 August 2009; the severe and prejudicial consequences of the refusal for the Applicant and for the Respondent; the effect of the refusal on the likely length and cost of the trial.

The applicant has sought the following orders: That the decision to refuse the application be set aside. That the orders sought in the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 19 August 2009 be made. That the decision to refuse the stay the trial pending the outcome of this appeal be set aside. That the costs of this appeal be costs in the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding BRG649/08.

Such further or other orders as the court sees fit. The orders sought in the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 19 August 2009 were as follows: By 14 September 2009 each party make discovery on oath in accordance with the categories described in Schedule hereto. Each party shall produce disclosed documents for inspection in accordance with Federal Court Rules by 4.00 pm on 21 September 2009. The trial of this proceeding will be conducted on the basis that the evidence-in-chief of each witness to be called by the parties will be given by affidavit. That the witnesses' affidavit be exchanged as follows: the Applicant file and serve the affidavit of any proposed witness by 19 October 2009; the Respondent file and serve the affidavit of any proposed witness by 4 November 2009; and the Applicant file and serve any affidavits in reply to the Respondent's affidavits by 13 November 2009. The parties are to exchange outlines of argument 7 days prior to the commencement of the hearing.</text>
