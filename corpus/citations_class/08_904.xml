<tocase>Re RUDDOCK (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/60.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) was explained by Gummow and Heydon JJ, with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed, in Re RUDDOCK (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 ('Ruddock') at [56] as follows:
 '56 ... The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate. Further, ... administrative decision-making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures. There, the court has to decide where, on the balance of probabilities, the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial.'

26 The relevant criterion for the grant of a protection visa to which s 65(1)(a)(ii) refers is to be found in s 36(2) of the Act, which relevantly, for present purposes, provides as follows:
 '36(2) A criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is: 
 
 
 (a) a non-citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a non-citizen in Australia who is the spouse ... of a non-citizen who: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) is mentioned in paragraph (a); and 
 (ii) holds a protection visa.' 
 
 


 
The Refugees Convention means the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 and the Refugees Protocol means the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on 31 January 1967. Hereafter I will refer to the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol as 'the Convention'.

28 As has been said many times, proceedings in the Tribunal are not adversarial, but rather, inquisitorial. The Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant. The Tribunal member conducting the relevant inquiry is not an adversarial cross-examiner, but an inquisitor obliged to be fair (see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Ruddock at [57]).
 
The Tribunal conducting an inquisitorial hearing is not obliged to prompt and stimulate an elaboration which an applicant chooses not to embark on. It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she may wish to advance before the Tribunal and for the Tribunal to decide whether the relevant claim has been made out (see per Gummow and Heydon JJ in Ruddock at [57]-[58]).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/794.html</AustLII>
<text>27 Plainly, satisfaction under s 65(1) is not to be addressed by deciding where the truth lies on the balance of probabilities. Whilst cases such as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam [1999] FCA 794 ; (1999) 93 FCR 220 ('Rajalingham') refer to the 'civil standard of proof' being not irrelevant to the process of fact-finding by the Refugee Review Tribunal and cases such as Kalala v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1594 ; 114 FCR 212 ('Kalala') refer to the Tribunal being obliged to consider matters on 'a standard less than the balance of probabilities' (see at [25]), I doubt the utility of addressing matters on which the Tribunal has to be 'satisfied' by a standard which is related to the standard of proof required in adversarial civil litigation.

84 Reference was made to Sackville J's leading judgment in Rajalingam where 'what if I am wrong?' terminology had been used. In SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 Bennett J referred to Sackville J's distillation of principle in Rajalingam as follows, at [46] and [48]:
 '46 In Rajalingam Sackville J, with whom North J agreed, discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider, in its assessment of well-founded fear ..., whether there is "real doubt" that findings of fact as to past events were correct. At [60] Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred, even though it finds that those events probably did not occur. If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence, it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true. ... ... 48 ... Where the Tribunal is unsure as to whether events occurred, as understood from its reasons, it is obliged to consider the possibility that its finding of fact might not have been correct. The Tribunal then considers the chance of an applicant's persecution in the future on a standard less than the balance of probabilities ... In Kalala conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to whether certain events did nor did not take place were attended by significant doubt. At [6]-[7] North and Madgwick JJ stated [in Kalala] that: 
 
 There may be a real and substantial basis for thinking that past events, having a character relevant for the applicant's future, may have occurred notwithstanding either that the truth of the matter cannot be established or that it is actually unlikely that those events did occur. The same is true of imputing a relevant character to past events which themselves are either not in doubt or as to which it has been recognised that there is at least a real and substantial basis for concluding that they may have occurred. 
 
 
 
 If there is, in the sense mentioned, an unacceptable risk that the events occurred or had such character, they are to be taken into account in assessing whether there is a real chance of Convention-related harm to the applicant. If there is a real chance that some event occurred or bore a certain character, that circumstance may powerfully affect the assessment of whether fear of future harm befalling an applicant, if returned to his or her country of nationality, is well-founded.

<tocase>NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/6.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In NAGV and NAGW of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 6 ; (2005) 222 CLR 161 ('NAGV') the High Court considered s 36(2) of the Act in the form in which it existed prior to the passage of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth). Relevantly, for present purposes, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ said at [31]-[33]:
 '31 ... a perusal of the Convention shows that, Art 33 apart, there is a range of requirements imposed upon Contracting States with respect to refugees some of which can fairly be characterised as "protection obligations". Free access to courts of law (Art 16(1)), temporary admission to refugee seamen (Art 11), and the measure of religious freedom provided by Art 4 are examples. 32 ... Section 36(2) does not use the term "refugee". But the "protection obligations under [the Convention]" of which it does speak are best understood as a general expression of the precept to which the Convention gives effect. The Convention provides for Contracting States to offer "surrogate protection" in the place of that of the country of nationality of which, in terms of Art 1A(2), the applicant is unwilling to avail himself. That directs attention to Art 1 and to the definition of the term "refugee". 33 Such a construction of s 36(2) is consistent with the legislative history of the Act. This indicates that the terms in which s 36 is expressed were adopted to do no more than present a criterion that the applicant for the protection visa had the status of a refugee because that person answered the definition of "refugee" spelt out in Art 1 of the Convention.' (Footnotes omitted)

30 Article 33(1) of the Convention, to which reference was made in NAGV , provides:
 
 
 '1. No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.'

31 The question of who answers the description of a 'refugee' is relevantly determined by Article 1of the Convention which relevantly provides:
 
 
 'A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term "refugee" shall apply to any person who: 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 (2) ... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence ... is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.'

47 After the applications for protection visas in NAGV were lodged, new subsections (3)-(7) were inserted into s 36 of the Act by the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Act 1999 (Cth), which new subsections commenced on 16 December 1999. These subsections were included as part of ' Part 6 Amendments to prevent forum shopping'. Another provision inserted into the Act as part of Part 6 was s 91M which formed part of a new 'Subdivision AK Non-citizens with access to protection from third countries'. That section provided:
 
 
 '91M This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that a non-citizen who can avail himself or herself of protection from a third country, because of nationality or some other right to re-enter and reside in the third country, should seek protection from the third country instead of applying in Australia for a protection visa, or, in some cases, any other visa. Any such non-citizen who is an unlawful non-citizen will be subject to removal under Division 8.'

48 The legislative purpose recorded in s 91M is consistent with the legislative intention which is evident in s 36(3) of the Act i.e. to tighten up the circumstances in which non-citizens in Australia may become entitled to the grant of protection visas.

49 Section 36(3) of the Act provides:
 
 
 '36(3) Australia is taken not to have protection obligations to a non-citizen who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a right to enter and reside in, whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed, any country apart from Australia, including countries of which the non-citizen is a national.'</text>

<text>32 The definition of 'refugee' is couched in the present tense and the text indicates that the position of the putative refugee is to be considered on the footing that that person is outside the country of nationality. The reference then made in the text to 'protection' is to 'external protection' by the country of nationality, for example by the provision of diplomatic or consular protection, and not to the provision of 'internal protection' provided inside the country of nationality from which the refugee has departed (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 ('Khawar') at [62], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 40 ; (2007) 237 ALR 634 ('SZATV') at [16]).

33 The definition of 'refugee' presents two cumulative conditions, the satisfaction of both of which is necessary for classification as a refugee. The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality 'owing to' fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason, which is well-founded both in an objective and a subjective sense. The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself 'of the protection of' the country of nationality. This includes persons who find themselves outside the country of their nationality and in a country where the country of nationality has no representation to which the refugee may have recourse to obtain protection. The second condition also is satisfied by a person who meets the requirements of the first condition and who, for a particular reason, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; that particular reason is that well-founded fear of persecution in the country of nationality which is identified in the first condition (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Khawar at [61], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [16].

The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality 'owing to' fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason, which is well-founded both in an objective and a subjective sense. The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself 'of the protection of' the country of nationality.

35 Because it is the primary responsibility of the country of nationality to safeguard fundamental human rights and freedoms, the international responsibility has been described as a form of 'surrogate protection'. 'Protection' in that sense has a broader meaning than the narrower sense in which the term is used in Art 1A(2) but, so long as the two meanings are not confused, it is a concept that is relevant to the interpretation of Art 1A(2) (per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in S152 at [20]. See also per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [20]).

36 It is well settled since Chan and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 ('Guo') at 571-2, 596 that the requirement that the 'fear' be 'well-founded' adds an objective requirement to the examination of the facts and that this examination is not confined to those facts which form the basis of the fear experienced by the particular applicant (per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [18]). A fear is 'well-founded' where there is a real substantial basis for it (see Guo at 572).</text>

42 In Chen Chi Hai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293 ('Chen') at [13] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ summarised the findings of the Court in Applicant A as follows:
 '13 It was held in Applicant A that the "common thread" which links "persecuted", "for reasons of" and "membership of a particular social group" in the Convention definition of "refugee" dictates that "a shared fear of persecution [is not] sufficient to constitute a particular social group".' (Footnotes omitted.)

43 In relation to membership of a particular social group, McHugh J said in Applicant A at 259-260:
 'Courts and jurists have taken widely differing views as to what constitutes "membership of a particular social group" for the purposes of the Convention. This is not surprising. The phrase is indeterminate and lacks a detailed legislative history and debate. Not only is it impossible to define the phrase exhaustively, it is pointless to attempt to do so. Records of the Convention's preparation, which are legitimate interpretative material under Australian law, reveal that the category of "particular social group" was the last of the enumerated grounds in Art 1A(2) to be added and that it was added with the intention to broaden the reach of the other four grounds. However, nothing in the prior history or the record of the Convention supports the conclusion that the category of "particular social group" was added to provide a safety-net for all persons subject to persecution who did not fall within the other enumerated grounds ...'

44 In addressing the phrase 'particular social group' Dawson J said in Applicant A at 241:
 '... The adjoining of "social" to "group" suggests that the collection of persons must be of a social character, that is to say, the collection must be cognisable as a group in society such that its members share something which unites them and sets them apart from society at large. The word "particular" in the definition merely indicates that there must be an identifiable social group such that a group can be pointed to as a particular social group. A particular social group, therefore, is a collection of persons who share a certain characteristic or element which unites them and enables them to be set apart from society at large. That is to say, not only must such persons exhibit some common element; the element must unite them, making those who share it a cognisable group within their society. I can see no reason to confine a particular social group to small groups or to large ones; a family or a group of many millions may each be a particular social group. Nor is there anything which would suggest that the uniting particular must be voluntary. ...'

45 In Applicant A Gummow J expressed his agreement with the following observations of Burchett J in relation to the meaning of persecution in Ram v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 57 FCR 565 at 568:
 'Persecution involves the infliction of harm, but it implies something more: an element of an attitude on the part of those who persecute which leads to the infliction of harm, or an element of motivation (however twisted) for the infliction of harm. People are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors. Not every isolated act of harm to a person is an act of persecution.' 
(see per Gummow J in Applicant A at 284.)

75 It then proceeded to address persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal said:
 'It was submitted that 'the victim of the Maoist atrocities can be classified as a particular social group ...' 
In the light of Applicant A and Chen , as quoted above, it would seem to me that persons, albeit victims, with a shared fear of persecution could not constitute a particular social group. 
 
The Tribunal went on to say:
 '... Other possible particular social groups arising on the facts are 'business people in Nepal' and 'wealthy Nepalis.''</text>

The first condition is that a person be outside the country of nationality 'owing to' fear of persecution for a relevant Convention reason, which is well-founded both in an objective and a subjective sense. The second condition is met if the person who satisfies the first condition is unable to avail himself or herself 'of the protection of' the country of nationality.

The second condition also is satisfied by a person who meets the requirements of the first condition and who, for a particular reason, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of nationality; that particular reason is that well-founded fear of persecution in the country of nationality which is identified in the first condition (per McHugh and Gummow JJ in Khawar at [61], cited with approval by Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in SZATV at [16]. See also Chan Yee Kin v The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 ('Chan'), Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ('Applicant A') at 283 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 [2004] HCA 18 ; (2004) 222 CLR 1 ('S152') at [19]).

34 Where diplomatic or consular protection is available, a person must show, not merely that he is unwilling to avail himself of such protection, but that his unwillingness is owing to his fear of persecution. He must justify, not merely assert, his unwillingness. A claimant's unreasonable refusal to seek the protection of his home authorities would not satisfy the requirements of Art 1A(2) (per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in S152 at [19]).

35 Because it is the primary responsibility of the country of nationality to safeguard fundamental human rights and freedoms, the international responsibility has been described as a form of 'surrogate protection'. 'Protection' in that sense has a broader meaning than the narrower sense in which the term is used in Art 1A(2) but, so long as the two meanings are not confused, it is a concept that is relevant to the interpretation of Art 1A(2) (per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ in S152 at [20].

<text>41 Any inquiry concerning causation arising in an extortion case must allow for the possibility that the extortive activity has a dual character it may be motivated by a personal interest on the perpetrator's part but may also be Convention-related (see Rajaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 62 ALD 73 per Finn and Dowsett JJ at [46]-[48]). Where the extortive activity has a dual character, s 91R(1)(a) requires that the Convention reason must be the 'essential and significant reason'.</text>

<text>42 In Chen Chi Hai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293 ('Chen') at [13] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ summarised the findings of the Court in Applicant A as follows:
 '13 It was held in Applicant A that the "common thread" which links "persecuted", "for reasons of" and "membership of a particular social group" in the Convention definition of "refugee" dictates that "a shared fear of persecution [is not] sufficient to constitute a particular social group".' (Footnotes omitted.)

75 It then proceeded to address persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group. The Tribunal said:
 'It was submitted that 'the victim of the Maoist atrocities can be classified as a particular social group ...' 
In the light of Applicant A and Chen , as quoted above, it would seem to me that persons, albeit victims, with a shared fear of persecution could not constitute a particular social group. 
 
The Tribunal went on to say:
 '... Other possible particular social groups arising on the facts are 'business people in Nepal' and 'wealthy Nepalis.''</text>

<tocase>Ram v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 57 FCR 565</tocase>
<text>45 In Applicant A Gummow J expressed his agreement with the following observations of Burchett J in relation to the meaning of persecution in Ram v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 57 FCR 565 at 568:
 'Persecution involves the infliction of harm, but it implies something more: an element of an attitude on the part of those who persecute which leads to the infliction of harm, or an element of motivation (however twisted) for the infliction of harm. People are persecuted for something perceived about them or attributed to them by their persecutors. Not every isolated act of harm to a person is an act of persecution.' 
(see per Gummow J in Applicant A at 284.)

46 In relation to membership of a particular social group, Gummow J opined at 285 that numerous individuals with similar characteristics or aspirations did not comprise a particular social group of which they were members. Once again, his Honour expressed agreement with a passage from the judgment of Burchett J in Ram at 569 as follows:
 'There must be a common unifying element binding the members together before there is a social group of that kind. When a member of a social group is being persecuted for reasons of membership of the group, he is being attacked, not for himself alone or for what he owns or has done, but by virtue of his being one of those jointly condemned in the eyes of their persecutors, so that it is a fitting use of language to say that it is "for reasons of" his membership of that group.'</text>

<tocase>SZHWI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] 95 ALD 631</tocase>
<text>57 In SZHWI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] 95 ALD 631 Allsop J considered the position of an appellant who was a citizen of Nepal and within the purview of the treaty with India. His Honour considered, at [23], that the Tribunal had failed to address one of the elements of s 36(3): that the appellant had not taken all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter India. He was not prepared to draw the conclusion that the failure by the Tribunal to address the relevant element could be excused because it was effectively conceded or not in issue.

58 With great respect to his Honour, I would take the view that it was for the first appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that the criterion for a protection visa prescribed by s 36(2)(a) of the Act had been satisfied and that required the first appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that he had not been excluded from eligibility for a protection visa by his failure to take all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter and reside in, relevantly, India.

59 No evidence was advanced by the first appellant to suggest that (say) there had been an outbreak of avian influenza in India with the consequence that there were no steps available to the first appellant to enter and reside in India. The finding of the Tribunal contained in its 'Conclusions' namely 'Having considered the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the first named applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention' was sufficient to support an inference that the Tribunal was not satisfied that the first appellant had taken all possible steps to avail himself of a right to enter and reside in India in circumstances where his evidence had been as recorded in the Tribunal's reasons:
 'The applicant stated that they had no relatives there, no links, and he would have to start from scratch. He said "we can't do business there".' 
The natural inference from this evidence is that, firstly, the first appellant took no steps and, secondly, he failed to establish that there were no possible steps available to him which he could have taken.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1332.html</AustLII>
<text>61 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Applicant C [2001] FCA 1332 ; (2001) 116 FCR 154 ('Applicant C') Stone J, with whose reasons for judgment, Gray and Lee JJ relevantly agreed, held that the primary judge had been correct in his interpretation of s 36(3). The primary judge had said (see [2001] FCA 229 at [30] ):
 '30 A literal construction of the word "right" in a statute must, in my view, be that it is a legally enforceable right. The extraneous materials to which I have referred above tend to support a literal construction. So does the fact that a literal construction would advance the purposes of the Refugees Convention whereas to construe the word "right" as meaning something less than a legally enforceable right would place much greater obstacles in a refugee's path.'

62 For my part I would have taken the view that the passages from the tabling speech referred to above demonstrate a clear intention on the part of the legislature that much greater obstacles should be placed in a putative refugee's path. Be that as it may, it is important to note that in Applicant C Stone J said at [60]:
 '60 It should also be recognised that a right of entry such as I have postulated may arise other than by grant of a visa. A country's entry requirements may be met by proof of identity and citizenship of a nominated country being provided at the border, for example by production of a valid passport, without the necessity for a visa. This would explain the use in s 36(3) of the phrase, "however that right arose or is expressed".'

63 In WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 ('WAGH') Lee J adhered to the construction of 'right' in s 36(3) which he had given when concurring with that part of the reasons of Stone J in Applicant C which addressed that matter. Carr J considered that Applicant C was authority for the proposition that the word 'right' in s 36(3) meant a legally enforceable right, albeit one that could be revoked (at [74]).

65 His Honour proceeded to refer to the leading judgment of Stone J in Applicant C and then said at [56]-[58]:
 '56 In the course of her judgment her Honour said, in a passage quoted by the learned primary judge at [65]: 
 
 The combination of the amendments to s 36 and the doctrine of effective protection leads to [t] his position. Australia does not owe protection obligations under the Convention to: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a person who can, as a practical matter, obtain effective protection in a third country; or 
 (b) a person who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in a third country. 
 
 
 57 It is true that the court affirmed the decision of the learned primary judge in that case. I am not sure that the reference to "effective protection" can, however, be ignored. In any event, after V872/200A the comments of Stone J should, in my view, be read so as to include (if not already comprehended by (a)), a category of persons of whom it can be said that while they have not, in a strict sense, a legally enforceable right, the factual situation is that they are likely to be afforded entry to the third country and as a matter of practical reality, have effective protection there. If there is any conflict between Applicant C and V872/00A I would follow the latter and later case. 58 One reason why a strict construction can not be given to the word "right", so that it is to be read as "legally enforceable right" is that all countries retain as a matter of sovereignty a right to exclude persons from the country. It would be unlikely in many cases that a visa would give a legally enforceable right, although as a matter of practical reality it would be virtually certain that the person in question would be permitted entry.'

66 In its reasons for decision in the present case, the Tribunal said in the section of its decision headed 'FINDINGS AND REASONS':
 'DFAT advised on 23 October 2006 that Nepalese citizens do not require a visa to enter India, and if travelling by air, it is necessary only to produce a valid national passport ... The Tribunal also accepts that a Nepalese citizen can fly directly to India from Australia provided they are in possession of a valid Nepalese passport ... The Tribunal finds that the applicant and his wife have valid current Nepali passports, and they could fly directly to India from Australia. ... The Tribunal finds that the applicant and his wife ... would not be denied entry to India, and they could live there indefinitely.'

67 The Tribunal also found that India accepted the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal and that the Treaty had been incorporated into the domestic law of India and, as such, could be accessed by the first appellant. In the circumstances, if it were necessary to find that the first appellant had a right of entry as explained by Stone J in Applicant C then no more was required than the matters which the Tribunal found (see in particular at [60] in Applicant C ).

97 The Tribunal did not err in finding, as it did, that the first appellant had a legally enforceable right to enter and reside in India pursuant to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal, in the sense which Stone J described in Applicant C at [60].

98 In my opinion grounds 3 and 4 fail. Accordingly, the alternative basis for affirming the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, as set out in paragraph 2 of the Notice of Contention, should be upheld. The appellants conceded that, if grounds 3 and 4 failed, the appeal should be dismissed.

99 In all the circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding ninety-nine (99) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Graham.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/194.html</AustLII>
<text>63 In WAGH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 194 ; (2003) 131 FCR 269 ('WAGH') Lee J adhered to the construction of 'right' in s 36(3) which he had given when concurring with that part of the reasons of Stone J in Applicant C which addressed that matter. Carr J considered that Applicant C was authority for the proposition that the word 'right' in s 36(3) meant a legally enforceable right, albeit one that could be revoked (at [74]).

64 Hill J dealt with the matter more extensively in WAGH at [54]. His Honour said:
 '54 The word "right" tends to suggest, prima facie, a legally enforceable right. However, it was held by a Full Court of this court in V872/00A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 185 ; (2002) 122 FCR 57 that "right" as used in the subsection did not mean legally enforceable right of entry and re-entry to a safe third country. The ratio of that decision in the narrowest sense is that s 36(3) will operate in a case where not only is there a legal right of entry but also where, absent a legally enforceable right of entry the person is likely to be allowed entry to the third country and is likely, as a matter of practical reality to have effective protection there and not be subject to refoulement contrary to Art 33 of the Convention: see per Black CJ at [5] and per Tamberlin J at [83], where his Honour said that the question is whether there was "any real risk that the applicant would not be able to secure access to that country so as to attract its protection". ...'

69 In WAGH at [66], Hill J expressed the opinion that the Tribunal had committed an error by ignoring altogether the requirement of s 36(3) that an applicant have not merely a right of entry, but also a right to reside in the other country. I respectfully agree that a right of residence within the meaning of the subsection is not sufficient. However, there can be no foundation for the suggestion that one has to find a separate right of entry and a separate right of residence. The Tribunal was entitled to find as it did that the appellants had a right to enter and reside in India.

70 The STATEMENT OF DECISION AND REASONS of the Tribunal has been recorded on some 28 pages of closely typed script. For present purposes it is sufficient to note the following extracts from the country information referred to:
 'Something interesting is happening these days in otherwise turbulent Nepal. Instead of incessant headlines about senseless killings and human-right abuses on a daily basis, there is news of peace parleys and multilateral dialogue. This seemingly non-violent face is a u-turn for a war-torn country so often described as a nation on the brink of collapse, a failing state. In what appears to be a major breakthrough in the decade-long civil war, the ruling pro-democratic seven-party alliance (SPA) and the insurgent Maoists decided on 8 November 2006 to disarm under United Nations supervision. The 35,000 "regular" Maoist guerrillas will be kept in seven cantonments around Nepal and their arms will be locked up. ...'

71 Another report referred to in the country information included:
 'The Maoists' 10-year journey from the jungle to government was partly a result of compulsion and partly political wisdom. After 10 years of fighting, the loss of 13,000 lives and massive damage to the country's infrastructure and economy, they were still unable to capture even a district headquarters, let alone the power in the centre. ...'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/49.html</AustLII>
<text>68 Turning to (c), my attention has been drawn to the decision of Federal Magistrate Smith in SZFKD v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 49 in which the learned Federal Magistrate expressed the view that s 36(3) required consideration to be given to whether there was relevantly a right to enter India as well as a right to reside in India. In my opinion s 36(3) does not call for a consideration of two separate rights. The issue is simply whether there was a right to 'enter and reside' in India. Apart from other considerations, if two rights were in contemplation, one would have expected the legislature to have expressed itself, later in the subsection, by referring to 'however those rights arose or are expressed' rather than, as it did, by using the singular, namely 'however that right arose or is expressed'.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/570.html</AustLII>
<text>84 Reference was made to Sackville J's leading judgment in Rajalingam where 'what if I am wrong?' terminology had been used. In SZCOS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 570 Bennett J referred to Sackville J's distillation of principle in Rajalingam as follows, at [46] and [48]:
 '46 In Rajalingam Sackville J, with whom North J agreed, discussed the various observations concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to consider, in its assessment of well-founded fear ..., whether there is "real doubt" that findings of fact as to past events were correct. At [60] Sackville J distilled those observations into the principle that there are circumstances in which the Tribunal must take into account the possibility that alleged past events occurred, even though it finds that those events probably did not occur. If the Tribunal makes an adverse finding in relation to a material claim of an appellant but is unable to make the claim with confidence, it must proceed to assess the claim on the basis that the claim may possibly be true. ... ... 48 ... Where the Tribunal is unsure as to whether events occurred, as understood from its reasons, it is obliged to consider the possibility that its finding of fact might not have been correct. The Tribunal then considers the chance of an applicant's persecution in the future on a standard less than the balance of probabilities ... In Kalala conclusions reached by the Tribunal as to whether certain events did nor did not take place were attended by significant doubt. At [6]-[7] North and Madgwick JJ stated [in Kalala] that: 
 
 There may be a real and substantial basis for thinking that past events, having a character relevant for the applicant's future, may have occurred notwithstanding either that the truth of the matter cannot be established or that it is actually unlikely that those events did occur. The same is true of imputing a relevant character to past events which themselves are either not in doubt or as to which it has been recognised that there is at least a real and substantial basis for concluding that they may have occurred. 
 
 
 
 If there is, in the sense mentioned, an unacceptable risk that the events occurred or had such character, they are to be taken into account in assessing whether there is a real chance of Convention-related harm to the applicant. If there is a real chance that some event occurred or bore a certain character, that circumstance may powerfully affect the assessment of whether fear of future harm befalling an applicant, if returned to his or her country of nationality, is well-founded.
