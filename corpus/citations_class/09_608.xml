<tocase>Bilfinger Berger Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia (2008) 176 IR 121</tocase>
<text>In Bilfinger Berger Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia (2008) 176 IR 121 the Full Court of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission considered whether an employer's business comprised one or more business. At [3] the Full Bench observed that the evidence revealed that each of the five businesses conducted by the employer had separate resources, budgets, profits, employees, cost centres and billing centres. The respondent contended that the business of the employer was 'a multiple-business '.

The Full Bench observed several obstacles with the respondent's submission. At [21] it stated: 
 The first difficulty is that despite the fact that s 331 has been in the Act in one form or another since 1993, the construction has apparently never been adopted. Counsel were unable to point to a single instance of a multiple-business agreement applying to only one employer.

The Full Bench continued at [22]-[23]: 
 A further difficulty with the interpretation is that it gives rise to the possibility of a multiplicity of single businesses, and collective agreements, depending upon how an employer chooses to structure its operations. It would also introduce an element of unpredictability and caprice into the application of the agreement-making provisions depending upon the operating structure used by the employer.
 The interpretation would also give rise to a conflict between the operation of the multiple-business provisions and the definition of single business in s 322(1)(a). The terms "business, project or undertaking" in s 322(1)(a) should not be given a technical meaning. We think that the term "business" and perhaps also the term "undertaking" are capable of referring to the whole of the operations of one employer. While management jargon might support a narrower view, we think it is consistent with normal usage to describe the disparate operations of a single employer as that employer's business.</text>

<text>In Ricochet Pty Ltd and Others v Equity Trustees Executor and Agency Company Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ rejected the submission that, in accordance with the observations of Wilson J in Gould v Vaggelas (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236-238 the trial judge was bound to infer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the appellants had been induced by the representations to enter into the lease in question. Their Honours said at 234: 
 On the question of proof of inducement, the judgment of Wilson J in Gould v Vaggelas makes the point that a combination of factors may, if unanswered, lead to the conclusion that a person was induced by the representation of another to make the relevant decision.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/9.html</AustLII>
<text>In Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations v Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd and Another; Gribbles Radiology Pty Ltd v Heath Services Union of Australia and Another [2005] HCA 9 ; (2005) 222 CLR 194 at [39] the High Court said: 
 The "business" of an employer may be constituted by a number of different assets, both tangible and intangible, that are used in the particular pursuit, whether of profit (if the "business" is a commercial enterprise) or other ends (if the activity is charitable or the "business" of government). In the case of a commercial enterprise, identifying the employer's "business" will usually require identification both of the particular activity that is pursued and of the tangible and intangible assets that are used in that pursuit. The "business" of an employer will be identified as the assets that the employer uses in the pursuit of the particular activity. It is the assets used in that way that can be assigned or transmitted and it is to the assets used in that way that an employer can be a successor.</text>

<tocase>National Union of Workers v Coles CDC Eastern Creek Pty Limited [2009] FCA 523</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/523.html</AustLII>
<text>Whilst this submission was not advanced to any significant degree, the Court observes that in National Union of Workers v Coles CDC Eastern Creek Pty Limited [2009] FCA 523 Graham J considered a submission to the same effect. His Honour at [50] dismissed the fact that certain employees engaged at a particular location would not have a ' reasonable opportunity to decide ' because of their voting power. His Honour found such claim lacked any substance.

No authority has been quoted in support of such proposition, nor is there any evidence to support the submission that Luxottica had, as asserted by the AMWU, ' deliberately ' structured the proposed agreement to deny the laboratory employees a ' reasonable opportunity ' to decide to approve or to reject the proposed agreement. The claim that the vote of the laboratory employees would be completely irrelevant because they comprised a minority of the total number of employees is without evidential foundation.

Pursuant to s 340(2)(b) of the Act an employee collective agreement may be made provided it is approved by a majority of employees. The vote of each member is of equal value and pursuant to s 340(2)(b)(i) of the Act the majority of those persons who vote will determine whether the agreement is to be made.

In National Union of Workers v Coles CDC Graham J considered the prospect of a multiple-business at [44]. His Honour said: 
 ...one might contemplate an employer which, within one company, carried on a media business, a pastoral business and a gambling business. Would those together constitute a single business, each being 'part of a single business' or, would they be three separate single businesses? Whilst it may be arguable that the three businesses were, for the purposes of the Act, a single business, with the answer to the question depending upon the unique facts of the given case, I am inclined to the view that there would be three separate 'single businesses' for the purposes of the Act.

Mr Fretwell testified that the laboratory maintains a record of the costs of its operations including expenses, wages, rent, waste, electricity and other general costs. A record is also maintained relating to service and material charges made against a particular order received from a retail outlet. The material costs relate to the provision of spectacles and lenses which are ground, coated, edged and assembled to frames. The spreadsheet records all items of expenditure and notional income. Luxottica produced a budget forecast entitled ' Eyebiz Q2 Forecast ' which was a forecast and budget for labour costs and unit costs being the costs incurred in the processing of each order.

The laboratory does not maintain any bank account and if cash is required for its operations it is supplied by a Luxottica retail cheque which is then cashed by the laboratory. No cash transactions take place between the retail outlets and the laboratory. Instead, an electronic record is maintained by the laboratory of the charges made for each order fulfilled by the laboratory.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/60.html</AustLII>
<text>Luxottica submits that the Court would have no jurisdiction to make orders of the kind sought by the AMWU since the vote for the collective agreement has not been taken and nor has Luxottica taken any steps to submit the agreement to the Workplace Authority Director for approval pursuant to s 340 of the Act. In particular, the respondents relied upon the observations of Dawson J in Oil Basins Limited v The Commonwealth of Australia and Other [1993] HCA 60 ; (1993) 178 CLR 643 at 649. In view of the findings of the Court made above it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the question whether the Court would, if either of the AMWU's submissions had been upheld, have had power either under the Act or pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act to grant injunctive or declaratory relief.

<tocase>Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 42 ; (2008) 166 FCR 562</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/42.html</AustLII>
<text>In Shop Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 42 ; (2008) 166 FCR 562 ( Karellas No. 2 ) the Full Court (Moore, Marshall and Tracey JJ) said at [54]: 
 His Honour had regard to the likely effect of the information on employees. We consider that his Honour was correct to do so. An employee who is given false and misleading information that may affect his or her decision on whether to approve an agreement is, by the very provision of that information, denied a reasonable opportunity to decide whether to approve the agreement. That is, because there is information available to the employee which has the capacity to distract him or her on voting on the agreement and from considering its actual effect. A decision that is capable of being affected by false and misleading information is not a decision about approving the agreement, but a decision about extraneous matters not given effect to by the agreement.

In applying such principle, it is necessary to consider the evidential onus upon the AMWU. That is, whether, on the balance of probabilities, the inference is established that the statements were inaccurate.</text>

<tocase>Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No. 2) (2007) 166 IR 51</tocase>
<text>Mr Green's statement contained at paragraph seven of his affidavit, reproduced at [19] above, is the only evidence that any employee might have been misled, assuming the statements to be wrong. The Court is mindful of the finding of Graham J at [49] in Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association v Karellas Investments Pty Ltd (No. 2) (2007) 166 IR 51 (' Karellas No. 1 ') where his Honour said: 
 In the absence of any evidence whatsoever as to the effect of any of the matters or alleged misinformation on the minds of any of the Karellas' employees, the likely effect of such alleged misinformation has to be considered.

The Court is required to consider whether the statements are likely to have misled the employees. The Court could conclude, upon a review and comparison between the Award and the current or proposed agreement that the rates of pay presented by the Award are clearly less advantageous to the employees of Luxottica, and that if employees believed that Luxottica would revert to the Award, they would be likely to be misled into voting for the agreement proposed. However, the Court must have some evidence before it that the employees were aware that the proposed agreement was clearly more advantageous to the Award, that is, whether the employees were aware of the content of the Award. In Karellas No. 1 the information provided to the employees was sufficient to enable the Court to find that it was misleading and was likely to ' distract ' the employees. For example, the employees were told the agreement would provide a pay rise over the previous agreement when it did not. Graham J had before him all the evidence necessary to decide the ' likely effect ' of such misinformation upon the minds of the employees. It was self-evident that the misinformation was likely to have provided an incentive to vote for the agreement. Without similar evidence the Court is unable find the ' likely effect ' of the alleged misinformation, since any such finding would be wholly speculative. The evidence is inadequate to warrant a finding that the statements caused employees to be distracted in their voting.</text>

<tocase>TNT Management Pty Limited v Brooks (1979) 23 ALR 345</tocase>
<text>In short, the Court is, on the evidence, unable to find that ' there is information available to the employee which has the capacity to distract him or her on voting on the agreement and from considering its actual effect ' (see Karellas No 2 at [54]) without knowing whether the employees knew of the content of the Award. More than mere conjecture is required to establish the facts relied upon in order that the Court might grant relief: see TNT Management Pty Limited v Brooks (1979) 23 ALR 345 per Gibbs CJ at 350; West v Government Insurance Office of NSW at 66. Mr Green's affidavit merely makes reference to the Award without any indication of his knowledge of its contents. This vital aspect is left entirely to speculation.

For the above reasons, the claim that the information provided by Luxottica to its employees was misleading thereby failing to provide them a ' reasonable opportunity to decide ' fails. Dilution of votes

As a second basis for the claim that the employees were not afforded a ' reasonable opportunity ' it is submitted that the voting power of those at the laboratory would be overwhelmed by the votes of other employees engaged in other activities of Luxottica, namely the distribution warehouse and the retail outlets. That is, their vote would be diluted in consequence of the votes of the other employees.</text>
