<tocase>Citicorp Australia Ltd v O'Brien (1996) 40 NSWLR 398</tocase>
<text>20 Counsel for the third respondent submitted that the duties which were owed by a solicitor were ascertained by reference to the scope of the retainer. Counsel relied in particular upon the following observations of Sheller JA in Citicorp Australia Ltd v O'Brien (1996) 40 NSWLR 398 at 418:
 
 'The solicitor's duty is found in the terms of the retainer and the ambit of any additional assumed responsibility relied upon.'

21 Further, counsel for the third respondent also relied upon observations in a number of authorities in support of a submission that, unless specifically retained to do so, a solicitor was not responsible for giving financial advice, advising about investments or, when retained to advise on or prepare a document, the commercial merits or wisdom of the underlying transaction.</text>

<tocase>Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp (A Firm) [1979] 1 Ch 384</tocase>
<text>27 The submissions of counsel for the applicants are to be accepted. The scope of any retainer and the scope of the implied duty to carry out the retainer with reasonable care, depends upon the facts peculiar to the relationship between the solicitor and the client in each case. As Oliver J said in Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp (A Firm) [1979] 1 Ch 384 at 402:
 
 'There is no such thing as a general retainer in that sense. The expression "my solicitor" is as meaningless as the expression "my tailor" or "my bookmaker" in establishing any general duty apart from that arising out of a particular matter in which his services are retained.'</text>

<tocase>Dalleagles v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 4 WAR 325</tocase>
<text>28 The applicants' proposition is that a solicitor, acting reasonably, would obtain instructions directly from a client, when that solicitor is retained by an agent of the client, and the carrying out of retainer has the propensity to benefit that agent. In my view, it cannot be said that the applicants' proposition is so untenable as to result in their application being summarily terminated. In my view, it is arguable that there was a duty on the third respondent to obtain instructions directly from the applicants, as an incident of the implied duty to carry out his retainer with reasonable care and skill. Further, in my view, it is also arguable that, in the circumstances of this case, had that duty been carried out, the advice duties pleaded at pars 32.3, 32.4 and 32.5 could also have arisen ( Dalleagles v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 4 WAR 325 at 332-333; Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15 ; (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 574). It follows that I do not accept that the claim against the third respondent should be struck out on the grounds that no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or that the claim is frivolous or vexatious.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1439</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1439.html</AustLII>
<text>34 In my view, the following observations of Dowsett J at [303] in Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1439 are relevant in this context:
 
 'It is quite possible that the act of a natural person respondent on behalf of a corporation will constitute a contravention of the Act by that corporation, and yet the natural person respondent will be found not to have been knowingly concerned in that contravention. In the case of representations as to existing facts, this is because it is not necessary to show that the respondent corporation knew of the misleading nature of the statement in question, but knowing involvement predicates such knowledge on the part of the relevant natural person. The matter is even more complex in the case of representations as to future matters. A representation on behalf of a corporation will constitute a contravention if the corporation fails to show reasonable grounds for it. However a natural person respondent bears no onus of proof. It will be necessary for ACCC to demonstrate that such a person: 
 
 
 
 &#61863; knew that the representation was made; and either: 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#61863; knew that it was misleading; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 &#61863; knew that the corporation had no reasonable grounds for it.'

35 The applicants have in par 37 of the statement of claim only relied upon the making by Dultona of future representations as the conduct comprising the breach of the TP Act. There is no pleading in par 37 of there being any absence of reasonable grounds for Dultona making the representations as to the future.</text>

<tocase>Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>36 There is no plea in par 38 that the third respondent knew of the future representations and, also, importantly there is no plea that the third respondent knew that there were no reasonable grounds for the making of those representations. The absence of pleas to that effect are fatal to any attempt to plead a claim against the third respondent based on an allegation that the third respondent was knowingly concerned in, or a party to, the misleading or deceptive conduct of Dultona ( Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 670).

37 It follows that par 37 and par 38 of the statement of claim will be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, but I will give the applicants leave to amend the statement of claim. The third respondent's motion will otherwise be dismissed. I will hear the parties on the question of costs.
