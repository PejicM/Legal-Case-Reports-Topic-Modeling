<text>2 The only remaining question is one in relation to costs. I have been referred to the decision of Burchett J in One-Tel v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 which was followed by Weinberg J in Australian Consumer &amp; Competition Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] FCA 396. I think the principles in that case are applicable in this matter. The general principle is, of course, that costs should follow the outcome, and the outcome in this case is that the applicant was successful and has achieved the result for which the proceedings were instituted.</text>
