<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFDJ [2006] FCAFC 53</tocase>

<text>50 In my opinion, the appellant was, by the answer given by the Tribunal, denied the chance of establishing those two facts before the Tribunal. If it had been established that the document was authentic, the Tribunal might not have made the adverse credit findings. That being the case, in my opinion, the appellant has been denied a fair hearing and the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error. Not every statement made by the Tribunal to an applicant which is factually incorrect or may mislead will give rise to a finding that the Tribunal has fallen into jurisdictional error. The statement or representation must give rise to unfairness in the sense that the applicant was denied a fair hearing: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZFDJ [2006] FCAFC 53 at [30] . Insofar as the Federal Magistrate said otherwise I think, with respect, he has fallen into error.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2001) 168 ALR 407 </tocase>

<text>28 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal was entitled to make a finding adverse to the appellant regarding his credibility which he said was a function of the Tribunal: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2001) 168 ALR 407 at 423 per McHugh J.

29 The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's complaints insofar as the appellant sought a rehearing on the merits.

30 Similar matters are raised in the notice of appeal. The thrust of the appellant's complaints on appeal is that the Tribunal erred in (a) finding that the document was a forgery; (b) failing to accord the appellant procedural fairness that it might find the document to be a forgery; (c) failing to allow the appellant to present arguments relating to the issues as required under s 425 of the Act; and (d) failing to investigate the authenticity of the document pursuant to s 427(1)(d) of the Act. Insofar as the Federal Magistrate rejected those arguments, it is said that the Federal Magistrate fell into error.</text>

<tocase>VAAC v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/74.html</AustLII>
<text>41 It was put that the second and third grounds of appeal were not raised before the Federal Magistrate. The respondent objected to the appellant raising these grounds for the first time, especially in circumstances where the appellant has not explained why the matters were not raised on the application before the Federal Magistrate: VAAC v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168.

42 The third ground of appeal was abandoned. Section 425 was in different form when the Tribunal undertook its review. It then provided:
 
 425. (1) Where section 424 does not apply, the Tribunal: 
 
 (a) must give the applicant an opportunity to appear before it to give evidence; and
 (b) may obtain such other evidence as it considers necessary. 
 
 (2) Subject to paragraph (1)(a), the Tribunal is not required to allow any person to address it orally about the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.

43 There was not then a statutory obligation to invite an applicant to present arguments relating to the issues. For that reason, that ground was rightly abandoned. Ground 2 was, I think, raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and could be the subject of an appeal.</text>

<tocase>WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/171.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The appellant has relied upon WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 where the Court found the Tribunal to be in breach of procedural fairness by failing to allow an applicant an opportunity to respond to its conclusion that documents which were submitted to the Tribunal at the Tribunal's request after the hearing were a forgery.

40 In this case, however, the Tribunal did not find the document to be a forgery. Rather, it refused to accept it as evidence in support of the appellant's credibility. Moreover, in this case, contrary to the facts in WACO [2003] FCAFC 171 ; 131 FCR 511, the Tribunal raised its concerns with the appellant about the status of the document during the hearing.</text>
