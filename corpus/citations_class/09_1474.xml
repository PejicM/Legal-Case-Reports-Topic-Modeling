<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1208.html</AustLII>
<text>In Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2009] FCA 1208 , Mr Brian Culley brought an appeal to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act"). The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent ("ASIC") which prohibited Mr Culley from managing a corporation for a period of two years. The delegate's decision was made under s 206F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act").

Mr Culley appealed to this Court on six questions of law. The first four questions arose from matters dealt with in the Tribunal's reasons. Each was resolved adversely to Mr Culley.

The fifth and sixth questions asked: 
 
 "(5) Whether the statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act is subject to an implied requirement that it be exercised within a reasonable time; and 
 

 
 
 (6) Whether the respondent failed to exercise its statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act within a reasonable time".</text>

 "It follows from what we have said that we do not see the problem facing the taxpayer as simply being that he has sought in this Court to raise fresh arguments not put to the AAT. It is not simply a matter of whether the AAT would have found in favour of the taxpayer had the arguments been put and whether raising those arguments before the Court creates "prejudice" to the Commissioner. The issue in the present case is, in the context of the relevant provisions of the [ Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth)], whether the AAT erred in law by not addressing the arguments now sought to be raised ... In our view, it did not".

<tocase>Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334</tocase>
<text>A distinction has been drawn, in the authorities, between findings which the Tribunal is bound to make for the purposes of a particular case and those which it is not required to make. In the former case a question of law may be found to arise notwithstanding the failure of the parties to raise the issue before the Tribunal and the failure of the Tribunal to deal with it. Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 was such a case. There Bowen CJ said (at 343) that: 
 
 "In my opinion a party is not necessarily precluded by the conduct of his case before the Tribunal from arguing on "appeal" matters conceded below. If he is successful then the decision of the Tribunal may be overturned found in some way to be wrong in law, even though that error may have been substantially contributed to by the conduct of the case by the party in question. In other words, the conduct of the party's case before the Tribunal goes to this Court's discretion to what course it will take given that there has been an error rather than to the question as to whether the Tribunal really made an error. 
 

 
 
 The case before this Court is not merely one of parties agreeing upon what facts should be decided by the trier of fact, nor a case of facts, peculiarly within the knowledge of the party, being conceded. Rather, there was a clear statutory precondition upon which the Tribunal had to be satisfied and enough material and evidence before it to raise the issue independently of the parties' submissions. In these circumstances it was an error of law not to consider and decide the issue of immigrant status. Whether or not that error should lead to the decision of the Tribunal being set aside and the matter remitted to it depends in my view upon principles similar to those expressed by Dixon J in Burston's case and by the same judge in Orr v Holmes [1948] HCA 16 ; (1948) 76 CLR 632 , at p 640 "to fulfil an imperative demand of justice...".

In Kuswardana the Tribunal had to make a determination as to whether or not the applicant before it was an 'immigrant' because the application of the statutory provisions which the Tribunal was applying depended on an answer to that question.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor [1982] FCA 99 ; (1982) 42 ALR 209</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1982/99.html</AustLII>
<text>These powers must be read in context. They are not as expansive as might at first appear. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor [1982] FCA 99 ; (1982) 63 FLR 441 at 454 Sheppard J said that: 
 
 "It is in my opinion not correct to say that this court is by these provisions given wide powers to make such order as it thinks fit. Implicit in its power are a number of restrictions. The appeal is expressly limited to error of law, which alleged error is the sole matter before the court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal. The order which this court can make after hearing the appeal is also similarly restricted to an order which is appropriate by reason of its decision. It follows that the only order which can be properly made is one the propriety of which is circumscribed by and necessary to reflect this court's view on the alleged or found error of law. To go further I would see as amounting to exceeding the jurisdiction of this court under this section. A power to make "such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision" is much more restrictive than a power "to make such order as it sees fit" or a power "to make a decision in substitution for the decision" the subject of the appeal. Section 44(5) confirms, though it states that it does not purport to limit, this as an appropriate reading of the power in s. 44(4) when it limits its statement of the express power of the court when setting aside a decision to the making of an order remitting the case to be heard again. Having set aside a decision, it has no express power to substitute what it sees as the correct decision unless such is the appropriate order by reason of its decision on the point of law in the context of the particular proceedings...".

It is not disputed that the "reasonable time" point could have been taken before the Tribunal. Had it been, the Tribunal would have been in a position to find the facts which are set out in my earlier judgment at [43]-[52] and determined whether, as a matter of law, ASIC had failed to comply with the implied obligation contained in s 206F of the Act and what, if any, consequences should follow. The Tribunal did not consider the point and make any findings because Mr Culley did not raise it.</text>
