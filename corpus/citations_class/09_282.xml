<tocase>Aston v Harlee Manufacturing co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1960/47.html</AustLII>
<text>In Malibu Boats West Inc v Catanese (2000) 51 IPR 134 it was said by Finkelstein J, at [25]: 
 ... Proprietorship can arise in one of two ways. In the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the "author" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1986) 32 Ch D 311 at 319; Seven-Up Co v OT Ltd [1947] HCA 59 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; [1947] ALR 436 ( Seven-up Co); Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 626 [1948] HCA 27 ; ; [1949] ALR 661 ; 1A IPR 438 ( Shell Co of Australia ). Authorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark. A person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 [1960] HCA 47 ; ; [1960] ALR 605 citing Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corp Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202 ( Re Registered Trade Mark "Yanx"). A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.

For Danley, it was submitted that: 
 It cannot affect the Applicant's proprietorship of the trade mark in Australia, by authorship or by first use, that the trade mark belongs to one of the Respondents in foreign countries. Indeed, it is clear that the owner of a trade mark in Australia "... may be the "author" of a trade mark, although he has deliberately copied or adapted a mark registered in a foreign country in respect of the same description of goods. [ Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400].

It was accepted that: 
 It would be otherwise if the foreign owner (one of the Respondents or a company associated with them) had previously used the mark in Australia.

In Aston it was said by Fullagar J, at 400: 
 Again, it is otherwise if the opponent or person aggrieved has used the mark, for prior user by the foreign proprietor negatives the claim of the Australian applicant to "authorship". But the user must be user in Australia: the most extensive user by another person in foreign countries will not avail by itself to defeat an applicant for registration in this country. It has been said, however, that the Courts frown on these borrowings from abroad, and very slight evidence of user in Australia has been held sufficient to protect the proprietor of a foreign trade mark: The Seven Up Co v O.T. Ltd [1947] HCA 59 ; [(1947) 75 CLR 203 at 211]... But, where there has clearly been no user at all in Australia, an applicant for a trade mark identical with a mark registered in a foreign country is entitled to be regarded, so far as Australia is concerned, as the "author" of the mark. I can see no reason why that should not be so. 
 (See also the case of Thai Gypsum Products Co Ltd v Waring and Gillow Pty Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 99).

It was submitted that the respondents used the Trade Mark "Pecaform" in 33 countries, and they have used "Pecaform" and "Pecafil" in 66 countries. That conduct is irrelevant to the question of first use of the Trade Mark in Australia, as the observations from Aston set out above indicate.

The question of first use in Australia being by Danley is challenged by the respondents. It was said, first of all, that a Mr O'Grady of Smorgon said: 
 Smorgon was the first company to bring Pecaform product into Australia from Germany before Danley, sometime in the late 1980s.

This hearsay evidence, says Danley, is not borne out by the facts which show that there was a single order by Smorgon on 10 August 1989, and a shipment to Smorgon of "Pecafil" product.</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/63.html</AustLII>
<text>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 makes plain that where interlocutory relief is sought it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial, and in respect of which final relief is sought.

In the principal proceedings, the applicant claims: A declaration that the threats of legal proceedings for trade mark infringement made by the Respondents to the Applicant are groundless within the meaning of section 129 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 .
 An order that the Respondents be permanently restrained, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise from continuing to make threats of trade mark infringement, by any means including, but not limited to, verbal statements, letters, e-mails or otherwise to the Applicant or any other person.
 Further in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 1 and 2 herein, damages.
 An order pursuant to section 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 that the register of trade marks be rectified by the cancellation or removal of trade mark 1161336.
 A declaration that the conduct of the First and Second Respondent, whether by themselves, their servants, employees, agents or otherwise in manufacturing, importing, advertising, offering for sale, distributing, or selling building materials used in concrete construction within Australia which bear the sign Pecaform ("the Infringing Products") constitutes conduct which: 
 (a) is misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive in contravention of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ("TPA"); and
 (b) is a contravention of section 53(c) and (d) of the TPA. 

 A declaration that the conduct of the Respondents, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise of manufacturing, importing, advertising, offering for sale, distributing, supplying or selling the infringing products within Australia constitutes passing off by the First Respondent of its business and products as being business and/or products of, or related to, or licensed by, or having authorisation of or a connection with, the Applicant.
 An order restraining the Respondents and each of them, their directors, officers, employees, servants agents or otherwise from manufacturing, distributing, promoting, offering for sale or selling in Australia or causing or permitting (directly or indirectly) to be manufactured, distributed, promoted, offered for sale or sold in Australia the Infringing Products.
 Further in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 herein, damages under section 82 of the TPA.
 Further in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 herein, further or other orders under section 87 of the TPA.
 Further in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 herein, damages for passing off.
 Further and/or in the alternative to the relief sought in the preceding paragraph, at the option of the Applicant, an account of the profits made by the Respondents and each of them by the said passing off and payment of the amount found to be due on the taking of such account.
 Delivery up on oath to the Applicant or its duly authorised agent for destruction under supervision of all goods, catalogues, price lists, brochures and other documents and materials, including materials which are or which are capable of being stored, generated or transmitted by an electronic media in the possession, power, custody, or control of the Respondents, bearing the sign Pecaform.
 Pursuant to section 80 of the TPA an injunction restraining the Respondents by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever from contravening section 52 of the TPA by the publication of misleading and deceptive documents and representations, such representations being to the effect that the Applicant is not able and or entitled to sell in Australia and New Zealand products under the name "Pecaform" or that the Applicant is not able to sell or supply to the market in Australia or New Zealand products that the Applicant has been selling and supplying to the market in Australia and New Zealand under the name Pecaform.
 Damages payable by the Respondents for loss and damage incurred by the Applicant as a result of the Respondents' contravention of section 52 of the TPA as referred to in the preceding paragraph herein.
 In the alternative to the relief sought in the preceding paragraph herein, at the option of the Applicant, an account of the profits made by the Respondents and or each of them by reason of the wrongful conduct of the Respondents by reason of their wrongful conduct.
 All such accounts/enquiries as to damages and profit in respect of the contravention of section 52 of the TPA and discovery in aid thereof as may be necessary.
 
 17 Interest pursuant to Section 51A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth). 

 
 18 Costs.

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The principal authority is the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 ( O'Neill ). In that case, Gummow and Hayne JJ held (Gleeson CJ and Crennan J agreeing) that (at [65]): 
 The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; [(1968) 118 CLR 618]. This Court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued [1968] HCA 1 ; [(1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622-623]: 

 
"The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief ... The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted."
 
 
 By using the phrase "prima facie case", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial.</text>

<tocase>Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325</tocase>
<text>The respondents also referred the Court to comments made by Stone J (prior to the High Court's decision above) in Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325. In that case, her Honour stated, at [17]: 
 This court has power to grant interlocutory relief pursuant s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The relevant principles governing the exercise of the court's discretion to grant interlocutory relief are well established. In order to secure the relief it seeks Roche must demonstrate: 

 
 (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or a prima facie case such that if the evidence remains the same there is a probability that at a final hearing it would be entitled to relief;
 (2) that it will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction is granted; and
 (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.

The second and third points referred to by Stone J are interrelated. Where damages can be adequate compensation, the balance of convenience will almost certainly be in favour of not granting relief; where, in the absence of an injunction, the harm will be irreparable, then the balance of convenience almost certainly favours the grant of interlocutory relief.

Both of the respondents are related companies within the "Max Frank Group". The first respondent, Max Frank Pte Ltd, is the majority shareholder of the second respondent, Peca Verbundtechnik GmbH, which was established in Germany in 1981.

The second respondent, in 1982, registered the marks "Pecaform" and "Peca" in Germany. Mr Christopher Baron, a director of the first respondent, deposes that the mark "Pecaform" was registered as a Trade Mark in various European countries in the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s. The steel mesh construction product that was labelled "Pecaform" has also been marketed and sold under the Trade Mark "Pecafil" in various countries. Although Pecaform and Pecafil are marked differently, they are in fact identical products.</text>

A person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia at 625, 627. At common law that is the person who first used the mark.</text>
