<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30</tocase>

<text>I see no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate. The High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI

These reasons were written prior to the decision of the High Court, handed down this morning, to allow the appeal in SZKTI ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30). The High Court there accepted (at [28]) the Minister's submissions (at [27] [28]) that s 424(2) does not operate to limit the general facultative power given by s 424(1) in aid of the inquisitorial functions of the Tribunal. The limitation on that general power is that the Tribunal ' must have regard ' to that information in making its decision (at [37]). Procedural fairness is assured by, inter alia , the requirements of s 424A. The High Court concluded (at [48]) that the procedural restrictions on the specific power to issue an invitation to give additional information do not qualify the Tribunal's general power in s 424(1) to ' get any information that it considers relevant '.

It follows that the method adopted by the Tribunal to obtain the information did not give rise to jurisdictional error.

It follows that the appellant has not demonstrated jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal or error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate. He has not made out the grounds of appeal in his notice of appeal.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/264.html</AustLII>
<text>The appellant contends that this country information received from the High Commission was not valid and was not independent information. This, he says, was because the people who collected the information are controlled by ' the Minister ' or ' the Minister's officials '. There is no evidence to support this assertion and I reject it. I note that the Tribunal was not obliged to comply with s 424A in respect of this report from the High Commission as it was information in the nature of country information that comes within s 424A(3)(a) ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572).</text>

<tocase>Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1994/1253.html</AustLII>
<text>As for the status of the report, as information that the Tribunal was entitled to take into account, I note that s 424(1) provides that the Tribunal may get any information that it considers relevant, so long as it complies with the Act, which includes procedures considered sufficient to afford natural justice with respect to that information. That information does not, as the appellant contends, have to be verified or supported by an international authority. In accordance with s 424(1) , the Tribunal did have regard to the information in making its decision and was entitled to do so. There is no suggestion that the Tribunal was acting at the dictate of the High Commission and, despite the appellant's assertions, no evidence that the Tribunal or the High Commission were acting at the dictate of any person in Bangladesh ( Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1994] FCA 1253 ; (1994) 52 FCR 437 at 452).

No other procedural unfairness is identified by the appellant. Otherwise, this aspect of the appellant's case seems to concern the fact-finding by the Tribunal. Other issues

The Tribunal did not accept the situation described by the appellant as to the political situation in Bangladesh. The Tribunal accepted that politics in that country has always been accompanied by violence but found that the violence against political opponents has been largely random and lacked the systematic and purposive elements necessary to be called persecution, especially when involving minor figures such as the appellant.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/83.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 424(2) of the Act (as then in force) applies to a situation where the Tribunal invites a person to give additional information. It does not apply to additional information that may have been given by a person to the person invited by the Tribunal to provide information. In my view, s 424(2) and s 424(3) do not apply to an invitation from the Tribunal to an Australian Embassy or High Commission overseas to give additional information to the Tribunal. Although SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 51 ; (2009) 255 ALR 407 does not directly deal with this circumstance, such a conclusion is not inconsistent with the reasoning in that case and is consistent with SZMBS v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 176 FCR 141. It does not involve the "vice" that was a consideration in SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ; (2008) 168 FCR 256 , which concerned an unexpected invitation to a third party.</text>

<tocase>VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/927.html</AustLII>
<text>As to s 91R of the Act, the Federal Magistrate observed that whether particular conduct amounts to persecution under s 91R is a matter of fact and degree for the Tribunal to determine in its fact-finding role ( VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [67] ) and found no jurisdictional error.

Accordingly, her Honour rejected the second ground in the application for review, that the Tribunal erred in its application of s 91R by failing to consider whether the appellant might suffer persecution as a result of false charges he claimed were filed against him.

The grounds of appeal raised by the appellant are: The learned Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it was not open for the Tribunal to make a finding that "Some of the statement made at hearing regarding the fate of party colleagues have been shown to be incorrect. His errors have been drawn to this attention on the Tribunal's letters but he has not addressed them in his replies" And the conclusion was made from this observation is quietly irrelevant with the observations. The Tribunal did not make comments on the applicant's reply. 
 The learned Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error that the Tribunal did not take into account the fear for harm in the future of the applicant for his political opinion. The Tribunal did not put any supporting evidence about its comment on false cases against the applicant because the false cases are investigated improperly and unfairly people are involved to persecute by the Government Agency. The applicant did not know that how the Australian High Commission in Dhaka made an investigation and made a report against the applicant. The investigation was not done properly.

In summary, they seem to raise the following bases of appeal:

The Minister says that these grounds do not relate to the grounds pleaded before the Federal Magistrate. The Minister submits that leave is required to rely on those grounds and opposes leave being granted, as there is no explanation why those grounds were not raised before the Federal Magistrate and as they are unmeritorious.
