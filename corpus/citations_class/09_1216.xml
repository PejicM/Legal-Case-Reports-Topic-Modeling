<text>On 1 December 2008, for reasons which I then published, I made a number of orders directed to the granting to the appellant of leave to appeal against the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 12 November 2007: see SZKCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1814. Leave to appeal was granted on one ground only, namely "the Federal Magistrates Court erred in concluding that no jurisdictional error was apparent in the Refugee Review Tribunal's (the Tribunal) decision in that the Tribunal had erred by having regard to the conduct of the appellant in Australia when determining her application for a protection visa. In so doing, the Tribunal failed to comply with the stipulation made in s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (Migration Act) that such conduct must be disregarded".

The Appellant subsequently filed and served a notice of appeal specifying that nominated ground of appeal. The background to the Appellant's application for a protection visa together with the course of subsequent proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal, in the Federal Magistrates Court and in this Court are set out in my reasons for judgment in respect of the leave to appeal application. These reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with the reasons for judgment which I gave in respect of that leave to appeal application.</text>

<text>At the time when I granted leave to appeal there was a basis for apprehending by analogy as between the circumstances of the Appellant's case and those in SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 ; (2008) 170 FCR 515 that an arguable case for the granting of leave to appeal existed. An application for special leave to appeal by the Minister in SZJGV was then pending in the High Court of Australia. In the interval which has passed between 1 December 2008 and today the High Court has, in respect of SZJGV , granted special leave to appeal to the Minister, heard the appeal and, on 30 September 2009, determined the appeal: see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV (2009) 259 ALR 595. The High Court, by majority, allowed the Minister's appeal in SZJGV . In so doing, the High Court reversed the result before a Full Court of this Court which had provided the foundation for a conception that the present Appellant had an arguable case for a grant of leave to appeal.</text>
