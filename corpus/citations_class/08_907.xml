<text>59 In Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42 ; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 286, Mason CJ, after remarking that categories of abuse of process remain open, identified three categories within which abuse of process usually falls:
 (1) the court's procedures are invoked for an illegitimate purpose; 
 
 (2) the use of the court's procedures is unjustifiably oppressive to one of the parties; or
 
 (3) the use of the court's procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

<text>63 It is an abuse of process, in my opinion, to proceed in the way in which the applicant has. It could lead to the very unsatisfactory result that, contrary to the decision of Mansfield J, the decisions would be quashed for reasons not considered by him. That would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute: Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 and Brock v Minister for Justice and Customs [2007] FCA 2091 ; (2007) 243 ALR 315.</text>

<tocase>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/1.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The respondents acknowledged that although it is only in the clearest of cases that an application for summary dismissal would succeed: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J, in this case, because the applicant's claim failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action, it was appropriate for the Court to exercise its power and dismiss the proceeding.

49 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act was enacted by the legislature with full knowledge of the decisions of the High Court in relation to the summary dismissal of proceedings and, in particular, the decision of the High Court in Dey [1949] HCA 1 ; 78 CLR 62 at 91 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. So much is supported by the Attorney-General's second reading speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth) which was the legislative vehicle which introduced s 31A. He said:
 The bill also strengthens the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters, by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases. It is appropriate that this provision is of general application. It will be a useful addition to the courts' powers in dealing with any unsustainable case.</text>

<tocase>Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/60.html</AustLII>
<text>42 In relation to the issue of "offset against bankruptcy proceedings", the respondents submitted that there were no "mutual dealings" between the respondents and the applicants for the purpose of s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (Bankruptcy Act): Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609 , and that the $2,000,000 claimed in damages by the applicant in this matter is neither a debt presently owed to the applicant by the respondents, nor is it a contingent liability arising out of mutual dealings between them. The respondents also stated that as there is currently no sequestration order made against the applicant, he is not presently a "person who has become a bankrupt" which means s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act cannot operate in relation to him.

43 The respondents argued that the proceeding was vexatious, given the applicant's litigation history in which he has been attempting (unsuccessfully) to establish that, as a result of his service in the Army, he developed a mental disability for which he should be compensated and that this proceeding was yet another attempt by the applicant to re-litigate matters already determined against him on a number of occasions both in this Court and in the AAT.

44 The respondents also contended that as there are no particulars in the application or statement of claim (other than bare allegations) as to how the applicant was discriminated against, that the applicant should be ordered to pay security for costs. They argued that the claim was unmeritorious. The respondents contended that the applicant owns no property and has been unable to pay previous costs orders made against him.</text>

<tocase>Metall &amp; Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin [1990] 1 QB 391</tocase>
<text>40 In support of the abuse of process ground, the respondents contended "that in making his application ... the predominant purpose of the [a]pplicant [was] not to prosecute the proceeding to a conclusion, but instead to use it as a means of obtaining an advantage for which it [was] not designed ...": Metall &amp; Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin [1990] 1 QB 391 at 469. In particular, the respondents submitted that the purpose of the applicant was to delay and/or frustrate the bankruptcy proceedings against the applicant.

41 The respondents submitted that the applicant was seeking to re-litigate issues already decided such that there was a collateral attack on several Full Court decisions. The respondents stated that, in effect, the applicant was seeking to re-agitate issues already the subject of a decision and order of the Full Court. The respondents submitted that there were no facts currently pleaded in the applicant's statement of claim which would support any conclusion that the second respondent actually unlawfully discriminated against the applicant.</text>

<tocase>Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FMCA 518</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/518.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The applicant sought judicial review of the two decisions made by the second respondent on 5 April and 28 April 2005 which came before Mansfield J. The grounds of the application were referred to in Mansfield J's reasons as being a breach of natural justice due to the non-provision of reports; an improper exercise of power for having taken into account irrelevant considerations; a failure to account for relevant considerations; unreasonableness and that the decision was made in bad faith; that the decision involved an error of law; and, finally, that there was no evidence to justify the decision. The applicant did not raise discrimination as a ground of review. On 14 September 2005 the applicant's application was dismissed by Mansfield J in Rana v Chief of Army [2005] FCA 1283. Mansfield J referred to the claim that the decision was unreasonable and said that there was no material to support the contention that the decision was made in bad faith.

24 On 12 May 2006 an appeal to the Full Federal Court was also dismissed: Rana v Chief of Army Staff [2006] FCAFC 63 ; (2006) 90 ALD 474.

25 On 30 September 2006 the applicant complained to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) alleging discrimination on grounds of both race and disability and victimisation.

26 On 5 July 2007 the applicant's complaint was terminated by HREOC pursuant to s 46PH(1)(c) of the HREOC Act on the ground that there was "no, or no sufficient, evidence that the A[ustralian] D[efence] F[orce] or Brigadier Orme discriminated against [the applicant] on the ground of disability or race or victimised [the applicant] ...".

37 On 15 May 2007 the respondents in this matter caused the applicant to be served with a bankruptcy notice claiming the sum of $7,582.86 which represents the first respondent's party/party costs which the applicant was ordered to pay by Mansfield J on 14 September 2005 in the applicant's failed judicial review proceeding. On 17 May 2007 the applicant swore an affidavit and made an application disputing the amount and sought an order that the respondent be restrained from proceeding until such time as the appeal in that matter was finalised and until the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) determined whether he was entitled to compensation from the respondent which could then be used to set off the bankruptcy claim.

38 On 10 July 2007 the application to have the bankruptcy notice set aside was dismissed by Registrar Christie (with costs to be taxed or agreed). The applicant sought review of that decision. On 22 April 2008 Simpson FM dismissed that application: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FMCA 518. Notwithstanding the applicant's application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, the first respondent has filed a creditor's petition which was required to be done within six months from the date of bankruptcy.

53 The applicant in these proceedings is seeking to have set aside the decisions made by the second respondent for grounds not advanced in the proceeding before Mansfield J and in the Full Court. It is the same decisions as were under attack before Mansfield J and the Full Court. Those decisions were found by the Full Court not to have been actuated by any bad faith on the part of the decision-maker.

54 Whilst the applicant chose not to argue before the Full Court that the particular of bad faith was discrimination on the ground of his mental illness, nevertheless, the primary judge and the Full Court needed to decide whether or not the decision-maker had reached his decision for any reason of bad faith. The finding has been made and must stand.

60 Moreover, I am satisfied that this proceeding, as the respondents have contended, has been brought for a collateral purpose and thereby an improper purpose: Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509. This proceeding has been brought for the purpose of calling into question Mansfield J's decision and that of the Full Court. It has also been brought for the further improper purpose to obtain the interlocutory relief which is sought in the application so as to prevent the first respondent from proceeding with the creditor's petition in the Federal Magistrates Court. Clearly, in this proceeding, this Court could not make an interlocutory order of the kind sought in the application. The Court in which the bankruptcy proceeding has been brought might make such an order but, as the reasons of Simpson FM show, the Federal Magistrates Court has declined to make such an order: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FMCA 518.</text>

<tocase>Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/77.html</AustLII>
<text>55 This Court has an implied incidental power to prevent an abuse of its processes. The jurisdiction of a superior court to prevent its processes from an abuse of process was considered by the High Court in Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378. In that case, the High Court was concerned with complaints against three medical practitioners which were laid but not prosecuted in the Medical Tribunal and then re-laid after a Royal Commission had reported adversely on the conduct of the practitioners. On an application to the Court, the Court of Appeal in New South Wales stayed the new complaints on the ground that they were so unfairly and unjustly oppressive as to constitute an abuse of process.

56 Chief Justice Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 392-393:
 The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness. Thus, it has long been established that, regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance, proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail. ... Yet again, proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if, notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel, their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it sought to litigate a newer case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. (Footnotes omitted.)

57 The respondents contended that this Court should find that this proceeding is an abuse of process.</text>

It may be thought, in those circumstances, that the purpose of the enactment of s 31A was to relax the rigours of the test imposed by the High Court in General Steel Industries [1964] HCA 69 ; 112 CLR 125 as to the necessary circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out summarily: Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 65 ATR 222 and White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298. So much is supported by the Attorney-General's second reading speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 (Cth) which was the legislative vehicle which introduced s 31A. He said:
 The bill also strengthens the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters, by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases. It is appropriate that this provision is of general application. It will be a useful addition to the courts' powers in dealing with any unsustainable case.</text>
