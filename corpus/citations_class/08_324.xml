<text>50 As to the jurisdictional question, s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act confers original jurisdiction on the Federal Court of Australia in any matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. Section 39B(1A)(c) confers jurisdiction upon the Court, relevantly for present purposes, in any matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament. The Bank claims that its 'rights and entitlements' as a party to a services contract are not affected by s 106 of the IR Act. That claim seems to me to be the assertion of a right, or reliance upon an answer to a claim for an order under s 106 of the State Act, conferred by or under the Commonwealth Act. The claim thus arises under the Commonwealth Statute ( Ex parte McLean [1930] HCA 12 ; (1930) 43 CLR 472 ; The King v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett [1945] HCA 50 ; (1945) 70 CLR 141 at 154 per Latham CJ; The Queen v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co.

<tocase>Fish v Solution 6 Holdings Ltd (2006) 80 ALJR 959</tocase>
<text>52 Questions of the tension between the conferral of limited jurisdiction upon the Industrial Court and constraints upon supervisory challenges to the exercise of that limited jurisdiction on grounds of jurisdictional error (before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the Court of Appeal and ultimately appellate challenges before the High Court) and the reconciliation of that tension, have been considered in Fish v Solution 6 Holdings Ltd (2006) 80 ALJR 959 (' Fish '); Batterham v QSR Limited [2006] HCA 23 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 995 (' Batterham ') and Old UGC Inc v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales in Court Session [2006] HCA 24 ; (2006) 80 ALJR 1018 ( 'Old UGC Inc '). Those cases do not involve a question of construction of an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament or whether the source of a denial of jurisdiction to the State Commission or Court involves invalidity in the provisions of the State Act conferring jurisdiction, by reason of s 109 of the Constitution . In other words, they do not engage the question of a State Act expressly seeking to limit federal jurisdiction (other than questions going to a possible or purported limitation upon the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by the High Court).

53 In Fish and Batterham the majority concluded that s 179 was not enlivened according to its terms as no decision or purported decision had been made by the Commission in Court Session. In Old UGC Inc , the s 179 point was not argued before the High Court. These cases are not authority for the proposition that notwithstanding s 179 (enlivened according to its terms), a supervisory court has jurisdiction to grant orders of prohibition directed to the Industrial Court to prevent the threatened making of a decision beyond jurisdiction or the conduct of proceedings that might lead to an order beyond jurisdiction as the point was not alive. Moreover, these cases do not in terms deal with constraints upon the exercise of federal jurisdiction.

55 The further consideration and, it seems to me, the real focus of inquiry, is whether the Federal Court ought to embark upon a consideration of the question raised by these proceedings in circumstances where the Industrial Court has not considered whether it has jurisdiction. If an assumption is made for present purposes that the Industrial Court might ultimately be found not to have the jurisdiction sought to be exercised, it nevertheless has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction. The Industrial Court is, by s 152 of the IR Act (and by amendment of the Constitution Act 1902 of the State of New South Wales) a superior court of record equivalent in status to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. An important question, as a matter of comity, is whether this Court ought to hear and determine the controversy framed by these proceedings and, if satisfied that an inconsistency arises depriving the Industrial Court of jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to s 106 of the IR Act, proceed to make orders preventing the further conduct of the Industrial Court proceedings, before the Industrial Court has determined whether it has jurisdiction ( Fish per Heydon J [176] and [177]).

56 The question raised by this controversy is not simply one of whether there is threatened jurisdictional error in acting in reliance upon s 106 of the IR Act in respect of the proper isolation and application of one or more of the integers of the section itself, but a threshold question of constitutional inconsistency between the Commonwealth and State Acts resulting in invalidity in the provisions sought to be relied upon in the exercise of jurisdiction. It seems to me that the interests of the parties are served by the Federal Court considering and determining that matter, in the nature of a preliminary question. Since this proceeding joins parties comprising the Bank, those executives who acted for the Bank in the relevant transactions and all of the participants in the three Industrial Court proceedings, there seems to be utility in deciding the inconsistency question (and thus the validity of s 106 of the IR Act), as between these parties. In addition, the contention of the respondents that the Industrial Court ought to first determine its own jurisdiction as the repository of the power, needs to be qualified as each of the Industrial Court proceedings has been cross-vested to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

57 Accordingly, I am not persuaded that an order for transfer ought to be made by reason of a want of jurisdiction in the Federal Court or on the footing that the Court ought not to embark upon a consideration of whether there is a constitutional denial of jurisdiction to the Industrial Court, before the relevant forum first determines whether jurisdiction is denied to it by reason of constitutional invalidity arising out of the contended inconsistency.</text>

Moreover, these cases do not in terms deal with constraints upon the exercise of federal jurisdiction.

54 The applicants in this proceeding seek to give expression to rights arising under Commonwealth law. A limitation upon those rights is said to arise by reason of s 179, a State law. Although an argument arises that a State law might, as a matter of construction, be intended by a State parliament to operate in such a way as to foreclose the exercise of jurisdiction by 'every court in the land' including a court exercising 'federal and constitutional jurisdiction' ( Old UGC Inc per Kirby J, [69]), it seems to me, as an aspect of considering an application for transfer, that the proper approach to the application of s 179 of the State Act is that it does not operate to oust or limit the exercise of federal jurisdiction by this Court. I find it difficult to analytically identify how a provision such as s 179 of the IR Act could deprive the Federal Court of invested federal jurisdiction.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/1.html</AustLII>
<text>69 The respondents say that what is necessary is an analysis of the 'totality of the relationship' between the parties to determine whether the contract is one to which an independent contractor is a party. That proposition is based upon Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1 ; (1986) 160 CLR 16 and the judgment of their Honours Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 ; (2001) 181 ALR 263 and particularly the observations at [24]. However, Hollis involved a question of whether a bicycle courier being one of about 25 to 30 individuals within the bicycle courier cohort providing courier services for and on behalf of Vabu, might properly be characterised as an employee or an independent contractor of Vabu for the purposes of determining whether Vabu was vicariously liable for the negligence of one of its couriers. In determining that question, the Court recognised that each bicycle courier was required to sign a three page document comprising on page 1 a pro forma layout for recording the personal details of the courier; a second page setting out an inventory sheet of radio equipment and uniforms and a third page which set out 11 points comprising terms. The content of the arrangements between Vabu and each of its bicycle couriers comprised not only the pro forma three page document but other important matters not forming part of the document such as the rate of remuneration for deliveries and other elements of work practices for bicycle couriers, adopted by Vabu. The arrangements were found to comprise both the written document and other terms not reduced to writing. The circumstances of the present case could not be further removed from the circumstances of Hollis . This case does not involve episodic arrangements for the provision of routine unskilled services. In this case, there is a significant detailed major commercial document which the respondents plead in their Industrial Court proceedings is one that provides for the establishment and governance of the OMB Agency. It is an agreement establishing and governing a significant commercial undertaking as between the parties to it and one which involves specific collateral documents such as the guarantees and securities given in support of it, a Representations Deed, a Business Term Loan Agreement and guarantees and securities given in support of that agreement.</text>
