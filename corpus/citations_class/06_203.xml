<tocase>R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Fowler (1980) 31 ALR 565</tocase>
<text>14 The Magistrate noted that he had a discretion to dismiss an application for judicial review in a case where there had been an unwarrantable delay. He observed that the discretion can be exercised against an applicant without determining whether there has been any jurisdictional error, citing R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal ; Ex parte Fowler (1980) 31 ALR 565, at 568-570 per Barwick CJ, Gibbs, Stephen, Mason and Aickin JJ and S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283. His Honour also said, on the authority of Re Commonwealth of Australia ; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491, at 495-496, per McHugh J, that ordinarily a delay of more than one year should lead to relief being refused, at least in the absence of an explanation.</text>

<tocase>R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust.) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/33.html</AustLII>
<text>20 In R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust.) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389, the High Court pointed out that the writ of mandamus is not a writ of right and that there are well recognised grounds upon which the Court may, in its discretion, withhold the remedy. By way of example, the Court stated (at 400) that the writ may be withheld if the relevant party has been guilty of unwarrantable delay.</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 , </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, McHugh J said (at [80]):
 
 ' The issuing of writs under s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act is discretionary. Discretionary relief may be refused under s 39B if the conduct of the party is inconsistent with the application for relief. It may be inconsistent, for example, if there is delay on the part of the applicant or the applicant has waived or acquiesced in the invalidity of the decision or does not come with clean hands. ' [Citations omitted.] 

See also at [211], per Hayne J, with whom Kirby J agreed on this issue.

22 The difficulty with the approach of the Magistrate is that he did not ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified the withholding of relief in the event that the appellant established that the RRT had committed a jurisdictional error. Rather, the cases upon which he relied suggest that he required the appellant to satisfy the Court that a discretion should be exercised in his favour, having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded one year.

23 On any view, the appellant was guilty of long delay and no satisfactory excuse was or could be proffered for that delay. But the question asked by the Magistrate, in my view, was not the correct one and this led to his discretion miscarrying on this issue.</text>

<tocase>Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1989/62.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The notion of 'systematic conduct' was referred to in Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1989] HCA 62 ; (1989) 169 CLR 379, at 429-430, per McHugh J. As McHugh J observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ibrahim [2000] HCA 55 ; (2000) 204 CLR 1, at [95], the use of this expression proved somewhat unfortunate in that some RRT decisions read it as meaning that there can be no persecution for the purposes of the Convention unless there has been a systematic course of conduct by the oppressor. McHugh J made it clear in Ibrahim that that had not been his meaning. Rather, he intended the expression to be a synonym for 'non-random'. McHugh J also said this (at [99]):
 
 ' It is an error to suggest that the use of the expression "systematic conduct" in ... Chan was intended to require, as a matter of law, that an applicant had to fear organised or methodical conduct, akin to the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the Second World War. Selective harassment, which discriminates against a person for a Convention reason, is inherent in the notion of persecution. Unsystematic or random acts are non-selective. It is therefore not a prerequisite to obtaining refugee status that a person fears being persecuted on a number of occasions or "must show a series of co-ordinated acts directed at him or her which can be said to be not isolated but systematic". The fear of a single act of harm done for a Convention reason will satisfy the Convention definition of persecution if it is so oppressive that the individual cannot be expected to tolerate it so that refusal to return to the country of the applicant's nationality is the understandable choice of that person. ' [Citations omitted.]

26 In the present case, the RRT used the expression 'a course of systematic conduct', or its equivalent, on three separate occasions. On each occasion, the RRT cited the observations of McHugh J in Chan . Of course, the RRT's decision in the present case was handed down long before the clarification of the law in Ibrahim .</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/14.html</AustLII>
<text>32 The RRT's reasoning seems to me to amount to an independent basis for the conclusion it ultimately reached. That is to say, even if the appellant feared a repeat of mob violence directed at people of Chinese ethnicity, the Government of Indonesia was willing and able to take effective steps to prevent the violence or to minimise the consequences of it. The approach taken by the RRT seems to me to be unexceptional and is in accord with the more recent authorities: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1; Minster for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/ 2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487, at [26] [29] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ. To use the language of the joint judgment in S152/2003 , at [29], the RRT must be understood as having found: 
 
 ' [T]hat the information did not justify a conclusion that the government would not or could not provide citizens in the position of [the appellant] with the level of protection which they were entitled to expect according to international standards. That being so, he was not a victim of persecution, and he could not justify his unwillingness to seek the protection of his country of nationality. It was not enough for [the appellant] to show that there was a real risk that, if he returned to his country, he might suffer further harm. He had to show that the harm was persecution, and he had to justify his unwillingness to seek the protection of his country of nationality. '</text>
