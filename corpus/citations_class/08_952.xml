<tocase>ACCC v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1997) 77 FCR 217</tocase>
<text>11 In January 2008, the defendants sought a stay of the claims made against MPG by ASIC pending the hearing and determination of the claims made against the directors or a stay of the claims made against MPG by ASIC until the Court has made findings of fact in relation to the claims against the directors but before final orders. The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by a Mr Babbage, a non-executive director of MPG. The application was refused: ASIC No. 2 . In considering the application for stay, a number of principles informed that decision: see ASIC No. 2 at [5] to [7]. They included:
 
1. The privilege against self-incrimination and penalty privilege apply to the directors but not MPG: ASIC No. 1 at [5] and ASIC No. 2 at [7].
 
2. A corporate defendant (such as MPG) may be required to provide documents and information which may tend to incriminate its officers: Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96 at 116.
 
3. A corporate defendant cannot invoke privilege on the grounds that an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate a natural person, such as a director: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC No. 1 at [5].
 
4. A natural person cannot complain that a corporate defendant's compliance with an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate him or her: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC No. 1 at [5]. 
 
5. The relevant enquiry is whether an order directed to the corporate defendant will require that a natural person tend to incriminate himself or herself: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC No. 1 at [5]. No submission has been made to that effect in this case. 
 
6. A corporate defendant cannot refuse to comply with a direction for the filing of evidence on the basis that its evidence may incriminate other natural person defendants or expose them to a penalty: Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Camile Trading Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1256 ; (2004) 58 ATR 163 at 170. However, a corporate defendant will not breach such a direction if it fails to file a statement or an affidavit from a witness where that witness claims privilege: ACCC v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd (1997) 77 FCR 217 at 220 and ACCC v Eurong Beach Resort Ltd [2005] FCA 1134 at [10] , [12] and [13]. That is to say, compliance is not required " if the only source of the information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent ": ASIC No. 1 at [5] (emphasis added). If the corporate defendant has other sources of information available from which it can comply with the direction, then it must do so.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 32</tocase>
<text>1 These are civil proceedings in which penalties are sought: s 1331 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act "). They have been the subject of previous interlocutory decisions: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [1] (" ASIC No. 1 ") at [1] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 951 (" ASIC No. 2 ") at [5]. Those reasons for decision adequately describe the nature of the proceedings.

2 For present purposes, it is sufficient to refer to Finkelstein J's description of the proceedings in ASIC No. 1 at [1]:
 In this action, which is still in its interlocutory phase, the plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission [("ASIC")], seeks various forms of relief in respect of alleged contraventions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The defendants are Mining Projects Group Limited (MPG), a minerals exploration company, and two of its directors, Mr Frost and Mr Revelins. ASIC contends that in breach of s 1041H MPG made misleading public announcements about the mineralisation and exploration potential for uranium mining at Niue Island in the South Pacific. The nub of the complaint is that the potential was overstated. The directors are alleged to have knowingly procured the breach and thereby contravened ss 180 and 181 , the directors' duties sections. There are also claims that the directors engaged in insider trading (s 1043A) and improperly used company information (s 183). The only relief sought against MPG is a declaration that it contravened s 1041H. But ASIC seeks the imposition of pecuniary penalties against the directors (s 1317G) and an order that they be disqualified from managing a corporation (s 206C). ...

3 At risk of undue abbreviation, ASIC's pleaded claim is that a Mr Blackburn, a geologist, was retained by MPG " to assist in considering information provided ... and to assess the potential mineralisation and exploration of the Niue Island ("the Blackburn Retainer ")" (par 9) and that, pursuant to that Blackburn Retainer, certain representations were made by Blackburn (pars 10, 11 and 13) ("the Blackburn Adverse Comments"). The substance of the Blackburn Adverse Comments is alleged to be such as would raise questions about the potential mineralisation and exploration of the Niue Island. ASIC further pleads that although the Blackburn representations were recorded in emails from Blackburn to one of the directors of MPG and were "adverse", the ASX released a company announcement about the Niue Island Project issued by MPG ("the Principal Announcement") which, inter alia , did not include one or more of the Blackburn Adverse Comments (par 20).

10 After the defences were filed, two issues arose - whether penalty privilege or privilege against self incrimination would ordinarily relieve the directors from any obligation to provide further details of their defence and, secondly, assuming the privileges could be relied upon, whether the directors had waived, in whole or in part, their right to assert either privilege by filing detailed defences. Those applications were heard and determined by Finkelstein J: see ASIC No. 1 (2007) 164 FCR 32 at [1]. In those reasons for decision, Finkelstein J described the content of the defences filed by the directors and the position of MPG in the following terms (at [5]):
 When going into the detail they did in their respective defences the directors were mindful of penalty privilege. Each of their defences opens with a statement that the director "claims and reserves his right to claim penalty privilege in the proceeding." No such statement was made by MPG for it is accepted that a corporation cannot claim the benefit of penalty privilege (Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Iceworks Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96) or self-incrimination privilege (see Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd ... [1993] HCA 74 ; (1993) 178 CLR 477). That MPG cannot claim the benefit of either privilege may not be of much assistance to ASIC if it successfully attacks the company's defence. If MPG's defence is defective and it is required to provide further information, it may not be able to satisfy that requirement if the only source of its information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent.

<text>19 What this necessarily truncated description makes clear is that the accuracy of the Principal Announcement and the Blackburn Adverse Comments were, and at this stage of the proceedings remain, some of the central issues in the proceedings. It is to these issues that the four new expert reports are directed. However, at no time did any of the defendants inform the Court or ASIC that it intended or even might intend to file and serve these expert reports. Of course, there was no obligation on the directors to file any evidence. MPG, too, could have stood mute, not gone into evidence and simply relied upon whatever positive case the directors ran. But if MPG intended to go into evidence, it was subject to the principles summarised in [11(6)] above.

20 What then did the defendants do? The affidavits exhibiting the reports state that the directors retained Mr Rutter, a geophysicist, on 4 June 2007, Mr Stoker, also a geologist, on 29 November 2007, Mr Lawrence, also a geologist, on 5 February 2008 and Mr Whitehead, on 9 April 2008. Moreover, the affidavit of Mr Whitehead disclosed that a preliminary written response was provided on 24 April 2008, some two weeks before the date for MPG to file and serve its material. The affidavits and reports were filed and served on behalf of the directors under cover of a letter seeking to maintain privilege. The explanation provided by the defendants' counsel for the late filing was that:
 ... we have flagged to [ASIC] expert reports attacking their expert position when they are not entitled to [such notice]. We've put ourselves at some disadvantage in terms of preparing their expert for them. He at least has a notion of what's coming, without a limitation on it. They are not entitled to that advantage. We were entitled to cross-examine their experts without them knowing what our experts were saying. That was the fact. We've given that away. In the interests of trying to resolve this matter, [ASIC] could have a quick look at it and decide whether they want [to proceed].

21 That submission was incomplete and not wholly accurate. First, as I have already noted, at the directions hearing on 12 June 2008, what ASIC wanted to know was not about the directors' case, but whether the affidavits and reports from the four experts were intended to form part of MPG's own case at trial. The response from MPG's Senior Counsel was that they were: see [5]. That fact was further reiterated by counsel for the defendants, who not only conceded (properly) that the affidavits and reports were late, but asserted that they were provided "in the interests of trying to resolve this matter". The subsequent submission on behalf of the defendants that MPG only intended to rely upon the affidavits if they were ultimately tendered by the directors is rejected. It ignores, first, that the sole reason why the matter came before me for directions on 12 June was to ascertain whether MPG intended to rely on the reports as part of its own case and, secondly, the submissions made by Senior Counsel for MPG in response to those enquiries.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1639.html</AustLII>
<text>24 ASIC also sought an order that the costs be paid forthwith: O 62 r3(3) of the Federal Court Rules . In support of its application, ASIC referred to the fact that additional costs had been incurred in making arrangements for Mr Blackburn to give his evidence from Peru. The principles which govern the exercise of the discretion under O 62 r 3 were set out by Branson J in Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd (22 May 1998, unreported) and Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No.14) (Lindgren J, 18 August 1995, unreported) as cited in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13] [20]. The effect of those cases is to suggest that courts will depart from the general rule and order payment forthwith principally where final judgment is "far away" and thus the eventuality of payment is remote. Consistent with those authorities, it is inappropriate in this case to order payment forthwith of the costs thrown away. The trial is now set for September, and final resolution of the proceeding is therefore not too far away. Moreover, the costs incurred were not quantified and the plaintiff is ASIC, a government entity with sufficient funding to meet its costs in the interim.

25 Accordingly, I will order that MPG pay ASIC's costs thrown away but make no order for immediate payment or taxation.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-five (25) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gordon.
