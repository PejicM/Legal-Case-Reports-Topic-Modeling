<text>8. On 7 October 2005 Bennett J dismissed the application for leave to appeal: SZFIO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs &amp; Anor [2005] FCA 1449.

9. An application for review of the delegate's decision was lodged in the Federal Magistrates Court by the applicant on 26 October 2005. That is the application which is the subject of the second order made by the Magistrate.

10. On 1 December 2005 the respondent issued the notice of motion to which I have previously referred to have that proceeding dismissed.</text>

<text>11. On 6 February 2006 the respondent's application came on for hearing before a Federal Magistrate and he made the orders which I have set out above. The Magistrate said that the applicant's application challenges the delegate's decision and he said that it was doomed to fail because the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal. 
 

3 I do not think that the applicant's proposed appeal enjoys any prospect of success. This case is similar to the case which came before Wilcox J in SZDFW v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1821. The Tribunal conducted a full merits review in relation to the decision of the delegate and the applicant was given every opportunity to present his case (see s 415 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), Zubair v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344). The Federal Magistrate found that the decision of the Tribunal was in no way affected by jurisdictional error and a judge of this court refused leave to appeal against that decision.
 
4 The delegate's decision is now of no significance having regard to the fact that it was reviewed by the Tribunal. The application for leave to appeal is dismissed.
 

 I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.
