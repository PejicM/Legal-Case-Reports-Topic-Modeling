<text>4 Mr Sheahan SC, on behalf of the applicants, recognises that masking for irrelevance is specifically contemplated by the discovery orders. He also recognises that, while an unqualified order for discovery may require a party to produce unmasked copies of all partially relevant documents unless the Court grants relief from the requirement, it was appropriate for Telstra in the present case to mask the truly irrelevant portions of discovered documents: cf Gray v Associated Book Publishers (Aust) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1045 , at [9], [14]-[15], per Branson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 , at [12]-[13], per Selway J; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 , at [16] ff, per Sundberg J, and authorities cited there.</text>
