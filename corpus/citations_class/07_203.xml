<text>13 It is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law: Water Board v Moustakas (1988) 77 ALR 193 at 196; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1991) 28 FCR 451; Cubillo v Commonwealth [2001] FCA 1213 ; (2001) 183 ALR 249. The first respondent conceded that the point could not have been met by any evidence had it been raised below but that the proposed ground was without merit and accordingly leave should be refused. It is necessary therefore to consider whether it is "expedient in the interests of justice" to allow the new ground to be argued and determined: H v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 at [6] .</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/73.html</AustLII>
<text>15 As to the merits, in my opinion, the proposed second ground cannot succeed. I accept the submissions of the first respondent which were to the following effect. The appellant was given the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and put such information before it as she wished. In circumstances where the appellant failed to attend her hearing, she cannot complain if her application was rejected because amongst other reasons, she failed to take up the opportunity: S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283 at [26] .

There is no substance to her claim that the Tribunal failed to consider the information in the appellant's case. The Tribunal was simply not satisfied as to the applicable criteria: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 ; SJSB v Minister for Immigration [2004] FCAFC 215 ; and SZBCS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1457.</text>

<text>11 In my opinion, the learned Federal Magistrate correctly held that it was for the applicant to establish her case before the Tribunal: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596. She failed to do so. The applicant was invited by the learned Federal Magistrate to provide details in support of that ground but she did not do so.</text>

<text>12 It is no part of the duty of the decision-maker to make the applicant's case for him: Prasad v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170. I do not accept that the Tribunal failed to carry out any duty, as contended for by the applicant, to demonstrate that the applicant did not face a risk of being persecuted if she was returned to China. No such duty exists as a matter of law. This ground discloses no error of law.</text>

<tocase>Water Board v Moustakas (1988) 77 ALR 193</tocase>
<text>13 It is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law: Water Board v Moustakas (1988) 77 ALR 193 at 196; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brambles Holdings Ltd (1991) 28 FCR 451; Cubillo v Commonwealth [2001] FCA 1213 ; (2001) 183 ALR 249. The first respondent conceded that the point could not have been met by any evidence had it been raised below but that the proposed ground was without merit and accordingly leave should be refused. It is necessary therefore to consider whether it is "expedient in the interests of justice" to allow the new ground to be argued and determined: H v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1348 at [6] .</text>
