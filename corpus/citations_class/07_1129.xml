<text>5 An applicant for review under s 104(2) is under no obligation to demonstrate error on the part of the Registrar, and does not need to establish that the Registrar's exercise of discretion miscarried in the sense described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505: Pattison v Hadjimouratis [2006] FCAFC 153 at [153] - [154] . The Magistrate must exercise any discretion on the material before him or her unaffected by how the Registrar may have exercised the discretion.</text>

<tocase>Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation v Commonwealth [1953] HCA 25 ; (1953) 94 CLR 621</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1953/25.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The remaining grounds of appeal attack the Magistrate's exercise of discretion. The appellant acknowledged the obstacles that lie in the way of such an attack. It must be shown that an error has been made in the exercise of the discretion. There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision appealed from, which must be affirmed unless the court of appeal is satisfied that it is clearly wrong: Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation v Commonwealth [1953] HCA 25 ; (1953) 94 CLR 621 at 627.</text>

<text>5 An applicant for review under s 104(2) is under no obligation to demonstrate error on the part of the Registrar, and does not need to establish that the Registrar's exercise of discretion miscarried in the sense described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505: Pattison v Hadjimouratis [2006] FCAFC 153 at [153] - [154] . The Magistrate must exercise any discretion on the material before him or her unaffected by how the Registrar may have exercised the discretion.

20 The circumstance is which error may be established in connection with an exercise of discretion are described in House v The King 55 CLR at 504-505:
 
 "It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so."</text>

<tocase>Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/17.html</AustLII>
<text>21 In Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17 ; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518 Mason and Deane JJ said:
 
 "If the questions involved lend themselves to differences of opinion which, within a given range, are legitimate and reasonable answers to the questions, it would be wrong to allow a court of appeal to set aside a judgment at first instance merely because there exists just such a difference of opinion between the judges on appeal and the judge at first instance."

28 Whether someone has behaved unreasonably in particular circumstances involves a value judgment. It is a matter about which minds may well differ. In this case the appellant's conduct in response to the request in the GSM letter was relevant to the exercise of the Magistrate's discretion. The complaint that the Magistrate "relied too heavily" on that letter as opposed to other material does not demonstrate error in the exercise of the discretion. It simply argues about the end result of its exercise. See the passage from Norbis quoted at [21]. Nor does it mean, as the appellant submitted, that the Magistrate "thereby failed to consider properly the actions and conduct of the appellant".</text>

<tocase>Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 211</tocase>
<text>22 The above principles apply to an appeal against an order for costs: Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd (1987) 17 FCR 211 at 222. The starting point is that costs normally follow the event. In Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97-98 McHugh J with whom Brennan CJ agreed, said:
 
 "The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion .... 'Misconduct' in this context means misconduct relating to the litigation, or the circumstances leading up to the litigation. Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation; unnecessarily protracts the proceedings; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court; prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute."</text>

<tocase>Hogg v J Isherwood-Hicks Pty Ltd (1992) 108 FLR 62</tocase>
<text>29 The appellant claims the Magistrate erred by relying on two earlier decisions: Hogg v J Isherwood-Hicks Pty Ltd (1992) 108 FLR 62 and Microsoft (International) Pty Ltd v Total Peripherals Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 50. It is said that they are distinguishable. In my view the appellant mistakes the use the Magistrate was making of these cases. She accepted that they were distinguishable. She was deprecating precipitate action on the part of the appellant, as were the judges in the two cases relied on. The Magistrate did not commit an appealable error by relying on what was said in those cases about precipitate action, as a relevant consideration, simply because the cases are distinguishable on their facts.</text>
