<tocase>Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd (1999) FCA 728</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/728.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The above legal principles (and others) were conveniently set out by Weinberg J in Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd (1999) FCA 728 at [44] .

13 I have concluded that APM has failed to demonstrate that it is solvent, it having the burden to the requisite civil standard to prove solvency. I have reached this conclusion for a number of reasons.

14 In order to demonstrate solvency, reliance was finally placed by APM upon a report of James Edward Miller dated 30 August 2007, an expert accountant, who prepared a Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement of APM as at 30 August 2007 and provided a report as to solvency as at 30 August 2007.

29 In addition to what I have concluded above, there are other matters which demonstrate that APM has not discharged the onus of proving solvency:-
 
 (i) APM has failed to comply with the statutory demand of the creditors, and that of a supply creditor, T &amp; G Welding Pty Ltd.
 (ii) APM has been in default under mortgages over its property, and has no immediate or foreseeable capacity to service the mortgages.
 (iii) The application for winding up was made on 15 March 2007, over six months ago. On 18 June 2007, in the written submissions of APM, it was stated:
 [APM] is able to raise sufficient funds with which to pay for its short term creditors and it is anticipated that it will receive further funds in the near future from the sale of a properties [sic] . It is conceded that there are other further supporting creditors. [APM] will be able to use the funds that it is capable of raising and which it is anticipated of receiving in the near future with which to pay these debts. 
 This has not eventuated despite the time lapse and there is no evidence to suggest that there will be sufficient funds to pay creditors in the near or reasonably near future. All the evidence relied upon by APM over recent months simply raised possibilities which have not eventuated. 
 (iv) APM has been involved in disputes and legal proceedings with a number of people in addition to the Supreme Court proceedings mentioned above. The proceedings instituted already do not appear to be capable of resolution in the short term. 
 (v) APM's books and records are incomplete and unsubstantiated. There have been a number of suggestions by APM since this matter was first heard to the effect that the new director Mr Fisher would take steps to put the books of accounts in order these suggestions have not been fulfilled and even Mr Miller in his report of 30 August 2007 necessarily relied upon incomplete and unsubstantiated records.
 (vi) No director can make a declaration of solvency. The then current directors of APM on 9 June 2006 resolved that APM was solvent as at that date, but this is obviously not sufficient to persuade me that the company was solvent at the date of hearing of this application.
 (vii) No cash flow statement or projections have been provided by APM despite ample opportunity to do so in these proceedings.
 (viii) There is no material to demonstrate that the company, in its attempts to refinance or obtain sufficient funding, will succeed in the foreseeable future or at all see Crema (Vic) Pty Ltd v Land Mark Property Developments (Vic) Pty Ltd (2006) 24 ACLC 889, at [172] per Dodds-Streeton J; Re Presha Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 675 at 677 and Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd (1999) FCA 728 ;</text>

<text>47 In the event that I appointed a liquidator, it was submitted by the creditors that the liquidator be appointed as receiver of certain trust assets. In the appropriate case this could be ordered see ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1702.</text>

<tocase>ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (2006) 56 ACSR 646</tocase>
<text>48 In my view, the appropriate approach is to appoint the liquidator who has power to administer any trust assets (at least at the early states) (see Crest Realty Pty Ltd (No 2) (in liquidation) (1977) 1 NSWLR 664 and Wells v Wily [2004] NSWSC 607) , and the liquidator can approach the Court if any problems arise. I would not think it desirable to separate the function of the liquidator and any receiver of the trust assets in this case, and these functions should (at least initially) be fulfilled by the same person. The liquidator may apply to the Court if his appointment needs to be extended to that of receiver of the trust assets or if he needs further assistance. Equally, if any conflict arises because of the appointment of Mr McCann to other companies associated to APM, he can apply to seek directions on how to deal with that conflict: see ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (2006) 56 ACSR 646 at 652.</text>

<text>57 In Woodgate v Leonard [2007] NSWSC 495 , Barrett J said (at [37]):
 
 The jurisdiction discussed in these cases is an extraordinary and protective jurisdiction. It is separate from the jurisdiction involved in protection of confidential information and the enforcement of fiduciary duty. This is made clear, in particular, in the extract from the judgment of Whealy J just quoted. The concern is with the due and proper administration of justice in a proceeding before the court. The jurisdiction exists to ensure that the integrity of the proceeding is maintained. Identification of the means needed to maintain that integrity will, of course, depend on the nature of the proceeding and its likely course.

<tocase>Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67</tocase>
<text>24 I should indicate that Mr Miller was not cross-examined upon his report of 30 August 2007 by any of the creditors, supporting creditors or the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') (which was given leave to intervene in these proceedings). APM contended that in these circumstances, because of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, I should ignore the criticisms made of his report, or give APM the opportunity to recall Mr Miller to address the criticisms.

25 I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 has an important function to play in the course of a trial, as recently made clear by the Full Court in Jardein Pty Ltd v Stathakis [2007] FCAFC 148 , at [27] to [33]:
 
 Where a party intends to contradict or challenge the testimony of an opposing party's witness, the party is obliged to put that witness on notice that his or her account will be challenged: Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. This gives the witness an opportunity to respond to the allegations. The reason this is done is as a matter of basic fairness. See Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 per Hunt J. 
 
 Adherence to the rule in Browne v Dunn also gives the party calling the witness the chance to adduce supporting evidence which might not otherwise have been led. 
 
 Compliance with the rule requires only that the substance of the contrary version is put to the witness, and not every detail of the challenge: White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169 at 217 per Goldberg J. 
 
 In a civil case the consequences of a failure to observe the rule will vary. However, they will usually be related to the central object of the rule which is to secure fairness. 
 
 In Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 Mahoney JA said (at 236 237): 
 
 
 
 "This kind of problem may arise at different times in the litigation. It may arise during the trial. Thus, where a party fails to cross-examine a witness at all or on a particular matter, it may be prudent for the trial judge at the time to draw the attention of counsel in an appropriate way to the effect this may have on the later conduct of the trial. It may be that the question arises at a later stage in the trial when counsel seeks to call evidence contradicting the witness or discrediting his evidence, or seeks to address upon the basis that the witness' evidence is untrue. The trial judge may then have to determine what course should be followed. Sometimes the interests of justice may be served by having the witness recalled for cross-examination. Sometimes the circumstances may be such that the only way in which justice can be achieved is by directing that, for example, it is not open to counsel, in address, to make such suggestion. What is to be done will depend, as I have said, upon the circumstances of the case." 
 
 
 
 A possible consequence of a breach of the rule may be that the party in breach will be prevented from suggesting that the witness' testimony should be disbelieved. Another possible consequence will be the exclusion of evidence that challenges the witness' account with respect to those matters upon which there was no cross-examination. A third possible consequence will be to permit the witness to be recalled so that the breach can be remedied. One thing is clear. The rule is not simply to be ignored. 
 
 The rule in Browne v Dunn has not been abrogated under the uniform Evidence Acts: Heaton v Luczka (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 3 March 1998) per Beazley JA. Indeed, s 46 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) specifically enables the recall of a witness where there has been a breach of the rule and therefore implies its continued existence.

28 In any event, whilst I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn may apply to expert testimony, there is no rule of law requiring that evidence not challenged in cross-examination be accepted. In this case, APM has an onus of proof to establish solvency. The legal approach to such a task is well established on the authorities. The real attack in this case was that Mr Miller's evidence as to solvency should not be accepted as it was based upon incomplete records and unsubstantiated source material, a mistaken approach to what needs to be shown to prove solvency, and the fact that the qualifications made to the report were such that the conclusion of "marginal" solvency could not be accepted by this Court. It seems to me that all a cross-examiner would have put to Mr Miller on this basis would be the very qualifications to his report Mr Miller himself acknowledged, which in themselves show his report of 30 August 2007 could not satisfy the Court as to solvency. APM and Mr Miller have not been unfairly treated. APM came to Court bearing the onus of proof as to solvency, but in my view has failed to provide the "fullest and best" evidence of its financial position.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477</tocase>
<text>11 At the outset I set out some legal principles I rely upon for determining this proceeding:
 
 &#8226; APM bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C ;
 &#8226; In order to discharge that onus the Court should generally be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of APM: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1081;
 &#8226; Unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency: Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477; Re Citic Commodity Trading Pty Ltd v JBL Enterprises (WA) Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 232 ; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 459 at 463;
 &#8226; The nature of a company's assets, and its ability to convert those assets into cash within a relatively short time, at least to the extent of meeting all its debts as and when they fall due, must be considered in determining solvency: Rees v Bank of New South Wales [1964] HCA 47 ; (1964) 111 CLR 210; Re Tweeds Garages Ltd [1962] Ch 406 at 410; Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd 15 ACLC 477; Melbase Corporation Pty Ltd v Segenhoe Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 823 at 832; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 465-466;
 &#8226; The appropriate test is the "cash flow test" rather than a "balance sheet test" of insolvency. The adoption of a cash flow test for solvency does not mean that the extent of the company's assets is irrelevant to the inquiry. The credit resources available to the company must also be taken into account: Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 671 per Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed); Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 466; Taylor v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 808 at 812;
 &#8226; The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing, although relevant future events are not to be ignored: Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 466-467.</text>

<tocase>Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2002) 194 ALR 138</tocase>
<text>64 As I indicated above, the enquiry I needed to undertake was in respect of the solvency of APM. The factors leading to its current position may be relevant if they could impact upon APM's ability to pay its creditors in the near or foreseeable near future. The "fraud" allegations would hardly impact upon that issue following upon the evidence that had been presented to me by APM, particularly through the report of Mr Miller of 30 August 2007. There is also the need for finality in litigation and the particular need for prompt resolution of winding up applications putting aside the public interest, there is, as this case shows, the possibility of the evidence becoming stale or out of date: see Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2002) 194 ALR 138 at [9].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1404.html</AustLII>
<text>56 Young J said in Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd v Dean [2006] FCA 1404 at [35] :
 
 The crucial question, therefore, is whether on the evidence before me a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that Vogrig and WVL be restrained from acting for GSS in these proceedings. In answering this question it must be borne in mind that this is an application for a permanent injunction: Yunghanns v Elfic Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, Gillard J, 3 July 1998). It must also be borne in mind that the Court's jurisdiction is an exceptional one; it is to be exercised with appropriate caution and due weight must be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the solicitor of its choice without due cause.

59 The application was brought at a late stage in the proceedings, after I had reserved judgment. Even if I considered Saxbys had in some way acted improperly, in the exercise of my discretion, I would not at the stage the proceedings had reached have restrained Saxbys from future participation in the proceeding. The cost, inconvenience and practicalities of requiring lawyers to cease to act are a proper basis to refuse relief see Young J in Geelong School Supplies [2006] FCA 1404 at [32] and [51]. Subject to a limited re-opening being permitted to APM after I reserved my judgment, the hearing of the proceedings was otherwise at an end.

60 It was suggested that this Court would need to determine, after a proper hearing, Saxbys' conduct and the effect their conduct had on a fair trial of these proceedings.

61 No proper basis was established for such an enquiry. As I have said, Saxbys have brought the potential conflict to the attention of the relevant persons, and I do not assume that any of their alleged improper conduct has impacted upon a proper and fair trial in these proceedings. No particulars of such impact were provided to the Court even to give cause to make further enquiry.</text>

<tocase>Horwath Corporate Pty Ltd v Huie (1999) 32 ACSR 413</tocase>
<text>33 APM also contended that APM's financial position must be considered from its position as a "trustee company", APM having a right of indemnity that was equal to the value of the benefits that it provided to the trust estate and that was equivalent to the value of any liabilities that it has incurred, whilst acting as trustee of the trust. It was further contended that the indemnity ranked as a first charge upon the assets of the trust and, if the Court were not satisfied of the solvency of APM, that it should exercise its power to accede to the request of APM to be removed from the office of trustee (a request made during the course of the hearing) upon certain undertakings being made as to certain funds. In effect, APM wanted a receiver to take the place as trustee upon APM's removal as trustee. In addition, APM submitted in reliance upon comments of Young J in Horwath Corporate Pty Ltd v Huie (1999) 32 ACSR 413 (at 416) that the courts have traditionally have been reluctant to wind up a trustee company as difficult questions of rights and entitlements are involved that would need to be determined by litigation, and there would be no useful purpose in winding up the trustee upon its removal from the office of trustee.

36 I do not consider that the contentions of APM should be accepted. At the outset, I do not accept that the principles applied by Young J in Horwath 32 ACSR 413, which was a case concerning a trust and not a corporation, apply to APM, as was contended by APM. APM cannot be treated as a "trustee company" simply because it holds assets on trust for certain beneficiaries. In any event, unlike that before Young J, this is a case where it is necessary for a skilled insolvency practitioner to go through the books and records, having regard to their current state as accepted by Mr Miller and APM itself. Further, the liquidator once appointed will be in a good position to deal with competing claims, which may involve no litigation at all.

37 The simple answer to the other contentions of APM is that in this case, accepting a right of indemnity exists, it is a right which has not been shown will result in the foreseeable future in the availability of funds to pay creditors. This is a case where there will be issues to be determined as to whether a right of indemnity can be exercised, assuming it exists in theory, because of the actions of APM. There is the question of whether the trustee (APM) has properly incurred liabilities in acting as trustee: only if it has done so will it be entitled to be indemnified out of the trust assets.</text>

<tocase>Jardein Pty Ltd v Stathakis [2007] FCAFC 148</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/148.html</AustLII>
<text>25 I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 has an important function to play in the course of a trial, as recently made clear by the Full Court in Jardein Pty Ltd v Stathakis [2007] FCAFC 148 , at [27] to [33]:
 
 Where a party intends to contradict or challenge the testimony of an opposing party's witness, the party is obliged to put that witness on notice that his or her account will be challenged: Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. This gives the witness an opportunity to respond to the allegations. The reason this is done is as a matter of basic fairness. See Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 per Hunt J. 
 
 Adherence to the rule in Browne v Dunn also gives the party calling the witness the chance to adduce supporting evidence which might not otherwise have been led. 
 
 Compliance with the rule requires only that the substance of the contrary version is put to the witness, and not every detail of the challenge: White Industries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Flower &amp; Hart (a firm) (1998) 156 ALR 169 at 217 per Goldberg J. 
 
 In a civil case the consequences of a failure to observe the rule will vary. However, they will usually be related to the central object of the rule which is to secure fairness. 
 
 In Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 Mahoney JA said (at 236 237): 
 
 
 
 "This kind of problem may arise at different times in the litigation. It may arise during the trial. Thus, where a party fails to cross-examine a witness at all or on a particular matter, it may be prudent for the trial judge at the time to draw the attention of counsel in an appropriate way to the effect this may have on the later conduct of the trial. It may be that the question arises at a later stage in the trial when counsel seeks to call evidence contradicting the witness or discrediting his evidence, or seeks to address upon the basis that the witness' evidence is untrue. The trial judge may then have to determine what course should be followed. Sometimes the interests of justice may be served by having the witness recalled for cross-examination. Sometimes the circumstances may be such that the only way in which justice can be achieved is by directing that, for example, it is not open to counsel, in address, to make such suggestion. What is to be done will depend, as I have said, upon the circumstances of the case." 
 
 
 
 A possible consequence of a breach of the rule may be that the party in breach will be prevented from suggesting that the witness' testimony should be disbelieved. Another possible consequence will be the exclusion of evidence that challenges the witness' account with respect to those matters upon which there was no cross-examination. A third possible consequence will be to permit the witness to be recalled so that the breach can be remedied. One thing is clear. The rule is not simply to be ignored. 
 
 The rule in Browne v Dunn has not been abrogated under the uniform Evidence Acts: Heaton v Luczka (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, 3 March 1998) per Beazley JA. Indeed, s 46 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) specifically enables the recall of a witness where there has been a breach of the rule and therefore implies its continued existence.</text>

<tocase>Re Presha Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 675</tocase>
<text>29 In addition to what I have concluded above, there are other matters which demonstrate that APM has not discharged the onus of proving solvency:-
 
 (i) APM has failed to comply with the statutory demand of the creditors, and that of a supply creditor, T &amp; G Welding Pty Ltd.
 (ii) APM has been in default under mortgages over its property, and has no immediate or foreseeable capacity to service the mortgages.
 (iii) The application for winding up was made on 15 March 2007, over six months ago. On 18 June 2007, in the written submissions of APM, it was stated:
 [APM] is able to raise sufficient funds with which to pay for its short term creditors and it is anticipated that it will receive further funds in the near future from the sale of a properties [sic] . It is conceded that there are other further supporting creditors. [APM] will be able to use the funds that it is capable of raising and which it is anticipated of receiving in the near future with which to pay these debts. 
 This has not eventuated despite the time lapse and there is no evidence to suggest that there will be sufficient funds to pay creditors in the near or reasonably near future. All the evidence relied upon by APM over recent months simply raised possibilities which have not eventuated. 
 (iv) APM has been involved in disputes and legal proceedings with a number of people in addition to the Supreme Court proceedings mentioned above. The proceedings instituted already do not appear to be capable of resolution in the short term. 
 (v) APM's books and records are incomplete and unsubstantiated. There have been a number of suggestions by APM since this matter was first heard to the effect that the new director Mr Fisher would take steps to put the books of accounts in order these suggestions have not been fulfilled and even Mr Miller in his report of 30 August 2007 necessarily relied upon incomplete and unsubstantiated records.
 (vi) No director can make a declaration of solvency. The then current directors of APM on 9 June 2006 resolved that APM was solvent as at that date, but this is obviously not sufficient to persuade me that the company was solvent at the date of hearing of this application.
 (vii) No cash flow statement or projections have been provided by APM despite ample opportunity to do so in these proceedings.
 (viii) There is no material to demonstrate that the company, in its attempts to refinance or obtain sufficient funding, will succeed in the foreseeable future or at all see Crema (Vic) Pty Ltd v Land Mark Property Developments (Vic) Pty Ltd (2006) 24 ACLC 889, at [172] per Dodds-Streeton J; Re Presha Engineering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1983) 1 ACLC 675 at 677 and Ace Contractors Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Ltd (1999) FCA 728 ;</text>

<tocase>Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439</tocase>
<text>34 APM then submitted, in reliance upon the principles enunciated in Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439 at 443 per McPherson JA, that there would be no benefit to the creditors in the trustee company being wound up, and it was trite law that a creditor can claim to be subrogated to the right of indemnity of the trustee company and directly enforce the debt against the trust assets or even the beneficiaries personally.

35 The way in which these submissions were put seemed to relate both to the question of solvency and the discretion to be exercised by the Court as to whether to order a winding up, assuming I was not satisfied as to solvency. As a matter of procedure, APM moved the Court for its removal as trustee, the appointment of a receiver, and that a winding up not be ordered by the Court.

38 As to APM's reliance on Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439, in that case the question of whether the trustee had properly incurred liabilities was not a matter that was or could be in contention. The defendants could not, having authorised the action of the trustee, have complained of a breach of trust.

39 Putting aside the correctness of the decision in Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439 in allowing the trustee's creditor to sue trust beneficiaries directly to enforce the trustee's right of indemnity against the beneficiaries, I do not consider it appropriate where there is an issue or potential issue as to whether the right of indemnity is available in the circumstances of this case to conclude that the creditors should be left to pursue such claims individually. In any event, there is no evidence that there will be sufficient assets to pay the creditors after the secured creditors have been paid. I do not consider that APM's contentions relating to the right of indemnity demonstrate that APM is solvent, assuming that at law there is a right of indemnity in favour of APM, or that such right of indemnity is a factor in favour of exercising my discretion not to wind up the company. If a liquidator is appointed he will be well placed to consider and deal with the question of the right of indemnity, and pursue with priority claims over the beneficiaries.

40 I now turn to other discretionary matters raised by APM and the issue of APM continuing as a trustee and the appointment of a receiver.

41 As I have indicated above, it was contended that if I came to the conclusion that APM had not discharged the burden of proof to show it was solvent, I should not order the winding up of the company but should instead remove it as trustee and appoint a receiver over the trust assets. In support of this approach, evidence was led of a number of creditors who expressed a desire for such a course. It was argued that it would save time and costs if the appropriate person, already familiar with the company, was appointed (in this case Mr Andrew Leonard Dunner). It was further contended that with the number of actions threatened against the company a receiver would be in a better position to defend the company with the aid of the current director, that the principal director (Mr Edwards) who was responsible for the bad state of the books of accounts of the company is no longer involved with APM, and that the current director is taking steps to put the books of accounts in proper order and prepare proper financial statements.

42 In addition, it was argued that because of the operation clause 11 in the Memorandum of Agreement between APM and the developer, Rocco Antonio Calderone, dated 3 August 2005, in the event of the appointment of a liquidator, APM would not be able to rely upon its right of indemnity, as the developer would be released from its duties and obligations under the agreement, and the trust properties would vest in the hands of the beneficiaries.

43 I have come to the view that I should order the winding up of APM despite these contentions. In addition to the views I have expressed in coming to the view that APM has not discharged the burden of proof upon it and my views on the report of Mr Miller of 30 August 2007, I have concluded that APM should be wound up, and that the alternative course of action contended for by APM not be followed, for the following reasons:
 
 (i) Whilst some creditors do not want the appointment of a liquidator, this is not the universal view of the unsecured creditors, and in any event is not a decisive factor.
 (ii) Whilst the appointment of a receiver familiar with the company already may save some time and costs, this is not the important consideration when balanced against the important public interest of ensuring an insolvent company ceases trading even if only a presumed insolvent company.
 (iii) Clause 11 does not, in my view, release the developer from any past responsibilities or liabilities it may have had under the agreement all it seems to do is to release, upon the appointment of a liquidator, the developer from any further duties and obligations under the agreement from the date of the appointment. In any event, even if clause 11 does have the result as contended for by APM, including the vesting of trust property in the beneficiary, the other factors I have relied upon in these reasons would indicate that it is appropriate for the company to be wind up, the public interest being a paramount consideration where APM is unable to prove its solvency and the books of accounts are incomplete and are unsubstantiated. Upon vesting of the trust property in the beneficiaries, the company will still have a beneficial interest with priority over the beneficiaries if, as trustee, it has a right of indemnity as submitted. If the debts have been incurred in the administration of the trust, the liquidator can call upon the right of indemnity.
 (iv) I do not consider that there are now better prospects for the creditors as a whole (including the unsecured creditors) if the company, with or without a receiver, were allowed to continue to trade on.</text>

 &#8226; The nature of a company's assets, and its ability to convert those assets into cash within a relatively short time, at least to the extent of meeting all its debts as and when they fall due, must be considered in determining solvency: Rees v Bank of New South Wales [1964] HCA 47 ; (1964) 111 CLR 210; Re Tweeds Garages Ltd [1962] Ch 406 at 410; Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd 15 ACLC 477; Melbase Corporation Pty Ltd v Segenhoe Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 823 at 832; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 465-466;
 &#8226; The appropriate test is the "cash flow test" rather than a "balance sheet test" of insolvency. The adoption of a cash flow test for solvency does not mean that the extent of the company's assets is irrelevant to the inquiry. The credit resources available to the company must also be taken into account: Sandell v Porter [1966] HCA 28 ; (1966) 115 CLR 666 at 671 per Barwick CJ (with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed); Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 466; Taylor v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1988) 6 ACLC 808 at 812;
 &#8226; The question of solvency must be assessed at the date of the hearing, although relevant future events are not to be ignored: Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC at 466-467.</text>

<text>11 At the outset I set out some legal principles I rely upon for determining this proceeding:
 
 &#8226; APM bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C ;
 &#8226; In order to discharge that onus the Court should generally be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of APM: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1081;

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/607.html</AustLII>
<text>48 In my view, the appropriate approach is to appoint the liquidator who has power to administer any trust assets (at least at the early states) (see Crest Realty Pty Ltd (No 2) (in liquidation) (1977) 1 NSWLR 664 and Wells v Wily [2004] NSWSC 607) , and the liquidator can approach the Court if any problems arise. I would not think it desirable to separate the function of the liquidator and any receiver of the trust assets in this case, and these functions should (at least initially) be fulfilled by the same person. The liquidator may apply to the Court if his appointment needs to be extended to that of receiver of the trust assets or if he needs further assistance. Equally, if any conflict arises because of the appointment of Mr McCann to other companies associated to APM, he can apply to seek directions on how to deal with that conflict: see ASIC v Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (2006) 56 ACSR 646 at 652.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2007/495.html</AustLII>
<text>57 In Woodgate v Leonard [2007] NSWSC 495 , Barrett J said (at [37]):
 
 The jurisdiction discussed in these cases is an extraordinary and protective jurisdiction. It is separate from the jurisdiction involved in protection of confidential information and the enforcement of fiduciary duty. This is made clear, in particular, in the extract from the judgment of Whealy J just quoted. The concern is with the due and proper administration of justice in a proceeding before the court. The jurisdiction exists to ensure that the integrity of the proceeding is maintained. Identification of the means needed to maintain that integrity will, of course, depend on the nature of the proceeding and its likely course.
