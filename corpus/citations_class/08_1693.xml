<text>8 Observations concerning the meaning of effect of s 424A were made by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 , at 1195 1196, [15] [17]. In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, one there finds the following in para 15: 
 Section 424A does not require notice to be given of every matter the Tribunal might think relevant to the decision under review. Rather the Tribunal's obligation is limited to the written provision of "particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review".

9 And then in para 17:
 The "reason, or a part of the reason for affirming the decision that is under review" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellant's statutory declaration would itself be "information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason for, affirming the decision that is under review". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellant's claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations.

10 Appended to the protection visa application was a statement of the male Appellant. That statement provided the basis upon which a claim for a protection visa was made. It also provided, for the reason which I have already given, the basis upon which the Appellant's wife advanced her claim. The basis of the claim for a protection visa, as there made, was not enlarged upon in the proceedings of the Tribunal. That is because, though invited to attend at a hearing and present evidence, the Appellant and his wife did not take advantage of that opportunity. The Tribunal, then, as it was entitled to do under the Migration Act 1958 , decided the case on the basis of the material which it did have, and that material, in essence, was the statement to which I have referred.</text>
