<tocase>Doolan v Dare [2005] FCAFC 69 ; (2005) 142 FCR 287 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/69.html</AustLII>
<text>50 The relationship between s 162 and s 64U of the Act was considered by the Full Court in Doolan v Dare [2005] FCAFC 69 ; (2005) 142 FCR 287. Their Honours' conclusions in this regard concerning the Act as in force at the time with which this proceeding is concerned may be summarised as follows:
 
(a) The Act assumes the existence of a right to be remunerated where a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed in the expectation that he or she will be remunerated and there is no prior arrangement to act gratuitously;
 
(b) s 162, and not s 64U, provides the mechanism for fixing the remuneration to be paid to a trustee;
 
(c) s 64U merely prescribes what is to occur at the first meeting of creditors in relation to a trustee's remuneration, and in the case of s 64U(8), at later meetings of creditors;
 
(d) s 64U(2) requires that a trustee's stated wish to be remunerated at the rate prescribed by the Regulation be minuted; it does not require that effect be given to that wish;
 
(e) a motion fixing the trustee's remuneration passed in accordance with s 64U is a resolution for the purposes of s 162(1);
 
(f) s 162(4) does not prevent the creditors from fixing the trustees' remuneration in relation to work to be undertaken thereafter in a sum or at a rate less than that which would otherwise flow from the application of the prescribed rate; the trustee's entitlement to a minimum level of remuneration is established by s 161B; and
 
(g) it is therefore incorrect to state that a trustee is permitted to elect to be remunerated at the prescribed rate; entitlement to remuneration at the prescribed rate arises by operation of s 162(4) when work is done for which no remuneration is fixed.

51 Neither party contended that, as a consequence of Mr Pantzer's failure to comply with the requirements of s 64U(5), the first meeting of Dr Wenkart's creditors was a nullity. Dr Wenkart's argument was that the failure to comply with s 64U(5) rendered ineffective the resolutions of the creditors fixing Mr Pantzer's remuneration. He additionally submitted that the proper construction of s 64U(8) when read with s 162(1) is that it is not possible for creditors at their first meeting to approve any remuneration for work done by the trustee.

52 It seems to me that Dr Wenkart's argument that the failure to comply with s 64U(5) rendered the creditors' resolutions ineffective is inconsistent with the conclusions of the Full Court in Doolan v Dare as to the significance of s 64U. Their Honours took the view that s 162, and not s 64U, provides the mechanism for fixing the remuneration to be paid to trustees. I therefore conclude that Mr Pantzer's failure to comply with s 64U(5) did not affect the validity of the motions carried at the first meeting of Dr Wenkart's creditors concerning Mr Pantzer's remuneration nor the motions on the same topic carried at later meetings.

53 I also reject Dr Wenkart's submission as to the significance of s 64U(8) when read with s 162(1). Section 64U(8) requires the President of a meeting of creditors other than the first meeting of creditors to request the trustee to lay before the meeting a statement of the amount of remuneration drawn by him or her from the funds of the bankrupt estate. That is, it is concerned with the drawing of remuneration, not the approval of remuneration. Nothing in s 64U(8) or s 162(1) suggests that the legislature intended to prevent creditors at their first meeting fixing by resolution of the creditors the remuneration of the trustee for work done before, at or (subject to the issue of prospective approval referred to below) after that meeting.

55 The practice of creditors approving future remuneration of a trustee in bankruptcy by reference to time-charging at the recommended rates set out in the IPAA guidelines is well established (see, for example, Pattison v Bellin at [2]). No instance of any Judge expressing disapproval of the practice was drawn to my attention. In Doolan v Dare the Full Court referred to Finkelstein's consideration of the history of the "fixing" of fees of insolvency practitioners and observed at [19] that the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) with which his Honour was concerned differ substantially from the provisions of the Act concerning the remuneration of trustees. In the above circumstances I do not consider it appropriate for a single judge to determine that a practice apparently sanctioned by other judgments of the Court is inconsistent with the Act. Having placed reliance on the view expressed by Finkelstein J, Dr Wenkart will be free, if so advised, to press his argument in this regard before the Full Court.</text>

<tocase>In Re Dare [1992] FCA 509 ; (1992) 38 FCR 356</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/509.html</AustLII>
<text>38 The provisions of s 165(1)(b) of the Act were also considered by Drummond J in In Re Dare [1992] FCA 509 ; (1992) 38 FCR 356 at 359-361. His Honour agreed with French J that it is necessary to read down s 165(1)(b) to avoid absurdity, noting that the legislative intent could not have been to proscribe the long-standing practice of members of partnerships being appointed as trustees and bringing their earnings as trustees into the pool of partnership income. Drummond J also expressed the view at 359 that it was difficult to identify any policy in the Act that would be served by reading the subsection as preventing a trustee dealing as the trustee chose with his or her income so long as the dealing was for the trustee's benefit. Finding guidance as to the limitation that should be placed on s 165(1)(b) in its precursor, s 134(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth), his Honour concluded that the subsection would not strike at an employee-trustee paying over or arranging to have paid to the trustee's employer his or her fees earned as trustee. Although Drummond J did not give express consideration to the position of an independent consultant trustee, I see no reason to limit the general approach adopted by his Honour so as to exclude its operation in respect of an independent consultant trustee.

39 Considering it appropriate to follow the approach adopted by Drummond J in In Re Dare, I reject the submission that Mr Pantzer's arrangements concerning his remuneration as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate contravened s 165(1)(b) of the Act. I also reject the alternative submissions that to the extent to which Mr Pantzer was paid remuneration in excess of the amount that he actually received from the Partnership he is liable to Dr Wenkart as the residuary beneficiary of the trust estate in respect of that amount.

40 It is not in dispute that persons in the employ of the Partnerships assisted Mr Pantzer in the performance of his duties as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate. Those persons were not accurately described as either partners or staff of Mr Pantzer.

41 Section 64U(5) of the Act required Mr Pantzer, at the first meeting of Dr Wenkart's creditors, to state the respective rates at which his remuneration and that of the other persons who would be assisting him would be calculated. It appears from the minutes of the meeting that Mr Pantzer sought to comply with this requirement by providing creditors with a copy of the document described in [18] above.</text>

<text>54 In Korda, in the Matter of Stockford Limited [2004] FCA 1682 ; (2004) 140 FCR 424 at [30] Finkelstein J expressed doubt as to the validity of the practice of creditors "fixing" the prospective fees of liquidators on a time-charge basis. Dr Wenkart submitted that the Court should conclude that this practice is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1528.html</AustLII>
<text>49 A first meeting of creditors is, in my view, a proceeding under the Act within the meaning of s 306(1) of the Act ( Nilant v Macchia [2000] FCA 1528 ; (2000) 104 FCR 238 per Carr J at [36] and Weinberg J at [42]-[53]). The defect in the resolutions was in the circumstances, I conclude, "a formal defect or irregularity" (s 306(1)).</text>

<tocase>Pattison v Bellin [2000] FCA 1167 ; (2000) 103 FCR 590</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1167.html</AustLII>
<text>31 However, the motion carried at the meeting held on 29 March 2000 approving Mr Pantzer's remuneration and "that of his partners and staff" from 11 March 2000 to 28 March 2000 in the sum of $11,811.40 suggests that by 11 March 2000 Mr Pantzer's claimed remuneration from 13 December 1999 calculated on the approved basis had reached the limit of $80,000 fixed by the creditors at their first meeting. I therefore conclude that the approval of $11,811.40 for remuneration from 11 March 2000 to 28 March 2000 was an amount additional to the amounts approved at the first meeting of creditors. On the same basis I conclude that the motion fixing the further remuneration of Mr Pantzer from 29 March 2000 to a limit of $68,188.60 beyond which further approval would be required from creditors was intended, together with the approval in respect of $11,811.40, to constitute approval for additional remuneration in a further amount of $80,000. It might have been arguable that by this motion the creditors reserved to themselves the fixing of any further remuneration beyond that amount (cf the resolution of creditors considered by Goldberg J in Pattison v Bellin [2000] FCA 1167 ; (2000) 103 FCR 590 at [2] and [33]). It does not appear that it has ever been so argued.

32 I conclude that on the proper construction of the above resolution, the creditors purportedly approved Mr Pantzer's remuneration as follows:
 
(a) $60,744.70 for the period from 28 October 10 December 1999;
 
(b) $80,000 for future remuneration from 13 December 1999;
 
(c) $11,811.40 for the period from 11 March 28 March 2000; 
 
(d) $68,188.60 for future remuneration from 29 March 2000; and
 
(e) $105,000.00 in accordance with para (a)(I) of the s 73 proposal.
 
These amounts are reflected in the first eleven payment items shown on Mr Pantzer's schedule (see [9] above).

55 The practice of creditors approving future remuneration of a trustee in bankruptcy by reference to time-charging at the recommended rates set out in the IPAA guidelines is well established (see, for example, Pattison v Bellin at [2]). No instance of any Judge expressing disapproval of the practice was drawn to my attention. In Doolan v Dare the Full Court referred to Finkelstein's consideration of the history of the "fixing" of fees of insolvency practitioners and observed at [19] that the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) with which his Honour was concerned differ substantially from the provisions of the Act concerning the remuneration of trustees. In the above circumstances I do not consider it appropriate for a single judge to determine that a practice apparently sanctioned by other judgments of the Court is inconsistent with the Act. Having placed reliance on the view expressed by Finkelstein J, Dr Wenkart will be free, if so advised, to press his argument in this regard before the Full Court.

64 On 4 December 2001 Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris advised Hunt &amp; Hunt that Mr Pantzer's costs, expenses and remuneration were as follows:
 A. Trustee's remuneration These figures do not include any realisation and interest charges or GST payable that may become due or other possible liabilities such as insurance $183,875.11 B. Anticipated Trustee Costs and Expenses - to finalise all matters in the bankrupt estate in the event that all costs, expenses and remuneration are paid as at 30 November 2001 $8,600.00 C. Trustee's Legal Fees and Disbursements - as at 30 November 2001 $247,103.62 A. Total Further Anticipated Legal Fees and Disbursement - depending on terms of s73 proposal and date of acceptance. $3,000 to unknown $ Total costs of Administration - in the event that a s73 proposal goes ahead which excludes any dispute as to the trustee's entitlement for full remuneration and payment of his full costs and expenses as set out above $442,578.73

65 By a memorandum dated 8 January 2002 Hunt &amp; Hunt repeated their request to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris for an itemised account of their costs.

66 By a letter dated 16 January 2002 Mr Pantzer advised Hunt &amp; Hunt:
 
 My solicitors did not state in their facsimile to you of 11 December 2001 that an itemised Bill of Costs had been provided by it to the creditors. My solicitor's statement was that the Trustee: 
 

 
 
 '...will provide an itemised Bill of Costs (as provided by Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris) to the Creditors;...' 
 


 
 I have been issued with legal Bills of Costs in relation to the estate for work up to November 2001. My solicitors are currently preparing Memoranda of Fees in relation to the work done since that date. The Bill of Costs which I have received, are of course, available for inspection by the creditors at any time. 
 

 
 Please find enclosed copies of the bills with which [I] have already been issued. Upon receipt of the Bills of Costs from Cutler Hughes and Harris relating to work done from November 2001 I will provide you with those copies. 
 

 
 ... 
 

 
 Would you please confirm that your clients still require a taxation of those bills. 
 

 
 In the event that your clients require taxation of the bills, would you please indicate: 
 

 
 
 
 (a) Which creditor will provide me with the costs of making an application for taxation of the bills; and 
 
 (b) Which creditor will undertake to provide payment of those costs or provide me with security for the payment of those costs 
 
 


 
 by return letter.

<tocase>Re Hurt, Ex parte Hurt (1988) 80 ALR 236</tocase>
<text>37 It is not necessary for me to express a view on whether the practice whereby the respective Partnerships charged in their own names for Mr Pantzer's work as trustee was objectionable. I note, however, that in Re Hurt, Ex parte Hurt (1988) 80 ALR 236 at 240-241 French J expressed the view in the context of an employed trustee in bankruptcy that a trustee should render accounts for work done as a trustee in the trustee's own name. His Honour observed at 241 that while the scope of s 165(1)(b) of the Act must be read "somewhat less than literally to avoid absurdity", it could well be infringed by an arrangement under which the trustee in effect seeks to alienate his remuneration at source by abdicating to his or her employer the right to charge for the trustee's services.</text>

<tocase>Wenkart v Pantzer (2005) 223 ALR 384</tocase>
<text>47 In Wenkart v Pantzer (2005) 223 ALR 384 at [70]-[71] I said:
 
 Subsection 162(6) does not operate, in my view, to prevent a trustee whose remuneration is fixed, for example, on a time-spent basis, from causing some of the ordinary duties required by the Act to be performed by the trustee to be undertaken, in whole or in part, by persons under the trustee's supervision and control. If the section were to so operate it could be expected significantly to increase the costs of the administration of estates by rendering it impractical for a trustee to instruct less highly remunerated personnel to undertake aspects of the trustee's duties under the trustee's supervision. 
 

 
 I conclude that subs 162(6) does not operate to require a taxing officer to disallow claims for remuneration by Mr Pantzer where the ordinary duties required by the Act to be performed by the trustee were performed by a person acting on behalf of Mr Pantzer and under his supervision and control. This view is consistent with the view expressed by Rogerson J in Re Ladyman (1981) 38 ALR 631 at 644 that a trustee can claim to be reimbursed for the cost of services rendered by persons employed exclusively by him or her. I also note that the Guide to Hourly Rates published by the Insolvency Practitioners' Association of Australia, which is recognised by reg 8.08, assumes that work will be undertaken by persons other than the trustee himself or herself.

48 I am not satisfied in the circumstances of this case that the erroneous description in the resolution of creditors of those who assisted Mr Pantzer rendered those resolutions ineffective to fix Mr Pantzer's remuneration. It may be assumed that the creditors accurately understood that the persons concerned were partners or employees of the Partnerships. Nothing in the evidence suggests that the precise nature of the relationship between those persons and Mr Pantzer was of any real interest to the creditors.</text>

<text>33 Additionally, as I noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [64] , Mr Pantzer's claim for 85% of the sum of $115,406.07 (ie $98,095.16) has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings. In Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 published on 29 October 2003, Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed. On that day Mr Pantzer's claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge. The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is, in my view, 14 days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim, namely 29 March 2002 (reg 8.09(1) of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 as then in force). This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer's schedule.</text>

<tocase>Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1589.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 16 October 2007 I published reasons for judgment in this matter ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2007] FCA 1589]). On that day I stood the proceeding over to a date to be fixed for the purpose of making orders giving effect to those reasons. Having regard to the complex history of the matter I additionally invited the parties to draw to my attention any issues on which I had inadvertently failed to rule.

2 No agreement was reached between the parties as to the orders appropriate to be made to give effect to my reasons for judgment. Dr Wenkart took the view that my published reasons for judgment did not deal with all of the issues required to be resolved in this matter.

3 The proceeding was therefore relisted to allow the parties to make further submissions. On 12 November 2007 Mr Sheahan SC appeared with Mr Green for Dr Wenkart; Mr Creais, solicitor, appeared for Mr Pantzer and Mr Rea appeared for Hapday Holdings Pty Ltd. These reasons for judgment should be read together with those published on 16 October 2007.

33 Additionally, as I noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [64] , Mr Pantzer's claim for 85% of the sum of $115,406.07 (ie $98,095.16) has been the subject of litigation in other proceedings. In Wenkart v Pantzer (No 6) [2003] FCA 1210 published on 29 October 2003, Lindgren J dismissed a motion by Dr Wenkart for an extension of time within which to request that this claim be taxed. On that day Mr Pantzer's claim to be lawfully entitled to that sum was rendered effectively beyond challenge. The date upon which he is to be regarded as becoming lawfully entitled to the sum is, in my view, 14 days after Dr Wenkart became aware of the amount of the claim, namely 29 March 2002 (reg 8.09(1) of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 as then in force). This amount is reflected in the second unpaid amount listed in Mr Pantzer's schedule.

57 The accuracy of Mr Pantzer's schedule so far as it concerns payments made to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is not challenged by Dr Wenkart. Payments by Mr Pantzer to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris in the aggregate amount of $380,225 are evidenced by a list of cash payments ("the Cash Payments List") made during the period of the administration by Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate provided to Dr Wenkart's then solicitors (Bruce &amp; Stewart) by Mr Pantzer's then solicitors (Sally Nash &amp; Co) under cover of a letter dated 7 October 2004 and placed in evidence by Dr Wenkart. At the heart of the dispute between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is the question of whether all of the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris are required to be taxed to determine the total quantum of the costs that Mr Pantzer is entitled to recover from Dr Wenkart (see order 1 of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002 which are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] ).

58 Mr Pantzer's case is that there was no request for any of the amounts paid to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris to be taxed under s 167 of the Act other than the amount of $105,000 paid on the date that Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy was annulled. Robert Gorczyca of Bruce &amp; Stewart, as the firm was then known, gave evidence that the first occasion on which he was provided with an accounting of the former bankrupt estate of Dr Wenkart was when he received the Cash Payments List (see [57] above). Before being retained by Dr Wenkart, Bruce &amp; Stewart acted for creditors of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate. The evidence suggests that the only advice given by Mr Pantzer to Dr Wenkart and the creditors of his estate during the course of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy is that referred to in [22] and [24] above. I therefore accept the accuracy of Mr Gorczyca's evidence in this regard.

59 However, Dr Wenkart's primary submission concerning the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris is that this proceeding has been conducted on the basis of an agreement by Mr Pantzer to have the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris taxed, and that this agreement is reflected in the orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003. Those orders are reproduced in [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] . It is therefore necessary to review the history of the dealings between Mr Pantzer and Dr Wenkart so far as they touch on the legal costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris.

60 The s 73 proposal put forward by Dr Wenkart by letter dated 18 January 2001 provided for certain bank cheques to be given to Mr Pantzer subject to the acceptance of the proposal by his creditors. One of the proposals was:
 
 the amount of $105,000.00 (in accordance with your letter of 7 December 2000) less the cash on hand you currently hold (as advised to be approximately $24,000) in the form of a bank cheque for your outstanding legal fees (including any associated with the current proceedings) due to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris up to the date and conclusion of the Section 73 meeting and its implementation.

61 I infer that there had been communication between Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer before Dr Wenkart formulated his s 73 proposal. This appears to be confirmed by par 4 of an affidavit sworn by Mr Pantzer on 8 March 2002. That paragraph reads as follows:
 
 At the date of the Section 73 proposal being put to me by the bankrupt on 18 January 2001 I determined the amount of the Trustee's remuneration and costs and disbursements incurred in the administration of the bankrupt estate at that time. Those amounts were $105,000.00 payable to me as Trustee and $105,000.00 payable to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. In proceedings 7051 of 2002 my rights to recover remuneration, costs, charges and expenses were preserved.

78 The context in which Lindgren J came to make orders in this matter on 21 October 2003 was that the docket judge, who was then Beaumont J, was unwell. Lindgren J was thus more than usually dependent on information provided to him by the parties' respective legal representatives. On 11 March 2002 Beaumont J had made the consent orders that are set out in [2007] FCA 1589 at [15] . Those orders provided, in effect, that Dr Wenkart charged the Paddington property to secure the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was, or might become, lawfully entitled as trustee of his bankrupt estate and recorded that Dr Wenkart "agreed to pay the same within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree". I observe, incidentally, that there is no suggestion that the parties have agreed another time.

79 The orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] ), although made after the filing of the cross-claim, were intended to enable the amount to which Mr Pantzer was "lawfully entitled" as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate to be quantified. Those orders in effect, obliged Mr Pantzer to require the persons who had provided services to him with respect to Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate (other than Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris) to supply bills of costs pursuant to s 167 of the Bankruptcy Act and additionally obliged Mr Pantzer to notify Dr Wenkart of his claim for remuneration in respect of services provided after the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy. I observe incidentally that the absence of any reference in the order to Mr Pantzer's entitlement to remuneration for services provided before the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy supports my above conclusion that Mr Pantzer's entitlement in that regard had by that time been quantified. His Honour noted that Dr Wenkart conceded that upon completion of taxation of the claims for costs and remuneration referred to in the orders, the amount taxed would be amounts to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled within the meaning of the orders made on 11 March 2002.

80 The explanation for Mr Pantzer not being obliged by the orders made on 21 October 2003 to require Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris to supply bills of costs can be found in the transcript of the hearing on that day before Lindgren J. On that day Mr Johnson of counsel appeared for Mr Pantzer. One of the matters debated before his Honour was a procedure for quantifying the amounts to which Mr Pantzer was "lawfully entitled" within the meaning of order 1 of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. Mr Johnson told his Honour:
 
 The position that we would seek is orders that we are lawfully entitled to a quantified amount of remuneration and costs and, your Honour, either to give directions as to who that procedure [sic] is to be quantified and then that attached to the charge. 
 

 
Mr Johnson later observed:
 
 Well, if your Honour was then minded to consider a position of a regime for quantification, we would say there should be some conditions, because we're concerned about this matter dragging on.

81 Mr Johnson went on to advise his Honour that the judgment of Beaumont J of 6 May 2003 (ie Wenkart v Pantzer [2003] FCA 471) dealt with the amounts due to Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. That judgment concerned Mr Pantzer's entitlement to the amount of Ms Sexton's certificate of taxation of 17 February 2003. Mr Johnson agreed with Lindgren J that, because Beaumont J had already determined the amount to which Mr Pantzer was entitled in respect of the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris, those costs should be an exception to the order obliging Mr Pantzer to require service providers to supply bills of costs. Shortly thereafter the transcript records the following exchange concerning the way in which the orders to be made by Lindgren J should be drafted:
 
 
 
 His Honour: ....We have excluded from that order legal services provided to Mr Pantzer by Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. Now is that correct? That covers all legal services irrespective of when provided by Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris? 
 
 Mr Johnson: I believe it does, your Honour. And I also believe it extends to their out of pocket expenses, including counsel fees ... 
 
 His Honour: In other words, that is already subject to the existing taxation? 
 
 Mr Johnson: Yes. Again, I will check Ms Sexton's taxation records on that, your Honour. 
 
 


 
It does not appear that Mr Johnson later qualified or withdrew his affirmative answer to the last of Lindgren J's above questions and his Honour thereafter made the orders dated 21 October 2003.

82 For the reasons given above, it appears that Mr Johnson's understanding on 21 October 2003 of the ambit of Ms Sexton's taxation was erroneous. However, I see no reason to conclude that Dr Wenkart's legal representatives were aware of Mr Johnson's error; Dr Wenkart's solicitors had requested a comprehensive taxation of the costs of Cutler Hughes &amp; Harris. I conclude that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated 21 October 2003.

83 The transcript of the hearing before Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 also reveals that on that day Mr Johnson accepted that the orders that Lindgren J was being invited to make would extend to other legal services provided to Mr Pantzer, including by him and his instructing solicitors, Sally Nash &amp; Co. Nonetheless, Mr Pantzer now submits that the amounts paid by him to Mr Johnson, Sally Nash &amp; Co and Mr P Walsh of counsel are all amounts to which he is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart because Dr Wenkart made no request for the relevant bills of costs to be taxed pursuant to s 167 of the Act. Again, I take the view that it is not now open to Mr Pantzer in this proceeding to adopt an approach that is inconsistent with the basis upon which Lindgren J was invited to make the orders dated 21 October 2003. The bill of costs of Sally Nash &amp; Co was certified by a taxing officer on 13 December 2004. The respective bills of costs of Mr Johnson and Mr Walsh were certified by a taxing officer on 12 January 2005. The quantum of Mr Pantzer's costs in respect of the legal services provided by those legal representatives was determined within the meaning of order 1 of the orders of 11 March 2002 by the respective certificates of taxation.

84 As mentioned above, the significance of the date 31 October 2002 is that it is the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's deemed cross-claim seeking "an order in aid of [the Court's] order made on 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of the [Paddington property]" (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [17] ).

85 As noted in [2007] FCA 1589 at [39] - [44] , the Full Court disagreed with the construction initially given by me to the orders made on 11 March 2002 and 21 October 2003. Nonetheless it is, I think, uncontroversial that Dr Wenkart's agreements to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is "lawfully entitled" from him is an agreement to pay within 28 days of the determination of the quantum of "the same". The charge over the Paddington property secures the payments by him of the relevant amount within that period of time. That is, Mr Pantzer is not entitled to exercise rights under the charge created by order 2 of the consent orders until Dr Wenkart defaults on his agreement to pay. By filing his cross-claim Mr Pantzer sought to exercise rights in reliance on that charge.

86 There is no dispute between the parties that the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate was $769,191.66. It is the payments made by Mr Pantzer that are controversial or perhaps, more accurately, the identification of the date or dates upon which the quantum of the amount or amounts to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled was determined.

87 As indicated above, I accept that the creditors of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate authorised Mr Pantzer's remuneration in an aggregate amount of $325,744.30. Mr Pantzer's schedule reveals that between 13 December 1999 and 10 March 2000 he paid himself 30 cents more than the creditors had authorised. This may be ignored on the de minimis principle. The total amount of authorised payments made by Mr Pantzer to himself by way of remuneration earlier than 31 October 2002 was thus $325,744.60.</text>
