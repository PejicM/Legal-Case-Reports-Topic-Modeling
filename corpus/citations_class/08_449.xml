<text>14 The statements in the affidavits of Mr Pearson and Mr Owbridge walk a very fine line between the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice and implied assertions that are inconsistent with it: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] ; Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 at [52] .</text>

<text>19 The question of whether the content has been put in issue or deployed lies at the heart of the principle of waiver. I am not satisfied that the assertions necessarily lay open the content of the confidential communications to scrutiny: DSE (Holdings) Pty Limited v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; (2003) 127 FCR 499 at [58] .

20 It follows that the motion must be dismissed.
