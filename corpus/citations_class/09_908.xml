<text>As a general proposition, an administrative decision-maker may fall into jurisdictional error where he fails to consider relevant material: Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. A decision that involves jurisdictional error is a decision that lacks legal foundation and is properly regarded, in law, as no decision at all: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 at [51] , [2002] HCA 11 ; 209 CLR 597 at 614 to 615 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ (McHugh J agreeing at [63]).</text>

<text>A failure on the part of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider " a substantial aspect or integer " of a claim being advanced may likewise amount to a constructive failure to exercise its jurisdiction: SZGUW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 91 at [68] to [69] per Jacobson J. In Bhardwaj , supra , Callinan J concluded: 
 [163] ... If one thing is abundantly clear, it is that the Tribunal must, if an application has properly been made as it was here, review the Minister's decision. This means that the Tribunal must exercise the jurisdiction of reviewing the Minister's decision: that is to say, it must make a decision on the application and any documents properly submitted by an applicant, with, as part of, or relevant to it. To fail, or refuse to receive and consider such a document, and to make a decision without regard to it, is a failure to exercise jurisdiction. This is more than a failure to give a party a hearing. It is to proceed on a false basis that such a document simply does not exist or has not been communicated to the Tribunal. The Tribunal would in these circumstances no more be exercising its jurisdiction than a court would be in deciding a case in favour of a defendant without looking at the plaintiff's initiating document and pleading, or even knowing that they had been filed in the registry of the court. 

 
Similarly, in HTUN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 at [42] , [2001] FCA 1802 ; 194 ALR 244 at 259 Allsop J (with whom Spender J agreed) observed:
 
 [42] ... This is not merely one aspect of evidence not being touched. It is not a failure to find a "relevant" fact. The Tribunal failed to address and deal with how the claim was put to it, at least in part. The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the Act requires the Tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked on. The claim or claims and its or their component integers are considerations made mandatorily relevant by the Act for consideration ... It is to be distinguished from errant fact finding. The nature and extent of the task of the Tribunal revealed by the terms of the Act ... make it clear that the Tribunal's statutorily required task is to examine and deal with the claims for asylum made by the applicant. ...

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 , 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>The distinction is well-recognised: WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 , 75 ALD 630. French, Sackville and Hely JJ there observed: 
 [45] In conducting its review the Tribunal must have regard to the criteria for the grant of a protection visa and in particular the criterion that the applicant for a visa is: 

 
'... a non-citizen in Australia to whom the [Tribunal] is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol;' (s 36(2)(a) read with s 415(1)) 
 
 
 The critical question which ordinarily will have to be addressed in applying this criterion is whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the Convention reasons. If the Tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the Tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 , to conduct a review of the decision. This is a matter of substance, not a matter of the form of the Tribunal's published reasons for decision. 

 
 [46] It is plainly not necessary for the Tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons. It may be that some evidence is irrelevant to the criteria and some contentions misconceived. Moreover, there is a distinction between the Tribunal failing to advert to evidence which, if accepted, might have led it to make a different finding of fact (cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [87] - [97] ) and a failure by the Tribunal to address a contention which, if accepted, might establish that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. The Tribunal is not a court. It is an administrative body operating in an environment which requires the expeditious determination of a high volume of applications. Each of the applications it decides is, of course, of great importance. Some of its decisions may literally be life and death decisions for the applicant. Nevertheless, it is an administrative body and not a court and its reasons are not to be scrutinised 'with an eye keenly attuned to error'. Nor is it necessarily required to provide reasons of the kind that might be expected of a court of law. 

 
 [47] The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point. It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.</text>

<text>There may be cases where the Tribunal is not confined to the " case " as expressly articulated by a claimant: Paramananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1693 ; (1998) 94 FCR 28 at 63 per Merkel J. In properly discharging the jurisdiction entrusted to it, the Tribunal must also consider a claim that emerges from the materials presented to it for consideration. How clearly a claim that has not been expressly raised must emerge from the materials has been variously expressed. In NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [48] , [2004] FCAFC 263 ; 144 FCR 1 at 18 to 19, Black CJ, French and Selway JJ said (references omitted): 
 [58] The review process is inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Tribunal is required to deal with the case raised by the material or evidence before it ... There is authority for the proposition that the Tribunal is not to limit its determination to the 'case' articulated by an applicant if evidence and material which it accepts raise a case not articulated ... By way of example, if a claim of apprehended persecution is based upon membership of a particular social group the Tribunal may be required in its review function to consider a group definition open on the facts but not expressly advanced by the applicant ... It has been suggested that the unarticulated claim must be raised 'squarely' on the material available to the Tribunal before it has a statutory duty to consider it ... The use of the adverb 'squarely' does not convey any precise standard but it indicates that a claim not expressly advanced will attract the review obligation of the Tribunal when it is apparent on the face of the material before the Tribunal. Such a claim will not depend for its exposure on constructive or creative activity by the Tribunal. 

 
Their Honours thereafter went on to refer to the decision in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 709 , 75 ALD 411 and continued:
 
 ... Selway J however went on to observe in SGBB (at [17]): 

 
But this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19th Century pleading.
 
 
 His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: 

 
The Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it. An asylum claimant does not have to pick the correct Convention "label" to describe his or her plight, but the Tribunal can only deal with the claims actually made.
 
 
 His Honour, in our view, correctly stated the position when he said (at [18]): 

 
 The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it. 

 
 This does not mean that the Tribunal is only required to deal with claims expressly articulated by the applicant. It is not obliged to deal with claims which are not articulated and which do not clearly arise from the materials before it.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/120.html</AustLII>
<text>Various expressions have thus been used to attempt to describe the manner in which an unarticulated claim may nevertheless sufficiently emerge from the materials before a Tribunal and thus trigger the necessity to consider that claim if the Tribunal is to properly discharge its jurisdiction. Those expressions have included the phrases " squarely " raised; " sufficiently raised " and " clearly arise ". There thus remains legitimate room for debate as to how " squarely " an alternative case need be raised before it need be considered: SDAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 120 at [19] , [2003] FCAFC 120 ; 129 FCR 137 at 146 per Cooper J.

Whatever may be the threshold before the Tribunal is required to give consideration to a claim other than that expressly raised, it is not considered that there arose for resolution the more specifically formulated claim now advanced on behalf of the Appellant as to his expressed intention to take " legal action ".

Irrespective of whether or not the now formulated claim was expressly raised or whether it was " squarely " raised, the Appellant further contends that the Tribunal itself nevertheless accepted that the claim as now formulated did emerge from the materials before it. No question arises, so the Appellant contends, for the Court to review those materials and for the Court to form any view as to whether in its opinion the newly formulated claim emerged from the materials. Indeed, the Appellant contends that the Tribunal's acceptance and formulation of the claim is conclusive such that the Court should not itself look at the evidence and other materials and go behind the finding of the Tribunal. By failing to resolve the claim, the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error &#8212; or so the argument runs.</text>

It is to proceed on a false basis that such a document simply does not exist or has not been communicated to the Tribunal. The Tribunal would in these circumstances no more be exercising its jurisdiction than a court would be in deciding a case in favour of a defendant without looking at the plaintiff's initiating document and pleading, or even knowing that they had been filed in the registry of the court. 

 
Similarly, in HTUN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 at [42] , [2001] FCA 1802 ; 194 ALR 244 at 259 Allsop J (with whom Spender J agreed) observed:
 
 [42] ... This is not merely one aspect of evidence not being touched. It is not a failure to find a "relevant" fact. The Tribunal failed to address and deal with how the claim was put to it, at least in part. The requirement to review the decision under s 414 of the Act requires the Tribunal to consider the claims of the applicant. To make a decision without having considered all the claims is to fail to complete the exercise of jurisdiction embarked on. The claim or claims and its or their component integers are considerations made mandatorily relevant by the Act for consideration ... It is to be distinguished from errant fact finding. The nature and extent of the task of the Tribunal revealed by the terms of the Act ... make it clear that the Tribunal's statutorily required task is to examine and deal with the claims for asylum made by the applicant. ...

<tocase>SZMPF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 273</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/273.html</AustLII>
<text>By way of a decision signed on 19 September 2007 the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the visa. An application for review of the Tribunal's decision was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 14 April 2009: SZMPF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 273.

The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court on 1 May 2009 sets forth the sole ground of appeal to be resolved as follows (without alteration):
 
 Ground 1 

 
 The learned Federal Magistrate erred by holding that the Appellant's claim that the Tribunal failed to consider an integer of his case or a claim or issue critical to his case has not been made out. 

 
 Particulars 

 
 His Honour stated in [45] that the Tribunal had held that: 

 
 In respect of the applicant's concerns regarding the death of his cousin, this matter has been the subject of extensive media reporting and there is evidence that the Fijian Human Rights Commission continues to operate. There is nothing to suggest that those who have reported the death or followed any investigation into it have in anyway been adversely of interest to military authorities. While there may be legitimate questions about how that investigation will proceed in the current environment, the Tribunal does not believe that any interest the applicant may have in this matter would put him at risk of harm on return. Notably, members of the applicant's family have remained in Fiji without further difficulties. 
 
 
 In [47] his Honour held based on the Tribunal's above stated finding: 

 
 This appears to me to address the applicant's claims that he would be in danger if he were to take action on his return in relation to the death of his cousin or were to pursue the investigation into his cousin's death...... ... ........ 
 
 
 This was an erroneous finding because on a correct reading the Tribunal was not addressing that claim. The Tribunal only considered people in three categories: 

 
 (a) those who reported the cousin's death;
 (b) those who followed up the investigation into it; and
 (c) members of the applicant's extended family in Fiji. 

 
 The Tribunal did not consider someone in his position who: 

 
 (a) expressed an intention to take legal action against the army when he returns to Fiji; and
 (b) expressed interest in the progress of the investigation into his cousin's death. 

 
This is apparently the same ground that was unsuccessfully relied upon before the Federal Magistrate.

The Federal Magistrate reviewed the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and relevantly concluded: 
 [46] ... I am satisfied that: 

(a) the applicant's claims were put before the Tribunal; and 
 
(b) those claims were considered by the Tribunal.
 
 
The Federal Magistrate then proceeded to conclude that the Tribunal had committed no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.

The Appellant appeared before this Court on 6 August 2009. He was then represented by a solicitor.

The case advanced both before the Federal Magistrate and this Court on appeal sought to draw a distinction between an administrative tribunal failing to advert to evidence or making an error of fact based upon evidence (on the one hand) and a tribunal failing to consider a contention advanced before it for resolution (on the other).</text>

<tocase>WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 , 75 ALD 630</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/184.html</AustLII>
<text>The distinction is well-recognised: WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 , 75 ALD 630. French, Sackville and Hely JJ there observed: 
 [45] In conducting its review the Tribunal must have regard to the criteria for the grant of a protection visa and in particular the criterion that the applicant for a visa is: 

 
'... a non-citizen in Australia to whom the [Tribunal] is satisfied Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol;' (s 36(2)(a) read with s 415(1)) 
 
 
 The critical question which ordinarily will have to be addressed in applying this criterion is whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the Convention reasons. If the Tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the Tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 , to conduct a review of the decision. This is a matter of substance, not a matter of the form of the Tribunal's published reasons for decision. 

 
 [46] It is plainly not necessary for the Tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons. It may be that some evidence is irrelevant to the criteria and some contentions misconceived. Moreover, there is a distinction between the Tribunal failing to advert to evidence which, if accepted, might have led it to make a different finding of fact (cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [87] - [97] ) and a failure by the Tribunal to address a contention which, if accepted, might establish that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. The Tribunal is not a court. It is an administrative body operating in an environment which requires the expeditious determination of a high volume of applications. Each of the applications it decides is, of course, of great importance. Some of its decisions may literally be life and death decisions for the applicant. Nevertheless, it is an administrative body and not a court and its reasons are not to be scrutinised 'with an eye keenly attuned to error'. Nor is it necessarily required to provide reasons of the kind that might be expected of a court of law. 

 
 [47] The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point. It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.</text>
