<text>8 Members of the High Court were at pains in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355, at [100] (per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ), to affirm that failure by a public officer to comply with a statutory obligation, while it may or may not affect the validity of an act or decision in question, may nevertheless be attended by legal consequences and that a court may restrain subsequent administrative action predicated upon supposed compliance with the unmet statutory condition until the default has been remedied.

9 I add that the appellant sought to raise some new grounds without descending to particulars. There appears to be nothing in any of them.

10 The appeal will be dismissed with costs assessed at $3,000.


 I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick.

<tocase>SZICO v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 435</tocase>

<text>4 His Honour accepted the submission of the first respondent that the only relevant consequence of a breach of s 430B(6) was to suspend the running of time for the purposes of the statutory time limits on judicial review and that no jurisdictional error arose. In this regard his Honour followed WACB v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] HCA 50 ; (2004) 210 ALR 190 and SZICO v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 435 at [14] . As his Honour pointed out at [26]: "The potential mischief resulting from a failure to comply with sub section [430B](6) is that an applicant may hypothetically be deprived of the opportunity of seeking judicial review of a tribunal decision."
 
 
 
 

His Honour continued at [26]-[27]:

 
 However, as was made clear by the High Court in WACB , that mischief does not in fact arise because time does not run for the purposes of statutory time limits on access to the courts until the required notification is given. Hypothetically, an applicant might challenge a purported notification of a tribunal decision which did not meet the requirements of s 430B(6) but there would be no point in doing so, given that in the absence of the required notification, it remains open to an applicant to apply in this Court or the High Court to challenge the Tribunal decision, not simply the notification.
 
 It follows, and I find that, compliance with s 430B(6) is not generally a condition subsequent to the making of a lawful decision in accordance with Part 7 of the Migration Act . It is a separate and enforceable statutory obligation on the Tribunal and a failure to comply with it, in accordance with the High Court decision in WACB, will render inoperative current statutory time limits on judicial review applications to the courts. The point is academic in this case as the judicial review application was filed within the prescribed time limit.</text>
