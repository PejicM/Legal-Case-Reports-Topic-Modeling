<tocase>Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/57.html</AustLII>
<text>79 I have already set out s 23(1) and my conclusion that it confers a right on the examinee's lawyer and not the examinee. That right is sufficient to attract the rules of procedural fairness: Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ. ASIC argued that the exercise of investigative powers was not generally subject to the rules of procedural fairness. It instanced Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 158 FCR 301 at 317-323 [53]-[72] per Gyles J. The decision under challenge in that case, however, was a decision by ASIC to confer "eligible applicant" status on a person. The only effect of that was to permit such a person to apply for the issue of examination summonses which might result in the examination of a person. Gyles J ultimately held (at 321 [67]):
 In my opinion, the initiation of the exercise of a statutory power of an investigatory nature will not normally "destroy, defeat or prejudice" (to use the words from Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596) or "imperil" (to use Meagher J's word) any relevant right or interest such as to require notice to be given to the object prior to exercise of the power. In any event, where, as here, the exercise of a power is anterior to that which has a direct effect upon the party, there is no such requirement.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>83 Granted that such an obligation existed, what were the inspectors to do? They needed to provide Atanaskovic Hartnell with an opportunity to persuade the inspectors that the direction should not be given. This was not done and breach is established. There may be difficult cases where the inspectors have before them confidential information the very nature of which requires that it not be shown to the lawyer or to his or her client. However, the inspectors did not suggest that they had relied on any such information in the present proceeding. There was a redacted portion of the reasons of 22 October 2008 but there was no intimation of what had been redacted. In any event, the Applicants did not complain that prejudicial but relevant material had been taken into account thereby: cf. Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 at 95 [15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517</tocase>
<text>20 There were three issues between the parties.
 
(a) The identity and authority of the decision-maker. ASIC contended that it had given the direction. The Applicants denied that the power to exclude Atanaskovic Hartnell from the examinations was a power which was vested in ASIC. They submitted that the power was vested in the inspectors. The inspectors were joined to the proceedings against this possibility.
 
(b) The reasonable grounds issue. The Applicants submitted that the Full Court's decision in Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 meant that the inspectors' direction was liable to be set aside unless they the inspectors demonstrated during the present proceeding that there were reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief on their part that to allow Atanaskovic Hartnell to represent all three of the Applicants would be likely to prejudice the investigation. ASIC, on the other hand, argued that Bell was concerned with the evidential consequences of the regulator failing to provide any reasons for the making of such a direction. Since ASIC furnished reasons for its direction it followed that the principle was inapplicable. Even if that were not so, ASIC argued that the materials before the Court showed that there were reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief on its or the inspectors' part that to allow the Atanaskovic Hartnell to represent all three Applicants would be likely to prejudice the investigation.
 
(c) The procedural fairness issue. As an alternative, the Applicants argued that the power to exclude their lawyers from the examinations was a power the exercise of which attracted an obligation of procedural fairness. Since the inspectors did not give the Applicants any opportunity to argue that the direction should not be made, it followed, so the argument ran, that they had denied the Applicants procedural fairness. ASIC, on the other hand, denied that the power to exclude the Applicants' legal advisers from an examination was a power the exercise of which was conditioned upon adherence to requirements of procedural fairness. It pointed to the fact that the decision to summon the Applicants for examination in the first place was not subject to those requirements and asked, rhetorically, how in the midst of a process in which procedural fairness did not figure largely such an obligation might be found to exist. Against the possibility that it might be found to exist, ASIC submitted that, in the circumstances, the content of the obligation would be diminished to such a low level that it should be found that the obligation had been discharged.

21 ASIC contended that it was it, as a corporate entity, that had given the direction to exclude Mr Hartnell and Atanaskovic Hartnell from being present at all the examinations. The Applicants made no express submission about that question but did submit that if ASIC was the decision-maker (as it submitted) then it had no power to give the direction. This was because the power to exclude a person from an examination was conferred by s 22(1) of the ASIC Act and that provision conferred power not on ASIC but on the inspector conducting the examination.

22 It is necessary in the first instance to identify with clarity who gave the direction. There are three matters bearing on this issue. First, there is the letter of Friday 10 October 2008 written by Ms Dodds and Mr Astar which is on the letterhead of ASIC and is signed by both Ms Dodds and Mr Astar in their stated capacity as "Lawyer, Deterrence". It contains the critical passage:
 ... we have now considered the matter and formed the view ...

34 This argument should be rejected. Section 19(2) authorises ASIC to summon a person for examination before an inspector. Section 22(1) authorises the inspector to give directions as to who may be present during the examination. There is no warrant for reading s 19(1) as the source of the authority to give such a direction. In any event, the authority of this Court establishes that the source of the power is s 22(1) itself: Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 at 521 per Lockhart J, 528-529 per Sheppard J.

39 In Bell v Australian Securities Commission (1991) 31 FCR 184 at 189 Pincus J held that s 22 did not permit an inspector to exclude an examinee's lawyer. This conclusion was reversed by the Full Court: Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 at 521 per Lockhart J, 528-529 per Sheppard J, 532-533 per Burchett J. The binding nature of that conclusion is not open to doubt.

42 The authorities do not establish this proposition clearly. However, at least two members of the Full Court thought that the right was conferred on the lawyer: Australian Securities Commission v Bell (1991) 32 FCR 517 at 528 per Sheppard J, 532 per Burchett J. The matter is complicated because Burchett J also thought (at 532) that the client had a right to have his lawyer's right observed. Lockhart J adverted to the question (at 519) but did not answer it.</text>

<text>53 Where, as here, it is alleged that ASIC has acted outside its power in making an exclusion direction under s 22(1), ASIC is required to prove that the making of the order was "necessary" in the sense used in Bell . The reasonable necessity is based on the views of the inspector if it appears necessary to the inspector then that will suffice provided that his or her belief is reasonably held. Put another way, the encroachment of the power in s 22(1) into the field of operation of s 23(1) is subject to a condition precedent, namely, the satisfaction of the inspector that the encroachment is necessary. And, of course, it is not to be presumed that Parliament intended that the inspector's view could be formed capriciously hence, not only must be the opinion be formed but is must be reasonably held: cf.

<tocase>Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/494.html</AustLII>
<text>43 In Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244 examinees sought judicial review of a direction given by an inspector appointed by the Australian Securities Commission to exclude their lawyer. French J appeared to assume (at 254), without debate, that the right created by s 23(1) was conferred on the examinee's lawyer although it may be admitted that this is far from clear. In Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd (rec apptd) v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 33 ACSR 106 at 108 [6] the parties, and Byrne J, assumed that the right was conferred on the examinee. In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 297 [38] French J assumed without discussion that the right was conferred on the examinee.

44 Bell requires the conclusion, with which I agree, that the right is at least conferred on the examinee's lawyer. It is an open question whether the right is also conferred on the examinee. The right referred to by Burchett J in Bell as the right to have the lawyer's right enforced does not appear, with respect, to have a textual foundation. The right assumed to be vested in the examinee in Gangemi and Re Macquarie Advisory Group was the right in s 23(1) itself rather than the right adverted to by Burchett J.

45 Only one judge (Sheppard J) has considered the matter in any detail. The statements by French J in Stockbridge and Gangemi do not appear to me to be intended to be taken as considered statements on the question and the statement by Byrne J is certainly not.

54 The opinion which matters is that of the inspector. The only issue for the Court is whether that opinion is held on reasonable grounds and in good faith. Once that threshold is passed, the fact that the Court might not have made the direction itself is of no moment because the state of satisfaction which expands the operation of s 22(1) into the domain of s 23(1) is that of the inspector and not that of the Court: cf. Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 297 [39] per French J; Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244 at 255 per French J.

65 For completeness, it is to be noted that ASIC had a similar inference drawn against it for failing to put on evidence as to the decision-making process in Bell 32 FCR 517 at 525 per Lockhart J, 531 per Sheppard J and, arguably, at 533 per Burchett J. Further, such evidence was put before the Court in Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 33 ACSR 106 at 108 [8] per Byrne J and in Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 290-291 [19] - [20] per French J. Whilst it is true that in both Gangemi and Stockbridge that the reasons of the inspectors were before the Court it is also true that those reasons were delivered contemporaneously with the direction. The significance of such evidence in the present case was obvious, therefore, not only because the Applicants explicitly signalled their intention to doubt the usefulness of the statement of reasons of 22 October 2008 but also from the course of authorities dealing with s 22(1).

71 That approach may, of course, require that confidential evidence be given about the relevant concerns in this Court. This was expressly contemplated in Bell by Lockhart J (at 32 FCR 521) and Sheppard J (at 32 FCR 532) both of whom indicated that the processes of the Court could be adapted to deal with the exigencies obtaining in such a state of affairs. Consistent with that observation French J received a confidential affidavit in Gangemi (at 129 FCR 290 [20]).

78 The question of whether the power in s 22(1) attracts a procedural fairness obligation has received little consideration. Sheppard J in Bell (32 FCR 516 at 532) thought that such an obligation did exist. Neither Lockhart nor Burchett JJ considered the issue. None of the decisions in Re Macquarie Advisory Group Ltd (33 ACSR 106), Stockbridge (43 FCR 244) or Gangemi (129 FCR 284) deals with the question.</text>

<text>84 Where confidential but prejudicial information is taken into account by a decision-maker, the Court may fashion its own procedures to determine whether the nature of the information is such as to reduce the obligation of procedural fairness to nothing: Nicopoulos v Commissioner for Corrective Services [2004] NSWSC 562 ; (2004) 148 A Crim R 74 at [100] - [104] per Smart AJ; Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs [2008] FCAFC 128 ; (2008) 169 FCR 241 at 275-276 [143] - [144] per Weinberg, Bennett and Edmonds JJ.

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>64 In those circumstances, the failure to call either the inspectors or Mr McGuinness permits me more comfortably to draw the inference to which I have already referred viz that the statement of reasons of 22 October 2008 does not reflect the true basis for the actions of the inspectors on 10 October 2008 when they gave the direction: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 per Kitto J, 312 per Menzies J, and 320-321 per Windeyer J. I so conclude. It follows that I do not think that any reliance should be placed upon those reasons.

72 In this case, however, there is nothing in the letter of 10 October 2008 to indicate what the conflict was between the accounts of the Applicants, why those conflicts mattered or what it was that made it necessary for Atanaskovic Hartnell to be excluded. An inference is open that because those matters are not dealt with in the letter of 10 October 2008 that the inspectors did not, in fact, turn their minds to those matters. I may more readily draw that inference in circumstances where the inspectors did not give evidence before me as to these matters: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308 per Kitto J, 312 per Menzies J, and 320-321 per Windeyer J.

73 I am conscious that ASIC subsequently produced a set of reasons on 22 October 2008. I have previously come to the conclusion that this set of reasons is not to be given any weight. Be that as it may, it might be thought that a belief on ASIC or the inspectors' parts that the second set of reasons would stand as the reasons for the direction may provide an explanation as to why no evidence was given by the inspectors or Mr McGuinness as to their grounds for the giving of the direction on 10 October 2008. If that explanation were to be accepted as legitimate it would prevent the drawing of the inference to which I have referred. I do think that it is possible that the second set of reasons provides some explanation for the absence of evidence from the inspectors or Mr McGuinness. However, it is difficult to know whether that it so or whether the decision not to call them was made by other people for possibly other reasons.

74 Ultimately, I think that it would be conjecture on my part to conclude that the reason the inspectors and/or ASIC did not give evidence about the grounds underpinning the letter of 10 October 2008 was because they, or their advisers, believed that the second set of reasons would perform that function for them. In that circumstance, I do not think that I can accept such a view as a sufficient or adequate reason for their not having been called such as would prevent the drawing of the inference to which I have referred. Accordingly, the only grounds that the inspectors had were the grounds set out in the letter of 10 October 2008, and those grounds were not adequate in the requisite sense.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/29.html</AustLII>
<text>35 Other provisions in Division 2 of Part 3 of the ASIC Act observe a distinction between ASIC on the one hand and the inspectors on the other. ASIC has the powers and functions explicitly conferred on it by ss 19(1) , 19 (2), 25 and 27 (2). By contrast, an inspector has functions and powers conferred on him or her by ss 21(1) , 21 (3), 22 (1), 23 (2), 24 (1), 24 (2)(a) and 24 (2)(b). If, as ASIC submits, all of the powers and functions of an inspector derive from the power conferred on ASIC by s 19(2) , then this distinction between an inspector and ASIC in Division 2 of Part 3 is merely a textual oddity having no significance. That view is contrary to the general principle of statutory construction that in construing a set of provisions each word must be given meaning: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 382 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. For those reasons, on its proper construction s 22(1) confers a power on an inspector in his or her own right and not upon ASIC.

36 This means that ASIC's arguments that it gave the direction in question and that it had authority to do so must both be rejected. This conclusion has two consequences. First, the proper respondents to these proceedings are the inspectors themselves and not ASIC. Secondly, the inspectors were, in fact, clothed with authority to give the direction by s 22(1). For present purposes this means that the Applicants' claim against ASIC must be dismissed.

37 Sections 22 and 23 of the ASIC Act provide:
 
 
 22 Examination to take place in private 
 (1) The examination must take place in private and the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it, or during a part of it.
 (2) A person must not be present at the examination unless he or she:
 (a) is the inspector, the examinee or a member; or
 (b) is a staff member approved by ASIC; or
 (c) is entitled to be present by virtue of: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) a direction under subsection (1); or
 (ii) subsection 23(1). 
 
 
 
 
 Penalty: 10 penalty units or imprisonment for 3 months, or both.
 (3) Subsection (2) is an offence of strict liability.
 Note: For strict liability , see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code .
 23 Examinee's lawyer may attend 
 (1) The examinee's lawyer may be present at the examination and may, at such times during it as the inspector determines:
 (a) address the inspector; and
 (b) examine the examinee;
 about matters about which the inspector has examined the examinee.
 (2) If, in the inspector's opinion, a person is trying to obstruct the examination by exercising rights under subsection (1), the inspector may require the person to stop addressing the inspector, or examining the examinee, as the case requires.
 Note: Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence (see section 63). 
 (3) An offence under subsection 63(4) relating to subsection (2) of this section is an offence of strict liability.
 Note: For strict liability , see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code .</text>

<tocase>National Crime Authority v A (1988) 18 FCR 439</tocase>
<text>46 The text of s 23(1) is, I think, plain. The right is conferred on the examinee's lawyer. In that regard, its wording is different from s 25(4) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) which provided, in part, that "a person giving evidence may be represented by a legal practitioner" and which was held by the Full Court in National Crime Authority v A (1988) 18 FCR 439 at 446 per Bowen CJ, Sheppard and Morling JJ to operate as a conferral of a right upon a witness.

47 The notion that rights are conferred on lawyers rather than their clients is neither novel nor surprising. The right to file an originating process is conferred on a solicitor just as the right of audience is conferred on both solicitors and barristers. In each of those cases the right thereby conferred is to be exercised by the lawyer in accordance with his or her legal and equitable duties. To conclude that the right conferred by s 23(1) on a lawyer is to be exercised for the benefit of the client (and in accordance with lawful instructions) does not make it necessary to construe s 23(1) as conferring a right on the client.

48 Reference has already been made to s 25 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) which expressly confers a right on an examinee to have a lawyer present during an examination. That Act did not confer on the Authority an explicit power to exclude a lawyer. However, s 19 of the Act conferred on the Authority the power to do all things necessary to be done for or in connexion with the performance of its functions. In National Crime Authority v A (1988) 18 FCR 439 at 446 the Full Court held that that power extended to the exclusion of a lawyer from an examination notwithstanding s 25(4). However, that meant that the extent of the power was coterminous with the degree of the necessity. Hence, the Full Court held (at 448) that the power to exclude a lawyer arose if the Authority "concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will, or may, prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out".

49 There was nothing novel about that conclusion. The fact that the power actually used depended upon the existence of a relevant necessity meant that an absence of such a necessity entailed ultra vires action. In that sense, it was for the Authority to show that its action was within power and to do that it needed to so show the necessity which activated the power in s 19.

50 In Bell that test appears to have been grafted onto ss 22 and 23 of the former (but relevantly identical) Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth). Notwithstanding that s 22 expressly conferred a power to exclude which was absent from the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth), Lockhart J concluded (at 521) that the power conferred by s 22(1) was subject to the same limitation that the Authority was subject to in National Crime Authority v A, namely, that the inspector must form the view that there are "reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief" on the inspector's part that to allow the particular lawyer to appear "will or is likely to prejudice the investigation which he is obliged to carry out pursuant to the requirements of the Act".

51 The mechanism underpinning this reasoning appears to be the need to reconcile apparently contradictory provisions. It is true that s 22(1) is not expressed to be subject to the same limitation as s 25 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth), namely, that the step sought to be justified had to be "necessary". However, to prevent the power to exclude in s 22(1) from devouring the whole of the operation of s 23(1) , which entitled the lawyer to be present, it was necessary to place limits on the extent of the power thereby conferred. Lockhart J identified the limitation as one of reasonable necessity which was explicit in National Crime Authority v A . Burchett J expressed essentially the same conclusion (at 533):
 I agree that, despite the express language of the Act, it is implicit in the scheme for which the Act provides that he [scil. the lawyer] may be excluded. However, such a qualification upon the express entitlement conferred by the Act cannot be stretched beyond what the court can say is necessarily required for the carrying out of the examination for which the statute provides.</text>

<text>52 Mr Halley submitted that Bell was better understood as a case where the evidential burden was shifted to the Commission by the paucity of the reasons it initially proffered: cf. Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond [1986] HCA 7 ; (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 663-664 per Gibbs CJ with whom Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ agreed. There is no doubt that Sheppard J approached the matter on that basis: see Bell 32 FCR 517 at 531. However, I do not think it was the way in which Lockhart and Burchett JJ approached it.</text>

<tocase>Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 158 FCR 301</tocase>
<text>79 I have already set out s 23(1) and my conclusion that it confers a right on the examinee's lawyer and not the examinee. That right is sufficient to attract the rules of procedural fairness: Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ. ASIC argued that the exercise of investigative powers was not generally subject to the rules of procedural fairness. It instanced Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2007) 158 FCR 301 at 317-323 [53]-[72] per Gyles J. The decision under challenge in that case, however, was a decision by ASIC to confer "eligible applicant" status on a person. The only effect of that was to permit such a person to apply for the issue of examination summonses which might result in the examination of a person. Gyles J ultimately held (at 321 [67]):
 In my opinion, the initiation of the exercise of a statutory power of an investigatory nature will not normally "destroy, defeat or prejudice" (to use the words from Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; 170 CLR 596) or "imperil" (to use Meagher J's word) any relevant right or interest such as to require notice to be given to the object prior to exercise of the power. In any event, where, as here, the exercise of a power is anterior to that which has a direct effect upon the party, there is no such requirement.</text>

<tocase>Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244</tocase>
<text>43 In Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244 examinees sought judicial review of a direction given by an inspector appointed by the Australian Securities Commission to exclude their lawyer. French J appeared to assume (at 254), without debate, that the right created by s 23(1) was conferred on the examinee's lawyer although it may be admitted that this is far from clear. In Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd (rec apptd) v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 33 ACSR 106 at 108 [6] the parties, and Byrne J, assumed that the right was conferred on the examinee. In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 297 [38] French J assumed without discussion that the right was conferred on the examinee.

45 Only one judge (Sheppard J) has considered the matter in any detail. The statements by French J in Stockbridge and Gangemi do not appear to me to be intended to be taken as considered statements on the question and the statement by Byrne J is certainly not.

54 The opinion which matters is that of the inspector. The only issue for the Court is whether that opinion is held on reasonable grounds and in good faith. Once that threshold is passed, the fact that the Court might not have made the direction itself is of no moment because the state of satisfaction which expands the operation of s 22(1) into the domain of s 23(1) is that of the inspector and not that of the Court: cf. Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 297 [39] per French J; Stockbridge v Ogilvie (1993) 43 FCR 244 at 255 per French J.

65 For completeness, it is to be noted that ASIC had a similar inference drawn against it for failing to put on evidence as to the decision-making process in Bell 32 FCR 517 at 525 per Lockhart J, 531 per Sheppard J and, arguably, at 533 per Burchett J. Further, such evidence was put before the Court in Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (1999) 33 ACSR 106 at 108 [8] per Byrne J and in Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at 290-291 [19] - [20] per French J. Whilst it is true that in both Gangemi and Stockbridge that the reasons of the inspectors were before the Court it is also true that those reasons were delivered contemporaneously with the direction. The significance of such evidence in the present case was obvious, therefore, not only because the Applicants explicitly signalled their intention to doubt the usefulness of the statement of reasons of 22 October 2008 but also from the course of authorities dealing with s 22(1).

78 The question of whether the power in s 22(1) attracts a procedural fairness obligation has received little consideration. Sheppard J in Bell (32 FCR 516 at 532) thought that such an obligation did exist. Neither Lockhart nor Burchett JJ considered the issue. None of the decisions in Re Macquarie Advisory Group Ltd (33 ACSR 106), Stockbridge (43 FCR 244) or Gangemi (129 FCR 284) deals with the question.</text>
