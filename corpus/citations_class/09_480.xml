<tocase>ISS Health Support Services Pty Ltd v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//sa/SAIRC/2007/94.html</AustLII>
<text>On 5 August 2008, the respondent issued a Summons in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia (IRCSA) alleging that at all material times of her employment she was performing duties covered by the Clerks' Award (SA) (the Clerks Award) and then from 27 March 2006 under the Notional Agreement Preserving the State Clerks' Award (Cth) (the Clerks NAPSA). She sought the underpayment of her claimed entitlements and interest, that is the difference between what she was paid pursuant to the Fitness Award and the Fitness NAPSA and what she contended she should have been paid pursuant to the Clerks Award and the Clerks NAPSA. The IRCSA had jurisdiction to entertain that claim under s 14(a) of the Fair Work Act 1994 (SA) (the FW Act) and as an "eligible court" as defined in s 717 and pursuant to s 720 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the WR Act), including the claim arising under the federal instrument, relevantly the Clerks NAPSA: see ISS Health Support Services Pty Ltd v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94 ( ISS Health v Duthie ).

The appellant denied that the respondent was performing the duties covered by the Clerks Award and the Clerks NAPSA as contended, and argued that the relevant instruments were the Fitness Award and the Fitness NAPSA.

The IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on 30 April 2009. On 2 April 2009, his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal. It is unclear what the "jurisdictional issue" is. It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders (although as noted in [8] of these reasons, s 187(1) of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal). It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent, having regard to the "matter" including the federal element and the provisions of ss 850(2) and 853 of the WR Act. As to that, see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94 at [45] . See also Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171 ( Kronen ) at [4] and [7]. It may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision, but only that part of it which related to the period up to 26 March 2006.</text>

<tocase>Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/171.html</AustLII>
<text>The IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on 30 April 2009. On 2 April 2009, his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal. It is unclear what the "jurisdictional issue" is. It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders (although as noted in [8] of these reasons, s 187(1) of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal). It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent, having regard to the "matter" including the federal element and the provisions of ss 850(2) and 853 of the WR Act. As to that, see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94 at [45] . See also Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171 ( Kronen ) at [4] and [7]. It may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision, but only that part of it which related to the period up to 26 March 2006.

In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , an Industrial Magistrate of the IRCSA had considered claims for underpayment of wages for overtime work and for underpayment of superannuation contributions. The written reasons for judgment dismissed the claim for overtime pay, but made no order reflecting the Industrial Magistrate's conclusions on the superannuation claim. The Full Court (Gray, Branson and Lander JJ) observed at [14]: 
 The industrial magistrate made no order reflecting the conclusions he had reached on the superannuation claim. He neither dismissed the claim (which he was bound to do, if he came to the conclusion that he had no power to order the making of payments) nor made any purported declaration reflecting the conclusion to which he had come as to the meaning and effect of the provisions of the Award relating to superannuation. His Honour seems to have thought that the expression of a conclusion in his reasons for judgment was sufficient. It was not. The whole of the application by summons before the court needed to be dealt with. Plainly, because the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the superannuation claim, that aspect of the application was required to be dismissed.

There is nothing in the FW Act (which continues the existence of IRCSA established first under the Industrial Relations Act 1972 (SA) which requires its decisions to be reflected in formally drawn orders so that its orders must be drawn up and sealed. Nor is there anything in the South Australian Industrial Proceedings Rules (SA) dealing with those topics. In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , the Full Court clearly accepted that the expression of an order dismissing the claim for overtime payments in the reasons for decision was sufficient to enliven the right of appeal, subject to granting leave to appeal if that were necessary: see at [15].

Clearly, that decision is different from the present circumstances. It is clear that the fact that the IRCSA does not routinely draw up formal orders after a decision (including reasons for decision) does not of itself impede the right of appeal under s 853 of the WR Act: see Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171. It therefore falls to consider whether the Industrial Magistrate, in particular by [39] of his reasons set out above, has in substance finally determined the issue as to how the parties' legal rights are to be assessed. Had the word "determine" been substituted for the word "conclude", or been used in conjunction with it, there would in my view have been no scope for debate about that. The limited liberty to apply as to the quantum reflects such an intention. In my view, the existence or otherwise of a right of appeal should not be determined by the precise word or words used, but by their substantive effect. I do not need to decide that issue because the appellant has taken upon itself to have this appeal dismissed. However, I think there is at least a reasonable basis to conclude that the Industrial Magistrate intended to, and did, finally determine the issue of principle in a binding way and that his expression at the conclusion of his reasons was intended to, and did, operate in that way. In any event, if there were any ambiguity, the Industrial Magistrate could have been asked to clarify the meaning of [39] of his reasons so as to indicate whether he intended it to be the operative judicial determination of that issue, or further, his Honour could have been asked to make such an operative judicial determination. The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court, in the latter event, could have been allowed to stand as if that operative determination had been made at the time of the publication of the reasons and any necessary extension of time granted. No party would thereby have been prejudiced, and indeed the respondent opposed the stay motion and wanted to proceed with the appeal.

I turn to consider the issue of the costs of the appeal.

Section 824 of the WR Act relevantly provides: 
 (1) A party to a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first-mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. 

 
 (2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs. 

 
 (3) In subsections (1) and (2):
 costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1975/31.html</AustLII>
<text>It is plain enough, as the appellant submitted, that the words "judgment, decree or order" should bear the same meaning as that in s 73 of the Constitution : Moller v Roy [1975] HCA 31 ; (1975) 132 CLR 622 ; Ah Toy v Registrar of Companies (1985) 10 FCR 280 ( Ah Toy ). It follows that reasons for judgment are not themselves judgments, and that there is no appeal against reasons standing alone: Hi-fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 3) (1998) 86 FCR 374 at 378 per Beaumont J. The appellant thus correctly identified the question whether there is any operative judicial act, beyond the expression of reasons which might form the basis for later orders. It said that there were no orders made in this matter, because there is no obligation on any party to do or refrain from doing any act and no determination of the amount payable under the applicable instruments.</text>

The appellant thus correctly identified the question whether there is any operative judicial act, beyond the expression of reasons which might form the basis for later orders. It said that there were no orders made in this matter, because there is no obligation on any party to do or refrain from doing any act and no determination of the amount payable under the applicable instruments.

In Ah Toy (1985) 10 FCR 280 , the Full Court held that an appeal from findings made in the reasons of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory who had conducted an inquiry under s 278 of the Companies Act (NT) into the conduct of the putative appellant as the liquidator of a particular company was incompetent. The findings were followed by a series of orders under s 278(2) that the putative appellant make good to the company its loss caused by certain actions taken by the liquidator. There was initially no appeal from some of the orders themselves; that was done by amendment at the hearing relating only to some of the challenged findings which did not relate directly to the liquidator. Not surprisingly, the Full Court regarded as incompetent the amended appeal to the extent that it challenged only those findings unrelated to the orders.

In Ah Toy (1985) 10 FCR 280 , the Full Court at 285-6 addressed various authorities considering what constitutes a "judgment, decree or order". I shall not repeat them. In essence, that expression covers only the operative judicial acts, binding upon the parties and determinative of their legal rights. It must involve the formal judicial act or order by which the Court disposes of the matter before it.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/389.html</AustLII>
<text>In matters such as the present, as I have noted, it is commonplace for the Court to decide the issue of principle between the parties, leaving it to them to then agree upon the consequential detailed calculations. The final determination of the issue of principle may operate only as an interlocutory judgment, as it does not finally dispose of all issues in the proceeding. It is akin to the separate determination of a question under O 29 of the Federal Court Rules , where an order recording such a determination may give rise to an appeal by leave under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). However, s 853(2) of the WR Act provides that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal under s 853(1), and s 853(2) has consequently been held to prevail over the requirement for leave: Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason [2008] FCA 389 ; (2008) 167 FCR 217 at [32] - [33] .

The question remains whether the reasons of the Industrial Magistrate constitute a determination, binding upon the parties and determinative of their legal rights, notwithstanding that there is no formal or separate sealed order recording such a determination.</text>

<tocase>Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395</tocase>
<text>In Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395 , the Full Court found that an appeal from the decision of the Australian Telecommunications Commission was competent in the following circumstances. The decision was that the employee should be compulsorily retired for medical unfitness under s 56 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 (Cth). As required by s 56 , the Telecommunications Regulations 1975 (Cth) made provision for review of such a decision. The Review Tribunal decided that "there was insufficient evidence to recommend any alternative to the decision". The employee successfully challenged the validity of the decision of the Review Tribunal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 (Cth), including on the basis that the relevant regulations did not make proper provision for review of the initial decision so the initial decision under s 56 was itself invalid. The judge at first instance delivered reasons for judgment to that effect, and, although no formal judgment was entered, both in his reasons for judgment and by a minute of orders containing proposed orders accompanying them made declarations as to the invalidity of the decision to retire the employee and setting aside that decision. The primary judge also concluded that, in any event, the Review Tribunal had failed to accord the employee procedural fairness so that, but for the decision about the invalidity of the relevant regulations, the matter would have had to be remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconciliation. The Full Court regarded the appeal from the order setting aside the initial decision as competent, even though there was no challenge to its being set aside for breach of procedural fairness. That is, the appeal was regarded as competent even though it was accepted by the employer as appellant that the Review Tribunal decision should be set aside because procedural fairness was not given to the employee. Toohey J (with whom Fisher J agreed) said at 402-3 that the appeal was "from a finding implicit in the judgment" that the initial decision was also invalid because it must have been on that basis that the matter was not remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration, but that the decisions were declared to be invalid.</text>
