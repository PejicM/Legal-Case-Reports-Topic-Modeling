<text>60 Those findings were open on the evidence and are consistent with authority concerning the scope of the term 'scheme' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 425, McHugh J; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 225, Gleason CJ and McHugh J [9], Gummow and Hayne JJ, 236 [43], Callinan J, 250 [85]).

63 The Tribunal identified that question as one of whether 'a reasonable person' would conclude that each taxpayer in entering into and carrying out the particular scheme had, as his or her 'most influential and prevailing or ruling purpose and thus [his or her] dominant purpose, the obtaining thereby of a tax benefit, in the statutory sense' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (supra) at 423, per the Court (supra)).

64 In considering each of the eight factors so as to determine whether a reasonable person would conclude that each taxpayer acted according to the most influential, prevailing or ruling purpose in the sense required by s 177D, the Tribunal was influenced by these findings in relation to the eight factors.

65 As to factor (i) (see [57] of these reasons in each case), the applicants did not so much enter into a series of transactions as acquire a packaged solution from their solicitors. The instructions required that each applicant execute a series of pro-forma documents over the course of a number of days [54].</text>

<text>60 Those findings were open on the evidence and are consistent with authority concerning the scope of the term 'scheme' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 425, McHugh J; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 225, Gleason CJ and McHugh J [9], Gummow and Hayne JJ, 236 [43], Callinan J, 250 [85]).

76 Accordingly, having regard to the eight factors and the alternative postulate ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (supra) at 243, Gummow and Hayne JJ [66]) open on the evidence, the Tribunal concluded as was open to it, that the dominant purpose of entering into and carrying out the scheme was to obtain a tax benefit of non-inclusion of the amount of a capital gain in the assessable income of each taxpayer that would have been realised upon disposal, as contemplated by s 177C(1)(a).

77 Each taxpayer says that no tax benefit arose in connection with the scheme and thus s 177D(a) is not satisfied with the result that Part IVA does not apply to the sequence of transactions found to be a scheme. In other words, s 177D falls at the threshold and Part IVA has no application to the sequence of transactions. That result is said to arise because the statutory definition of a tax benefit contained in s 177C(1)(a) is subject to an express exclusion which removes the non-inclusion of a postulated capital gain from the assessable income of a taxpayer where the non-inclusion is attributable to the making of a choice or election expressly provided for by the 1997 Act (or the 1936 Act).

78 The relevant provisions are these. 
 
 SECTION 177C TAX BENEFIT 
 
 177C(1) [Obtaining a tax benefit] Subject to this section, a reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as a reference to: 
 
 
 (a) an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income where that amount would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out; or 
 
 
 
 (b) ... 
 
 
 and, for the purposes of this Part, the amount of the tax benefit shall be taken to be: 
 
 
 (c) in the case to which paragraph (a) applies the amount referred to in that paragraph; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 177C(2) [Exclusions] A reference in this Part to the obtaining by the taxpayer of a tax benefit in connection with a scheme shall be read as not including a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income not including an amount that would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income if the scheme had not been entered into or carried out where: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the non-inclusion of the amount in the assessable income of the taxpayer is attributable to the making of an agreement, choice, declaration, election or selection, the giving of a notice or the exercise of an option (expressly provided for by this Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ) by any person, except one under subdivision 126-B, 170-B or 960-D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ; and 
 
 (ii) the scheme was not entered into or carried out by any person for the purpose of creating any circumstance or state of affairs the existence of which is necessary to enable the declaration, agreement, election, selection, choice, notice or option to be made, given or exercised, as the case may be.</text>

<tocase>Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1428.html</AustLII>
<text>99 As to the integer influencing the question of whether Part IVA applies to the scheme as found, each taxpayer contended that no 'tax benefit' arose for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a) and s 177D(a) by operation of the exclusion contained in s 177C(2)(a)(i). However, since the non-inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer was not attributable to the roll-over choice made under subdivision 122A of the 1997 Act, each taxpayer obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme (s 177C(1)(a)). The scope of the exclusion is limited to the non-inclusion of the relevant amount directly attributable to the roll-over choice. Since the Tribunal correctly found that the sequence of inter-related transactions between 13 15 April 1999 comprising the scheme is the source of the non-inclusion of the relevant amount in the assessable income of each taxpayer rather than the roll-over choice made under s 122-15 of the 1997 Act, it can be seen, having regard to the facts found, that the argument of the taxpayer concerning the construction and application of that integer is wrong. However, that is not the end of the matter. Even though the argument is incorrect, the question is whether the argument contended for by each taxpayer is one that could be argued, objectively, 'on rational grounds to be right' ( Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1428 ; (2003) 138 FCR 1 at 26 [108] ).

100 The principles identified by Hill J, which apply with equal force to s 226 of the 1936 Act, are these ( Walstern v Commissioner of Taxation (supra) [108], propositions 1 to 7).

101 The test to be applied is an objective one; the comparison is one between the taxpayer's argument and the argument which is considered to be the correct argument; a determination must then be made whether the taxpayer's argument although considered wrong, is about as likely as not correct, when regard is had to the 'authorities' (including the income tax law, material for the purposes of s 15AB(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) and decisions of Courts, the Tribunal or a Board of Review) s 22C(4); it is not necessary that the taxpayer's argument, in an objective sense, is 'more likely to be right than wrong' as the taxpayer's argument will have been found to be wrong as an underlying premise; nor is it necessary that the taxpayer's argument is 'just as likely correct' as the principal argument will have been found to be wrong; the word 'about' indicates the need to balance two competing arguments so that 'on balance the taxpayer's argument can objectively be said to be one that while wrong could be argued on rational grounds to be right'; and:
 
 ... the view advanced by the taxpayer must be one where objectively it would be concluded that having regard to the material included within the definition of 'authority' a reasoned argument can be made which argument when contrasted with the argument which is accepted as correct is about as likely as not correct. That is to say the two arguments, namely, that which is advanced by the taxpayer and that which reflects the correct view, will be finely balanced. The case must thus be one where reasonable minds could differ as to which view, that of the taxpayer or that ultimately adopted by the Commissioner, was correct. There must, in other words, be room for a real and rational difference of opinion between the two views such that while the taxpayer's view is ultimately seen to be wrong, it is nevertheless 'about' as likely to be correct as the correct view. 
 
 A question of judgment is involved.

102 The Tribunal has not addressed itself to the principles governing the question of whether the argument advanced by the taxpayer is one which is sufficiently 'finely balanced' to be reasonably arguable. The Tribunal concluded that since the 'point raised', ([67] of the Tribunal's reasons) ie, the taxpayer's argument in relation to the effect of the election was 'not easy to refute' each taxpayer did have a reasonably arguable contention.</text>
