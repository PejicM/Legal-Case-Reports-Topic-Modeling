<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2009/30a.html</AustLII>
<text>Following the invitation to the appellant under s 424A in relation to the information from DFAT and the appellant's response, the Tribunal placed no reliance upon any information received from DFAT that was not put to the appellant in that invitation. Accordingly, there was no breach of s 424A. The High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI

These reasons were written prior to the decision of the High Court, handed down this morning, to allow the appeal in SZKTI ( Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30). The High Court there accepted (at [28]) the Minister's submissions (at [27] [28]) that s 424(2) does not operate to limit the general facultative power given by s 424(1) in aid of the inquisitorial functions of the Tribunal. The limitation on that general power is that the Tribunal ' must have regard ' to that information in making its decision (at [37]). Procedural fairness is assured by, inter alia , the requirements of s 424A. The High Court concluded (at [48]) that the procedural restrictions on the specific power to issue an invitation to give additional information do not qualify the Tribunal's general power in s 424(1) to ' get any information that it considers relevant '.

It follows that the method adopted by the Tribunal to obtain the information did not give rise to jurisdictional error.

I see no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal or error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.</text>

<text>As to the appellant's complaints about the Tribunal's use of independent country information, his Honour observed at [60] that, if there was particular information which the appellant considered relevant, it was up to him to bring that material to the Tribunal's attention. As his Honour observed, the Tribunal is not obliged to make the appellant's case for him ( Re Ruddock; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [57] ).</text>

<tocase>SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152</tocase>
<text>Federal Magistrate Scarlett concluded that the Tribunal had also complied with s 425 of the Act and with the procedures otherwise required by the Act and the Regulations. His Honour noted that the credibility of the appellant's claims, which had been an issue before the delegate, was also a significant factor in the Tribunal hearing and that ' there was no issue that would have taken the [appellant] by surprise '. In that respect also, his Honour found compliance with s 425 of the Act ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152).</text>

<text>Otherwise, the grounds of the application were, his Honour said, seeking merits review or complaints as to the use of independent country information, the use of which was a matter for the Tribunal ( SZJHP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 119 per Tamberlin J). The ground of bias was not, his Honour said, made out.</text>

<tocase>SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 236</tocase>
<text>The s 424A letter sent to the appellant following receipt of the response from DFAT did not fail adequately to set out clear particulars of the information obtained or fail to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the appellant understood why it was relevant to the review (cf. SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 119 ; (2008) 170 FCR 236).</text>

<tocase>SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 256</tocase>
<text>As to s 424B, Scarlett FM considered that the request to DFAT about the authenticity of the document purportedly from the Supreme Court of Bangladesh should be distinguished from SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 ; (2008) 168 FCR 256 and that there was no prejudice to the appellant, who had been given the opportunity to comment on the response from DFAT in accordance with s 424A of the Act. His Honour did not explicitly find that s 424(2) had not been engaged by the request to DFAT about the authenticity of the document but that finding is implicit in his Honour's finding that SZKTI should be distinguished. Accordingly, given that s 424(2) was not engaged, there was no need for the Tribunal to comply with s 424B in making that request.

Federal Magistrate Scarlett found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.

The appellant raises three grounds of appeal: The Federal Magistrates Court failed to follow the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness when making decision. 
 The Federal Magistrates Court was in improper exercise of its power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported; therefore the decision on 11 th September 2008 should be sat aside. 
 The Federal Magistrates Court an error of law and jurisdictional error when it made its decision.</text>

<tocase>SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 255 ALR 407</tocase>
<text>As to his Honour's consideration of the Full Court decision in SZKTI , the decision of the Full Court in SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2009) 255 ALR 407 at [88] [114] and at [123] [124] makes it clear that the request from the Tribunal to DFAT did not enliven s 424(2) of the Act. It was not an invitation to give "additional information" for the purposes of that subsection (as then in force). It was not an invitation for additional information from DFAT.</text>
