<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>As Gleeson CJ and Crennan J observed in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [19] , in all applications for an interlocutory injunction the Court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that:

As their Honours observed further, these are the organising principles, to be applied having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case, under which issues of justice and convenience are addressed (at [19]).

It follows that it is for Ms Jones to satisfy me positively in respect of these issues. Before turning to these issues however it is appropriate to identify the precise relief sought by Ms Jones, and, in more detail, the background to this application. Relief Sought

Pursuant to her application Ms Jones seeks relief for adverse action taken against her, and/or proposed to be taken against her, by QTAC because of her role in negotiations for an Enterprise Agreement, and for breach of her contract of employment.

The permanent relief sought by Ms Jones is as follows: 
 
 A. DETAILS OF CLAIM 
 

 
 
 On the grounds stated in the accompanying affidavit or statement of claim (or such other accompanying document as may be prescribed by the Rules) the Applicant claims: 
 

 Pursuant to section 545(2)(a) of the FW Act, an injunction restraining the Respondent from taking any action against the Applicant in reliance upon:
 any allegations against the Applicant made by the Australian Services Union in its letter to the Respondent dated 7 August 2009; and/or
 the complaint made against the Applicant by Nicola Bowes dated 7 August 2009; and/or
 the anonymous complaint made against the Applicant dated 11 August 2009; and/or
 the anonymous complaint made against the Applicant dated 12 August 2009; and/or
 the complaint made against the Applicant by Danelle Bayley dated 13 August 2009; and/or
 any allegations against the Applicant made by the Australian Services Union in its letter to the Respondent dated 14 August 2009; and/or
 the Carol Watson report on Grievances against CEO, QTAC dated 28 September 2009; and/or
 Walter Williams' hand written diary notes forwarded to the Applicant by Professor Deborah Terry on about 30 October 2009.
 Pursuant to section 545(2)(b) of the FW Act, the Respondent pay the Applicant compensation for loss suffered by the Applicant because of the Respondent's contravention of the FW Act;
 Pursuant to section 546 of the FW Act, the Respondent pay the Applicant a pecuniary penalty for the Respondent's contravention of the FW Act;
 A declaration that it is a term of the employment contract between the Applicant and the Respondent dated 29 November 2007 that the Applicant is entitled to be accorded natural justice in any investigation into any complaint or allegation of serious misconduct as set out in clause 15.2 of the employment contract and/or unsatisfactory performance or misconduct as set out in clause 15.3 of the employment contract.
 A declaration that the Respondent is in breach of the contract of employment between the Applicant and the Respondent by failing to:
 
 
 
 (a) accord the Applicant natural justice in the purported investigation into the allegations and complaints against her, as referred to in paragraph 1 above. 
 
 

 
 
 6. Damages for breach of contract.

It is clear that the question whether there is a serious question to be tried imports the obligation of the applicant to establish a prima facie case for permanent relief as explained by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] . There, their Honours said the establishment of a prima facie case in this context meant it was sufficient for the plaintiff to show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. How strong the likelihood needs to be depends upon the nature of the rights the plaintiff asserts, and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order sought ( Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] , Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622).</text>

<tocase>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266</tocase>
<text>4. Fourth, although Mr Spry for Ms Jones urged that the contract of employment should be interpreted as implying a term requiring QTAC to accord natural justice to Ms Jones in connection with any determination of serious misconduct or misconduct by Ms Jones, such an implied term is difficult to reconcile with cl 15.6 which specifically provides that QTAC is not required to follow grievance or other procedures in view of the seniority of Ms Jones' position. The Court does not lightly imply terms into a contract which the parties have not thought fit to express. As observed by the Privy Council in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 , in order for a term to be implied the following conditions must be satisfied: It must be reasonable and equitable; It must necessary to give business efficacy to the contract so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; It must be so obvious "it goes without saying"; It must be capable of clear expression; and It must not contradict any express terms of the contract.

In light of the detailed terms of cl 15, which provides for different grounds of termination and associated periods of notice, and a specific provision in cl 15.6 excluding review procedures in respect of Ms Jones' employment, it is difficult to see how the implication of term importing the rules of natural justice into the terms and conditions of employment can be justified on any of the conditions described in BP Refinery (1977) 180 CLR 266. Certainly there is clear authority to the contrary the House of Lords held in Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation [1971] 1 WLR 1578 that, absent statutory intervention, there is no rule at common law that the requirements of natural justice are incorporated into the employment relationship (per Lord Reid at 1581F-G, Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest at 1586F and 1588D, Lord Guest at 1593G-H, Lord Wilberforce at 1595E).</text>

<tocase>Kimpton v Minister for Education (1996) 65 IR 317</tocase>
<text>4. Fourth, I am persuaded that the commencement of an investigation into the allegations against Ms Jones and the commissioning of the Carol Watson report arguably constituted "adverse action" for the purposes of the FW Act. In particular, I note: Observations of North J in Kimpton v Minister for Education (1996) 65 IR 317 at 319 where his Honour said: 
 
 
 I do not regard it as hopeless or untenable to contend that the requirement to participate in the investigatory process may amount to a relevant injury or prejudicial alteration. This is not to say that there is not force in the arguments put by Dr Jessup. Those arguments should, however, be resolved at the trial of the proceeding when the matter can be determined after comprehensive argument and in the light of all the evidence available at the trial. 
 
 

 Observations of Goldberg J in United Firefighters Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (2003) 198 ALR 466 at [89] where his Honour said in the course of delivering judgment in respect of an application for an interlocutory injunction: 
 
 
 I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried on this integer of a contravention of s 298K. The laying of the charges imposes a burden on the persons charged to respond to allegations relating to their conduct as employees of the board. I do not consider that one can separate out the effect and consequence of the charges from the fact that they occurred because of the employee's employment by the board. I do not accept that a person charged is not affected in his or her employment until the charge has been proven... The laying of the charges exposes an employee of the board to a potential disadvantage in his or her employment if the charges are ultimately proven.

In highlighting these comments of Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 , Mr Spry submitted that his Honour contemplated adverse action taken by an employer in circumstances where a disciplinary charge was brought other than in good faith, and contended that such was the case in relation to the commencement of the investigation against Ms Jones. In my view, placing to one side for the moment whether the commencement of the investigation constituted adverse action against Ms Jones, there is little evidence at this stage to support any claim by Ms Jones that the Carol Watson report was commissioned by QTAC other than in good faith. Indeed, as Mr Murdoch SC submitted, under the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld) QTAC is obliged to ensure the safety of its employees at work, which includes protection from workplace harassment. However it is also the case that the possible conflict of authority between Kimpton (1996) 65 IR 317 and United Firefighters (2003) 198 ALR 466 on the one hand, and Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 on the other, suggests another issue which warrants determination at a final hearing rather than at an interlocutory stage.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/622.html</AustLII>
<text>On the basis that Ms Jones would suffer an injury from this course of action, I consider that damages would not provide an adequate remedy. Discipline of a chief executive officer for allegedly creating a culture of fear or terror in the workplace, be such discipline in the form of termination of employment or otherwise, is a very serious matter. In my view it is likely that such a course of conduct would have a detrimental effect on Ms Jones' reputation and impose a stigma which could adversely affect her future career prospects (cf comments of Young J in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure [2006] FCA 622 at [29] ). Issue 3 Does the balance of convenience favour the granting of an interlocutory injunction?

In relation to this issue, Ms Jones submitted in summary that:

In response QTAC submitted that the balance of convenience is strongly in favour of denying the interlocutory relief sought because, in summary:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/467.html</AustLII>
<text>I note that a contrary view was expressed by Ryan J in Police Federation of Australia v Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 where his Honour observed that the resumption of an investigation into certain allegations against a senior police officer did not amount to an alteration of the officer's position because "alteration" in this context requires a substantive change in, or reduction of, the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity. Specifically, his Honour found that: 
 
 Merely to be subject to a disciplinary inquiry or investigation does not, without more, constitute such a substantive change. (at [45])

Mr Spry drew my attention to further comments of his Honour in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [48] , namely: 
 
 I consider, with respect, that amenability to a disciplinary charge brought in good faith and on a proper prima facie evidentiary basis is a normal incident of employment and does not of itself, before the laying of the charge, constitute "an adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee" in the sense used by the High Court in the passage from Patrick Stevedores ...

In highlighting these comments of Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 , Mr Spry submitted that his Honour contemplated adverse action taken by an employer in circumstances where a disciplinary charge was brought other than in good faith, and contended that such was the case in relation to the commencement of the investigation against Ms Jones. In my view, placing to one side for the moment whether the commencement of the investigation constituted adverse action against Ms Jones, there is little evidence at this stage to support any claim by Ms Jones that the Carol Watson report was commissioned by QTAC other than in good faith. Indeed, as Mr Murdoch SC submitted, under the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld) QTAC is obliged to ensure the safety of its employees at work, which includes protection from workplace harassment. However it is also the case that the possible conflict of authority between Kimpton (1996) 65 IR 317 and United Firefighters (2003) 198 ALR 466 on the one hand, and Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 on the other, suggests another issue which warrants determination at a final hearing rather than at an interlocutory stage.

In this case Ms Jones has established at least a sufficient likelihood of success in claiming that the commencement of the investigation by QTAC and the subsequent conduct of the investigation were prejudicial or disadvantageous to her position as an employee. Not only had QTAC commissioned an investigation by a third party into complaints and allegations against Ms Jones in circumstances where such complaints and allegations included anonymous complaints or, in the case of allegations by Mr Williams, were allegedly driven by motives relevant to his own position, but QTAC on 6 November 2009 informed all staff of the existence of the Carol Watson report and that it intended to respond to it. While QTAC did not specifically identify Ms Jones as the subject of the report, in my view the focus of the report would have been well-known to QTAC staff. Such publicity is invariably capable of damaging the reputation of an employee or adversely affecting her standing in the organisation (cf comments of Ryan J in Nixon [2008] FCA 467 ; (2008) 168 FCR 340 at [42] - [43] ).

5. Fifth, in her letter to Ms Jones dated 29 October 2009, Professor Terry responded in detail to issues raised in correspondence from Cooper Grace Ward on behalf of Ms Jones and concluded: 
 
 Allegations 
 

 
 
 Having considered the investigator's report and your response to that report, QTAC believes there is evidence that you have acted in a way which amounts to bullying or harassment of employees. If established, QTAC believes the conduct may amount to serious misconduct or misconduct for the purposes of your employment contract, such that QTAC is in a position to terminate your employment either summarily or on notice. 
 

 
 
 The allegations are set out conveniently in the findings in the investigator's report as clarified in this correspondence and supplemented by the matters recorded in Mr William's diary entries. The diary entries (maintained by Mr Williams) contain a number of specific examples of conduct. If the events occurred in the manner recorded by Mr Williams, QTAC would consider many of them to be unacceptable.

As is clear from the affidavit of Professor Terry sworn 18 November 2009 (paras 23-25), a meeting of the members of QTAC was proposed to make a decision concerning Ms Jones' employment based on the Carol Watson report and Ms Jones' responses to that report. Indeed a meeting was scheduled to take place on 17 November 2009 but postponed because of the commencement of these proceedings.</text>
