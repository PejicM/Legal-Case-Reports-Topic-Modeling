<text>5 The principles governing the exercise of the Court's power summarily to dismiss a claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, the principles which govern pleadings in this Court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421. It is not necessary to restate, at length, his Honour's exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that:
 
&#8226; The power to dismiss a claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action will not lightly be exercised: see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130; Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603.
 
&#8226; The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues with sufficient clarity such that respondents understand, and have the opportunity to meet, the case made against them: see Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [1997] ATPR 41-591 at 44, 151ff.
 
&#8226; A statement of claim must plead all the material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action. If it does not it is liable to be struck out: Mitanis ; Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713.
 
&#8226; It is not sufficient for the pleader to state conclusions drawn from unstated facts: see Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-5.
 
&#8226; There will be cases in which the power to strike out pleadings will not be exercised notwithstanding a failure to plead all material facts. Such restraint will be appropriate where the deficiency causes no confusion and does not raise issues of substantive principle ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro-Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 at [59] ), and where deficiencies can be overcome by ordering the provision of particulars or the furnishing of affidavits ( State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42,828-9).
 
&#8226; Not all conclusionary pleadings will be struck-out as being deficient: see Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 at 417. Whether or not such a pleading should be struck out will depend on whether or not the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality: see Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557.</text>

15 In my view a person reading the pleaded definition could not reasonably be expected to determine whether he or she had purchased items which were "rubber products" as defined in paragraph 4 of the statement of claim. The statement of claim fails sufficiently to describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates. For this reason alone the statement of claim should be struck out: see Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v Nixon [2000] FCA 229 ; (2000) 170 ALR 487 at 514.

16 There are, however, additional and related difficulties occasioned by the failure of the applicant adequately to define "rubber products" which affect the efficacy of other parts of the statement of claim. The applicant pleads (in paragraph 37) that Bayer Australia and Chemtura Australia were able to and did influence the price of rubber products in Australia. In paragraph 38 it is claimed that the respondents overcharged for rubber products. As a result it is alleged (in paragraph 40) that the applicant and group members suffered loss and damage as a result of having to pay more for rubber products that they would have been required to do had the respondents contravening conduct not occurred. In the absence of a clear definition of group members and a clear understanding of what is comprehended by the term "rubber products" these paragraphs are embarrassing. The respondents cannot fairly be expected to plead to them. The same problem arises in respect to paragraph 12 in which it is said that there is a national market in Australia for the supply of rubber products.

17 Before passing to other objections to the statement of claim it should be noted that the applicant has not pleaded sufficient material facts to establish that it is a member of the group which it seeks to represent.</text>

<tocase>Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Ltd [2003] FCA 61</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/61.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The need for precision in the framing of group definitions in representative proceedings was explained by Sackville J in Petrusevski v Bulldogs Rugby League Ltd [2003] FCA 61. His Honour said:
 "19 In determining what s 33H(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act requires, it is important to consider why it is necessary to describe or identify the group members in a representative proceeding. One reason, as the High Court observed in Wong v Silkfield, is to enable the Court to determine whether the requirements of s 33C have been satisfied. Unless the group member is adequately described or identified (although not necessarily named or counted: s 33H(2)), it may be difficult to ascertain, for example, whether the claims of all the group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. 20 Another reason for describing or identifying group members is to enable group members to decide whether or not to opt out of the representative proceeding pursuant to s 33J(2) of the Federal Court Act. If a person who is a group member does not opt out of the proceedings he or she will be bound by the judgment. (Section 33ZB requires the judgment in a representative proceeding to "describe or otherwise identify the group members who will be affected by it" and provides that the judgment binds any such persons other than any person who has opted out.) The failure by a group member to opt out of representative proceedings may therefore be attended by serious consequences, although of course the litigation might also produce advantages for that group member. 21 These factors suggest that it must be possible for persons who may be within the represented group to ascertain from the pleadings whether they are in fact group members. The point was made by Hedigan J in Cook v Pasminco Ltd [2000] VSC 534 , at [59], in relation to similar State legislation: 
 
 
 "It is beyond doubt that in a group proceeding the description of a group membership must be such so that it is at least possible to determine who falls within the group as described. Persons contemplated as being within the group would themselves not understand whether they were within it, unless the definition of the group is intelligible, although not necessarily exact. Members of the group are entitled to know what constitutes the essentials of the group. A decision concerning opt-out cannot be sensibly made unless it is known what it is that is being opted out from." 
 
 
 
It follows from his Honour's observations that a person must be able to ascertain from the description of the represented group whether he or she is a member of that group. 22 ... 23 Clearly enough, not every description or identification of the represented group will satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a) of the Federal Court Act. A useful, although not necessarily exhaustive test, is whether the description is such as to enable a person, with the assistance of a legal adviser if necessary, to ascertain whether he or she is a group member. If the description incorporates a reference to conduct alleged in the pleadings, a person or his or her adviser ought to be able, by reading the description and the relevant portion of the pleadings, to determine whether he or she is a member of the represented group. If a person cannot reasonably be expected to do this, the definition is unlikely to satisfy the requirements of s 33H(1)(a). (Emphasis added)." 
In that case the group was defined, in part, by reference to the pleaded conduct of the respondent. Hence his Honour's allusion, in the final paragraph quoted, to a definition incorporating a reference to conduct. The test which he propounded would have equal application to a definition which had, as one of its elements, the purchase by group members of a particular product: a person who wishes to ascertain whether or not he or she is a group member must be able, by reading the definition, to determine whether he or she has purchased such a product.

14 As presently framed the group definition includes any person who has paid at least $5,000 for "rubber chemicals" or "rubber products" in a six and a half year period. There could be multiple purchases so long as the aggregate price of those purchases exceeds $5,000. The purchases could have been made anywhere. A person seeking to determine, perhaps with the assistance of his or her lawyer, whether he or she fell within the group would have considerable, but probably not insurmountable, difficulty in deciding whether or not these criteria had been satisfied. Resort to invoices, catalogues, product statements and other documents would be needed. The real problem would lie in determining whether the items purchased were "rubber products". Some decisions would be easy: a rubber ball could readily be identified as a "rubber product". But how are potential group members to know whether an item which does not have the external appearance or texture of rubber contains "rubber chemicals"? They would, presumably, require the assistance of an expert chemist. What if the rubber item forms but a small part of a larger product? The respondents cite as examples the mud flaps on a large truck or the rubber "feet" at the bottom of table legs. Despite being asked, the applicant has not told the respondents whether, in such cases, the larger item with a small rubber part is itself to be regarded as a "rubber product" because it "contains rubber chemicals".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>37 The applicant's attempt to rely on s 75B of the Act must fail in the absence of a pleading of intentional and knowing participation by a respondent in any alleged contravention of the Act : see Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 669-670. This aspect of the pleading also suffers from an absence of specificity: it identifies conduct, for the purposes of s 75B , as being any of the conduct, alleged to have been undertaken by the foreign respondents or the Australian companies, to which reference is made in any or all of some 22 paragraphs of the statement of claim.

38 The statement of claim should be struck out. It cannot be saved by amendment. As this is the first occasion on which the Court has considered and ruled on the respondents' objections, the applicant should, if it is so advised, have the opportunity to replead.

 I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.
