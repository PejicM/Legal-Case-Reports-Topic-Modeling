<tocase>Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479</tocase>

<text>In Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 , McHugh J was concerned with the application of O 60 r 6 of the High Court Rules in respect of the applicant's application for an extension of time. McHugh J said, at 480: 
 [Order 60 rule 6] provides that a court or a justice may enlarge the time appointed by the Rules for doing an act upon such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require and that the enlargement may be ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act. The grant of an extention of time under this rule is not automatic. The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the court or justice to do justice between the parties: see Hughes v National Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co of Australasia Ltd [1978] VR 257 at 262. This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant.

There are two relevant matters concerning whether the Court should exercise its discretion to extend time. The first is whether a sufficient explanation for the delay has been forthcoming; the second is whether the proposed appeal would enjoy any prospect of success, such that it ought be allowed to proceed.

The applicant, on the first issue, says that the delay was occasioned by an application which she made to the Australian Human Rights Commission after the dismissal of a Federal Magistrates Court proceedings. The evidence establishes that the Commission said on 17 October 2008 that it was not the appropriate body for reviewing the applicant's case. On 20 October 2008, the applicant filed her application for an extension of time in the Federal Court. This application was filed promptly after the applicant was advised by the Australian Human Rights Commission determined that it was not the appropriate body to review the applicant's case.</text>

<tocase>Mentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCAFC 149</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/149.html</AustLII>
<text>In Mentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation [2004] FCAFC 149 at [3] , Kiefel, Weinberg, and Stone JJ held that an order dismissing an application for want of jurisdiction was interlocutory in character, at least where it does not finally dispose of the parties' rights.

Whether the judgment of Jarrett FM is final or interlocutory, the application for extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal, which was filed 20 October 2008, is either 34 days late if it was an interlocutory judgment, or 20 days late if it was a final judgment. It is unnecessary to determine that question.

Order 52 r 5(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides: 
 (3) Where an application is not filed within the time limited by subrule (2), an order shall be sought in the application that compliance with subrule (2) be dispensed with.</text>
