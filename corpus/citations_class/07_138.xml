<text>32 It was for the applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that the applicant met each of the relevant criteria for the grant of the visa. It was for the applicant to put forward any evidence in support of her application and make whatever submissions she wished to establish that she came within the relevant criteria in the Regulations: Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576.

33 The applicant's application did not require the Tribunal to review the decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse Shark Australia's nomination. In my opinion, no separate duty rested upon the Tribunal to inquire into the decision to refuse Shark Australia's nomination. It would have been pointless for the Tribunal to further inquire into that other decision. That is so because no-one who could seek a review had done so.

34 The question before the Tribunal was whether the decision made by the delegate of the Minister in relation to the refusal of the applicant's application for a visa ought to be affirmed or otherwise. On the information that was before the delegate, it was inevitable that the decision had to be affirmed, as it was. The appellant did not put any material before the Tribunal which the Tribunal failed to consider. The appellant did not attend the Tribunal hearing and her claims were limited to the very brief statements in the letter of 29 May 2005.</text>

<tocase>Tvarkovski v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 375</tocase>

<text>30 In Tvarkovski v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 375 , Goldberg J said at [30]-[31]:
 
 ' 30 It is an accepted principle of administrative law that the jurisdiction given to a body to review an administrative decision generally extends to a consideration of the decision maker's findings or conclusions which contribute to the final or operative decision: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 338 per Mason CJ. The application of this principle to the Tribunal's decision means that the Tribunal was entitled to review, and should have reviewed, the whole process of decision making in relation to the applicant's visa, which included that part of the decision making process which determined that the applicant had not been nominated in accordance with reg 5.19.

31 I am satisfied that the Tribunal had the power to consider the reg 5.19 issues as part of its review of the decision to refuse the visa application. The Tribunal fell into an error of law by failing to turn its mind to whether the visa criteria were satisfied by reference to the reg 5.19 definitions. The Tribunal precluded itself from considering the reg 5.19 issues by misconstruing the regulations and determining that there was no right of review in respect of employment nominations before 1 July 1999.' 
 

31 In this case, the decision to refuse Shark Australia's nomination was not reviewable by the Tribunal for the two reasons which I have mentioned. First, it was not an MRT-reviewable decision. Secondly, if it was, it was only reviewable at the instigation of Shark Australia.</text>
