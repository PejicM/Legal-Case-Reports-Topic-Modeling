<text>9 Without further hearing from the appellant, the Tribunal was not satisfied on the very limited material before it that the appellant's claimed political involvement with the Akali Dal Baadal in India or the false charges and attacks on his family that the appellant claimed to have suffered as a result of his political activities were true. These were factual conclusions that were open to the Tribunal. According to the decision in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 the Court cannot review the merits of the Tribunal's decision. Further, there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: see Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 560, [137] .</text>

<tocase>S58 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 85 ALD 492</tocase>
<text>8 The real difficulty facing the appellant is that the appellant declined a hearing before the Tribunal. It may have been that he was ill-advised in so acting, but the appellant must accept the consequences of that choice: see S58 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2004) 85 ALD 492 at [25]. As was pointed out in SZDXC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1306 at [16] :
 
 The RRT made it pellucidly clear in its letter of 12 March 2004 that it was unable to make a decision in the appellant's favour on the basis of the information before it, and as the Full Court observed in NAVX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 , when the appellant failed to accept the opportunity to elaborate on that information at the scheduled hearing, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application.</text>
