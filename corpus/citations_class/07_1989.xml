<tocase>Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428</tocase>
<text>15 The Tribunal is required by s 37(6) of the Act to affirm a relevant decision of a Trustee if it is satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Relevant principles as to fairness and reasonableness in this context include the following:
 
&#8226; the words "unfair" and "unreasonable" as used in the Act are of broad content and purpose, and not to be read restrictively: National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 571
 
&#8226; whether a decision, or its operation in relation to a person, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances involves a value judgment, the making of which is committed to the Tribunal: National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 570-571
 
&#8226; where the Tribunal forms the view that the decision was fair and reasonable it must affirm the decision even though the Tribunal might not itself have made the same decision ( National Mutual Life Association of Australia v Scollary [2002] FCA 695 at [37] , Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Brayley [2002] FCA 1333 at [31] )
 
&#8226; a decision under review pursuant to s 37 may be one which so involves elements of fact, degree, opinion or value judgement that different minds can legitimately differ in reaching a decision. That is why the Tribunal's task is not to ask itself whether such a decision was the correct or preferable decision, nor to engage in ascertaining generally the rights of the parties, nor to engage in some form of judicial review of the decision of the trustee or insurer. Rather it is to form a view, from the perspective of the trustee, as to whether the decision was - recognising the overriding framework given by the rules of the fund - unfair or unreasonable (Allsop J in Crocker at ATR 366, 367, the Full Court in Cameron 130 FCR at 133)
 
&#8226; as explained by Branson J in Brayley [2002] FCA 1333 at [32] , if the Tribunal is not satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances, ss 37(1) and (2) require the Tribunal put itself in the position of the trustee and, in an appropriate case, the insurer and other relevant decision-maker ( National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 570; Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428 at 443-445). From that position or positions the Tribunal must determine whether, consistently with:
 
 
 
 (a) the general law;
 (b) the governing rules of the fund concerned; and
 (c) if a contract of insurance between the insurer and a trustee is involved, the terms of the contract, 
 
 

the unfairness or unreasonableness that the Tribunal has identified in respect of the trustee's decision can be addressed in whole or in part
 
&#8226; a decision of a trustee or insurer as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision of the Tribunal in substitution for a decision of the trustee or insurer, is for all purposes (other than the making of a complaint about the decision) taken to be a decision of the trustee or insurer and, on the coming into operation of the determination by the Tribunal, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect on and from the day on which the original decision had effect: s 41(3) 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal is obliged to consider the evidence before it by way of hearing de novo : Seafarers' Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Oppenhuis [1999] FCA 1683 ; (1999) 94 FCR 594 at 598-599. Indeed in reviewing a decision of a Trustee of a fund, the Tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee: s 37(1)(a). In exercising its powers of review, the Tribunal is not restricted to the documents which were before the Trustee, nor is it confined to the manner in which the applicant addressed the subject matter: Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board v Dexte r [2004] FCA 1434 ; (2004) 142 FCR 151 at 166-167, Crocker 48 ATR 387-388, Oppenhuis 94 FCR at 599, HEST Australia Ltd v Sykley [2005] FCA 1381 ; (2005) 147 FCR 248 at 259.</text>

<text>12 In summary, the second respondent submitted:
 
&#8226; in exercising its powers under s 37(1) of the Act , the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the decision-maker: National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell [2000] FCA 852 ; (2000) 99 FCR 562
 
&#8226; the task of the Tribunal is that it must first consider whether the decision complained of was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The words "fair" and "reasonable" are of broad content and purpose: Flexiplan Australia Ltd v Pankhurst [2001] FCA 1535 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal noted that the issue to be determined was whether the decision of the Trustee to refuse payment of the TPD benefit, on the grounds that the applicant's total and permanent disability was caused by a condition related to his pre-existing schizophrenia, was fair and reasonable in its operation to the applicant in the circumstances
 
&#8226; in relation to the medical evidence before it, the Tribunal noted the considerable variation in the clinical history provided by the applicant to the various medical experts, and the competing medical opinions relevant to the applicant's case
 
&#8226; the Tribunal ultimately concluded that it was satisfied that the Trustee's decision to decline payment of the TPD benefit to the applicant on the grounds that, on the balance of probabilities his medical condition, be it PTSD or an anxiety disorder, was related to the pre-existing, long-standing paranoid schizophrenia, was fair and reasonable given the conflicting psychiatric opinions. After reviewing all the available medical evidence, the Tribunal also expressed the opinion that the applicant's PTSD or anxiety disorder was sufficiently related to his schizophrenia such as to render the decision of the Trustee fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances
 
&#8226; contrary to the submission of the applicant, the Tribunal did not misdirect itself as to the fundamental issue it was obliged to consider, namely whether the decision of the second respondent was fair and reasonable in the circumstances
 
&#8226; the reasons of the Tribunal must be read as a whole and fairly
 
&#8226; it was not necessary for the Tribunal to decide afresh all findings of fact made by the second respondent
 
&#8226; it was open for the Tribunal to conclude that favourable opinions expressed in the expert medical reports were outweighed by countervailing considerations including the opinions of Dr Butler and Dr Reddan
 
&#8226; the Tribunal has examined the medical evidence, was fully aware of the task it had to embark on, and had regard to all the evidence in reaching its decision
 
&#8226; the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that there has been an error of law. The Tribunal does not commit an error of law because it finds facts wrongly or upon a doubtful basis or because it adopts some unsound or questionable reasoning at the end of the day
 
&#8226; the second respondent in effect relied upon the findings of Dr Reddan and Dr Butler that the conditions complained of were not related to work
 
&#8226; the second respondent relied on the following comments of Allsop J in Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd v Crocker (2001) 48 ATR 359 at 367, which were endorsed by the Full Court in Cameron v Board Trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme [2003] FCAFC 214 ; (2003) 130 FCR 122:
 
 
 "The Tribunal's task is not to engage in ascertaining generally the rights of the parties, nor is it to engage in some form of judicial review of the decision of the trustee or insurer. Rather it is to form a view, from the perspective of the trustee or insurer, as to whether the decision of either was (recognising the overriding framework given by the governing rules and policy terms, respectively) unfair or unreasonable."

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/82.html</AustLII>
<text>3 A party may appeal to the Federal Court, on a question of law, from a determination of the Tribunal: s 46 Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act "). Such proceedings come before the Court for hearing and determination in the exercise of its original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction: Cullinane v Mercer Benefit Nominees Ltd [2006] FCAFC 82 ; (2006) 152 FCR 1.

4 The background facts to this matter can be found in the Tribunal's Record of Decision, and the Statements of Facts, Issues and Contentions of the parties. They may be summarised as follows:
 
&#8226; in 1994 the applicant was diagnosed with schizophrenia and commenced ongoing treatment
 
&#8226; in September 2001, the applicant commenced employment with the Department of Primary Industries in Queensland as a field assistant in the Department's Fire Ant Eradication Program
 
&#8226; on 10 September 2001 the applicant joined the QSuper Accumulation Account (the Fund). The Fund automatically provided him with 4 units of death and Total and Permanent Disablement ("TPD") insurance cover
 
&#8226; in December 2001 the applicant applied to the Fund to increase his insurance cover to 17 units of death and TPD cover. This was approved effective 10 December 2001
 
&#8226; so far as relevant, cl 6.2 of the QSuper Trust Deed's Insurance Terms provides as follows:
 
 
 "No insurance benefit will be paid for a claim unless:
 ...
 (b) (i) the member has been an insured member for fewer than 10 continuous years; and
 (ii) the member lodged a personal medical statement at or about the date on which the member became an insured member; and
 (iii) the board is of the opinion that the total and permanent disablement ... was not related to a condition that was disclosed on the personal medical statement or which in the opinion of the board should reasonably have been disclosed on the personal medical statement; or
 
 (c) (i) the member has been an insured member for fewer than 10 continuous years; and
 (ii) the member did not lodge a personal medical statement at or about the date on which the member became an insured member, and
 (iii) it is established to the satisfaction of the board that the total and permanent disablement ... was not related to a condition that ought reasonably to have been disclosed had a personal medical statement been submitted at or about the date on which the member became an insured member."
 
 

&#8226; there is some lack of clarity as to whether the applicant had disclosed his schizophrenia to the Fund prior to joining. The applicant claims he did so orally over the telephone and in a personal medical statement which was posted to QSuper, however it appears that this medical statement was not received. In any event this is not a relevant issue in this case as no insurance benefit is payable for TPD relating to a pre-existing medical condition irrespective whether it was disclosed
 
&#8226; on 2 January 2002, while inspecting a property for fire ants, the applicant injured his right foot after running away from two dogs he thought were chasing him
 
&#8226; the applicant ceased work on 8 July 2002 after anticipation of a repeat experience left him anxious and stressed to such a degree that he was unable to cope with his work
 
&#8226; the applicant applied for a TPD benefit on 12 February 2003
 
&#8226; a delegate of the Trustee of the Fund determined that the TPD was because of his pre-existing schizophrenia and declined to pay the benefit in accordance with its rules relating to pre-existing illnesses
 
&#8226; by letter dated 26 May 2003 the applicant was informed of the Trustee's decision
 
&#8226; the applicant sought to appeal this decision on 17 June 2003 and then subsequently withdrew his appeal on 17 July 2003. However, by letter dated 19 May 2004 he renewed his appeal and provided various reports in support of the appeal
 
&#8226; on 23 June 2003 the applicant was retired on ill health grounds
 
&#8226; on 31 August 2004 the Trustee reviewed its decision at the applicant's request, and advised the applicant that the previous decision of the delegate of the Trustee was affirmed
 
&#8226; the applicant appealed the Trustee's decision to the Tribunal on 5 November 2004 pursuant to s 14 of the Act , on the basis that the decision of the Trustee was unfair or unreasonable
 
&#8226; the Tribunal affirmed the Trustee's decision in its decision of 2 October 2006
 
&#8226; the amount in dispute is the insured TPD benefit of $991,200.

5 The Tribunal identified its role as to determine whether the decision of the Trustee was fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances. The Tribunal noted that the issue was not whether the Tribunal would have made the same decision. The Tribunal considered that the issue before it was whether the decision of the Trustee that the condition rendering the applicant totally and permanently disabled was related to a pre-existing condition (as that term appeared in subcll 6.2 and 6.5 in the Fund's insurance terms) operated fairly and reasonably in relation to the applicant in these circumstances.

6 In its review determination and reasons the Tribunal considered in summary:
 
&#8226; the Trust Deed and Insurance Terms
 
&#8226; the medical reports of one psychologist, three psychiatrists, two general practitioners, two orthopaedic surgeons, one occupational health physician and a podiatrist and
 
&#8226; the submissions of the parties. I note that the applicant was given leave to be legally represented at the hearing before the Tribunal.

7 The Tribunal found:
 
 "Based on the Tribunal's analysis of the medical reports, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Trustee's decision to decline payment of the TPD benefit to the Complainant on the grounds that, on the balance of probabilities, his medical condition, be it PTSD or an anxiety disorder, was related to the pre-existing, long-standing paranoid schizophrenia was fair and reasonable, given the conflicting psychiatric opinions.
 
 In the opinion of the Tribunal after reviewing all of the available medical evidence, the Complainant's PTSD or anxiety disorder is sufficiently related to his schizophrenia such as to render the decision of the Trustee fair and reasonable in relation to the Complainant in the circumstances."</text>

<text>15 The Tribunal is required by s 37(6) of the Act to affirm a relevant decision of a Trustee if it is satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Relevant principles as to fairness and reasonableness in this context include the following:
 
&#8226; the words "unfair" and "unreasonable" as used in the Act are of broad content and purpose, and not to be read restrictively: National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 571
 
&#8226; whether a decision, or its operation in relation to a person, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances involves a value judgment, the making of which is committed to the Tribunal: National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 570-571
 
&#8226; where the Tribunal forms the view that the decision was fair and reasonable it must affirm the decision even though the Tribunal might not itself have made the same decision ( National Mutual Life Association of Australia v Scollary [2002] FCA 695 at [37] , Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Brayley [2002] FCA 1333 at [31] )
 
&#8226; a decision under review pursuant to s 37 may be one which so involves elements of fact, degree, opinion or value judgement that different minds can legitimately differ in reaching a decision. That is why the Tribunal's task is not to ask itself whether such a decision was the correct or preferable decision, nor to engage in ascertaining generally the rights of the parties, nor to engage in some form of judicial review of the decision of the trustee or insurer. Rather it is to form a view, from the perspective of the trustee, as to whether the decision was - recognising the overriding framework given by the rules of the fund - unfair or unreasonable (Allsop J in Crocker at ATR 366, 367, the Full Court in Cameron 130 FCR at 133)
 
&#8226; as explained by Branson J in Brayley [2002] FCA 1333 at [32] , if the Tribunal is not satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances, ss 37(1) and (2) require the Tribunal put itself in the position of the trustee and, in an appropriate case, the insurer and other relevant decision-maker ( National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 570; Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428 at 443-445). From that position or positions the Tribunal must determine whether, consistently with:
 
 
 
 (a) the general law;
 (b) the governing rules of the fund concerned; and
 (c) if a contract of insurance between the insurer and a trustee is involved, the terms of the contract, 
 
 

the unfairness or unreasonableness that the Tribunal has identified in respect of the trustee's decision can be addressed in whole or in part
 
&#8226; a decision of a trustee or insurer as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision of the Tribunal in substitution for a decision of the trustee or insurer, is for all purposes (other than the making of a complaint about the decision) taken to be a decision of the trustee or insurer and, on the coming into operation of the determination by the Tribunal, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect on and from the day on which the original decision had effect: s 41(3) 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal is obliged to consider the evidence before it by way of hearing de novo : Seafarers' Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Oppenhuis [1999] FCA 1683 ; (1999) 94 FCR 594 at 598-599. Indeed in reviewing a decision of a Trustee of a fund, the Tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee: s 37(1)(a). In exercising its powers of review, the Tribunal is not restricted to the documents which were before the Trustee, nor is it confined to the manner in which the applicant addressed the subject matter: Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board v Dexte r [2004] FCA 1434 ; (2004) 142 FCR 151 at 166-167, Crocker 48 ATR 387-388, Oppenhuis 94 FCR at 599, HEST Australia Ltd v Sykley [2005] FCA 1381 ; (2005) 147 FCR 248 at 259.

18 Following from this point, there was evidence before both the Trustee and the Tribunal, in particular the opinions of Dr Reddan and Dr Olsen, that the cause of the applicant's total and permanent disability was his schizophrenia, and that the applicant did not suffer from PTSD (reports of Dr Reddan and first report of Dr Butler). It appears that the Tribunal, unlike the Trustee, accepted that the applicant suffered a medical condition in the nature of either PTSD or anxiety disorder. Nonetheless there was clear evidence in the report of Dr de Leacy - which was not before the Trustee, but to which the Tribunal could have regard in light of principles emerging from cases including Sykley - that the applicant's pre-existing schizophrenia may have made him more susceptible to experiencing PTSD or an anxiety disorder. It is clearly in respect of the view the Tribunal took of the susceptibility of the applicant to either PTSD or anxiety disorder resulting from his schizophrenia that the Tribunal was referring to the "sufficient relationship" between those disorders and the applicant's schizophrenia, which latter condition was the basis of the Tribunal's finding. It was open to the Tribunal on the evidence to make that finding of fact. Interestingly, while the applicant claims as a ground of appeal that the Tribunal failed to give any or adequate weight to the views of Dr de Leacy - which weight was an issue of fact for the Tribunal in any event - on the contrary, it appears that the Tribunal gave considerable weight to the views of Dr de Leacy regarding the susceptibility of persons (including the applicant) suffering schizophrenia to PTSD or anxiety disorders.

19 Second, in relation to the question of law concerning the improper exercise by the Tribunal of its powers under s 37(1)(a) of the Act , it is clear that the role the Tribunal assumed for itself, and the question it posed for itself, were correct. The Tribunal recognised that, irrespective whether the Tribunal would have made the decision the Trustee made, its role was to consider whether the decision of the Trustee to refuse payment of the TPD benefit because of the applicant's pre-existing illness was fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances (s 37).

20 Further, and contrary to the submissions raised in the applicant's first ground of appeal , in my view the Tribunal did not err in finding that the Trustee's decision was fair and reasonable, notwithstanding that the Trustee did not have the opportunity to have regard to the opinion of Dr Eric De Leacy in his report dated 22 October 2005. In relation to this point, I note in passing that clearly there was no dearth of psychological or psychiatric material before the Trustee, including several reports favourable to the applicant. However the key issue here is that the Trustee did not have the opportunity to have regard to the opinion of Dr de Leacy. The obvious answer to this point is that the reason for this is because Dr de Leacy's report had been neither sought nor prepared at the time the Trustee made its decision. In my review this issue has no merit.</text>

<text>17 First, in relation to the question of law concerning the lack of evidence supporting the findings of the Tribunal, it is clear that, as observed by the Tribunal itself, and as demonstrated by my summary of the evidence before the Tribunal, there was a dissent of opinion amongst the reporting psychologist and psychiatrists. In such a case, the weighting of the evidence by the Tribunal, including the preference given to the views of the relevant medical practitioners, is an issue of fact, and any errors in so weighting the evidence do not give rise to errors of law appellable to this Court: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.</text>

<text>12 In summary, the second respondent submitted:
 
&#8226; in exercising its powers under s 37(1) of the Act , the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the decision-maker: National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell [2000] FCA 852 ; (2000) 99 FCR 562
 
&#8226; the task of the Tribunal is that it must first consider whether the decision complained of was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The words "fair" and "reasonable" are of broad content and purpose: Flexiplan Australia Ltd v Pankhurst [2001] FCA 1535 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal noted that the issue to be determined was whether the decision of the Trustee to refuse payment of the TPD benefit, on the grounds that the applicant's total and permanent disability was caused by a condition related to his pre-existing schizophrenia, was fair and reasonable in its operation to the applicant in the circumstances
 
&#8226; in relation to the medical evidence before it, the Tribunal noted the considerable variation in the clinical history provided by the applicant to the various medical experts, and the competing medical opinions relevant to the applicant's case
 
&#8226; the Tribunal ultimately concluded that it was satisfied that the Trustee's decision to decline payment of the TPD benefit to the applicant on the grounds that, on the balance of probabilities his medical condition, be it PTSD or an anxiety disorder, was related to the pre-existing, long-standing paranoid schizophrenia, was fair and reasonable given the conflicting psychiatric opinions. After reviewing all the available medical evidence, the Tribunal also expressed the opinion that the applicant's PTSD or anxiety disorder was sufficiently related to his schizophrenia such as to render the decision of the Trustee fair and reasonable in its operation in relation to the applicant in the circumstances
 
&#8226; contrary to the submission of the applicant, the Tribunal did not misdirect itself as to the fundamental issue it was obliged to consider, namely whether the decision of the second respondent was fair and reasonable in the circumstances
 
&#8226; the reasons of the Tribunal must be read as a whole and fairly
 
&#8226; it was not necessary for the Tribunal to decide afresh all findings of fact made by the second respondent
 
&#8226; it was open for the Tribunal to conclude that favourable opinions expressed in the expert medical reports were outweighed by countervailing considerations including the opinions of Dr Butler and Dr Reddan
 
&#8226; the Tribunal has examined the medical evidence, was fully aware of the task it had to embark on, and had regard to all the evidence in reaching its decision
 
&#8226; the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that there has been an error of law. The Tribunal does not commit an error of law because it finds facts wrongly or upon a doubtful basis or because it adopts some unsound or questionable reasoning at the end of the day
 
&#8226; the second respondent in effect relied upon the findings of Dr Reddan and Dr Butler that the conditions complained of were not related to work
 
&#8226; the second respondent relied on the following comments of Allsop J in Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd v Crocker (2001) 48 ATR 359 at 367, which were endorsed by the Full Court in Cameron v Board Trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme [2003] FCAFC 214 ; (2003) 130 FCR 122:

Rather it is to form a view, from the perspective of the trustee, as to whether the decision was - recognising the overriding framework given by the rules of the fund - unfair or unreasonable (Allsop J in Crocker at ATR 366, 367, the Full Court in Cameron 130 FCR at 133)
 
&#8226; as explained by Branson J in Brayley [2002] FCA 1333 at [32] , if the Tribunal is not satisfied that the decision was fair and reasonable in the circumstances, ss 37(1) and (2) require the Tribunal put itself in the position of the trustee and, in an appropriate case, the insurer and other relevant decision-maker ( National Mutual Life v Campbell 99 FCR at 570; Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428 at 443-445). From that position or positions the Tribunal must determine whether, consistently with:
 
 
 
 (a) the general law;
 (b) the governing rules of the fund concerned; and
 (c) if a contract of insurance between the insurer and a trustee is involved, the terms of the contract, 
 
 

the unfairness or unreasonableness that the Tribunal has identified in respect of the trustee's decision can be addressed in whole or in part
 
&#8226; a decision of a trustee or insurer as varied by the Tribunal, or a decision of the Tribunal in substitution for a decision of the trustee or insurer, is for all purposes (other than the making of a complaint about the decision) taken to be a decision of the trustee or insurer and, on the coming into operation of the determination by the Tribunal, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, has effect on and from the day on which the original decision had effect: s 41(3) 
 
&#8226; the Tribunal is obliged to consider the evidence before it by way of hearing de novo : Seafarers' Retirement Fund Pty Ltd v Oppenhuis [1999] FCA 1683 ; (1999) 94 FCR 594 at 598-599. Indeed in reviewing a decision of a Trustee of a fund, the Tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee: s 37(1)(a). In exercising its powers of review, the Tribunal is not restricted to the documents which were before the Trustee, nor is it confined to the manner in which the applicant addressed the subject matter: Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board v Dexte r [2004] FCA 1434 ; (2004) 142 FCR 151 at 166-167, Crocker 48 ATR 387-388, Oppenhuis 94 FCR at 599, HEST Australia Ltd v Sykley [2005] FCA 1381 ; (2005) 147 FCR 248 at 259.</text>
