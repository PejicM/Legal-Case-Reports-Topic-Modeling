<text>98 I accept that I should not depart from the ratio decidendi of the Hamersley decision unless I am satisfied it is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong': see Nezovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 (' Nezovic ') at 206, [52]; Marr v Australian Telecommunications Corp (1991) 34 FCR 82; Upperedge v Bailey (1994) 13 ACSR 541 at 543; Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. It would not be sufficient for a judge to merely reach one view, which he or she may prefer over that of an earlier decision, and upon that basis not follow the strong persuasive authority that has already pronounced on the same legislative provision. Before a judge refuses to follow an earlier decision regarding the construction of the same legislative provision he or she must come to the view the earlier decision is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong'.</text>

<tocase>Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/5.html</AustLII>
<text>165 The Council, however, submitted that the economic evidence was admissible in order to provide context to the task of interpreting Part IIIA of the Act. It submitted that since Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1989) 67 CLR 77, the courts have approached the Act as an economic statute designed to address economic activity. It was submitted that, critically, the courts have understood that the character of the Act as an economic statute must be taken into account in construing the words of the Act and, in this regard, economic theory and writings may be considered: see Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (' Boral Besser ') at 454, [247] per McHugh J. Like the High Court, the Tribunal recognised the importance of economic concepts in the consideration and understanding of the purpose of Part IIIA: see Re Australian Union of Students (1997) 147 ALR 458 at 462-463.

172 In the process of my reasoning, reliance has been placed upon relevant legitimate extrinsic material (referred to by the parties), including the Hilmer Report. However, I have found helpful the discussion of the economic experts as to the nature and the context in which Part IIIA is to operate, although in this regard this has been no more than an elaboration of the relevant legitimate extrinsic material referred to me by the parties. I see nothing inappropriate in the court having regard to and admitting into evidence expert evidence to inform itself as to the nature of and the context in which Part IIIA is to operate, just as it would be appropriate for the court to consider any economic writings on the subject: see Boral Besser at 454, [247] per McHugh J. By admitting the expert evidence for this purpose, the material is presented in evidentiary form and all the parties know precisely the extent of the material that is before the court and that which is to be considered by the court.</text>

<tocase>Cabell v Markham (1945) 148 F (2d) 737</tocase>
<text>94 Nevertheless, context is important. The significance of context was articulated well by Learned Hand J, first in Helvering v Gregory (1934) 69 F (2d) 809 at 810: 
 
 It is quite true...that as the articulation of a statute increases, the room for interpretation must contract; but the meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear, and which all collectively create. 

And also in Cabell v Markham (1945) 148 F (2d) 737 at 739:
 
 ...of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.</text>

 Where the law in issue is expressed in the form of an Act of an Australian legislature, it is in the words of that statute that the content of the legal obligation is to be found, not in judicial synonyms, restatements or approximations.

101 This is a statement of principle which, as Kirby J indicated has been repeated and emphasised on many occasions: (see the cases referred to by his Honour in fn 64).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/36.html</AustLII>
<text>88 The process of construction of the definition of 'service' and the expression 'use of a production process' must begin by examining the context in which the definition appears and giving the words 'presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances': Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398 (' Agfa '), applying Maunsell v Olins [1975] AC 373 at 391. That is, the court must give the words a meaning which is consistent with the language and purpose of Part IIIA and the Act as a whole. It is important to remember that whilst for the purpose of these proceedings one focuses upon the definition of 'service', it is just that, a definition. One must consider the operative provision that incorporates that definition, and determine the purpose and ambit of the operative provisions.

168 The general rule of statutory interpretation is that words used in a statute are given their most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances. Consistent with a purposive approach to the interpretation of the expression 'use of a production process', the court would be entitled to receive expert economic evidence to assist in the interpretation of that phrase if it had a technical or specialised meaning: see, e.g. Agfa at 401; Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289 at 297-8; Re Michael ; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 (' Re Michael ') at 543-544, [107]. Whether the words of a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning or a technical or specialised meaning is a question of law for the court: see Agfa at 396-398.</text>

<tocase>Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203</tocase>
<text>97 The second matter is that the construction of the definition of 'service' and the term 'use of a production process' has been comprehensively considered by a single judge of this Court in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (1999) 164 ALR 203 (' Hamersley ').

98 I accept that I should not depart from the ratio decidendi of the Hamersley decision unless I am satisfied it is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong': see Nezovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 (' Nezovic ') at 206, [52]; Marr v Australian Telecommunications Corp (1991) 34 FCR 82; Upperedge v Bailey (1994) 13 ACSR 541 at 543; Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. It would not be sufficient for a judge to merely reach one view, which he or she may prefer over that of an earlier decision, and upon that basis not follow the strong persuasive authority that has already pronounced on the same legislative provision. Before a judge refuses to follow an earlier decision regarding the construction of the same legislative provision he or she must come to the view the earlier decision is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong'.

103 BHPBIO contends that the meaning of the expression 'use of a production process' was correctly stated in Hamersley . It is contended by the Council that the Hamersley decision is clearly wrong. Fortescue supported the decision of 'production process' adopted in Hamersley , but contended that the trial Judge made errors of principle in her reasoning so as to lead her to the wrong conclusion. In addition, Fortescue contended that Hamersley was plainly distinguishable. In view of these submissions the question of the correctness or otherwise of the Hamersley decision falls for my consideration, as does the question of whether the decision can be distinguished.

104 The decision in Hamersley arose after an application was made by one of the respondents in the proceeding (which I will refer to as 'Robe') to the Council under s 44F(1) of the Act to recommend to the designated Minister declaration of a service. The service to which Robe sought access was identified in its application as 'the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility'. Robe specifically distinguished this service from any rail haulage service which may be available in relation to the facility. In essence, Robe sought access to what it termed the rail track service provided by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd ('Hamersley') by means of a facility owned by Hamersley, including associated infrastructure, but not including locomotives, rolling stock, hi-rails or operational personnel.

105 One of the main issues in the proceeding was whether the service to which access was sought by Robe was a 'service' within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Act. In particular, the issue was whether the rail track service involved the use of a production process.

106 In determining what was meant by the expression 'production process' the learned trial Judge used dictionary definitions of the word 'production' and the word 'process' as the starting point for her analysis. Her Honour concluded (at 213, [34]) that:
 
 The expression "production process" in the definition of "service" in s 44B of the Act means, in my view, a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured. 

I will refer to this definition of 'production process' as the 'Hamersley Construction'.

107 After referring to this definition, her Honour continued:
 
 Hamersley's production process in the Pilbara extends, on this view, from its commencement of mining operations at the mines to the completion of the product that it sells, namely, export product.

108 In support of her view, the learned trial Judge referred to the judicial analyses of related expressions, including the term 'the product' in a series of cases about whether an activity or series of activities was part of a taxpayer's 'mining operations' for the purposes of income tax deductions and sales tax exemptions.

109 Having determined the meaning of the term 'production process', the learned trial Judge then considered the purpose of the expression as an exclusionary criterion within the definition of 'service' in s 44B of the Act. In doing so, she noted that Part IIIA was introduced into the Act as a result of the Competition Principles Agreement and the recommendations of the Hilmer Report. Her Honour concluded (at 217, [46]) that:
 
 The purpose of the exclusion was, it seems, to permit appropriate utilisation of certain infrastructure by third parties and, at the same time, protect the viability of investments made by those who had invested in, for example, the processes of production.

110 In light of this conclusion, the learned trial Judge dismissed an argument that in order for the proposed service to come within the exemption it had to comprise the entire relevant production process and not just one part of it, such as the railway line, on the ground that such an interpretation of 'production process' would defeat the purpose of the exclusion.

111 As to the concept of 'use of' her Honour held (at [51]) that: (emphasis in original)
 
 To use a production process, then, is, in some way to employ, apply or exploit a process directed to production. Most commonly, a user makes use of a production process to create the product or products which the process of production is designed to create. That is not, however, the only sense in which a user can be said to engage in 'the use of a production process'. Someone may use a production process by incorporating it into another process or operation. To use a production process may not only involve incorporating it into a larger operation; it is also possible to 'use a production process' by using (employing, applying, exploiting) part of that process. That is, the use of a production process extends, in my view, not merely to the use of the whole process but also to the use of any operation (or step or procedure) that is integral (and perhaps essential or non-subsidiary) to that process as a whole. In this case the use of the railway is integral and essential to the highly integrated series of operations that constitute Hamersley's production process.

112 The learned trial Judge found on the evidence adduced by Hamersley that by virtue of the highly integrated nature of Hamersley's operations in the Pilbara, Hamersley operated its railway line not simply for transporting ore from mine to port but also as a necessary component of an integrated set of operations which constituted a production process: at 220, [55].

113 In reaching her ultimate conclusion the learned trial Judge made a number of important observations and factual findings. In considering the object of Hamersley's use of the railway line, the learned trial Judge observed (at 215, [39]):
 
 What is the relevance, if any, of the operational ends of Hamersley's use of its railway line? The respondents submitted that Hamersley's own use of its railway line is irrelevant, because that use forms no part of the service sought by them. That submission is, it seems to me, accurate to a limited extent only. Thus, I accept that the ultimate issue is the correct characterisation of the service (or use of the railway line) sought by Robe. I do not accept, however, that the operational ends that Hamersley meets by its use of the railway line are immaterial. Those ends, or the uses to which Hamersley puts its use of the line, are relevant, in my view, to the question whether the service Robe seeks is or involves the use of a production process.

114 Her Honour then went on to set out the following central facts about Hamersley's production process (at 216, [40]):
 
 I have already set out the facts concerning Hamersley's operations in the Pilbara in some detail because, in my view, the outcome of this case necessarily turns on them. In summary, the central facts are the following. 
 
 (1) Hamersley's railway line carries locomotives, consists and like vehicles between Hamersley's mines and the port at Dampier; 
 (2) Ore of differing grades, composition and quantities is carried in the consists that run along the line; 
 (3) The grades, composition and quantities of ore carried in the consists (from each mine to the port) are pre-determined by the [Batch Planning Team] in accordance with a 'recipe' that the [Batch Planning Team] formulates for making a particular batch of export product; 
 (4) The consists carrying the ore are run over the line in a planned sequence as part of making up the recipe for a particular batch and as part of blending and stockpiling operations; 
 (5) (Save for Yandicoogina) by virtue of the batch system Hamersley's mines operate as if each were a pit within a larger mine; 
 (6) Although not blended with ore from other mines, ore from Yandicoogina is subject to essentially the same process. (The respondents did not submit that ore from Yandicoogina was subject to a relevantly different production process.); 
 (7) Each step in the production process, including the use of the railway line for the carriage of ore in accordance with a recipe for a batch of product, is part of a highly integrated operation designed to make the export product; and 
 (8) The export product is brought into being at the port at Dampier after all blending and stockpiling operations are complete.

115 Her Honour then concluded (at [41]):
 
 Hamersley's use of its railway line (and associated infrastructure) is, it seems to me, one in a series of operations that result in the creation of its export product. (Nothing turns in this analysis on the fact that Robe seeks access to a part of the length of the railway line and not to the whole of the length of the line.) By the use of its railway line (and associated infrastructure) it does not merely convey ore by rail from mine to port, it makes up the recipe that it has formulated for the creation of a particular batch of its product. The making-up of a recipe for a batch of product depends on the line being made available (by Hamersley) for Hamersley's use. That is the effect of the undisputed evidence. It follows from this that Hamersley's use of its railway line is an integral (indeed, essential) operation in Hamersley's production process. That is, by virtue of the operations carried on by Hamersley in the Pilbara, Hamersley's use of the railway line is an operation upon which other operations necessarily depend for the creation of its export product. (In this connection, I emphasise that I am not concerned with the application of the exemption from the exclusion; rather, I am concerned with the operation of paragraph (f) of the exclusion.)

116 I make the following observations on the approach taken in Hamersley . First, the learned trial Judge carefully considered the question before her, and analysed in detail the various terms used in Part IIIA. There was a detailed consideration of the purpose of Part IIIA and of the exclusion in question. The different conclusion I have reached, and where I find Hamersley to be 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong', is in the approach taken to defining 'the use of a production process'.

117 Secondly, I can see no objection to interpreting a composite phrase by reference to the dictionary definitions of one or more of the words within that composite phrase. Everything will depend upon the context and subject matter of the composite phrase. Of course, the context is the master not the dictionary definitions of single words, particularly where one has a phrase involving a number of individual elements combining to introduce into legislation a single concept. However, approaching the expression 'production process' as merely the combination of the dictionary definitions of the individual words 'production' and 'process' has its dangers, and in itself may not yield the correct interpretation of the expression in Part IIIA of the Act.

118 I do not disagree with her Honour's use of the definitions of 'production' and 'process' as a starting point to the sympathetic understanding of the operation of the relevant provisions. However, as a composite phrase, in my view the emphasis is on a process of production, being a production process which in itself makes or creates one thing into another, not being so much a series of operations covering relevantly in Hamersley , mine to port operations. If one focuses, as her Honour does, on the 'series of operations' concept, then one readily moves to the conclusion in Hamersley that the 'production process' includes the entire operation from mine to port.

119 I do not think this is warranted as a matter of the most ordinary and natural meaning of the term, particularly when dealing with the composite term 'production process'. By looking at the overall series of operations one diverts attention away from the very thing to which access is sought in the Access Application (the railway line and associated infrastructure), and the function it has to perform. The railway line in itself is not designed to make or create anything. Further, with or without the 'batch system', iron ore could be carried over the rail line, and whether or not the 'batch system' was employed does not affect the character of the railway line itself. The 'batch system' was merely a management tool in the efficient carriage of iron ore over the railway line, albeit from Hamersley's point of view, an important one.

120 Thirdly, the concept of marketable commodity (of which I will discuss later) is not found in the dictionary references made in Hamersley . This concept arises out of the tax cases her Honour refers to such as Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 12 ATR 429 at 440 per Lush J (with whom Kaye J agreed); at 444 per Brooking J.

121 In my view, I see no warrant to introduce such a concept into the definition of 'service' or the phrase 'use of production process' in the context of Part IIIA. Whilst the learned trial Judge in Hamersley was acutely aware of the limited assistance to be afforded by those cases she relied upon, in my view the purposes of the statutory regimes are so dissimilar that there is no warrant to introduce the concept of 'marketable commodity' into the meaning to be given to a 'production process'. In addition, by introducing the concept of 'marketable commodity', as these proceedings attest, introduces an even greater uncertainty into the operation of Part IIIA. It also detracts, in my view, from the main enquiry, which is to define what is a production process. In looking at the most natural and ordinary meaning of the words found in the exclusion in para (f), one is not directed to an enquiry as to what is a 'marketable commodity', which has taken prominence in these proceedings.

122 Fourthly, her Honour recognised that the concept of 'use of' a production process most commonly imparts the notion of a user making use of a production process to create the product or products which the process of production is designed to create. In my view, this is the very concept that ought be incorporated into the phrase 'use of a production process'. It fits well within the most natural and ordinary meaning to be given to the term 'a production process', and by employing that concept one does not necessarily exclude the whole rail line from the possibility of consideration for declaration under Part IIIA. In view of the specific inclusion of a railway line as a service, the interpretation of 'use of a product in process' given in Hamersley is not appropriate. It has the potential to exclude infrastructure that would normally be expected to be considered under Part IIIA for access, and does not assist in promoting the purposes of Part IIIA.

123 Fifthly, in my view the learned trial Judge focused not upon the phrase 'use of a production process' but the concept of 'involving the use of a production process'. The critical question was whether the 'service' in respect of which Robe sought access was or constituted the use of a production process. The exclusion does not extend to something which merely 'involves' the use of a production process. The learned trial Judge's approach in any given circumstance may not lead to any different conclusion, but when considering the 'highly integrated operation' from mine to port as in Hamersley , approaching the matter as 'involving' the use of a production process, did lead, in my view to an erroneous conclusion. It diverted attention away from the service the subject of the Access Application and from a proper characterisation of the railway line itself.

124 Finally, I agree with the principle in the Hamersley decision that in determining whether the 'production process' exclusion is applicable, the court must consider 'the actual operation of the activities in question, considered as a whole. The question of characterisation is, in this sense, one of fact and degree' (at 213, [48]). As I have indicated, however, the use of the railway line as part of its operations, even if essential to Hamersley's operations, does not mean that the railway line has the character of being 'a production process'. The use of the railway line itself was to convey iron ore by rail from mine to port by whatever management tool was appropriate to employ, and did not of itself constitute the use of a production process.

125 In light of the above, with respect to the learned trial Judge, I have come to the conclusion that the decision in Hamersley is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong', and I should not follow it in these proceedings.

126 Fortescue contended that Hamersley was plainly distinguishable on its facts for three principal reasons. First, it was submitted that the above rail/below rail distinction found to be irrelevant in Hamersley was relevant on the facts in these proceedings because the Mt Newman JV and the Goldsworthy JV own the facilities which provide the two below rail services to which Fortescue seeks access, whilst BHPBIO provides to Mt Newman JV, Goldsworthy JV and the Yandi JV above rail services to which Fortescue does not seek access.

127 Secondly, it was submitted that the production process as relied upon by BHPBIO in these proceedings is relevantly different from that found by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley , and was not the 'highly integrated operation' therein described.

128 Thirdly, it was submitted that, whilst the learned trial Judge in Hamersley found there was no 'marketable commodity' produced by Hamersley before the export product which it produced at Dampier, and concluded for that reason that Hamersley's production process included the railing of the ore between Hamersley's mines and Dampier, in these proceedings there are marketable iron ore products produced at the mines serviced by the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Railway Lines prior to rail transportation to Port Hedland, and so the relevant production process is complete prior to railing the ore.

129 Accepting the approach of the learned trial Judge in Hamersley , I do not consider that a different result would have been reached in Hamersley had the three alleged distinguishing features been present in that case.

130 In relation to the first feature, there is nothing in her Honour's reasoning that would lead to the conclusion that she would have reached a different conclusion if joint venture parties (as providers) owned the facilities which would have provided the below rail services to which Robe sought access. The essential question the learned trial Judge determined was whether access was being sought to the use of a production process. On her Honour's reasoning, as detailed above, the exception in para (f) would apply irrespective of the ownership of the facilities, and irrespective of the distinction sought to be made by Fortescue here of the above rail/below rail services.

131 As to the second feature, upon the facts as I have found them in relation to the operations of BHPBIO, I can see no material difference in the operations of Hamersley found by her Honour. In particular, BHPBIO's operations in these proceedings effectively consist of carrying iron ore over the railway line in a planned sequence as part of making up 'the recipe' for the iron ore eventually blended and stockpiled, to adapt the words of her Honour. In essence, the findings I have made in relation to BHPBIO operations indicate no material difference to the elements relied upon by her Honour in Hamersley at [40].

132 I now turn to the question of when the 'marketable commodity' is produced. It is necessary for me to consider in some detail the context in which 'marketable commodity' was used by her Honour. There is some dispute between the parties as to the meaning of the expression 'marketable commodity' used by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley . Expert evidence was led by Fortescue in support of its position, but in light of the following analysis, nothing turns on such evidence.

133 BHPBIO submitted that the marketable commodity to which the learned trial Judge referred was Hamersley's finished product, or 'export product'. The inquiry, it was submitted, was focused on the products that were produced by Hamersley for sale to end-user customers, and the series of operations undertaken by Hamersley to produce those products. BHPBIO submitted that the interpretation did not involve or invite a hypothetical inquiry into whether a commodity capable of being sold was 'produced' at an earlier point in time: the case involved an inquiry into the actual operations undertaken, and the actual products created, or manufactured, for sale to end users by Hamersley.

134 Fortescue, on the other hand, contended that the term 'marketable commodity' in Hamersley referred to a product that is capable of being sold rather than one which is actually sold. In its submission, whether a product is capable of being sold depends upon whether there are actual or potential transactions for that product. The potential for transactions will exist if the transaction costs associated with the separate provision of goods or services at the two layers cannot be such that vertical integration is inevitable.

135 In my mind, it is difficult to accept Fortescue's submissions on this point. In the learned trial Judge's discussion of the meaning of 'process', she referred to the Macquarie Dictionary, which defined 'process' as 'a systematic series of actions directed to some end' (at 213, [32]). Her Honour also referred to the definition of 'process' in the Oxford Dictionary, which referred to a series of actions carried on 'in a definite manner, and leading to the accomplishment of some result'.

136 Having regard to the definitions of the individual terms that make up the composite phrase 'production process', it seems to me that the 'marketable commodity' to which the learned trial Judge referred was the finished product, or export product, that Hamersley sells (at 213, [34]):
 
 Hamersley's production process in the Pilbara extends, on this view, from its commencement of mining operations at the mines to the completion of the product that it sells, namely, export product. There was no evidence to show that Hamersley produces a marketable commodity at an earlier stage.

137 Fortescue argued that the final sentence implies that, had there been evidence to show that Hamersley produced a marketable commodity at an earlier stage, the learned trial Judge may have reached the conclusion that the production process finished once that marketable commodity was produced, such as before the ore is railed to the port. However, this does not detract from the learned trial Judge's focus on the product that Hamersley 'sells'. Her focus is on the end product that Hamersley's production process is directed to producing, and indeed does produce. Accordingly, the main focus for me in this case must be the commodities that are sought to be produced by BHPBIO.

138 Even if I am wrong on this point, and accept the submission that the term 'marketable commodity' refers to no more than a product for which there is a potential or actual market, it is still necessary for me to assess whether the production process used by BHPBIO produces the actual marketable commodities at the port. Whilst it may be, as Fortescue submited, that a marketable commodity is produced by BHPBIO at a stage before railing the ore to the port and therefore before the use of either the Mt Newman or Goldsworthy Railway Lines, BHPBIO also produces marketable commodities, not only capable of being sold but that are in fact sold, at the port. Accordingly, where a marketable commodity is produced by BHPBIO at the port, all of the integrated series of operations by which that marketable commodity is produced will constitute the production process under the Hamersley Construction.

139 It is instructive to analyse the application of the Hamersley Construction to the evidence in this case to determine whether the third distinguishing feature relied upon would have produced a different result in the Hamersley case. The issue requires an analysis of whether the railway facilities to which Fortescue seeks access are an integral part of the series of operations by which any (or all) of BHPBIO's marketable commodities are created or manufactured.

140 The output of BHPBIO's production process is currently six bulk iron ore products that are offered for sale to steel makers, primarily on the export market. The iron ore products are sold as the ore is loaded onto ships at Port Hedland. The iron ore products have consistent and specific chemical and physical properties. Those properties are determined by BHPBIO, having regard to BHPBIO's perception of what is acceptable to its customers, and having regard to BHPBIO's perception of the optimal manner of using its available mineral resources. The process by which BHPBIO produces the six finished iron ore products for export at Port Hedland involves an integrated series of operations as has been described above.

141 However, the process by which BHPBIO produces each of its six bulk iron ore products differ to some extent. Despite this, BHPBIO submitted that it has only one overall production process for the purposes of producing all of its iron ore products. In the alternative, BHPBIO submitted that it conducts more than one production process to the extent that the operations by which the different products are produced differ. For the purposes of applying Hamersley , I do not accept BHPBIO's first submission that it has only one overall production process for all its products. However, I do accept its alternative submission. Hamersley requires an analysis of the process by which a marketable commodity is produced and each of BHPBIO's exported iron ore products clearly constitutes a marketable commodity whether on the definition contended by Fortescue or BHPBIO. To the extent that the process by which each marketable commodity is produced differs, the use of the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Services in that process will also differ. Therefore, applying Hamersley , there would be more than one production process, but still from mine to port and involving the use of the railway line.

142 Fortescue further submitted that BHPBIO produces iron ore which is a marketable commodity prior to its transportation on either the Mt Newman or the Goldsworthy Railway Lines by reason of a number of joint venture transactions. The facts establish that iron ore is sold between different joint ventures at the various mine sites. In particular, the evidence shows the transfer of ownership of ores mined from Jimblebar, W4 and Mining Area C. These joint venture transactions at the mine sites are legitimate commercial transactions and evidence a market for ROM ore at the Newman mining area. Therefore the ROM ore is a marketable commodity (applying the definition contended for by Fortescue) produced without the use of the rail lines. Fortescue submitted that, therefore, the use of the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Rail Lines are used after the end of a production process.

143 Whilst I accept that a marketable commodity (within the meaning contended for by Fortescue) is produced in these instances at the mines, the evidence establishes that after ownership of these ores is transferred at the mine, the relevant ores continue to undergo further processing. The further processing is directed to the production of finished bulk iron ore products by BHPBIO to be loaded onto ships at Port Hedland for export. Fortescue did not dispute that through its operations at the port BHPBIO seeks to make, in relation to some ore, a more refined and valuable product. However, Fortescue submitted that these port operations, under which ore from some of the mines is further crushed, screened and blended and ore from other mines is blended and screened are separate production processes to those undertaken at each of the mines.

144 Applying Hamersley , I do not accept this submission. The extent to which the ROM ore undergoes further development in order to produce some other marketable commodity of different physical or chemical constitution, in this case NHGL and NHGF, necessarily means that the production process for NHGL and NHGF, which commences at the mine, does not finish until the finished product is produced at the port.

145 Fortescue also submitted that, in respect of at least two of the iron ore products produced by BHPBIO (Yandi Fines and MAC Fines), finished products are produced at the mine without the use of the rail line as a proportion of these products are loaded as DSO without undergoing further processing at the port after railing. I do not accept the contention that a particular service must solely be used as part of a production process according to the principles adopted in Hamersley . Accordingly, accepting that a proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines products are finished at the mines, and accepting Fortescue's submission that the production process in relation to that proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines ends at the mine, it does not necessarily follow that the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Railway Lines are not a part of BHPBIO's production process used to create BHPBIO's other finished products.

146 The evidence clearly shows that all six of BHPBIO's final export products, apart from the small proportion of Yandi Fines and MAC Fines loaded as DSO, are produced at the port, after transportation on the relevant rail facilities. Accordingly, in relation to all of BHPBIO's products (or 'marketable commodities') on the Hamersley Construction the production process extends from the commencement of mining operations at the mines and ends at the port, when that final product is created.

147 Therefore, in light of the above, there is no basis to distinguish the ratio decidendi in Hamersley to the facts pertaining to these proceedings.

150 Putting aside the Hamersley decision, in my view the question before the Court can be resolved by the following analysis.

151 BHPBIO uses the rail line in its operations, and schedules trains which run on the track as part of BHPBIO's overall production of iron ore. One can conclude that, by virtue of the operations carried on by BHPBIO, its use of the railway line is an activity upon which other operations necessarily depend for the creation of its export product. Fortescue, by gaining access, may well interfere with BHPBIO's operations and scheduling of trains, but this will be a matter to be assessed at a later part of the statutory investigation under Part IIIA. The fact that access to the relevant service sought by Fortescue may impact upon, or be a part of, BHPBIO's operations does not mean that access to the rail lines and associated infrastructure and systems is access to the 'use of a production process'.

152 A production process is the creation or making of a product or the transforming of one thing into another. To use a production process is to employ, apply or exploit a process for this purpose. This most natural and ordinary meaning can be seen from the use of the definitions of 'production', 'process' and 'use' in the Oxford English Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary, which may be used as a first point of reference. However, as I have discussed previously, the relevant expression is a composite term and must be read in the context of the definition, Part IIIA and the Act as a whole.

154 Apart from the decision in Hamersley , BHPBIO relied upon the case of Hematite Petroleum Pty Ltd v Victoria [1983] HCA 23 ; (1982) 151 CLR 599 (' Pipeline Tax Case') in the consideration of the question of what is encompassed by the concept of production process. The question in that case was whether the Pipelines (Fees) Act 1981 (Vic) purported to impose a duty of excise, contrary to s 90 of the Constitution , and accordingly was invalid. By majority (Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ, Gibbs CJ and Wilson dissenting), the High Court so held.

162 The evidence of Mr Ergas and Professor Rey was primarily concerned with the meaning 'from an economic perspective' to be given to the term 'production process' as used in s 44B of the Act. Having formulated a proposed economic test, they both provided an opinion of the facts and matters that would be relevant in determining whether the Mt Newman and Goldsworthy Services constitute a 'production process' within the meaning of those words as favoured by them. The evidence of Mr Houston was primarily directed to the meaning 'from an economic perspective' of the words 'marketable commodity' as used by the learned trial Judge in Hamersley and he similarly arrived at a proposed test. He then provided his opinion of the facts and matters that would be relevant in determining whether the various stages of BHPBIO's iron ore operations are economically separable in accordance with his test.

163 BHPBIO submitted that as the words used in s 44B of the TPA, in particular the term 'production process', are words of ordinary meaning, expert evidence was not required for their understanding. Therefore, BHPBIO submitted, the economic evidence cannot affect the construction of ordinary words in a statute.

164 It was further submitted that the economic evidence had to be relevant to some issue in the proceeding. It was stressed that whilst there may be some debate in relation to how the definition of 'service' applies to the facts in the case, it was certainly not a matter for the economists. It was merely a matter of argument, one in which it is clearly inappropriate for the economists to engage.

177 Fortescue relied upon evidence to support the distinction between an 'above rail service' and a 'below rail service' and sought to attack the reliability of the evidence led by BHPBIO as to the integrated nature of the production process and upon the issue of marketable commodity. I have not found it necessary to rehearse in these reasons this evidence or attack because of the approach I have taken to the construction of the phrase 'use of a production process'. To the extent I have found as a fact and detailed within these reasons the operations of BHPBIO, such have been determined objectively by reference to the operations actually employed by BHPBIO and not by reference to BHPBIO's own subjective views or characterisations, nor by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of any witness called on behalf of BHPBIO. None of the matters raised by Fortescue would otherwise detract from the essential elements of the production process as relied upon by BHPBIO nor would lead to distinguishing the ratio decidendi in Hamersley. It may well be that the submissions made and evidence relied upon by Fortescue will be relevant at a later stage in the processes to be undertaken under Part IIIA, but these considerations do not impact upon the Court's function in these proceedings.

178 In the Victorian Proceeding, I will order that the application of BHPBIO dated 24 December 2004 be dismissed. In the Western Australian Proceeding, I will declare that the bulk iron ore rail track transportation services provided by the Goldsworthy rail facility, as defined in Part 5.1 of the Fortescue's Access Application filed under s 44F(1) of the Act and dated 11 June 2004, is a service within the meaning of s 44B of the Act. The matter of the question of costs will be adjourned to a date to be fixed.

 I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy eight (178) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice MIDDLETON.

<tocase>Helvering v Gregory (1934) 69 F (2d) 809</tocase>
<text>94 Nevertheless, context is important. The significance of context was articulated well by Learned Hand J, first in Helvering v Gregory (1934) 69 F (2d) 809 at 810: 
 
 It is quite true...that as the articulation of a statute increases, the room for interpretation must contract; but the meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear, and which all collectively create. 

And also in Cabell v Markham (1945) 148 F (2d) 737 at 739:
 
 ...of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing: be it a statute, a contract or anything else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.</text>

<text>96 I should also mention two other matters which are relevant to my deliberation. First, one should be mindful of the well-recognised limit to the use to be made of dictionary definitions of words. In House of Peace Pty Ltd v Bankstown City Council [2000] NSWCA 44 ; (2000) 48 NSWLR 498 at 505, [28] , Mason P (with whom Stein and Gyles JJ agreed) observed, in relation to the role of a dictionary meaning of a word in the task of statutory interpretation, that:

<text>92 In Mills v Meeking [1990] HCA 6 ; (1989) 169 CLR 214 at 235 Dawson J clearly explains this principle, stating:
 
 However, if the literal meaning of a provision is to be modified by reference to the purposes of the Act, the modification must be precisely identifiable as that which is necessary to effectuate those purposes and it must be consistent with the wording otherwise adopted by the draftsman.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/14.html</AustLII>
<text>90 In Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 14 ; (2004) 218 CLR 273 the High Court restated a number of the key principles of statutory interpretation. In doing so, the Court cited with approval (at 280, [11]) the following extract from the judgment of the High Court in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2 ; (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408 (footnotes omitted):
 
 Moreover, the modern approach to statutory interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses "context" in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended to remedy. Instances of general words in a statute being so constrained by their context are numerous. In particular, as McHugh JA pointed out in Isherwood v Butler Pollnow Pty Ltd , if the apparently plain words of a provision are read in the light of the mischief which the statute was designed to overcome and of the objects of the legislation they may wear a very different appearance. Further, inconvenience or improbability of result may assist the court in preferring to the literal meaning an alternative construction which, by the steps identified above, is reasonable open and more closely conforms to the legislative intent.

91 Furthermore, s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) requires that a construction which promotes the purpose or object underlying the Act is to be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object. This is so even if the meaning of the words, interpreted in the context of the rest of the Act, is clear. When the purpose or object is brought into account, an alternative interpretation of the words may become apparent. However, I accept that if the words of a legislative provision are capable of only one construction, taking into account the purpose and context of the provision, then a court cannot ignore them and substitute a different construction because the court considers it somehow furthers the object of the legislation.</text>

 ...in applying a purposive construction, "the function of the court remains one of construction and not legislation".

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1263.html</AustLII>
<text>98 I accept that I should not depart from the ratio decidendi of the Hamersley decision unless I am satisfied it is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong': see Nezovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 (' Nezovic ') at 206, [52]; Marr v Australian Telecommunications Corp (1991) 34 FCR 82; Upperedge v Bailey (1994) 13 ACSR 541 at 543; Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. It would not be sufficient for a judge to merely reach one view, which he or she may prefer over that of an earlier decision, and upon that basis not follow the strong persuasive authority that has already pronounced on the same legislative provision. Before a judge refuses to follow an earlier decision regarding the construction of the same legislative provision he or she must come to the view the earlier decision is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong'.

99 Justice French in Nezovic noted that the rule that one judge of the same or co-ordinate jurisdiction should follow another has greater significance in the area of statutory construction. His Honour said (at 206, [52]): 
 
 The judgment of Hely J in Tuncok is a carefully considered and recent judgment on the same issue as is before me in the present proceedings. Unless I was satisfied that his Honour was plainly wrong, I would not be justified in departing from the ratio of his decision on that point. In that respect I refer to what I said in Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 757. Judicial comity does not merely advance mutual politeness between judges of the same or co-ordinate jurisdictions. It supports the authority of the courts and confidence in the law by the value it places upon consistency in judicial decision-making and mutual respect between judges. Where questions of law and in particular statutory construction are concerned, the view that a judge who has taken one view of the law or a statute is "clearly wrong" is not lightly to be adopted having regard to the choices that so often confront the courts particularly in the area of statutory construction.</text>

<tocase>Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289</tocase>

<tocase>Rail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 517</tocase>
<text>84 The Full Court confirmed the distinction between 'above rail' (transportation) and 'below rail' (infrastructure) services in its decision in Rail Access Corporation v New South Wales Minerals Council Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 517 (' Rail Access Case '). The Rail Access Case concerned the question of whether the NSW Rail Access Corporation provided a 'government coal-carrying service' within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 (Cth) which could therefore not be a 'service' within the meaning of Part IIIA of the Act. Rail Access Corporation did not carry coal itself or offer the service of carrying coal, but it owned the railway line which Freight Rail Corporation used to carry coal and provided a below rail service to third parties seeking to run trains to transport coal on its tracks and related infrastructure.

85 In considering the definition of 'service' in s 44B, the Full Court held, at 524:
 
 The definition of "service" in s 44B of the Act makes clear that a service is something separate and distinct from a facility. It may, however, consist merely of the use of a facility. The definition of "service" distinguishes between the use of an infrastructure facility, such as a road or railway line, and the handling or transporting of things, such as goods or people, by the use of a road or railway line. The fact that one service provider, such as Freight Rail Corporation, is using the railway line infrastructure facility made available to it by Rail Access Corporation for the purposes of carrying coal by rail does not mean Rail Access Corporation is carrying on, or is the provider of, a service of carrying coal by rail. There is a clear distinction, enshrined in the Transport Administration Act and confirmed by the NSW Rail Access Regime, between the service provided by Rail Access Corporation and the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation. Freight Rail Corporation provides the service of transporting coal. Rail Access Corporation provides to Freight Rail Corporation the different service of making available the infrastructure facility which is necessary to enable Freight Rail Corporation to provide the transportation service. The respondent is seeking access to the service provided by Rail Access Corporation, not the service provided by Freight Rail Corporation.

86 The Full Court concluded that the provider of a rail network or permanent way provides a different service to an entity that provides the service of carrying or transporting the coal using the rail network.</text>

<tocase>Re Australian Union of Students (1997) 147 ALR 458</tocase>
<text>37 Part IIIA of the Act is to be interpreted as part of an economic statute designed to address economic activity. This does not mean that each and every word or expression found in Part IIIA of the Act is to be interpreted as an economic word or expression, just that the economic context of Part IIIA of the Act provides the setting within which to interpret words and expressions. The importance of the economic context was recognised by the Australian Competition Tribunal ('the Tribunal') in Re Australian Union of Students (1997) 147 ALR 458 at 462:
 
 Part IIIA is based on the notion that competition, efficiency and public interest are increased by overriding the exclusive rights of the owners of "monopoly" facilities to determine the terms and conditions on which they will supply their services.

165 The Council, however, submitted that the economic evidence was admissible in order to provide context to the task of interpreting Part IIIA of the Act. It submitted that since Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1989) 67 CLR 77, the courts have approached the Act as an economic statute designed to address economic activity. It was submitted that, critically, the courts have understood that the character of the Act as an economic statute must be taken into account in construing the words of the Act and, in this regard, economic theory and writings may be considered: see Boral Besser Masonry Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 5 ; (2003) 215 CLR 374 (' Boral Besser ') at 454, [247] per McHugh J. Like the High Court, the Tribunal recognised the importance of economic concepts in the consideration and understanding of the purpose of Part IIIA: see Re Australian Union of Students (1997) 147 ALR 458 at 462-463.</text>

<tocase>Re Michael ; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511</tocase>
<text>168 The general rule of statutory interpretation is that words used in a statute are given their most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances. Consistent with a purposive approach to the interpretation of the expression 'use of a production process', the court would be entitled to receive expert economic evidence to assist in the interpretation of that phrase if it had a technical or specialised meaning: see, e.g. Agfa at 401; Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289 at 297-8; Re Michael ; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 (' Re Michael ') at 543-544, [107]. Whether the words of a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning or a technical or specialised meaning is a question of law for the court: see Agfa at 396-398.

173 In Re Michael, Parker J (with whom Malcolm CJ and Anderson J agreed) discussed the relevance of economic expert evidence in informing the court of the specialised usage of particular words or phrases. Importantly, his Honour continued (at 544, [107]):
 
 Further, the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and, in particular, of the regulation of essential infrastructure, so that the policy and objectives of the Act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities. In addition, the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the Act and Code can be more readily understood.

174 In Visa International Service Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300, Tamberlin J made the following observation in relation to Re Michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence (at 439, [665]):
 
 The emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised.</text>

It is therefore not permissible to receive the views of witnesses, expert or lay, as to their preferred interpretation or to explain how the words of a statute would be expected to be applied to the circumstances of the case: Royal Insurance Australia Ltd v Government Insurance Office (NSW) [1994] 1 VR 123 at 133-4. Such evidence is nothing more than submission and argument and indeed an attempt to usurp the judicial function.

170 Accordingly, each of the tests proposed by the experts, and the application of the facts of this case, is irrelevant. I therefore accept BHPBIO's submission and reject the expert evidence to the extent that it is directed to the meaning to be given by the Court to the term 'production process'.

171 However, BHPBIO also submitted that the economic evidence is not relevant to any other issue in the proceeding. BHPBIO submitted that the evidence cannot assist the court in understanding the purposes of the legislation or the 'production process' exclusion. It was contended that to the extent that Professor Rey gave evidence about the purpose of Part IIIA generally, his observations are derived from extrinsic materials available to the Court, which do not require expert explanation.</text>

<tocase>Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/146.html</AustLII>
<text>38 In order to understand the economic theory underpinning Part IIIA of the Act, it is useful to consider its origins and purpose. The Full Court recently set out the background and context to Part IIIA in its decision in Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 146 (' Sydney Airport') , to which I will briefly return.

39 Part IIIA of the Act was introduced by the Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 (Cth) and had its genesis in the recommendations of the report entitled 'National Competition Policy Report by the Independent Committee of Inquiry, August 1993' by F Hilmer, M Rayner &amp; G Taperell. The report is more commonly known as the 'Hilmer Report'. Of course, one must recall that not all the recommendations of the Hilmer Report were adopted by Parliament. Nevertheless, it provides an insight into the purpose of the access regime in Part IIIA of the Act.

40 The Hilmer Report made a number of recommendations as to how concerns over access to 'essential facilities' could be dealt with under a national competition policy. The Hilmer Report recognised that in some markets the introduction of effective competition requires competitors to have access to facilities which exhibit natural monopoly characteristics and therefore cannot be duplicated economically.

44 The concept is not complex, as the Full Court in Sydney Airport said (at [36]):
 
 ...the background material does not reveal any complexity in the concepts behind what the access regime is directed to: essential facilities that cannot be duplicated economically (to use the words of the Hilmer Report) and services being provided by means of significant infrastructure facilities in circumstances set out in cl 6(1)(a)-(d) of the Competition Principles Agreement of 11 April 1995... 

Further, as the Full Court went on to say (at [37]):
 
 ...in none of the various materials was there any discussion of any complexity of notion or anticipated complexity of assessment involved in respect of the consideration contained in cl 6(1)(b) of the Competition Principles Agreement: that access to the service is necessary in order to permit effective competition in a downstream or upstream market. Rather, the essential notion to be derived from the Hilmer Report, the outline of legislation issued by COAG, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Competition Principles Agreement is that it is necessary for the fact of access (in its ordinary meaning) to be relevant to effective competition in another market (upstream or downstream).

45 The Hilmer Report itself makes it clear that notions of access and the circumstances in which access rights should arise are separate from whether in any given situation vertical integration exists. Vertical integration in itself cannot be a basis to exclude the operation of Part IIIA. The notion of shared access within the context of a vertically integrated operation is part of the scenario the Hilmer Report was seeking to address. That is, it is the very prevention of a vertically integrated organisation using its control over access to an essential facility to limit effective competition in dependent markets that is a key activity that the access regime seeks to deal. Hence, it was envisaged certainly by the Hilmer Report that the access regime would be applied to require vertically integrated organisations to provide access to services provided over some of their infrastructure.

46 This is not to say, however, that the Hilmer Report envisaged the automatic and indifferent application of the access regime to vertically integrated operations. In this regard, the Hilmer Report cautioned that a legislative right of access to private property and facilities may have undesirable economic consequences, and that competition policy needed to strike a balance between protecting private property and freedom of contract on the one hand, and requiring access to essential facilities on the other (at p 242):
 
 As a general rule, the law imposes no duty on one firm to do business with another. The efficient operation of a market economy relies on the general freedom of an owner of property and/or supplier of services to choose when and with whom to conduct business dealings and on what terms and conditions. This is an important and fundamental principle based on notions of private property and freedom to contract, and one not to be disturbed lightly. 

And at p 248:
 
 The Committee is conscious of the need to carefully limit the circumstances in which one business is required by law to make its facilities available to another. Failure to provide appropriate protection to the owners of such facilities has the potential to undermine incentives for investment.

53 However, it is to be recalled that even if there be an opportunity for access to a particular service should the exclusion in para (f) not apply, Part IIIA provides for a two-stage process as described by the Full Court in Sydney Airport (see [25]-[34]). Even a declaration of the service under the first part of the process does not necessarily ensure access to the service, but rather confers a right on the access-seeker to negotiate with the provider. Whether access occurs and on what terms will involve questions of 'an economic, commercial and social character' (see Sydney Airport at [35]). It seems to me this is an important consideration in determining the interpretation to be given to the exclusion in para (f). Protection of the viability of certain investments is not just found in the interpretation to be given to the exclusion in para (f), but is also found in the two-stage process that is to be undertaken even if the exclusion is inapplicable.

54 BHPBIO's business in the Pilbara consists of three main operations:
 
 (a) A mining operation which extracts the iron ore from the various mines;
 (b) A rail operation that transports ores from the different mines to port facilities at Port Hedland, using either, or a combination of, the Mt Newman Railway Line and Goldsworthy Railway Line and associated facilities; and
 (c) A port operation at Port Hedland (with infrastructure located at both Nelson Point and Finucane Island) at which ore is crushed and screened (in some instances), blended in stockpiles (in most instances), reclaimed and loaded onto ships (where in some instances further blending occurs) for transportation to customers.

55 BHPBIO uses a Continuous Stockpile Management System ('CSMS') as a production and grade control system that involves its mining, rail and port operations. The CSMS is part of the production and grade control system that is involved in BHPBIO's operations from mine to ship loading at the port. It assists in the development of the daily blend for each mining area, and determines the required sequence of trains necessary for BHPBIO's operation and requirements for finished iron ore products. Essentially the CSMS was intended to be a more efficient and effective form of the 'batch system' which was employed prior to the introduction of the CSMS.

148 The Hilmer Report itself does not set the specific boundaries in which the access regime would apply. Other than giving guidance as to the aims and potential parameters of the access regime, the Hilmer Report (and for that matter other extrinsic material referred to in the Sydney Airport case) provides little guidance as to the ambit of the exclusion found in para (f) of the definition of 'service'. In view of the general application of the access regime this is not surprising. Part IIIA is not referable to any particular industry. This is to be contrasted with similar regimes in other jurisdictions, such as New Zealand, where access regimes are introduced in the context of a particular industry, such as the telecommunications, gas or electricity industries. Similarly, Part XIC of the Act specifically deals with a telecommunications access regime. However, Part IIIA applies generally to a wide range of potential industries and circumstances. Therefore, the court must apply Part IIIA to a range of services and this will be done on a case by case basis.

149 It can be accepted that the use of rail infrastructure generally is the type of essential facility infrastructure which was intended to be included within the scope of Part IIIA. The services provided by a railway line would be obvious candidates for declaration given that they would often be prohibitively expensive to duplicate. The width of exception in para (f) must balance the desire to preserve the viability of investment in production facilities whilst at the same time preserving the aims of the access regime. Whether or not access to a particular railway line should be declared would need to be determined following the two-stage process set out in Part IIIA and referred to in the Sydney Airport case. So much is clear from the legislative scheme and by reference to the Hilmer Report to the extent adopted by Parliament.</text>

<text>98 I accept that I should not depart from the ratio decidendi of the Hamersley decision unless I am satisfied it is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong': see Nezovic v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2003] FCA 1263 ; (2003) 133 FCR 190 (' Nezovic ') at 206, [52]; Marr v Australian Telecommunications Corp (1991) 34 FCR 82; Upperedge v Bailey (1994) 13 ACSR 541 at 543; Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 55 FCR 233 at 255. It would not be sufficient for a judge to merely reach one view, which he or she may prefer over that of an earlier decision, and upon that basis not follow the strong persuasive authority that has already pronounced on the same legislative provision. Before a judge refuses to follow an earlier decision regarding the construction of the same legislative provision he or she must come to the view the earlier decision is 'clearly wrong' or 'plainly wrong'.</text>
