<tocase>Re; Mario Silverio Macchia Ex parte; Mario Silverio Macchia v Charles Philippe Louis Nilant as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Mario Silverio Macchia [1997] FCA 246</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1997/246.html</AustLII>
<text>25 The applicant's application was heard on 8 April 1997 and was opposed by the respondent. On 11 April 1997 Lee J delivered his judgment ( Re; Mario Silverio Macchia Ex parte; Mario Silverio Macchia v Charles Philippe Louis Nilant as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Mario Silverio Macchia [1997] FCA 246) and ordered that:
 
 '...the period of bankruptcy limited by s149 of the Act be abridged from 3 years to 1 year and 1 month from the date of filing of the statement of affairs. As a result, [the applicant] will be discharged from bankruptcy as at 22 February 1995.'

26 Lee J accepted that the date on which the statement of affairs had been filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy was 21 January 1994.

27 The applicant was legally represented before Lee J. The case advanced by the applicant was that the applicant had provided to the trustee a statement of his affairs in July 1991 as part of the proposed Pt X composition, and in September 1991 as part of the debtor's petition, and that the respondent was therefore not prejudiced by the applicant's failure to provide a statement of affairs earlier than, on the applicant's version, 6 April 1993, or on the respondent's version, shortly before 21 January 1994. The applicant submitted that as the respondent had access to the July 1991 and September 1991 statements of affairs, he had sufficient information about the applicant's affairs to conduct the bankruptcy. No case was advanced on behalf of the applicant that the applicant had provided the trustee with a statement of affairs on 7 October 1991.

28 In his reasons, after reviewing the evidence, Lee J said at 4-5:
 
 'On 6 October 1992 the Trustee advised Mr Macchia that he had not received a copy of Mr Macchia's statement of affairs as required by s 54 of the Act and informed Mr Macchia that pursuant to s 149 of the Act discharge from bankruptcy would not occur until 3 years from the filing of the statement of affairs. 
 
 On 9 October 1992 Mr Macchia replied to the Trustee that he had provided a statement of affairs on 16 July 1991 and again on 4 September 1991 and asked that the Trustee obtain a copy of the statements from the Registrar as soon as possible. 
 
 In a letter to the Trustee dated 23 October 1992 Mr Macchia again referred to his debtor's petition and the statement of affairs and that he had "lodged" with that petition... 
 
 By letter dated 28 October 1992 the Trustee informed Mr Macchia that he had been made bankrupt on a creditor's petition...and not on the debtor's petition with which the statement of affairs had been supplied. The Trustee asked Mr Macchia to file a statement of affairs. 
 
 On 3 December 1993 the Trustee applied to the Court for an order that Mr Macchia be committed for contempt pursuant to sub-s 54(3) of the Act for failure to file a statement of affairs as required by paragraph 54(1)(a). Before the application came on for hearing Mr Macchia filed a statement of affairs on 21 January 1994. Pursuant to s149 of the Act discharge from bankruptcy will occur on 22 January 1997 if the period of bankruptcy were not extended by an objection lodged by the Trustee.'

29 At 9-10 of his reasons, Lee J said:
 
 'In the present case the bankrupt has been the author of his own misfortune in that he continued to maintain, in the face of the Trustee's advice that he was obliged to file a further statement of affairs, that he had complied with the requirements of the Act when he presented his own petition and by declining to comply with the Trustee's request that he do so.'

30 Apart from the statement of affairs, which was filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy on 21 January 1994, Lee J referred in his judgment only to two statements of affairs, made by the applicant, namely, the statement of affairs of 16 July 1991 (provided as part of the attempts to reach a composition under Pt X) , and the statement of affairs of 4 September 1991 (provided with the debtor's petition). His Honour made the orders abridging the time relying upon the provisions of s 33(1)(c) of the Act and the case of Re; Rohde (1993) 42 FCR 149 ('Rohde') .

31 Before Lee J the applicant argued that there had in fact been compliance with s 54(1) of the Act in that the statement of affairs had been filed with the Registrar in Bankruptcy as part of the debtor's petition on 4 September 1991, being a date within 14 days of the sequestration order, albeit before the date of the sequestration order. Lee J rejected that argument, holding that on a proper construction, s 54(1) of the Act required that the statement of affairs be filed within 14 days after the date of the making of the sequestration order, and not 14 days before the making of that order.

32 The respondent appealed the decision of Lee J and the appeal was upheld by the Full Court. The decision of the Full Court is reported as Nilant v Macchia (1997) 78 FCR 419. The Full Court overruled the decision of Rohde and held that the Court does not have power pursuant to s 33(1)(c) of the Act to abridge the time limited by s 149(3) of the Act.

34 It is plain from the judgment that the reference to 'one or other of the statement of affairs' is a reference to the two statements of affairs which had been referred to by Lee J in his judgment, namely, the statement of affairs which was prepared and filed as part of the Pt X proceedings and the second statement of affairs which accompanied the debtor's petition presented to the Registrar in Bankruptcy by the applicant.

35 There is no reference in either of the decisions of Lee J or the Full Court referred to above, to any claim or argument being advanced by the applicant on the basis that he made and supplied the respondent with a statement of affairs on 7 October 1991.

36 After the Full Court decision in 1997, the applicant in March 1999 applied for and was given leave to file a further amended application. The application was heard on 12 October 1999. At that time, there were in existence further objections by the respondent to the discharge of the applicant from bankruptcy. The hearing was adjourned part heard. However, on 17 December 1999, and before the hearing of the application was resumed the respondent withdrew his objections to the applicant's discharge from bankruptcy. The withdrawal of the objections meant that the applicant was discharged from bankruptcy pursuant to s 149 of the Act with effect from 22 January 1997 - that being three years from the filing of the statement of affairs with the Registrar in Bankruptcy. However, as at 17 December 1999, the applicant had been treated as an undischarged bankrupt for almost three years beyond the date on which the bankruptcy terminated under the Act.

37 Thus, by the time the application came on for the resumed hearing before Lee J on 23 February 2000 the applicant had been discharged from his bankruptcy. At the resumed hearing the applicant further amended the application. In that amended application, the applicant relied upon s 30(1)(b) and s 306 of the Act to seek a declaration that a 'proceeding' under the Act had not been invalidated by a formal defect or irregularity. The 'proceeding' which the applicant sought to be validated was the statement of affairs prepared in relation to the Pt X proceedings, or alternatively the statement of affairs dated 4 September 1991 accompanying the debtor's petition. The declaration he sought was that either of those statements of affairs be deemed to have been filed in the office of the Registrar in Bankruptcy on 17 September 1991.</text>

<tocase>Macchia v Nilant [2000] FCA 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/353.html</AustLII>
<text>38 On 27 March 2000, Lee J, granting relief under s 306(1) of the Act, ordered that the statement of affairs signed by the applicant on 4 September 1991 and presented to the Registrar in Bankruptcy on that date be deemed to have been made out and filed in the office of the Registrar in Bankruptcy, and a copy furnished to the trustee of the sequestrated estate of the applicant, on 16 September 1991 in compliance with the requirements of s 54(1) of the Act ( Macchia v Nilant [2000] FCA 353).</text>

<tocase>Nilant v Macchia [2000] FCA 1528 ; (2000) 104 FCR 238</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1528.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The respondent appealed that decision and the Full Court upheld the appeal finding that s 306 of the Act does not confer a power to treat a failure to comply with s 54(1) of the Act as compliance with it. The case is reported as Nilant v Macchia [2000] FCA 1528 ; (2000) 104 FCR 238.

40 The Full Court held that relief under s 306(1) of the Act was not available because the bankrupt had not made any attempt to comply with s 54(1) of the Act which required a filing of a statement of affairs after the date of sequestration.

41 Weinberg J said at 249, at [54]:
 
 'In the present case, the plain fact is that the appellant did not file a statement of affairs in accordance with the requirements of s 54(1) of the Act, but assumed erroneously that a statement of affairs previously filed with the Registrar on a debtor's petition would serve that purpose. There was no act on the part of the appellant which could be described as even purported compliance with the requirements of the section. His failure to comply with the requirements of s 54(1) does not give rise to a "proceeding under this Act" which would be invalidated but for the fact that any defect or irregularity is merely formal. In these circumstances, there is no proceeding capable of being brought before the Court on an objection concerning that invalidity.' (original emphasis)

42 At 251, at [64] and [65], Weinberg J said:
 
 'Where there has been an attempt to comply with the obligations of s 54(1) , whether within the fourteen day period specified, or on some other occasion thereafter, it is entirely apt to speak of that attempt being a "proceeding under this Act", and being capable of being regarded by the Court as "not invalidated" by reason of any formal defect or error. Section 306(1) in such a case is to permit the period of bankruptcy to run from the date of purported compliance with the Act, or perhaps some later date. It follows that the bankruptcy will not continue for an unconscionably long period merely because of some relatively minor failure on the part of the bankrupt to comply with the strict requirements of s 54(1). 
 
 Regrettably, it seems to me that s 306(1) cannot be invoked in the circumstances of the present case, where no step whatever has been taken by the bankrupt in purported compliance with the requirements of s 54(1). There is simply no "proceeding" or "step" taken in the course of the bankruptcy which is capable of being the subject of an order that it not be invalidated.'

43 Carr J at 246, at [36] said:
 
 '3. In the present matter, where there has been no attempt to comply with s 54 until (at the earliest) 6 April 1993, there was no proceeding which by the operation of s 306 could escape invalidity due to formal defect or irregularity.'

44 There was no case made by the applicant at the hearing of the second application before Lee J in 2000, nor at the hearing before the Full Court in 2000, that the applicant had made a statement of affairs dated 7 October 1991 and delivered it to the respondent. Indeed, the finding by the Full Court that the applicant made no attempt to make a statement of affairs until 6 April 1993 at the earliest, is at the heart of the Full Court's decision. It was a crucial finding on which the whole decision rested.

45 In addition to the legal proceedings referred to above, the applicant also took proceedings against the respondent for compensation in respect of the manner in which the respondent had carried out his duties as trustee of the applicant's bankrupt estate. These proceedings included an action against the respondent in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for the negligent conduct of the applicant's bankruptcy administration.

46 On 20 May 2002, the applicant and the respondent entered into a deed of release in respect of mutual claims made by each of the parties against each other in the various proceedings then pending. Pursuant to the deed of release the respondent agreed to pay the applicant a settlement sum. Clause 4 of the deed of release is particularly relevant to these proceedings. Clause 4 provides as follows:
 
 ' 4. BAR TO PROCEEDINGS 
 
 
 4.1 Party not to take action 
 
 
 
 Subject to clause 4.3, a Party must not at any time take or continue any action, suit or proceeding, or make any claim or demand of any nature against the other Party relating to, or arising out of, or connection with, the Dispute or Macchia's bankruptcy except that the terms of this Document do not affect, limit or restrict: 
 
 
 
 (a) any issue between the Parties in relation to the estate of Macchia's mother; 
 
 
 
 (b) the existing rights of any party to receive a distribution or benefit from that estate; or 
 
 
 
 (c) any right of Nilant or Macchia's creditors in relation to any property or income of Macchia which Macchia failed to disclose to Nilant and which would have been vested in Nilant as his trustee in bankruptcy or been available to his creditors.'

47 The respondent sought the summary dismissal or a permanent stay of the claims made in the substantive application by relying on the inherent power of the Court to prevent an abuse of process, alternatively upon O 20 r 2(1) of the Rules. The gravamen of the respondent's argument is that by his current application the applicant is attempting to relitigate a matter which has already been litigated.</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>55 The respondent submitted further that the applicant is precluded from bringing the claims made in the application by reason of the principles enunciated in the case of Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 ('Anshun') . The respondent submitted that the claims now made properly belonged to the earlier proceedings. This is because the claims are based on a factual allegation, namely, that the applicant made and provided to the respondent a statement of affairs on 7 October 1991, which was of crucial significance to the issues in contention in the previous litigation, and that it was open to the applicant to have advanced such a claim because there was evidence available to be presented. It was further submitted that the legal representatives of the applicant elected not to advance any case founded on the existence of a statement of affairs allegedly made on 7 October 1991 in any of the previous proceedings. It was, therefore, unreasonable for the applicant not to have made the factual allegation now made in this application, as part of any one or more of the previous proceedings.

56 The respondent also submitted that the claims made in the substantive application rendered the application an abuse of process.

57 Further, the respondent submitted that the applicant's claim made by reference to s 33A of the Act in par 4 of the substantive application, was, in any event, misconceived. It was submitted that although s 33A of the Act was enacted after the conclusion of the proceedings in 2000, the section did not assist the applicant. This was because s 33A(3) of the Act contains a restriction which precludes the Court from making an order which would result in the discharge of the bankruptcy occurring at a date earlier than 30 days after the making of the Court order. It was not possible, therefore, for the applicant to obtain an order which would treat the alleged 7 October 1991 statement of affairs as having been filed in October 1991, because this would have the effect of backdating the discharge to a date in October 1994. Relief under s 33A of the Act was, therefore, only open to a bankrupt who had not yet been discharged from bankruptcy.

66 As to the respondent's arguments that these proceedings are res judicata, the claims made in these proceedings are founded upon a different allegation of fact which formed the basis for the claims which were considered by Lee J and the Full Court in 1997 and 2000. For this reason, I would also not summarily dismiss the application on the basis that the matter is res judicata ( Anshun at 597). No argument was addressed to me that there was an issue estoppel in relation to the date of the first attempt made to comply with s 54 of the Act after the date of sequestration.

67 The Anshun estoppel principles have recently been considered by the Full Court of this Court in the case of Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2005) 146 FCR 10 ('Wong') . The Full Court said that the doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel are founded on the broad rules of public policy that a person ought not to be vexed twice for one and the same cause and that it was in the public interest that there be an end to litigation. At 17-18, at [36]-[37] the Full Court went on to say:
 
 '...It would be an abuse of process to allow parties to litigate repeatedly matters that have been finally determined by the Court. Also, quite apart from any psychological detriment that might flow from an individual having to undertake litigation of the same issue a second time, the State has an interest in ensuring that, once an issue has been determined according to law and all rights of appeal have been exhausted, that should be an end of the matter. The resources of the community ought not to be expended in the litigation, more than once, of the same issue. 
 
 A plea in bar may be raised in respect of an issue, not only if the Court in the earlier proceeding was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but also in relation to every issue that properly belonged to the subject of the earlier litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier litigation: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 598 and 602. Anshun estoppel arises where the issue, now raised for the first time, properly belonged to the subject of the earlier proceeding but, by negligence, omission or accident, was not raised in earlier proceeding. In essence, where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceedings between the parties: Anshun at 602.'</text>

<tocase>Dumitrasku v Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [2003] FMCA 477</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2003/477.html</AustLII>
<text>62 In relation to his claim at par 4 in the application, the applicant relied upon the case of Dumitrasku v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2003] FMCA 477 ('Dumitrasku') in support of his submission that the Court has power to make an order under s 33A of the Act which would have the effect of backdating the date of his discharge to a date in October 1994. The applicant also relied on the authority of Baral v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1999] FCA 77 ('Baral') in support of that proposition.

91 I accept the submission by the counsel for the respondent that the Dumitrasku case does not assist the applicant. In that case, the applicant was still a bankrupt at the time that he brought the application. The applicant's primary ground of relief was founded on s 306 of the Act. The applicant sought declarations that a statement of affairs had been filed with the Official Receiver in compliance with s 54 of the Act on 3 October 2000; and that by the operation of s 149 of the Act he was discharged from bankruptcy on 4 October 2003. The Federal Magistrate granted the relief claimed pursuant to s 306 of the Act.

92 The Federal Magistrate also dealt obiter with the claim which the applicant had made in reliance on s 33A of the Act. He said that he would have been prepared to grant relief under that section had he been required to do so. However, what is significant in that case was that the applicant was still bankrupt at the time of the making and hearing of the application. Here the applicant had been discharged from bankruptcy for more than eight years when the application was made. It is plain from the terms of s 33A(3) of the Act that relief under s 33A of the Act would not be available to a person who has already been discharged from bankruptcy at the time of making an application for that relief. Accordingly, the case of Dumitrasku relied on by the applicant has no application to this issue. Further, the Baral case relied upon by the applicant deals with annulment of bankruptcy and has no application to the construction of s 33A of the Act.</text>

<tocase>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/1.html</AustLII>
<text>64 It is well established that the Court's power to grant summary relief should be exercised with great caution. In Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 Dixon J observed:
 
 '...A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination...'

65 I would not dismiss the applicant's application on the grounds that the claims made in the current application are within the ambit of cl 4 of the deed of release. It is arguable that on a proper construction of that clause, the applicant's substantive application relates to the applicant's right to receive a distribution or benefit from his mother's estate, and that the application is, therefore, not covered by the bar in the deed of release.</text>

<text>67 The Anshun estoppel principles have recently been considered by the Full Court of this Court in the case of Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 242 ; (2005) 146 FCR 10 ('Wong') . The Full Court said that the doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel are founded on the broad rules of public policy that a person ought not to be vexed twice for one and the same cause and that it was in the public interest that there be an end to litigation. At 17-18, at [36]-[37] the Full Court went on to say:
 
 '...It would be an abuse of process to allow parties to litigate repeatedly matters that have been finally determined by the Court. Also, quite apart from any psychological detriment that might flow from an individual having to undertake litigation of the same issue a second time, the State has an interest in ensuring that, once an issue has been determined according to law and all rights of appeal have been exhausted, that should be an end of the matter. The resources of the community ought not to be expended in the litigation, more than once, of the same issue. 
 
 A plea in bar may be raised in respect of an issue, not only if the Court in the earlier proceeding was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but also in relation to every issue that properly belonged to the subject of the earlier litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier litigation: Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 598 and 602. Anshun estoppel arises where the issue, now raised for the first time, properly belonged to the subject of the earlier proceeding but, by negligence, omission or accident, was not raised in earlier proceeding. In essence, where the issue was so relevant to the subject matter of the earlier action that it would be unreasonable not to have raised it at that time, it is an abuse of process to endeavour to raise that issue for the first time in a subsequent proceedings between the parties: Anshun at 602.'

69 What will be sufficient to constitute 'special circumstances' is not fixed and may involve a range of factors that bear upon the general discretion of the Court where justice requires the non-application of the general principle ( Wong at 18).

70 I do not accept the applicant's argument that the Anshun estoppel principles do not apply because the claims made in his current application would not conflict with any existing judgment as both of the decisions of Lee J in his favour were overturned on appeal. In my view, it is irrelevant to the operation of Anshun estoppel principles that the two first instance decisions were overturned on appeal. It does not follow that there are now no judgments with which the claims would conflict. Both of the Full Court decisions, and indeed, the decisions of Lee J, are based on findings of fact that during the period from the date of the sequestration order to 6 April 1993 at the earliest, there was no attempt made by the applicant to file a statement of affairs. As previously mentioned, this finding is central to the Full Court's decision in 2000. The claims made by the applicant in the application are directed at asking the Court to make factual findings which are directly contrary to the factual findings made in the previous proceedings, and to grant relief (previously denied) on the basis of that conflicting finding in the fact.

71 In my view, this is a circumstance where the Anshun estoppel principles are capable of applying.</text>

 "An attempt to litigate in the Court a dispute or issue which has been resolved in earlier litigation in another court or tribunal may constitute an abuse of process even though the earlier proceeding does not give rise to res judicata or issue estoppel; see Culture International v Scoles (1991) 32 FCR 275 at 279 and Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393-394. Whether it does depends on the facts of the particular case." '

84 French J went on to say at 21 at [69]:
 
 'The public interest considerations underlying the power of courts to stay or dismiss the proceedings for abuse of process extend to preventing the waste judicial resources and their use for purposes unrelated to the determination of genuine disputes. They include the necessity of maintaining confidence in, and respect for, the authority of the courts Sea Culture International v Scoles (1991) 32 FCR 275 (at 279 French J); Djaigween v Douglas (1994) 48 FCR 535 (at 54 Carr J). 
 
 The power to strike out a statement of claim or to dismiss an application as an abuse of process is to be exercised sparingly and upon an examination of the relevant circumstances of the particular case before the Court...'</text>

<tocase>State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd (1997) Aust Torts Reports 81-423</tocase>
<text>85 French J approved the following observations of Giles CJ in the case of State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Stenhouse Ltd (1997) Aust Torts Reports 81-423 at 64,089:
 
 '...whether proceedings are, or an aspect of proceedings is, an abuse of process because a party seeks to relitigate [an] issue already decided depends very much on the particular circumstances. The guiding considerations are oppression and unfairness to the other party to the litigation and concern for the integrity of the system of administration of justice...'

86 French J also adopted as matters relevant to the determination of whether there was an abuse, a non exhaustive list set out by Giles CJ in that case. These factors were:
 
 '(a) the importance of the issue in and to the earlier proceedings, including whether it is an evidentiary issue or an ultimate issue; 
 
 
 
 (b) the opportunity available and taken to full litigate the issue; 
 
 (c) the terms and finality of the finding as to the issue; 
 
 
 
 (d) the identity between the relevant issues in the two proceedings; 
 
 (e) any plea of fresh evidence, from and including the nature and significance of the evidence and the reason why it was not part of the earlier proceedings; all part of - 
 
 (f) the extent of the oppression and unfairness to the other party if the issue is relitigated and the impact of the relitigation upon the principle of finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice; and 
 
 (g) an overall balancing of justice to the alleged abuser against the matters supportive of abuse of process'.

87 I would, on the application of these factors, have found that the applicant's substantive application was an abuse of process.

88 Firstly, the factual issue as to the time at which the applicant first made a statement of his affairs for the purposes of the Act was of crucial importance in the earlier proceedings. Secondly, there was every opportunity available to the applicant to have advanced in the earlier proceedings a claim based on the factual assertion now made in the application. Thirdly, there are factual findings made in the earlier proceedings which are contrary to the factual position now being asserted in this application. As previously mentioned, the finding that no statement of affairs was made prior to 6 April 1993 at the earliest, was crucial to the Full Court's decision in 2000. Fourthly, the nature and the object of the relief claimed in the application, is substantially the same as in the earlier proceedings. Each of the earlier proceedings was concerned with the question of if, and when, the applicant had filed a statement of affairs under the Act. Fifthly, there is no plea by the applicant of fresh evidence, nor could there be such a plea. There was evidence available to the applicant and his legal advisers at the time of the hearing of the first application in 1997 before Lee J upon which the claims now made could have been advanced in the earlier proceedings. Sixthly, if the Court were now to make factual findings along the lines claimed in the current proceedings, the factual findings on which the courts acted and upon which decisions were made in the earlier proceedings would be undermined. This would have a tendency to adversely impact upon the finality of judicial determination and public confidence in the administration of justice. Further, the respondent has already been involved in four previous proceedings relating to the issue of the filing of the statement of affairs; and five years have elapsed since the Full Court decision in 2000.</text>

<text>90 I turn now to the respondent's argument that the applicant's claim in par 4 is, in any event, misconceived. It is also not necessary to decide this issue, but as the matter was argued and I will briefly set out the view to which I would have come. It is a well established principle that a court should not summarily dismiss an application on the basis that there is no reasonable cause of action unless it is clear that the case is bound to fail ( Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603). In my view, the applicant's claim is bound to fail.</text>
