<text>7 Another matter referred to by counsel was alluded to in the decision of the Federal Magistrate concerning the possible application of Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473 ( " S395/2002 v MIMA") . At page 3 of the Federal Magistrate's judgment in the present case, the Magistrate refers to a statement by in the RRT's decision which reads:
 
 'As noted in the country information cited above there is a history of violence between the Hindu and Muslim communities in India but the applicant's experience in dealing with this situation will, in the Tribunal's view, enable him on return to act with sufficient care as to avoid situations in which he would be likely to suffer violence.'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/131.html</AustLII>
<text>3 Two other matters were raised by counsel for the respondent. Neither of these issues was referred to by the appellant. The first issue raised was whether the decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 applied in the present circumstances. Having regard to the cases referred to by counsel for the respondent, including the decisions of Gray J in M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 (" M55 v MIMIA") and the decision of Jacobson J in NAZY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 744 ( "NAZY v MIMIA") , I am persuaded that in the present case the material in the file which was before the Department was incorporated in the Application for Review to the RRT.

6 Counsel has also referred me to the recent decision of the Full Court in a number of cases including SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 , which was handed down on 24 February 2006 after the decision of the Federal Magistrate in this matter. In my view, having looked at the reasons for judgment in that case, I am not persuaded that they vary the position in any way from the position taken in NAZY v MIMIA or in M55 v MIMIA . Accordingly, I do not consider that there is any basis for a contention that there has been a breach of s 424A.</text>
