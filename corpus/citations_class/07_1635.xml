<text>27 I am willing for present purposes to assume (I do not so find) that the language of the definition of 'work' in s 94(5) admits of some qualification of the usual broad meaning of the word 'work' (but see Re Crossland and Secretary Department of Family and Community Services [2004] AATA 864). However, I do not accept that the Act discloses an intention that a person with tertiary qualifications is to be regarded as a person with a continuing inability to work, and thus as a person entitled to taxpayer funded DSP, just because the person's impairment prevents him or her from undertaking professional or other high status employment. A person able to do work of a character undertaken by a very large number of Australian taxpayers (ie customer service, call-centre or light retail work) is not, in my view, a person with a continuing inability to work within the meaning of the Act.

28 I see no reason to conclude that the Tribunal erred in its understanding of the words 'any work' in s 94(2)(a) of the Act.

29 As mentioned above, the Tribunal identified the question of whether Mr Croker's bilateral hand discomfort and his somatoform disorder are separate conditions or otherwise merit separate impairment assessment as an essential question for its determination. It gave careful consideration to this question by reference to the expert evidence before it. It noted that there was no evidence that any past examination had revealed a basis for RSI as a medical condition suffered by Mr Croker. The Tribunal concluded that Mr Croker's 'RSI' was not a separate condition from his somatoform disorder. It concluded that the only diagnosis that could be assigned a rating under the Impairment Tables was Mr Croker's somatoform disorder. In this respect the Tribunal referred to [4] of the introduction to the Impairment Table which states:
 
 'A rating is only to be assigned after a comprehensive history and examination. For a rating to be assigned the condition must be a fully documented, diagnosed condition which has been investigated, treated and stabilised.'</text>

<tocase>Re Hamal and Secretary, Department of Social Security (1993) 30 ALD 517</tocase>
<text>25 Mr Croker's reference to work that is 'benign' appears to derive from an observation made by the Full Tribunal in Re Hamal and Secretary, Department of Social Security (1993) 30 ALD 517 when considering the application, in the circumstances of that case, of s 94(2) of the Act before it was amended to its present form. At [43] the Full Tribunal said:
 
 'When considering the issue of work in this context, the tribunal is of the view that it is the "normal" workplace against which a person's abilities are to be judged, not the workplace of the "benign employer".'

26 It appears that Mr Croker's real complaint is that the Tribunal gave consideration to types of employment that were not sufficiently intellectually challenging for him, or alternatively of an insufficient status, when it accepted evidence that he was capable of undertaking customer service, call-centre or light retail work where excessive or repetitive use of his hands would not be required. Mr Croker submitted:
 
 'I don't think there is any real benefit in doing repetitive customer services even for 30 hours a week to a state where, well, at the moment I would say I wouldn't be using any of my intellect at all in a position like that, your Honour. 
 
 ... 
 
 Well, in the retail meat industry, you know, I suppose when I was working and the amount of time that has elapsed today it would not put me in a better position. I would say I would virtually be stepping back into really a position where I was doing things which I knew caused me injuries and obviously there could be potential harm or psychological harm again and even if there is a psychological injury as well the potential there would be raised even further.'</text>
