<tocase>Bruce v Odhams Press, Limited [1936] 1 KB 697</tocase>
<text>The leading authority for that proposition is the judgment of Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press, Limited [1936] 1 KB 697. His Lordship described the difference between a statement of material facts and particulars in the following terms (at 711): 
 [A] radical distinction, and none the less so that in cases near the dividing line there is a penumbra where the two may and often do overlap, just as between night and day there is zone of doubt which we call dusk. 

 
His Lordship said (at 712) that a statement of the material facts is a statement of the facts necessary to constitute a complete cause of action. He said that "particulars" are not to be used in order to fill material gaps in a statement of claim. His Lordship said (at 712-713):
 
 The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading, imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant. Their function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial. Consequently in strictness particulars cannot cure a bad statement of claim. But in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between a "material fact" and a "particular" piece of information which it is reasonable to give the defendant in order to tell him the case he has to meet; hence in the nature of things there is often overlapping. And the practice of sometimes putting particulars into the statement of claim and sometimes delivering them afterwards either voluntarily, or upon request or order, without any reflection as to the true legal ground upon which they are to be given has become so common that it has tended to obscure the very real distinction between them.

Bruce v Odhams Press, Limited was a defamation case. The defendant company had published a newspaper article which referred to certain aeroplane smuggling exploits of "an Englishwoman". By her statement of claim, the plaintiff merely asserted that these words were meant and were understood to mean her. This was held to be failure to plead material facts. It was necessary for the plaintiff to plead extrinsic facts on which she would rely to link the words "an Englishwoman" to herself.

In H 1976 Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd , above, Northrop J, following Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press, Limited , rejected (at 187) an argument that the particulars to a paragraph of a statement of claim should be treated as a statement of material facts for the purposes of the Federal Court Rules .</text>

<text>The present case is not one of the Commonwealth officers' having induced Rotary or Mr Whittaker or both to decide to breach contracts giving rise to a secondary liability of the Commonwealth to the other contracting parties. Yet counsel for the applicants cited Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157 , a case of inducement of a breach of contract. If it is anything, the present case is one of direct interference by unlawful means with the performance by Rotary and Mr Whittaker of the respective contracts.</text>

<tocase>Lumley v Gye (1853) 2 El &amp; Bl 216 (118 ER 749)</tocase>
<text>There is, however, a more fundamental question which was also not raised on the hearing. This is whether the action lies for the benefit of Mr Whittaker and Rotary at all. The action for inducement of breach of contract does not lie for the benefit of the contract breaker. It lies only for the benefit of the other contracting party. Much of the debate on the hearing treated the claim as a species of inducement of breach of contract of the Lumley v Gye (1853) 2 El &amp; Bl 216 (118 ER 749) kind, yet this point was not raised. Is the position different when the claim is for direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means? It may well be. On the other hand, the argument is open that it is no different, and that the applicants' remedy includes a claim for their economic loss in the damages they seek to recover for some other tort, such as, false imprisonment.

In conclusion, the "Heads of Loss and Damage" document filed by the applicants on 24 April 2008 showed that the allegation is not that the supply contract was breached, but that additional costs were incurred by the applicants in connection with its performance. Again, on the hearing it seems to have been assumed by both counsel that the applicants' claim was that the Commonwealth, through its officers, had prevented performance of the contracts.

Paragraphs 8 and 9 will be struck out with leave to replead. The most careful consideration will need to be given as to what cause of action, if any, can properly be pleaded in their place. If claims are to be pursued for direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means, they must be separately pleaded in respect of each applicant and each of the three contracts.

<tocase>Luton v Lessels [2002] HCA 13 ; (2002) 210 CLR 333</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/13.html</AustLII>
<text>There is no substance in these attacks: see Luton v Lessels [2002] HCA 13 ; (2002) 210 CLR 333.

Mr Whittaker has previously taken these contentions to the stage of a special leave application before the High Court: see Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2004] HCATrans 252. Special leave was refused. Previously Mr Whittaker's judicial power argument was rejected by Drummond J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2000] FCA 1733 ; (2000) 106 FCR 105 and Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2002] FCA 1429. His taxation power argument was rejected by Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2002] FCA 1430. On appeal, the Full Court held that Luton v Lessels "foreclos[ed] any constitutional challenge" ( Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2003] FCAFC 114 at [4] ). As noted above, the High Court refused special leave to appeal. Further, an attempt to limit the scope of the operation of Luton v Lessels failed in Weekes and Child Support Registrar [2006] FLC p93-273 ; [2006] FamCA 598.

Mr Whittaker (in person with leave) submitted that Luton v Lessels does not constitute a binding precedent because the originating process on the High Court file in that case did not bear the seal of the High Court. The submission is devoid of merit. I also note that the deletion of para 1 in the further amended application was consistent with an abandonment of the submission. Torts in relation to tax file numbers paragraphs 28, 29 and 31

These paragraphs are as follows: Further or alternatively, prior to making the DPO on or about 6 December 2006, the First Respondent negligently or in breach of his duty of confidence to the First Applicant used the First Applicant's tax file number to identify the First Applicant for the purpose of making the DPO.
 Particulars 

 The First Respondent did not at any time make a request to the First Applicant to give the First Respondent a written statement of the First Applicant's tax file number under section 16B of the Child Support (Registration &amp; Collection) Act 1988 or otherwise. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a written statement of the First Applicant's tax file number. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a written statement of any kind authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the First Respondent with information about the First Applicant, including tax file numbers, being information that is in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a statement in writing that the First Applicant has a tax file number but does not know what it is and has not asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform the First Applicant of the First Applicant's tax file number and authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to tell the First Respondent the tax file number. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a statement in writing that the First Applicant has an application for a tax file number pending and authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to tell the First Respondent if a tax file number is issued to the First Applicant that number or if the application is refused that the application has been refused or if the application is withdrawn that the application has been withdrawn. The First Respondent did, without lawful basis, require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the First Respondent with information about the First Applicant, including the First Applicant's tax file number and/or, without lawful basis, accessed confidential or private information, including the First Applicant's tax file number, being information that was in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation. The First Respondent did, without the consent or authority of the First Applicant, obtain the First Applicant's tax file number, stored and maintained a record of the said tax file number and used the said tax file number in connection with the First Applicant's identity in breach of section 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and/or in breach of the Privacy At 1988. The First Applicant reserves the right to supplement or amend these particulars after discovery.
 As a result of the negligence or breach of duty of the First Respondent his servants or agents the First Applicant has suffered loss and damage.
 Particulars
 Particulars exceed 3 folios and are supplied separately. 

 
 30. . 

 Further, or alternatively, the First Respondent negligently or in breach of his duty of confidence to the First Applicant used the First Applicants' tax file number to identify the First Applicant for the purpose of administratively assessing the First Applicant's purported liability pursuant to Part V of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 namely the assessment made or determined on or shortly prior to December 2006 that the First Applicant was a person who has a child support liability.
 Particulars 

 The First Respondent did not at any time make a request to the First Applicant to give the First Respondent a written statement of the First Applicant's tax file number under section 150B of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 . The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a written statement of the First Applicant's tax file number. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a written statement of any kind authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the First Respondent with information about the First Applicant, including tax file numbers, being information that is in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a statement in writing that the First Applicant has a tax file number but does not know what it is and has asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform the First Applicant of the First Applicant's tax file number and authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to tell the First Respondent the tax file number. The First Applicant did not at any time give to the First Respondent a statement in writing that the First Applicant has an application for a tax file number pending and authorising the Commissioner of Taxation to tell the First Respondent if a tax file number is issued to the First Applicant that number or if the application is refused that the application has been refused or if the application is withdrawn that the application has been withdrawn. The First Respondent did, without lawful basis, require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the First Respondent with information about the First Applicant, including the First Applicant's tax file number and/or, without lawful basis, accessed confidential or private information, including the First Applicant's tax file number, being information that was in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation. The First Respondent did, without the permission or authority of the First Applicant, obtain the First Applicant's tax file number, store and maintain a record of the said tax file number and use the said tax file number in connection with the First Applicant's identity to determine the First Applicant's Child Support Income amount and the said assessment of child support liability.

Section 16B of the Collection Act, referred to in the ASC, provides that the Registrar may request, but not compel, a person who is a payer or payee in relation to a registrable maintenance liability to give the Registrar a written statement of the person's tax file number.</text>

<tocase>Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307</tocase>
<text>I discussed this question of the required state of mind of the inducer in a case of inducing breach of contract in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1995] FCA 1368 ; (1995) 58 FCR 26 ( Allstate ) at 43 (in a judgment with which Lockhart and Tamberlin JJ agreed). Malice, in the sense of spite or ill will, is not an element of that tort: Zhu v Treasurer of the State of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at [114] ; cf Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307 ( Mengel ) at 341-342.

A tort of interference with trade or business interests by unlawful means, as distinct from interference with contractual relations, has not yet been recognised by the High Court, although neither has it been rejected. In Mengel at 343 and Sanders v Snell [1998] HCA 64 ; (1998) 196 CLR 329 at [35] - [40] , it was referred to as an embryonic or emerging tort. For the purposes of the present motion, I proceed on the assumption that it forms part of Australian law.</text>

<tocase>OBG Ltd v Allan; Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 3); Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young [2008] 1 AC 1</tocase>
<text>Recently in OBG Ltd v Allan; Douglas v Hello! Ltd (No 3); Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young [2008] 1 AC 1 ( OBG ) the members of the House of Lords had occasion to consider in detail the elements of the torts of "inducing a breach of contract" and "interference with contractual relations by unlawful means". The former is a secondary liability, the primary liability being that of the contract breaker. The latter is a primary liability alone.

Because the matter was not debated before me, I simply refer the parties, especially the applicants, to the discussion of the elements of the tort of direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means in OBG . In particular, they will need to consider (a) the unlawful means element, and (b) the element of the required state of mind of the respondents in the case of that species of tortious conduct, as distinct from the required state of mind in the case of inducing a breach of contract.</text>

<tocase>Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd v Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (1987) 89 FLR 349</tocase>
<text>Admittedly, the two bases of liability to which I have referred have often not been distinguished. Direct physical prevention of contractual performance by unlawful means has been treated as a species of inducing a breach of contract. See, for example, Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd v Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (1987) 89 FLR 349 at 350-1. In Trindade, Cane and Lunney, The Law of Torts in Australia (4 th ed, OUP, 2007), the authors give as an example of the procurement of a breach of contract, a defendant's physically detaining a contracting party or depriving him of his tools, so that he cannot perform a contract with the plaintiff (at [6.6.2.2] p 307). See, too, John Murphy, Street on Torts (12 th ed, OUP, 2007) at 368-369; and The Laws of Australia (Lawbook Co., subscription service) 33 Torts at [8.1140].

It will be necessary for the pleading to be amended in order to conform, not with the notion of inducing or procuring a breach of contract, but with that of direct inference by unlawful means with the performance of a contract.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/64.html</AustLII>
<text>A tort of interference with trade or business interests by unlawful means, as distinct from interference with contractual relations, has not yet been recognised by the High Court, although neither has it been rejected. In Mengel at 343 and Sanders v Snell [1998] HCA 64 ; (1998) 196 CLR 329 at [35] - [40] , it was referred to as an embryonic or emerging tort. For the purposes of the present motion, I proceed on the assumption that it forms part of Australian law.

I do not understand the basis on which "interference with trade" is pleaded as distinct from a pleading of interference with contractual relations by unlawful means. If the tort is recognised, the unlawfulness concerned will be not just unauthorised conduct but prohibited conduct: see Sanders v Snell , above, at [35]-[36].

Counsel for Mr Whittaker puts the interference with trade case on two bases: an intentional interference with the business of the applicants, or an interference with their business by illegal means . The former seems to be nothing other than the claim of interference with contractual relations. As to the alternative, the illegal means identified is "the threat of an illegal act, namely what we have previously pleaded, or alternatively illegal false imprisonment, or alternatively trespass to goods." The "illegal means" must be pleaded with specificity. "What we have previously pleaded" is not good enough. As well, I do not understand how a threat of false imprisonment or a threat of trespass to goods, without more, could have interfered with the applicants' trade.

Unlike paras 8 and 9, para 10 does not state that it is based on "the premises" of paras 6 and 7. It seems to add no cause of action beyond that of interference with the performance of the three contracts. Unless "interference with trade" is intended to be different, and the difference is clearly articulated, it should not be repleaded.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1985/228.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents cite H 1976 Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd (1979) 30 ALR 181 ; 40 FLR 242 and Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 for the proposition that the material facts must be stated in the text of a pleading, not in "particulars".

The distinction between material facts and particulars was recognised by Fisher J in Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd, above (at 112 ff). His Honour described the paragraph of the statement of claim in question in that case as "merely a statement of a conclusion drawn from facts which are not in the statement of claim" (at 114). The paragraph pleaded that certain respondents had "made an arrangement or arrived at an understanding". The deficiency in that allegation was not cured by the giving of particulars of the individuals who had represented those respondents at a certain meeting, the date and place of the meeting, the identity of those present, and the effect of the arrangement or understanding.

It may be that the distinction between material facts and particulars is not insisted upon as strictly nowadays as it was a few decades ago. An advantage of maintaining the distinction is that it emphasises, for the benefit of both the parties and the Court, that the applicant's position is that it is the facts pleaded in the text of the statement of claim, no more and no less, that the applicant needs to prove in order to establish the asserted cause of action. So long as the distinction is understood and observed, there will not be the confusion that arises when either party, if and when it suits its own purposes, refers to the particulars as if they formed an undifferentiated part of the pleading.

The text of paras 6 and 7 is deficient. The expression "deprived him of his liberty" may mean "locked him in a room", "forcibly man-handled him into a room and stood guard at the doorway", "handcuffed him", "encircled him" and so on. The expression "restraining him" is subject to the same kind of criticism.</text>

The respondents make the following submission : A further reason to strike out the paragraphs is that they are premised upon reasoning that led to the original paragraph 7 of the Amended Application. The respondents contended that there should be summary dismissal of that part of the proceedings relating to ... this aspect of the case. The respondents' submissions in the summary judgment motion [which did not proceed to judgment] included the following: 
In any event, and more importantly, the underlying premise of the relief is misconceived and should be the subject of summary dismissal as having no reasonable prospect of success.
 
 
The relief is premised upon the view that s 8WB(1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) prevents the Registrar from exercising powers under ss 16C(1) of the Registration Act [a reference to the Collection Act] or s 150D(1) of the Assessment Act to require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the Registrar with information about people, including their tax file numbers, unless and until the person or persons concerned have first provided statements under ss 16B(4) or (5) and 150C(2) or (3) of those respective Acts.
 
 
The short answer is that s 8WB(1) of the Taxation Administration Act does not apply in connection with the Registrar exercising powers or performing functions under, or in relation to, the Assessment Act and the Registration Act : see s 8WB(1A)(b) of the Taxation Administration Act and s 202(ga) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth).
 
 
This argument or one materially identical was considered and rejected by Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2002] FCA 1430 at [4] .
 
 
It has not merit whatsoever and this part of the proceeding should be summarily dismissed under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act .

Section 16C(1) of the Collection Act and s 150D(1) of the Assessment Act empower the Registrar to require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the Registrar with information about people, including tax file numbers, being information that is in the possession of the Commissioner. In each case, information provided by the Commissioner to the Registrar may be used only for the purposes that are specified in s 16C(2) or 150D(2) as the case may be.

The general prohibition of s 8WB of the TA Act and the power given by the Assessment Act to the Registrar do not impinge on the specific powers given to the Registrar by s 16C of the Collection Act and s 150D of the Assessment Act.</text>

<text>Mr Whittaker has previously taken these contentions to the stage of a special leave application before the High Court: see Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2004] HCATrans 252. Special leave was refused. Previously Mr Whittaker's judicial power argument was rejected by Drummond J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2000] FCA 1733 ; (2000) 106 FCR 105 and Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2002] FCA 1429. His taxation power argument was rejected by Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2002] FCA 1430. On appeal, the Full Court held that Luton v Lessels "foreclos[ed] any constitutional challenge" ( Whittaker v Child Support Registrar [2003] FCAFC 114 at [4] ). As noted above, the High Court refused special leave to appeal. Further, an attempt to limit the scope of the operation of Luton v Lessels failed in Weekes and Child Support Registrar [2006] FLC p93-273 ; [2006] FamCA 598.</text>
