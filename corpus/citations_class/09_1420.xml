<tocase>Anasson v Phillips (unreported, Sup Ct, NSW, Young J, 4 March 1988)</tocase>
<text>Mr Kowalski asserts that the primary judge misapplied the law in Anasson v Phillips (unreported, Sup Ct, NSW, Young J, 4 March 1988) and Levinge v Director of Custodial Services, Department of Corrective Services (1987) 9 NSWLR 546. These cases are, Mr Kowalski submits, authorities for the proposition that, where statements made in affidavits are not replied to or contradicted by other evidence and the deponents of the affidavits are not cross-examined, those statements will be accepted by the Court.</text>

<tocase>Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/7.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Kowalski has not presented any proper basis for asserting the primary judge did not bring an unprejudiced mind to the appeal ( Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at [35] - [36]). Mr Kowalski's dissatisfaction with his Honour's reasons is not sufficient to establish bias or reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the primary judge ( Bienstein at [32]). As pointed out by Medicare, Mr Kowalski did not ask his Honour to disqualify himself before judgment was given. Mr Kowalski has not established any basis for such an allegation. None is apparent. Is there utility in the proceedings? What is Mr Kowalski's purpose in maintaining the proceedings?

Mr Kowalski clarified why, despite the fact that Medicare has stated clearly that it will take no steps to recover any money he received from Mitsubishi, thus depriving the proceedings of any apparent utility, he wishes to maintain the proceedings. He says that he wishes to have determined at law whether or not monies received by him from Mitsubishi were compensation under the HOSC Act. He says that it is relevant to other proceedings presently before the Courts that he is bringing against the Military Compensation Commission and against Mitsubishi. He says that in both of these proceedings, the nature of the payments made by Mitsubishi is in issue. He also says that he believes that his failure to challenge Medicare will prejudice his claim against the Military Compensation Commission.

There is no utility in the present proceeding. In effect, this case has no subject matter. An attempt by Mr Kowalski to maintain these proceedings in order to influence in some unspecified way other proceedings is an abuse of process and forms no basis for allowing this application for leave to appeal.

Other matters have been raised in Mr Kowalski's notice of appeal, with which I will deal, although they were not pressed in oral argument. Alleged failure on the part of the Tribunal to provide reasons

This ground seems to be based upon the fact that the Tribunal provided written reasons after the appeal was instituted in the Federal Court. The Tribunal did provide reasons for its decision and those reasons were considered by the primary judge. There is no suggestion in his Honour's reasons that the Tribunal's reasons were inadequate. There is no evidence before me to suggest that they were. Alleged failure correctly to apply the law regarding uncontradicted affidavit evidence</text>

<tocase>Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare [2009] AATA 427</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2009/427.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 23D of the HOSC Act confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal to review a decision by the Medicare CEO that a statement under ss 18 or 23A, or an amended statement under s 23B, is not substantially correct. The Tribunal found that none of the correspondence from Mr Kowalski to Medicare constituted a statement under s 18 ( Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare [2009] AATA 427 at [7] ). It found at [8] that it had no evidence before it that Medicare ever received a statement from Mr Kowalski under ss 18 or 23A, or an amended statement under s 23B, or that the Medicare CEO had made a decision of the kind referred to in s 23D(1). The Tribunal did not consider that there had been any reviewable decision by Medicare and dismissed Mr Kowalski's application.</text>

<tocase>Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare [2009] FCA 1072</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1072.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Kowalski instituted an appeal to the Federal Court from the decision of the Tribunal. The primary judge dismissed the appeal pursuant to a motion brought by the Medicare CEO for summary dismissal pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( the FCA Act ) on the ground that Mr Kowalski had no reasonable prospects of success ( Kowalski v Chief Executive Officer of Medicare [2009] FCA 1072).

The primary judge (at [13]) was of the view that the Tribunal's conclusion was correct. His Honour found that the Tribunal correctly concluded that the letters did not amount to statements of past benefits for the purposes of s 18(1) of the HOSC Act nor did they constitute or evidence a decision under s 23B of that Act. His Honour found that the Tribunal correctly concluded that the "decision" identified by Mr Kowalski by reference to the correspondence did not amount to or evidence a reviewable decision, that is, a decision reviewable by the Tribunal in accordance with the powers in ss 18, 23A and 23B of the HOSC Act. His Honour rejected the assertions that the Tribunal failed to provide adequate reasons and held that the Tribunal did not err in law in deciding that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain Mr Kowalski's application. His Honour dismissed the application and awarded indemnity costs.

There was a further matter. As his Honour noted at [1], the purpose of these proceedings, in a practical sense, was not apparent. Medicare had informed Mr Kowalski in writing that it did not intend to take any further action against him under the HOSC Act to recover any monies paid by Mitsubishi and had pointed out to him that the proceedings appeared to be entirely unnecessary. As his Honour said at [19], '[t] hat is self-evident '. Application for leave to appeal</text>

<tocase>Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (2009) 178 FCR 401</tocase>
<text>Mr Kowalski made an oral application to the primary judge for leave to appeal both the judgment and the costs order after his Honour made orders and delivered reasons in this matter. His Honour ordered that the notice be treated as an application for leave to appeal for the purposes of the Federal Court Rules and that the proceedings be referred to another judge of the Court. An order under s 31A is interlocutory ( Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (2009) 178 FCR 401 at [42]-[43] per Spender, Graham and Gilmour JJ ( Kowalski FCAFC ) approving Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCAFC 73 ; (2009) 176 FCR 268 at [101] per Rares J with whom Graham J agreed at [58]). Accordingly, Mr Kowalski needs leave to appeal the decision of the primary judge under s 24(1A) of the FCA Act.</text>

<tocase>Kowalski v Repatriation Commission (2009) 259 ALR 444</tocase>
<text>Mr Kowalski submits that the Court has no jurisdiction to award costs in this matter because the jurisdiction of the Court is enlivened by s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ( AAT Act ). That submission was made and answered in Kowalski v Repatriation Commission (2009) 259 ALR 444 at [24] [28] per Spender, Graham and Gilmour JJ. The Full Court pointed out that there is no question of the Court's power to award costs and that the submission is answered by s 43(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act which provides: 
 
 Subject to subsection (1A) and section 570 of the Fair Work Act 2009, the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court (including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction) other than proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded. 
 

 
No other Act has been identified which provides that costs should not be awarded in these proceedings.

The primary judge awarded costs against Mr Kowalski on an indemnity basis. I see no basis for any suggestion that his Honour's discretion in that regard miscarried.

Medicare seeks costs of this application on an indemnity basis. Medicare submits that it was capricious for Mr Kowalski to institute these proceedings in circumstances where he should have known that there was no reasonable prospect of success and where Medicare was not seeking to recover anything from him or seeking in any way to implement what he described as a reviewable decision.

Mr Kowalski was clearly on notice from the decision of the primary judge that his Honour was of the view that the proceedings had no utility. He had been warned by Medicare, when pointing out to him the futility of the proceedings commenced before the primary judge, that it would seek indemnity costs from his Honour. Mr Kowalski has persisted in this application for leave to appeal. There is no basis for his grounds of appeal. Medicare should be compensated for its costs of defending this application. Although the Court is generally more reluctant to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants, I consider that it is appropriate to order costs against Mr Kowalski on an indemnity basis in these circumstances.

<tocase>Twist v The Council of the Municipality of Randwick [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1976/58.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Kowalski says that the primary judge failed to allow him to make oral submissions before dismissing his appeal against the Tribunal decision. Mr Kowalski states that he did not have an opportunity to make oral submissions, contrary to Twist v The Council of the Municipality of Randwick [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106. He says that as a litigant in person, he should have been treated differently. Medicare contends that, at the directions hearing of 4 August 2009, both parties agreed to the primary judge hearing the appeal ' on the papers ' and that Mr Kowalski raised no objection to the absence of an oral hearing. Medicare says that Mr Kowalski only took exception to the course adopted by his Honour after judgment was handed down on 23 September 2009.

The transcript of the relevant directions hearing before the primary judge is in evidence. During the hearing, the following exchange took place: 
 
 His Honour: ....All right. Now, how do you want your appeal to proceed? 
 

 
 
 Mr Kowalski: Well, I want it to proceed on papers 
 

 
 
 His Honour: Okay, that's fine. What I'll do then is the following:... 
 

 
The primary judge then made directions, including for the filing of further affidavit evidence and written submissions by Mr Kowalski, taking into account Mr Kowalski's request for the time he required. His Honour then said:
 
 
 All right. 
 

 
 
 4. Direct notice of motion to be heard and determined on the papers. 
 5. Liberty to apply. 
 

 
 
 So after 19 August I will consider all the material that's before me and I'll give you a ruling 
 

 
Mr Kowalski responded: Thank you, your Honour .

Both Mr Kowalski and Medicare have referred to a number of decisions in which Mr Kowalski was a party and appeared for himself. It is apparent that, while Mr Kowalski is not legally represented and was not legally represented before the primary judge, he is not unfamiliar with court proceedings. To the extent that the question whether the parties would be content to have the primary judge deal with the matter ' on the papers ', his Honour was entitled to assume that Mr Kowalski understood what that meant. Mr Kowalski does not say that he questioned what that expression meant at the relevant time and, indeed, he used it himself. It is apparent to me after hearing Mr Kowalski present his application for leave to appeal that he is not reticent in making statements or asking questions if he feels the need to do so. In circumstances where the matter was raised clearly at the directions hearing, and that his Honour did not, on that occasion, fix the matter for an oral hearing, the course of conduct being addressed should have been apparent to Mr Kowalski.

I see no denial of procedural fairness or of natural justice in the primary judge proceeding to do what he told the parties he would do, that is, to decide the matter on the papers. It is clear from his Honour's reasons that he gave full consideration to the subject matter before him. There is no basis for Mr Kowalski's claim that he was denied natural justice or procedural fairness by the primary judge. Alleged bias or reasonable apprehension of bias</text>
