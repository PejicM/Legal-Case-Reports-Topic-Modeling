<tocase>Sovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd [1892] 2 QB 573</tocase>
<text>The leading English case of the composition of classes is Sovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd [1892] 2 QB 573 ( Sovereign Life ). In that case Bowen LJ said (at 583) that classes must be defined so as to prevent confiscation and injustice and that a class must be "confined to those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest". This approach has often been cited with approval.

I do not see why it is "impossible" for Kingsway and Assif SA "to consult" with all other holders of in-the-money options with a view to persuading them to vote against the Option Scheme on the ground that the consideration being offered for their options is inadequate because it is not calculated according to the Black-Scholes methodology (cf Sovereign Life , above). According to their contention, all holders of in-the-money options will be underpaid for the same reason: that they are denied the benefit of receiving any consideration for loss of the prospect of an increase in the value of the underlying shares and the corresponding prospective increase in the value of their options. All holders of in-the-money options have a "common interest" or "community of interest" in considering the merits of this contention.

For the above reasons I was not persuaded that the two classes of option holders proposed were inappropriate.

It will remain open to Kingsway and Assif SA (and others) to contend on the second court hearing that the Option Scheme should not be approved because it is unfair or oppressive to them. Share Scheme Deed Poll and Option Scheme Deed Poll</text>

<tocase>UDL Argos Engineering &amp; Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin [2001] HKCFA 54 ; [2001] 3 HKLRD 634</tocase>
<text>In UDL Argos Engineering &amp; Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin [2001] HKCFA 54 ; [2001] 3 HKLRD 634 Lord Millett (at [27]) emphasised that the test was based on similarity or dissimilarity of legal rights against the company, not on similarity or dissimilarity of interest derived otherwise than from such legal rights. His Lordship stated: 
 
 The question is whether the rights which are to be released or varied under the Scheme or the new rights which the Scheme gives in their place are so different that the Scheme must be treated as a compromise or arrangement with more than one class.</text>

<tocase>In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (2009) 73 ACSR 385</tocase>
<text>The court will not ordinarily order that a meeting be convened unless the scheme is of such a nature and cast in such terms that if it receives support from the statutory majority at the meeting, the court would be likely to approve it on the final hearing: F T Eastment &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Metal Roof Decking Supplies Pty Ltd (1977) 3 ACLR 69 at 72; Re Central Pacific Minerals NL [2002] FCA 239 at [8] . Nonetheless, the court is not bound by the decision of the meeting so that if, for example, the court considered that there had been oppression, it would not approve the Scheme: see, for example, In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (2009)73 ACSR 385 at [66]. CONSIDERATION 
 The Share Scheme

Under the proposed Share Scheme, all of Sino Gold's issued ordinary shares not already owned by members of the Eldorado Group will be acquired by Eldorado Pacific. The consideration to be received by the Sino Gold shareholders will be:

The new Eldorado shares will rank equally with each existing Eldorado shares.

In In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (2009) 73 ACSR 385 , Finkelstein J said (at [66]): 
 
 The application of the relevant test involves a comparison of the rights creditors have in the absence of the scheme and any new rights that are established under the scheme: Re T &amp; N Ltd (No 3) [2007] 1 All ER at 882. Once those differences are identified the question whether they form separate classes must be assessed with the following factors in mind. First, when creditors are broken up into classes, each class is given power to veto the scheme and that is a process that undermines the basic approach of decision by majority: Nordic Bank Plc v International Harvester Australia Ltd [1983] 2 VR 298 , 301. Second, there is a built-in safeguard against majority oppression in that the court is not bound by the decision of the meeting. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that there is no oppression by the minority. Third, practical considerations are relevant. If a judge is too assiduous in identifying classes, it is possible to end up with any number of classes. In the end, schemes of arrangement are propounded in a business context. The judge should adopt a practical business-like approach to the issue, as would the creditors if they were to decide the matter.</text>

<tocase>Re MIA Group Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 29</tocase>
<text>The holders of the options are treated as "creditors" in the proposal in accordance with the prevalent view (the authorities were reviewed by Barrett J in Re MIA Group Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 29 at [3]-[9]) a view from which I will not depart.

It is proposed that Eldorado Gold Corporation (Eldorado), a corporation incorporated in Canada, will, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Eldorado Pacific Pty Ltd (Eldorado Pacific), acquire all of the shares in and options issued by Sino Gold. Eldorado is a public company limited by shares with its headquarters in Vancouver (it was originally incorporated in Bermuda but was continued and now exists under Canadian law). It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Eldorado shares are traded on the TSX and the NYSE.

Two schemes are proposed: a Share Scheme and an Option Scheme. It is proposed that there be one meeting of the shareholders (Share Scheme Meeting) but two meetings of the option holders (Option Scheme Meetings). There are two Option Scheme Meetings because those responsible have divided the option holders into two classes according to whether their options are "in-the-money" or "out-of-the-money". They are in-the-money if their exercise price is less than (i) for options with an A$ exercise price A$7.17, and (ii) for options with a C$ exercise price C$6.49. The options are out-of-the-money if their exercise price is equal to or greater than (i) for options with an A$ exercise price A$7.17, and (ii) for options with a C$ exercise price C$6.49.

It is not for this Court, when considering an application under s 411(4)(b), to express any view as to whether the procedures and processes of the Court or under the Act are sufficient to satisfy the requirements for exemption to be enlivened: see Re Central Pacific Minerals NL [2002] FCA 239 at [31] per Emmett J; Re Simeon Wines Ltd [2002] SASC 204 ; (2002) 42 ACSR 454 at [21] - [26] per Lander J; Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601 at [20] per Barrett J. Exclusivity under the Scheme Implementation Deed

Eldorado and Sino Gold are parties to a Scheme Implementation Deed dated 26 August 2009 as amended on 26 October 2009 (SID). Clause 11 of the SID contains "no-talk" and "no-shop" provisions. The period during which those provisions operate is from the date of the SID until the earlier of 31 March 2010 ("End Date") and the termination of the SID. The "sunset date" is therefore 31 March 2010. It follows that the maximum overall period is just over seven months, and the period from the first court hearing to that date is close enough to five months.

In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 , I said (at [31]) that I did not regard an overall period of some three and a half months as unreasonably long.

In Re MIA Group Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 29 , Barrett J observed in relation to the Black-Scholes methodology (at [12]): 
 
 ...its use for pricing purposes (and voting purposes) in the scheme of arrangement context is sufficiently reasonable, at least on a prima facie basis, to allow the proposed scheme in which it plays a part to go forward for optionholders' consideration on the basis proposed. 
 

 
In that case orders were made for the convening of two meetings only: a meeting of members and a meeting of option holders. His Honour noted (at [10]-[14]) that the Black-Scholes methodology took into account the different expiry dates and strike prices of the various series of options with which he was concerned, and that its use militated against the prescription of different classes. However, his Honour noted that it remained open for any question of unfairness to be raised at the second court hearing as an objection to approval. 
 The class issue in the present case

Kingsway is the holder of 588,830 in-the-money options. They are some of a series of 777,700 options which expire on 8 August 2012. Their exercise price was originally C$5.63 but, as a result of a consensual amendment, was reduced by 16c to C$5.47. Assif SA holds options in the same series. For all I know, it may hold the remaining 188,870 options in the series.

In correspondence, Kingsway and Assif SA contended that in-the-money options should be valued, not according to the intrinsic value methodology, but according to the Black-Scholes methodology so that their holders would enjoy the benefit of the prospect of an increase in the value of Sino Gold shares down to the expiry date of the options, 8 August 2012.

Finally, in Re MIA Group Ltd , above, Barrett J stated (at [14]): 
 
 In the present case, consistent and indiscriminate application of the same pricing or valuation methodology to options having different characteristics in terms of exercise price and expiry, being a methodology that has regard to value criteria in one market at one time, should lay to rest any argument that those different characteristics so destroy community of interest as to indicate different classes. The matter is, to my mind, sufficiently clear to make it appropriate that a single meeting of all optionholders be convened on the basis that separate classes do not exist. Any contrary view can be agitated in due course should anyone see fit to raise it.

Barrett J's reference to "consistent and indiscriminate application of the same pricing or valuation methodology" is reflected in the classes that have been adopted in the present Option Scheme: the intrinsic value methodology has been applied to all in-the-money options, while the Black-Scholes methodology has been applied to all out-of-the-money options. Accordingly, it is appropriate to describe the proposed in-the-money class as the intrinsic value methodology class, and the proposed out-of-the-money class as the Black-Scholes methodology class.</text>

<tocase>Re Solution 6 Holdings Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 113</tocase>
<text>Grant Samuel has expressed the opinion that the valuation methodology adopted for the in-the-money options is fair and reasonable (the Grant Samuel report is annexure A to the Scheme Booklet). An "intrinsic" valuation method formed the basis of the scheme that was approved in Re Solution 6 Holdings Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 113 (Jacobson J described the calculation at [7]).

As noted earlier, out-of-the-money options are those that have a strike price at or above A$7.17 (or C$6.49). The view could be taken that they have no value. However, because the underlying shares will continue to trade in the future, there is the possibility that their value will increase by the expiry date for those options, so that the options will become "in-the-money" options with an intrinsic value after all. So long as they remain unexercised, the options may fluctuate between being in-the-money and out-of-the money. The extent to which this is likely to occur depends on the volatility of the market for the underlying shares, the level of the exercise price, the period that the option has yet to run to its expiry date, and, no doubt, other considerations.

The question of what value is to be ascribed to out-of-the-money options is difficult. In the Option Scheme they have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology which takes into account factors of the kind mentioned. Grant Samuel has discussed the appropriateness of applying that methodology (in section 9.7 at pp 90-91 of its report), and has expressed the opinion that the valuation arrived at for the out-of-the-money options is "generous" and is "fair and reasonable and in the best interests of holders of [out-of-the-money] options and [that] overall the option proposal is fair and reasonable and accordingly in the best interests of option holders".</text>
