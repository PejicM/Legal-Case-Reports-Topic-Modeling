<tocase>Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/178.html</AustLII>
<text>11 It is common ground that any order on the motion would be an interlocutory order, so that ordinary principles governing summary dismissal of a proceeding should apply. That is, an application under s 84C should be approached with caution and should be allowed only where a clear case for summary dismissal has been made: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 at [48] - [49] per Lander J (with whom North and Dowsett JJ agreed); Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 89 [51] per Stone J. The general approach, therefore, is consistent with the approach of Courts in other applications to summarily dismiss proceedings, namely that they should be dismissed only in very clear cases: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129. As in Williams v Grant at [84] and [87] per Lander J, the first applicants seeking to strike out the Town of Batchelor No 2 application under s 84C have the onus and responsibility of establishing that the second applicants were not authorised by the native title claim group to bring that claim, and so to make out a very clear case of want of authorisation, or a clear failure to comply with one or other of the requirements of ss 61 , 61A or 62 .

15 Section 84C(2) requires the Court to consider an application under s 84C(1) before any further proceedings take place in relation to the main application. But that does not require the Court to hear and determine the question as to whether the application has, in fact, been authorised as required by s 251B in all cases. It is only where the application is obviously without merit, that is, where there is no realistic prospect on the material before the Court of the authorisation being shown to have existed at the time it was purportedly granted, that an order will be made summarily dismissing or striking out the main application under s 84C. Sometimes an applicant faced with an application under s 84C may seek to amend the application to cure an identified deficiency (as discussed by Lander J in Williams v Grant at [57]). Where the application is not clearly without merit, so that it is not dismissed summarily or struck out, the Court may consider directing that an application under s 84C be heard and determined at the same time as the main application. That is a course of action which Wilcox J in Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890 at [45] suggested. The Court may also consider directing that the question of authorisation be heard and determined as a separate question, and be heard and determined prior to the hearing of the main application, under O 29 of the Federal Court Rules . That is a matter for each particular case and its particular circumstances. Whether such an order were appropriate would depend upon the extent to which there would be an overlap in the evidence likely to be called relating to authorisation and on the main application and a range of factors. The apparent attraction of expedition and economy may be misleading. Very often, the proposed evidence of authorisation is to be given by persons who also will give "connection" evidence and evidence of traditional laws and customs. There are often sound reasons in such circumstances why the separate trial of issues should not be ordered: Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd v Anti-Dumping Authority (1995) 56 FCR 406 ; Energy Australia v Australian Energy Ltd [2001] FCA 1049 at [8] per Stone J. There are also countervailing considerations of potential delay through splitting of issues and the separate processes which follow that course: Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 130. So, not uncommonly, as occurred in both Risk and Harrington-Smith (referred to above) the issue of authorisation was heard and determined as part of the principal hearing of the main application.</text>

<tocase>Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77</tocase>

<text>11 It is common ground that any order on the motion would be an interlocutory order, so that ordinary principles governing summary dismissal of a proceeding should apply. That is, an application under s 84C should be approached with caution and should be allowed only where a clear case for summary dismissal has been made: Williams v Grant [2004] FCAFC 178 at [48] - [49] per Lander J (with whom North and Dowsett JJ agreed); Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 89 [51] per Stone J. The general approach, therefore, is consistent with the approach of Courts in other applications to summarily dismiss proceedings, namely that they should be dismissed only in very clear cases: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioner [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91 per Dixon J; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129.

21 The objection is not simply that hearsay evidence cannot be received on an application such as the present. As I have said, it is common ground that the application is an interlocutory one in respect of which hearsay evidence may be admitted by reason of s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth): see e.g. Bodney v Bropho [2004] FCAFC 226 ; (2004) 140 FCR 77 at 92 [64] per Stone J. Section 75 requires evidence of the source of the hearsay material within the affidavit. It is contended that such evidence has not been given, so that that particular part of Mr Petherick's affidavit of 23 April 2007 should not be received, or alternatively that it should not be received by reason of s 135 of the Evidence Act . There is no explanation as to why Ray Petherick should not have given evidence of those facts directly. There is nothing to verify on his part the reliability of his diary, although it has considerable detail within it. However, I think it identifies the source of the information, namely Ray Petherick and there is some independent confirmation of the events to which it refers by Captain Wodidj having signed the affidavit on 10 April 2006 which was filed in support of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application as amended. It is a different question as to the weight to be given to that affidavit of Captain Wodidj generally upon the whole of the evidence.

22 I propose to receive that part of the affidavit of Mr Petherick, but I indicate that I do not think it carries much weight. There is direct evidence from Captain Wodidj as to the fact that he did not intend to authorise the bringing of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application as amended as an authorised applicant or on his behalf as an asserted member of that native title claim group, or to authorise the claim to be brought as a senior member of the Emu Clan. He plainly disavows any interest as a member of any native title claim group which may have native title rights and interests in respect of the Batchelor area. Nevertheless, there is some evidence of attempts made by Thomas Petherick through Ray Petherick to secure Captain Wodidj's agreement to being a nominated applicant for the claim group, and to indicate his preparedness to be a member of the claim group.

23 For reasons which appear below, nothing turns upon the receipt of that evidence in all the circumstances.</text>

14 It is, therefore, hard to resist the temptation of determining such a fundamental issue as authorisation before a full trial of the native title determination application with the very substantial resources which are then involved. To do so has the attraction of expedition and economy. Certain recent decisions of the Court have illustrated that proper authorisation is a matter which should not be overlooked, and the possibility of a challenge, at an early point in the proceeding: see e.g. Risk v Northern Territory [2006] FCA 404 ; Harrington-Smith v Western Australia (No 9) (2007) 238 ALR 1. The mere complexity of an issue, or the fact that extensive argument may be necessary to demonstrate that the claim is untenable, is not a reason not to dispose of an application summarily: General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) 112 CLR at 130 per Barwick CJ.</text>

<text>12 In Landers v South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; (2003) 128 FCR 495 at 497 [7] I said:
 
 ... The power summarily to dismiss an application should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable, and upon the version of the evidence favourable to the applicant. The Court should not, upon such an application, generally undertake any weighing of conflicting evidence or of the inferences which might be drawn from such evidence: Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603.

36 In my view, on his own material, those two clans are a mere subset of the FRBG. It is therefore inappropriate that they should constitute the native title claim group: see e.g. Ward v Western Australia [1998] FCA 1478 ; (1998) 159 ALR 483 at 581; Risk v National Native Title Tribunal [2000] FCA 1589 at [60] ; Tilmouth v Northern Territory [2001] FCA 820 ; [2001] 109 FCR 240 at 241-242; Dieri People v South Australia [2003] FCA 187 ; (2003) 127 FCR 364 at [55] ; Landers v South Australia [2003] FCA 264 ; [2003] 128 FCR 495 at 504; and Harrington-Smith v Western Australia (No 9) (2007) 238 ALR 1 at [1209]-[1217].</text>

That is a matter for each particular case and its particular circumstances. Whether such an order were appropriate would depend upon the extent to which there would be an overlap in the evidence likely to be called relating to authorisation and on the main application and a range of factors. The apparent attraction of expedition and economy may be misleading. Very often, the proposed evidence of authorisation is to be given by persons who also will give "connection" evidence and evidence of traditional laws and customs. There are often sound reasons in such circumstances why the separate trial of issues should not be ordered: Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd v Anti-Dumping Authority (1995) 56 FCR 406 ; Energy Australia v Australian Energy Ltd [2001] FCA 1049 at [8] per Stone J.

Very often, the proposed evidence of authorisation is to be given by persons who also will give "connection" evidence and evidence of traditional laws and customs. There are often sound reasons in such circumstances why the separate trial of issues should not be ordered: Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd v Anti-Dumping Authority (1995) 56 FCR 406 ; Energy Australia v Australian Energy Ltd [2001] FCA 1049 at [8] per Stone J. There are also countervailing considerations of potential delay through splitting of issues and the separate processes which follow that course: Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 130. So, not uncommonly, as occurred in both Risk and Harrington-Smith (referred to above) the issue of authorisation was heard and determined as part of the principal hearing of the main application.</text>

<text>15 Section 84C(2) requires the Court to consider an application under s 84C(1) before any further proceedings take place in relation to the main application. But that does not require the Court to hear and determine the question as to whether the application has, in fact, been authorised as required by s 251B in all cases. It is only where the application is obviously without merit, that is, where there is no realistic prospect on the material before the Court of the authorisation being shown to have existed at the time it was purportedly granted, that an order will be made summarily dismissing or striking out the main application under s 84C. Sometimes an applicant faced with an application under s 84C may seek to amend the application to cure an identified deficiency (as discussed by Lander J in Williams v Grant at [57]). Where the application is not clearly without merit, so that it is not dismissed summarily or struck out, the Court may consider directing that an application under s 84C be heard and determined at the same time as the main application. That is a course of action which Wilcox J in Bodney v State of Western Australia [2003] FCA 890 at [45] suggested. The Court may also consider directing that the question of authorisation be heard and determined as a separate question, and be heard and determined prior to the hearing of the main application, under O 29 of the Federal Court Rules . That is a matter for each particular case and its particular circumstances. Whether such an order were appropriate would depend upon the extent to which there would be an overlap in the evidence likely to be called relating to authorisation and on the main application and a range of factors. The apparent attraction of expedition and economy may be misleading.
