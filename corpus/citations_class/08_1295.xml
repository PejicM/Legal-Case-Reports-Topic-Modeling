<text>88 In Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 ( Parkdale ), Gibbs CJ at 199 in a frequently quoted passage said:
 Section 52 does not expressly state what persons or class of persons should be considered as the possible victims for the purpose of deciding whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It seems clear enough that consideration must be given to the class of consumers likely to be affected by the conduct. Although it is true, as has often been said, that ordinarily a class of consumers may include the inexperienced as well as the experienced, and the gullible as well as the astute, the section must in my opinion by regarded as contemplating the effect of the conduct on reasonable members of the class. The heavy burdens which the section creates cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will or course depend on all the circumstances. 
That passage was referred to with approval by the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 ( Campomar ) at [102]-[103].</text>

89 In Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 ( Taco ), in the joint judgment of Deane and Fitzgerald JJ, their Honours at 200 said:
 In truth, of course, no conduct can mislead or deceive unless the representee labours under some erroneous assumption. Such an assumption can range from the obvious, such as a simple assumption that an express representation is worthy of credence, through the predictable, such as the common assumption in a passing-off case that goods marketed under a trade name which corresponds to the well-known trade name of goods of the same type have their origins in the manufacturer of the well-known goods, to the fanciful, such as an assumption that the mere fact that a person sells goods means that he is the manufacturer of them. The nature of the erroneous assumption which must be made before conduct can mislead or deceive will be a relevant, and sometimes decisive, factor in determining the factual question whether conduct should properly be categorized as misleading or deceptive or as likely to mislead or deceive. 
Again, that passage was cited with apparent approval by the High Court in Campomar at [104].

91 Their Honours then provided certain guidance in considering and determining whether the suggested misrepresentation has been made, and is or is likely to be misleading or deceptive of the public. The first item of guidance was to identify the relevant section or sections of the public by reference to whom the question of whether conduct is, or is likely to be, misleading or deceptive falls to be tested. The second, having identified the relevant section of the public, was to consider the issue by reference to all who come within it, "including the astute and the gullible, the intelligent and the not so intelligent, the well educated as well as the poorly educated, men and women of various ages pursuing a variety of vocations". That quotation was adopted from the judgment of Lockhart J in Puxu Pty Ltd v Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 73 at 93. In Campomar , the High Court confirmed at [105] that the Court may well decline to regard as controlling the application of s 52 assumptions by persons whose reactions are "extreme or fanciful".

92 In Campomar , the High Court then said at [105]:
 The initial question which must be determined was whether the misconceptions, or deceptions, alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of prospective purchasers. 
Their Honours emphasised at [106] as had been said in Taco Bell at 201, that the question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment, or is misleading or deceptive, cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in the section under consideration.</text>

<text>89 In Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd (1982) 42 ALR 177 ( Taco ), in the joint judgment of Deane and Fitzgerald JJ, their Honours at 200 said:

Again, that passage was cited with apparent approval by the High Court in Campomar at [104].

90 Deane and Fitzgerald JJ in Taco at 202 pointed out the difficulty arising in a case involving s 52 of the TP Act (a civil claim alleging misleading or deceptive conduct) of determining whether the alleged conduct contains or conveys a misrepresentation, and of the significance to that question of evidence from one or more persons that they were in fact led into error. Their Honours said that the latter question, namely whether actual evidence of being misled is necessary, should be answered in the negative. Such evidence is helpful but not necessary. Their Honours continued:
 ... whether or not conduct amounts to misrepresentation is a question of fact to be decided by considering what is said and done against the background of all surrounding circumstances.

92 In Campomar , the High Court then said at [105]:
 The initial question which must be determined was whether the misconceptions, or deceptions, alleged to arise or to be likely to arise are properly to be attributed to the ordinary or reasonable members of the classes of prospective purchasers.

<tocase>Knight v R [1992] HCA 56 ; (1992) 175 CLR 495</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/56.html</AustLII>
<text>107 The defendant did not have any onus of demonstrating that an understanding of the Christmas catalogue consistent with innocence was available: see Knight v R [1992] HCA 56 ; (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 503. The prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the false or misleading representations were made as it alleged. In my judgment, for the reasons referred to, the prosecution has proved that.

108 I have considered whether there were other reasonably possible "explanations consistent with innocence" (words used by the defendant in its written submission) which could be drawn from the relevant sections of the Christmas catalogue. For the reasons I have given, the fact that there may have been other meanings drawn by some consumers, with different degrees of knowledge or understanding, does not diminish my conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged representation was made. As I have said, s 75AZC(1) does not require that the representation must be so understood by every consumer or potential consumer.

109 The defendant suggested that the strike out price might have conveyed the defendant's previous or normal ticketed price, or a competitor's price, or the value of the relevant item of jewellery. For the reasons already given, even if some consumers or potential consumers might reasonably have so understood what was represented by the relevant parts of the Christmas catalogue in all the circumstances, that would not mean that the representation which I have identified was not made.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd (1996) 85 ACrim Rep 500</tocase>
<text>118 For the sake of completeness, I record that I have also considered the cases under s 53(e) of the TP Act to which I was referred. Each was decided on its own particular facts and is not, in my view, of direct assistance in deciding whether the prosecutor has made out the case. That depended on whether, judged objectively, the representations were made by the defendant in all the circumstances by the relevant parts of the Christmas catalogue. However, I mention briefly those cases: Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd (1996) 85 ACrim Rep 500 ( Cue Design ) and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allans Music Group Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1552 ( Allans ). Each of those cases concerned a prosecution under s 79(1) of the TP Act for a contravention of s 53(e) of that Act (that is the regime which existed prior to the introduction of Pt VC). Each involved pricing representations. In the case of Cue Designs , there was a price tag with a higher price which was crossed out together with a representation as to a lower price in relation to items of apparel. It was found that a reasonable person would be led to believe that the items of apparel had previously been offered for sale at the higher price marked on the tag and were now being offered for sale at the lower price. It is therefore somewhat different from the present case where the relevant allegation is that the strike through price was the price at which the particular items of jewellery might be purchased other than during the sale period, and so provided an indication of the saving available during the sale period. In Cue Design the higher price had not previously been the price at which the items of apparel had been offered for sale. In any event, in that case there was a guilty plea to the charges and the case concerned penalty. Similarly in Allans : the representation was that there was a narrow window of opportunity in the Christmas lead up period when bargains of a very substantial nature could be obtained on Allans' musical goods by paying a much lower price in that period than that which had been paid in circumstances where a purchase was made before the beginning of that period. In other words, the representation in that case was as to what had previously been paid or was expected to be paid by reason of the crossed through price. Again, a plea of guilty was made in relation to those charges. Finally, I note Ducret v Chaudhiry's Oriental Carpet Palace Pty Ltd (1987) 76 ALR 182. It was also a prosecution under s 79 for contraventions of s 53(e) of the TP Act. The prosecution was summarily dismissed. In that case, the price comparators were viewed in the context of extensive evidence to which the primary judge referred, so that upon the whole of the evidence the contrasting price was not misleading or deceptive. It was a decision on its particular facts also.</text>
