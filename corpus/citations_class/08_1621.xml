<tocase>Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229</tocase>
<text>21 The Court has discretionary power to make orders as to costs, which power is to be exercised judicially: see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 43 and Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. The Court is now concerned with what are commonly known as "costs thrown away". An order for costs thrown away is not infrequently made in circumstances such as the present, where an adjournment application succeeds, and the party seeking costs maintains a readiness to proceed on the day fixed for trial but for the conduct of the other party. The costs thrown away are such costs as have been reasonably incurred that relate to work done and wasted as a result of the successful adjournment application: see Andromeda Handelsaktieselskab v Holme (1924) 130 LT 329 at 330 and Fashion Warehouse Pty Ltd v Pola [1984] 1 Qd R 251 at 254. Generally, costs thrown away are costs that have been incurred once and will be incurred again for the purpose of the trial that is fixed a second time: Roger Quick and David Garnsworthy, Quick on Costs (Thomson Law Book Company, 2009) par [1.1230]. It is to be borne in mind that the likelihood or otherwise of a party being ultimately successful in the proceeding is not a relevant consideration on the question whether an order for costs thrown away should be made.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>27 In this circumstance, the Commissioner should have his costs thrown away by reason of the adjournment of the trial, including the hearings on 5 and 18 September 2008. The next question is whether these costs should be paid on an indemnity basis. The usual rule is that costs are payable on a party and party basis, unless the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the normal course: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 233 per Sheppard J; Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 152-53 per Black CJ and 156-58 per Cooper and Merkel JJ; and O 62 of the Rules. It is unnecessary to outline in detail the principles governing when a departure from the usual rule is justified: see, for example, Boyapati v Rockefeller Management Corporation (No 2) [2008] FCA 1375 (" Boyapati (No 2 )") and the authorities therein. As the Full Court said in Hamod v New South Wales [2002] FCA 424 ; (2002) 188 ALR 659 at 665 (per Gray J, with whom Carr and Goldberg JJ agreed), indemnity costs "serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs".</text>

<tocase>Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1823.html</AustLII>
<text>30 In Barrett Property Group Limited v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1823 (" Barrett "), Gilmour J discussed the circumstances in which departure from the general rule in Order 62 rule 3(3) may be justified: see Barrett at [23]-[24] and the authorities there discussed and cited. It is unnecessary to repeat his Honour's discussion here. Having regard to the relevant authorities, including Barrett , I would not grant leave to tax costs forthwith in this case, at least not now. I accept that Mr Sobey has led the Commissioner to incur costs over and above what he would have incurred had Mr Sobey conducted his case diligently. The issues in this case are not complex, however, and I would not expect the trial to be especially lengthy or complex. The parties ought to be ready for a trial, at the latest, by early next year. This ought not to be a case in which the Commissioner waits unduly long to recover any costs due on taxation.

31 In the circumstances as presently disclosed, I would not order costs to be paid forthwith.

32 Accordingly, I would order that Mr Sobey pay the Commissioner's costs thrown away by reason of the trial of the proceedings being adjourned, including the hearings on 5 and 18 September 2008. I would further order that these costs be paid on an indemnity basis. 

 I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny .
