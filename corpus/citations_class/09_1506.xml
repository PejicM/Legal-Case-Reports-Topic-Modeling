<tocase>Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313</tocase>
<text>The context and the characteristics or properties of the original and the substitute can assist in ascertaining whether what is put forward is truly a substitution for what was originally there. Usually, it will be a question of fact whether a substitution or something more radical has occurred in a given case. In competition law, s 4E of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides a definition of a market as including a market for the particular goods or services under consideration "and other goods or services that are substitutable for ..." the former. Yet, the mere fact that a consumer will on occasion purchase tea instead of coffee does not necessarily mean that because of that substitution tea and coffee cannot be distinct goods with their own separate markets. On the other hand, it maybe that, if the relevant market is the hot beverage market, they will be substitutes; hence the importance of the context in which substitution is assessed: cp Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 at 332 per Lockhart, Wilcox and Gummow JJ; Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 188 per Mason CJ and Wilson J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/7.html</AustLII>
<text>Additionally, the construction of s 12DL(2) favoured by the Commission would broaden the scope of the strict liability offence created by s 12DL(1) in a manner that strains the natural and ordinary meaning of "a card of the same kind" as referring to one or other of the two cards referred to in s 12DL(1). This invites a more cautious approach to the looser construction of this criminal provision than the Commission's contention: Stevens 224 CLR at 210-211 [45]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; and see too R v Adams [1935] HCA 62 ; (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-568 where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: 
 
 "No doubt, in determining whether an offence has been created or enlarged, the Court must be guided, as in other questions of interpretation, by the fair meaning of the language of the enactment, but when that language is capable of more than one meaning, or is vague or cloudy so that its denotation is uncertain and no sure conclusion can be reached by a consideration of the provisions and subject matter of the legislation, then it ought not to be construed as extending any penal category ."

<tocase>Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/17.html</AustLII>
<text>The construction of s 12DL must be approached having regard to its dual operation as a section that imposes both criminal and civil liability for a contravention of either s 12DL(1) or (4). The heading to the subdivision in the Act of which s 12DL forms part is headed "Consumer protection". That heading provides part of the context in which the substantive provisions of Subdiv D of Div 2 of Pt 2 of the Act must be construed: s 13 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). The heading should be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of those sections in cases of ambiguity. However, as Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ cautioned in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 601, the heading does not control the permissible scope of the substantive provisions within the subdivision in the Act. The heading cannot properly be used to impose an unnaturally constricted or expanded meaning upon the words of those substantive provisions: cf Concrete Constructions 169 CLR at 601-602, 603-604.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/10.html</AustLII>
<text>The expression "of the same kind" does not require that the previous and later cards are absolutely identical. A retail business will replace or substitute new goods for those it has sold. Sometimes suppliers of such goods discontinue production of a particular good or go out of business. The trader will often seek a replacement or substitute good that has some identity or characteristic in common with the unavailable product. The new good may be an improved version of the old with more functions or features, perhaps having shed others: cf the discussion in the dissenting judgments of Stephen J and Aickin J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd (In Liq) [1978] HCA 10 ; (1978) 138 CLR 210 at 218 and 242-243.</text>

<tocase>Futures Industry (NSW) Code in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Lombard Nash International Pty Ltd (1986) 11 ACLR 566</tocase>
<text>The Commission accepted that because a card could be sent in substitution for another of the same kind, the substitute did not have to be identical with the original card. But, it argued that the words "of the same kind" in s 12DL(2) should be construed as meaning "substantially of the same nature or type" following the view of Young J on that expression as used in s 4(1) of the Futures Industry (NSW) Code in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Lombard Nash International Pty Ltd (1986) 11 ACLR 566 at 569-570. The Commission argued that the word "kind" in s 12DL(2) did not relate back to just whether the card was a credit card or a debit card. This was because, it said, the definitions in s 12DL(5) did not create a bright line distinction between the two terms; indeed each card could have features of the other within their defined meanings. Thus, the Commission contended, one had to consider the functionality of each card in order to ascertain whether the cards were "of the same kind". This was a question of fact and degree.

The Commission argued that the functionality of a Handycard was more limited than the new card. It said that the Handycard was used in a straightforward, simple manner requiring personal presence of the card holder and the use of his or her PIN to access the person's account at only two types of entry points, namely on EFTPOS or ATM machines. The Commission argued that this functionality was substantively different in kind to the broader range offered by the new card. It argued that because the new card could access different payment systems and be used by mail, over the telephone or on the internet, the risk of its unauthorised use was greater than that for a Handycard. It contended that these features amounted to a difference in kind.</text>

<tocase>McNamara v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal [2005] HCA 55 ; (2005) 221 CLR 646</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/55.html</AustLII>
<text>First, the predecessor versions of s 12DL had significantly different wording and operated differently. Secondly, because s 12DL in its present form is different to the previous versions, the relevant task of statutory construction is to construe the section as it now is. The previous wordings were in respect of differently expressed provisions, including the repealed offence created in the former version of s 12DL(1): cf McNamara v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal [2005] HCA 55 ; (2005) 221 CLR 646 at 661 [40] per McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, Gleeson CJ agreeing at 650 [1]. Thirdly, I am of opinion that the language of the present s 12DL is clear and the earlier versions do not elucidate its meaning. Fourthly, the earlier version of s 12DL(1) expressly referred to two separate types of debit card including one being "a debit card of the same kind" which may have had a relationship to the expression "card of the same kind" as then used in s 12DL(2). In addition, there was also a definition of "debit card". The absence in the present s 12DL of the expression "a debit card of that kind" demonstrates the irrelevance of the earlier legislation to the construction of the Act in its present form.

The Commission also relied on complaint logs to argue that the new card was not regarded by Westpac's customers as a card of the same kind as their Handycard. A total of 740 complaints was recorded although it is not clear whether one complainant could have had more than one complaint recorded. In any event, the total number of complaints is inconsequential having regard to the fact that over 420,000 new cards were issued, the last over six months ago.

Next the Commission relied on what it asserted were differences in reported fraudulent use of all Westpac debit cards in relation to the category "card not present" in the 12 quarters to September 2009. The Commission did not put forward any analysis to make good its assertion that this material was probative of the new card not being a card of the same kind as the Handycard. As a percentage of the total amount spent on the cards, the incidence of this fraudulent use varied quarter by quarter within a range, while the overall spending has been significantly increasing. The first three quarters in 2008 and 2009 show broadly similar percentages although they are all slightly less for 2009. In contrast the incidence of fraudulent use of a PIN is very much smaller.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<text>The three purposes specified at the commencement of para (b) in s 12DL(2) must each be given a distinct meaning and operation. This is because the Court must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision and construe it, if possible, so as to give effect to harmonious goals: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69]-[71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.

A renewal of a card ordinarily will occur close to the expiry date of the credit or debit card. By renewing the card, the issuer creates a new expiry date for the card. A replacement card ordinarily would be one sent to take the place of a card that had been lost by or stolen from the cardholder. A card in substitution for an existing card is different, again, from a renewed or replacement card. A substitute is not normally an exact replica. Often a substitute will have different characteristics, even though it will be able to take the place of the original. The Oxford English Dictionary defines "substitution" as including "the putting of one ... thing in place of another" and "replacement (of one thing) by another".

Suppose that on renewal, a renewed debit card has a significant new security feature offering the cardholder extra protection that the expired debit card did not have. Or suppose that because of improvements in technology a completely new payment system allowed the renewed card to be used in many more locations, but with the same security features as the expiring card. If the Commission's contentions were correct, the presence of the new security feature or the functionality with the new payment system would mean that the card was not "of the same kind" as the expiring card. I reject that argument.</text>

<tocase>Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment [2005] HCA 58 ; (2005) 224 CLR 193</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/58.html</AustLII>
<text>Another important contextual feature that must be considered in construing s 12DL is its imposition of strict criminal liability for a contravention of each of s 12DL(1) or (4). This feature cautions against (but does not always exclude) the adoption of an expansive construction of narrower, but clear words. However, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ said in Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment [2005] HCA 58 ; (2005) 224 CLR 193 at 210-211 [45] : 
 
 "... in choosing between a relatively broad and a relatively narrow construction of legislation, it is desirable to take into account its penal character. The present litigation does not arise from the institution of criminal proceedings under the offence provisions now contained particularly in s 132 of the Act. However, a person who makes or sells a circumvention device (s 132(5B)) is liable to imprisonment for not more than five years (s 132(6A)). An appreciation of the heavy hand that may be brought down by the criminal law suggests the need for caution in accepting any loose, albeit "practical", construction of Div 2A itself." (emphasis added)

The initial prohibition in s 12DL(1) applies to an issuer of a card (by dint of s 12DL(3)) sending one or other of the two cards defined in s 12DL(5), unless the person sends the card in accordance with s 12DL(2). When the chapeau to s 12DL(2) refers to "the card", it identifies the particular card sent to which s 12DL(1) applies. That is, "the card" in the chapeau to s 12DL(2) is either one or other of a credit card or a debit card as defined in s 12DL(5). A significant feature of s 12DL(2)(b)(ii) is that the card sent may be in renewal, or replacement of, or in substitution for, "a card of the same kind" that has two other characteristics; first, that "a card of the same kind" had been sent previously to the person concerned and, secondly, it (the last mentioned card) had been used for "a purpose for which it was intended to be used".

Additionally, the construction of s 12DL(2) favoured by the Commission would broaden the scope of the strict liability offence created by s 12DL(1) in a manner that strains the natural and ordinary meaning of "a card of the same kind" as referring to one or other of the two cards referred to in s 12DL(1). This invites a more cautious approach to the looser construction of this criminal provision than the Commission's contention: Stevens 224 CLR at 210-211 [45]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; and see too R v Adams [1935] HCA 62 ; (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-568 where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said:
