<tocase>Comcare v Burton (1998) 50 ALD 846</tocase>
<text>Ms Cheung seeks to distinguish Power on the basis that, in that case, the only prior determination had been by the determining authority and not by the Tribunal following a contested hearing of the claim. However, the Tribunal's power is enlivened upon reconsideration of a determination in accordance with s 62 of the SRC Act. As Finn J said in Comcare v Burton (1998) 50 ALD 846 , the review procedure under the SRC Act has three stages: (a) the initial determination as defined in s 60; (b) reconsideration of the determination under s 62; and (c) review of the reconsideration decision (a reviewable decision) by the Tribunal under s 64. The 2008 Tribunal had the jurisdiction to review the reviewable decisions of Australia Post, being decisions which gave rise to determinations (s 60 of the SRC Act) and had been reconsidered so as to constitute s 62 reviewable decisions ( Power at 525 citing Burton ).

As Sackville J noted in Power at 525 (citing Burton ), s 43(1) of the AAT Act is not a source of jurisdiction but confers powers on the Tribunal in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Hanna v Australian Postal Corporation [1990] FCA 153 ; (1990) 12 AAR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1990/153.html</AustLII>
<text>In Hanna v Australian Postal Corporation [1990] FCA 153 ; (1990) 12 AAR 511 at 513, Davies J said that s 62(1) of the SRC Act meant that the determining authority was entitled to reconsider its own determinations. A reconsideration decision made under s 62 is a "reviewable decision" which may be reviewed by the Tribunal under s 64. That is, on a s 64 application to the Tribunal, the Tribunal reviews the reviewable decision; in this case, the reconsideration decisions made by Australia Post, the determining authority.

For the purpose of reviewing a decision, the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by the SRC Act on the decision-maker and may affirm, vary or set aside the decision under review (s 43(1) of the AAT Act). The Tribunal decision is then, for all relevant purposes, the decision of the decision-maker (s 43(6) of the AAT Act).

The reconsideration of a determination is not confined. There is no statutory requirement to apply the earlier determination or to take it into account. Inherent in the provision for reconsideration is the concept that that reconsideration is untrammelled by any previous determination. This does not preclude the determining authority from taking the previous determination into account but there is no requirement to do so. Similarly, there is no statutory requirement on the Tribunal to take into account any previous determinations or reconsideration decisions when reviewing a reviewable decision.</text>

<tocase>Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141</tocase>
<text>Section 43 refers to a substantive decision on the merits of the matter and not to each and every preliminary determination on the receipt or rejection of evidence, or to whether or not the Tribunal will allow argument on a specific issue sought to be raised before it. It goes without saying that there is no specific provision obliging the Tribunal to consider a previous Tribunal decision in relation to the same parties. The Tribunal had a duty to record its reasons for the substantive decision and the evidence upon which those reasons where based. The Tribunal was obliged to give reasons in relation to an application made to it. No application was made to the 2008 Tribunal in respect of the weight to be given to the 2001 Tribunal decision, nor did it form part of the evidence tendered by Ms Cheung (cf Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141).

The Tribunal is not bound by the laws of evidence and is entitled to inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks appropriate (s 33(1)(c) of the AAT Act). The 2008 Tribunal decision does refer to the 2001 Tribunal decision in circumstances where it is apparent that the 2008 Tribunal made up its own mind on the evidence before it. Ms Cheung has not submitted that the 2001 Tribunal decision formed any part of the material facts relied upon by the 2008 Tribunal.

The 2008 Tribunal had before it evidence that differed from the evidence before the 2001 Tribunal. The 2008 Tribunal was entitled to form its own view on the merits of the case, including the credibility of Ms Cheung and to determine the question before it as a review of reconsideration (reviewable) decisions made under s 62 of the SRC Act.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>Further, the 2001 Tribunal decision was not "a relevant consideration" in the sense that it was not required by the legislation to be considered, either expressly or by implication ( Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24).

The 2008 Tribunal was not bound to apply the 2001 Tribunal decision but did have a discretion to take the 2001 Tribunal decision into account. No interlocutory application was made to the 2008 Tribunal prior to the calling of evidence and the making of submissions on the basis that the 2001 Tribunal decision was determinative. The 2008 Tribunal was aware of the 2001 Tribunal decision but embarked upon its own determination in the light of fresh medical evidence and in the context of different reviewable decisions. That course was made clear to counsel. There is no allegation that there was a denial of procedural fairness.

As Australia Post was entitled to reconsider a determination without applying or considering an earlier determination of the 2001 Tribunal decision, the 2008 Tribunal was entitled to do the same.</text>

<text>The Tribunal is obliged to give reasons for its final and operative decision ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323). Section 43(2) of the AAT Act requires the Tribunal to give reasons either orally or in writing for its decision. Section 43(2B) provides that the reasons should include findings on material questions of fact and refer to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based.</text>

<text>Generally speaking, there should not be relitigation without reason of the same issues before the Tribunal where the relitigation is of the same facts and issues already decided. In those circumstances, previous Tribunal decisions would generally be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and the grounds for determination. It is open to a subsequent Tribunal to regard a previous decision as determinative of an issue and to decide that an issue should not be reopened. The Tribunal has a discretion in those circumstances to take such a course ( Morales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 82 FCR 374 at 390).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/595.html</AustLII>
<text>As noted by Lockhart J (with whom Black CJ and Gummow J agreed) in Plumb v Comcare [1992] FCA 595 ; (1992) 39 FCR 236 at 241, the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction and many of its powers from statutes other than the AAT Act, in this case the SRC Act.

The 2008 Tribunal was conducting a review of a number of reviewable decisions following applications made by the claimant, Ms Cheung, pursuant to s 64 of the SRC Act. Section 64 provides that an application to the Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision may be made by a claimant or a party affected by the decision the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth authority or a corporation that holds a licence under Part VIII of the SRC Act.

A reviewable decision is a decision made, relevantly, under s 62 of the SRC Act (s 60 of the SRC Act). Section 62 relevantly provides: 
 (1) A determining authority may, on its own motion: 

 
 (a) reconsider a determination made by it; or 

 
 (b) cause such a determination to be reconsidered by a person to whom its power under this section is delegated, being a person other than the person who made, or was involved in the making of, the determination; 

 
 whether or not a proceeding has been instituted or completed under this Part in respect of a reviewable decision made in relation to that determination. 

 
 (2) A request to a determining authority to reconsider a determination made by it may be made by: 

 
 (a) the claimant; or 

 
 (b) if the determination affects the Commonwealth &#8212; the Commonwealth; or 

 
 (c) if the determination affects a Commonwealth authority &#8212; that Commonwealth authority.</text>

<tocase>Power v Comcare (1998) 89 FCR 514</tocase>
<text>In Power v Comcare (1998) 89 FCR 514 Sackville J confirmed that the reconsideration decision-maker and the Tribunal have power to consider whether an applicant's condition has ever been causally related to his or her work. Ms Cheung does not say that the 2008 Tribunal was compelled to hold the 2001 Tribunal decision as determinative and therefore appears to accept that the 2008 Tribunal had jurisdiction to revisit the question of causation as determined by the 2001 Tribunal. However, she relies upon the existence of the 2008 Tribunal's discretion to regard the 2001 Tribunal decision as determinative and says that, in any event, it was a relevant consideration which was required to be taken into account.

Ms Cheung seeks to distinguish Power on the basis that, in that case, the only prior determination had been by the determining authority and not by the Tribunal following a contested hearing of the claim. However, the Tribunal's power is enlivened upon reconsideration of a determination in accordance with s 62 of the SRC Act. As Finn J said in Comcare v Burton (1998) 50 ALD 846 , the review procedure under the SRC Act has three stages: (a) the initial determination as defined in s 60; (b) reconsideration of the determination under s 62; and (c) review of the reconsideration decision (a reviewable decision) by the Tribunal under s 64. The 2008 Tribunal had the jurisdiction to review the reviewable decisions of Australia Post, being decisions which gave rise to determinations (s 60 of the SRC Act) and had been reconsidered so as to constitute s 62 reviewable decisions ( Power at 525 citing Burton ).

As Sackville J noted in Power at 525 (citing Burton ), s 43(1) of the AAT Act is not a source of jurisdiction but confers powers on the Tribunal in relation to matters in which it has jurisdiction.

There is no dispute in the present case that there were determinations under the SRC Act followed by reconsideration of those determinations which gave rise to the 2008 Tribunal decision. As Sackville J pointed out in Power at 525, s 43(1) of the AAT Act confers on the Tribunal the same powers and discretions as were available to the decision-maker, including the power provided in s 62(5) of the SRC Act to affirm, revoke or vary the delegate's decision that liability previously accepted had ceased. For the purpose of reviewing each reconsideration decision (ie. each reviewable decision) the 2008 Tribunal could exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the SRC Act on the reconsideration decision-maker ( Power at 526). This included a power to consider whether Ms Cheung's conditions had ever been causally related to her work. This consideration involved the reconsideration decision-maker and then the 2008 Tribunal analysing all the necessary facts, including further medical reports, to determine whether or not there was a continuing liability. The 2008 Tribunal could have exercised its discretionary powers to exclude evidence recanvassing the issues resolved in the 2001 Tribunal decision ( Power at 526 citing Re Quinn ). No issue as to the Tribunal's discretionary power was raised in Power .</text>

<tocase>Re Quinn and Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 15 AAR 519</tocase>
<text>Section 33 of the AAT Act provides for the Tribunal the flexibility needed to control its processes in the ordinary course, as pointed out in Re Quinn and Australian Postal Corporation (1992) 15 AAR 519. Ms Cheung draws attention to the comments by President O'Connor and Mr Barbour in Re Quinn at [32] where they pointed out that a Tribunal should not generally allow relitigation of issues already decided and that previous Tribunal decisions should be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and the grounds for the determination. They gave as examples compensation cases, where issues of causation and level of incapacity for the period the subject of the earlier decision would not be areas contested in a subsequent hearing. Confirming that estoppel does not apply where there is a ' different decision [to be reviewed] , a clear legislative intent, the reconsideration decision is not "final" and there has been prima facie a change in circumstances ', Re Quinn emphasised the flexibility provided for in s 33 of the AAT Act to enable the Tribunal to control its processes.

The thrust of Ms Cheung's submissions is that, while the 2008 Tribunal was not estopped from reconsidering the issues the subject of the 2001 Tribunal decision, it was at least required to have regard to that decision. It was open to the 2008 Tribunal to apply the previous decision to some or all of its findings and, Ms Cheung submits, the 2008 Tribunal was obliged to consider whether or not to do so. She submits that the failure even to consider the exercise of such a discretion, or to consider whether or not the previous decision should be applied or given weight, is an error of law. Further, the failure to provide reasons for taking the course that it did is, Ms Cheung submits, a further error of law.

There is no dispute in the present case that there were determinations under the SRC Act followed by reconsideration of those determinations which gave rise to the 2008 Tribunal decision. As Sackville J pointed out in Power at 525, s 43(1) of the AAT Act confers on the Tribunal the same powers and discretions as were available to the decision-maker, including the power provided in s 62(5) of the SRC Act to affirm, revoke or vary the delegate's decision that liability previously accepted had ceased. For the purpose of reviewing each reconsideration decision (ie. each reviewable decision) the 2008 Tribunal could exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the SRC Act on the reconsideration decision-maker ( Power at 526). This included a power to consider whether Ms Cheung's conditions had ever been causally related to her work. This consideration involved the reconsideration decision-maker and then the 2008 Tribunal analysing all the necessary facts, including further medical reports, to determine whether or not there was a continuing liability. The 2008 Tribunal could have exercised its discretionary powers to exclude evidence recanvassing the issues resolved in the 2001 Tribunal decision ( Power at 526 citing Re Quinn ). No issue as to the Tribunal's discretionary power was raised in Power .</text>

<tocase>Re Rana and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (2008) 104 ALD 595</tocase>
<text>Ms Cheung relies upon the "flexible" approach that the Tribunal may take in considering matters before it. That, she says, includes the ability simply to apply an earlier decision of the Tribunal. She points out that in Re Rana and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (2008) 104 ALD 595 , Deputy President Forgie concluded that an applicant should not be permitted to rehearse the circumstances of his employment a further time or to challenge findings that had been made about the circumstances of his employment and the compensability of his conditions and in respect of which the Tribunal had affirmed previous reviewable decisions. The Deputy President concluded in that case that, under s 33(1)(c) of the AAT Act, the Tribunal would inform itself as to the circumstances of the applicant's employment and of the conditions he suffered by reference to the findings of fact made by the earlier Tribunals and that she would not permit the parties to lead further evidence on these matters. She stated that any evidence given should be directed to establishing the necessary causal links between the facts as found by those previous Tribunals and the conditions now claimed by the applicant (at [134] to [137]). However, as is apparent in Re Rana , the context was a situation where events had been comprehensively considered in previous Tribunal decisions, the applicant applied for compensation in relation to the same set of events as in previous cases, those earlier decisions had either not been challenged or had been considered on appeal and no error of law in the findings of fact had been found. The circumstances in Re Rana formed the basis for the Tribunal's conclusions in that case.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/87.html</AustLII>
<text>In Telstra Corporation Ltd v Hannaford [2006] FCAFC 87 ; (2006) 151 FCR 253 at [57] , the statutory scheme was described by Conti J (with whom Heerey and Dowsett JJ agreed) as allowing for: 
 ... progressive and evolving decision-making giving effect to the provisions of ongoing review of relief or entitlements in the nature of course of workers compensation, being review which allows for adjustment or change in the light of events and circumstances which may subsequently happen. 

 
This may empower the Tribunal to make findings of fact ' that effectively undercut the necessary findings of fact made in the initial or original decision ... to accept liability ' (at [59]).

The Tribunal is not excluded from revisiting and making its own findings on questions of fact that have been the subject of findings by a prior Tribunal in an application to review a different reviewable decision. Until the subsequent decision is made, the earlier decision remains in operation.

Australia Post relies on the conduct of the hearing before the 2008 Tribunal. It points out that Ms Cheung's counsel was on notice that it was in issue whether she suffered any injury which gave rise to liability. The 2008 Tribunal made it clear that it was going to rehear medical evidence on that issue, including fresh medical evidence that was not before the 2001 Tribunal, and there was no application to exclude that evidence. Nor was an application made to the 2008 Tribunal to treat the decision of the 2001 Tribunal as determinative of the conclusions to be drawn. There was no application to exclude any evidence concerning the subject matter of the 2001 Tribunal decision. There was no application to exclude evidence going to the issue of causation of Ms Cheung's left shoulder condition or her neck and right shoulder condition.</text>
