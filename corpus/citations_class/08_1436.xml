<tocase>Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/72.html</AustLII>
<text>483 Telstra submits that procedural fairness requires a decision-maker to disclose to an interested party the substance of material that is significant, relevant, credible and obtained from a source other than that party (citing Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 ( Kioa v West) and Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 ( VEAL )). As formulated, the submission is based on the High Court judgment in VEAL at [14]-[18] which refers to the judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West at 628-629. Brennan J there referred to adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant which the decision-maker possesses and proposes to take into account. VEAL concerned an unsolicited letter from a third party which had been forwarded by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

484 In my respectful opinion neither Kioa v West nor VEAL is of direct relevance to the present case, which is not one of "information" of the kind referred to in them. The relevant information that ACCC "possessed" was that Telstra had implemented a churn process that required the participation of both the losing and gaining access seekers, and that neither Telstra (Bigpond) nor Request were participants in that process. This information came from Telstra or was at least known to Telstra. Furthermore, Telstra knew that ACCC's objective was to avoid disconnection charges in the case of an end-user switching service providers, and the information referred to was of obvious relevance to that objective. The procedural fairness issue raised in the present case concerns the solution arrived at and the reasoning process that led to it. This is a different area of discourse from that of information received by a decision-maker from a third party.</text>

<text>209 The particular criterion relevant to the present circumstances is whether it is probable to the required degree that the additional evidence will affect the result. There is not a single formulation in the cases as to the degree of probability required.

 In situations where a hearing has concluded but judgment has been reserved and not delivered, it has been said that fresh evidence should be admitted only when it is so material that the interests of justice require it; the evidence is believed would most probably affect the result; ...

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<text>391 Both parties refer to Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 ( Bond ) in which Mason CJ discussed whether a finding of fact can constitute a reviewable decision, and when a finding of fact can constitute an error of law that contributes to a reviewable decision.

392 In respect of both, Mason CJ stated (at 340-341):
 ... in ordinary circumstances, a finding of fact, including an inference drawn from primary facts, will not constitute a reviewable decision because it will be no more that a step along the way to an ultimate determination. Of course an ultimate determination which depends upon a finding of fact vitiated by error of law or made without evidence is reviewable: see s. 5(1)(f) and (h) [of the ADJR Act]. In such a case the finding of fact may be challenged as an element in the review of the ultimate determination.

393 His Honour went on to explain when a decision involves an error of law (at 353):
 A decision does not "involve" an error of law unless the error is material to the decision in the sense that it contributes to it so that, but for the error, the decision would have been, or might have been, different. The critical question on this aspect of the case is whether, but for the alleged error of law ... the decision might have been different by reason of the possibility that the Tribunal would not have made the findings of fact ... [that] were made.

394 Later in his Honour's reasons, the Chief Justice stated (at 355) that findings of fact, including inferences, will have involved an error of law where there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the finding (see s 5(1)(h) of the ADJR Act). His Honour noted (again at 355) that the question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact, or whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed, is a question of law, and that in the context of judicial review it has been accepted that the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. After quoting from Menzies J in Reg v District Court; Ex parte White [1966] HCA 69 ; (1966) 116 CLR 644 at 654, Mason CJ concluded (at 356) that according to the Australian authorities, at common law want of logic is not synonymous with error of law, and that so long as an inference is reasonably open, even if drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review for error of law.

395 In oral submissions, senior counsel for Telstra stated that Telstra relied on the "common law no evidence" ground as expressed by Mason CJ in Bond .

396 As mentioned previously, Telstra submits that there was no evidence to support ACCC's finding that Telstra was already fully recovering its line costs.

397 Although Telstra accepts that ACCC had expressed its view that Telstra was recovering its line costs at various times prior to the making of the Final Determination, it contends that it would be unsafe to assume that the support for that view continued to be available at the time of the Final Determination. For example, Telstra notes that the ADC (referred to at [351] above) had been "discontinued" (see ACCC's Final Determination for model price terms and conditions of the PSTN, ULLS and LCS services of October 2003, section 8.8, pp 60-61). Although at the time of its discontinuance, ACCC concluded that Telstra would still recover its line costs even without the ADC, Telstra's point is that Telstra operates in a "dynamic industry" and that its line costs and sources of recovery may change over time.

409 If I had found that Telstra was denied procedural fairness, or that ACCC had made an error of law, Telstra would still need to show that there was at least a possibility that a different result might have been reached: Bond at 353; ex parte Aala at [80].</text>

<tocase>Broussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 21 FCR 472</tocase>
<text>485 A party liable to be directly affected by a decision (such as Telstra) is, however, entitled to have its mind directed to the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn ( Kioa v West at 587; Sinnathamby v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1986) 66 ALR 502 at 517; Broussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 21 FCR 472 at 481-482; Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389 ; (1991) 31 FCR 100 ( Somaghi ) at 108). This does not mean that the party is entitled to have its mind directed to the provisional views of the decision-maker so that it may have a further opportunity of criticising the decision-maker's mental processes before a final decision is reached ( Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 590-592). Similarly, a decision-maker is not required to alert parties to "evaluative conclusions" on the material before the decision-maker ( Somaghi at 108). What the rules of procedural fairness require depends on the statutory framework and the facts and circumstances of the particular case: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [26] .

<text>518 Jurisdictional error occurs where a decision-maker fails to exercise the jurisdiction it has by making or refusing to make an order or decision by reason of "a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction" ( Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177). In Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416 at 420, Jordan CJ said that there was a failure to exercise jurisdiction where the decision-maker "misunderstand[s] the nature of the jurisdiction which [he or she] is to exercise, and ... appl[ies] a 'wrong and inadmissible test' ... or ... 'misconceive[s his or her] duty,' ... or '[fails] to apply [himself or herself] to the question which the law prescribes' ... or '... misunderstand[s] the nature of the opinion which [he or she] is to form'".

<text>208 The ultimate question for the Court is whether it is in the interests of justice that the further evidence be admitted (see, for example, Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; Daniel v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 849 ; (2004) 138 FCR 254 ( Daniel ) at 269; Urban Transit Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 at 478-479 (per Clarke JA, Mahoney &amp; Meagher JJA agreeing); Dumitrov v SC Johnson and Son Superannuation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 42 at [7] ).

<tocase>East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 239 ALR 50</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/44.html</AustLII>
<text>116 Telstra refers to East Australian Pipeline Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] HCA 44 ; (2007) 239 ALR 50. The factual context was not alien to that of the present case "a national access regime for gas pipeline systems within the framework of a national competition policy" (headnote, p 50). The facts and legislation are complex. Central to the issue for decision was s 8.10 of the National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems contained in Schedule 2 to the Gas Pipelines Access (South Australia) Act 1997 (SA). Section 8.10 listed in paras (a) to (k) eleven factors that were required to be considered when the initial capital base of certain pipelines was being established by a "Relevant Regulator".

117 The High Court held that the Australian Competition Tribunal had not erred in taking as its starting point, and giving priority to, known valuation methodologies identified in the early paragraphs of paras (a) to (k).

118 The case is not authority for the proposition that para (d), for example, of s 152CR(1) must be accorded priority over the matters identified in the other paragraphs of that subsection. The most that can be said is that the case shows that the correct approach to a list of mandatory relevant considerations can lead to priority properly being given to particular matters in the list.</text>

<text>214 In the context of a failure to accord procedural fairness, Telstra refers to Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 , where the Court stated (at 147):
 ... if the Full Court is properly to be understood as saying no more than that a new trial would probably make no difference to the result, their Honours failed to apply the correct criterion. All that the appellant needed to show was that the denial of natural justice deprived him of the possibility of a successful outcome. In order to negate that possibility, it was, as we have said, necessary for the Full Court to find that a properly conducted trial could not possibly have produced a different result. [my emphasis] 
The "possibility of a different result" was also referred to in the context of alleged failure to accord procedural fairness by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 ( ex parte Aala ) at 116-117, and by myself (Jenkinson J agreeing) in Girretti v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 70 FCR 151 at 166.</text>

<tocase>Idonz Pty Ltd v National Capital Development Commission (1986) 13 FCR 70</tocase>
<text>210 In Idonz Pty Ltd v National Capital Development Commission (1986) 13 FCR 70 ( Idonz ), the Court refused an application by the respondents to an appeal to reopen the hearing of the appeal to allow them to call fresh evidence. One reason given by Fox J, with whom Everett J agreed, was that the evidence had been available when the appeal was heard. Other reasons given by Woodward J (in relation to the application by the second and third respondents) were that the evidence would be complex, contested and not appropriate for consideration by an appellate court, and that the evidence would have added little probative value to material already before the Court and would have related only to the possible exercise of discretion against the appellant if it were otherwise successful in its appeal.

211 Idonz is both different from and similar to the present case. In the present case, the evidence is sought to be tendered at trial, was not available at the time of hearing, and consists simply of two documents. On the other hand, the evidence relates to the possible exercise of discretion against Telstra if it were otherwise successful on Telstra's Cost Model G\rounds. Moreover, as appears below, complex questions as to the probative value of those documents are raised.

212 Telstra submits that Request erroneously states the test as to the circumstances in which relief may be refused on discretionary grounds where a judicial review ground vitiating a decision (relevantly, a failure to take into account a relevant consideration and a denial of procedural fairness) is established. Telstra submits that to ask whether it "would have made any difference" if that ground had not existed involves legal error.

213 Telstra submits that where there is a failure to take into account a relevant consideration, relief will be refused only if that consideration was so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision. I referred to the relevant authorities in relation to a failure to take into account a relevant consideration at [192] above.</text>

<tocase>Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<text>179 Telstra points to the fact that no officer of ACCC was called to give evidence that regard was had to the two Spreadsheets. Telstra refers to the "rule of evidence" associated with Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 305, 308, 320-321. That rule has been recognised as having scope for operation in applications for judicial review of administrative decisions: see the authorities cited in Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v State of Western Australia (1996) 67 FCR 40 at 61. In that case the Full Court stated (at 62):
 The application of the rule requires ... that there be inferences available from the evidence which favour the other party. The failure of the Minister to call evidence does not provide positive evidence that he did not consider the representation but, unexplained, it leaves the Court in a position where opposing inferences can be more confidently drawn because they stand uncontradicted by the person who could say something about the true state of the facts: Jones v Dunkel at 308. The question then is what inferences were open on the evidence.

182 I therefore do not think the principle recognised in Jones v Dunkel is appropriately invoked in the present circumstances. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Western Australia is distinguishable. Unlike ACCC, the Minister was not arbitrating a dispute pursuant to an arbitration regime laid down by statute.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>483 Telstra submits that procedural fairness requires a decision-maker to disclose to an interested party the substance of material that is significant, relevant, credible and obtained from a source other than that party (citing Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 ( Kioa v West) and Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 225 CLR 88 ( VEAL )). As formulated, the submission is based on the High Court judgment in VEAL at [14]-[18] which refers to the judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West at 628-629. Brennan J there referred to adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant which the decision-maker possesses and proposes to take into account. VEAL concerned an unsolicited letter from a third party which had been forwarded by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

484 In my respectful opinion neither Kioa v West nor VEAL is of direct relevance to the present case, which is not one of "information" of the kind referred to in them. The relevant information that ACCC "possessed" was that Telstra had implemented a churn process that required the participation of both the losing and gaining access seekers, and that neither Telstra (Bigpond) nor Request were participants in that process. This information came from Telstra or was at least known to Telstra. Furthermore, Telstra knew that ACCC's objective was to avoid disconnection charges in the case of an end-user switching service providers, and the information referred to was of obvious relevance to that objective. The procedural fairness issue raised in the present case concerns the solution arrived at and the reasoning process that led to it. This is a different area of discourse from that of information received by a decision-maker from a third party.

485 A party liable to be directly affected by a decision (such as Telstra) is, however, entitled to have its mind directed to the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn ( Kioa v West at 587; Sinnathamby v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1986) 66 ALR 502 at 517; Broussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 21 FCR 472 at 481-482; Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389 ; (1991) 31 FCR 100 ( Somaghi ) at 108). This does not mean that the party is entitled to have its mind directed to the provisional views of the decision-maker so that it may have a further opportunity of criticising the decision-maker's mental processes before a final decision is reached ( Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 590-592). Similarly, a decision-maker is not required to alert parties to "evaluative conclusions" on the material before the decision-maker ( Somaghi at 108). What the rules of procedural fairness require depends on the statutory framework and the facts and circumstances of the particular case: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [26] .

<tocase>Martincevic v Commonwealth (2007) 164 FCR 45</tocase>
<text>192 The relevant test was described by Mason J in Peko-Wallsend at 40:
 Not every consideration that a decision-maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re-exercised according to law. A factor might be so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision. 
More recently, a Full Court of this Court in Martincevic v Commonwealth (2007) 164 FCR 45 observed (at [68]) that:
 It is not for the court to guess what view [the decision-maker] would have taken of the report and its significance. It is enough that it cannot be said that the failure to have regard to the report was so insignificant that it could not have materially affected the decision.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>121 In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 ( Peko-Wallsend ), Mason J emphasised (at 41) that it is generally a matter for the decision-maker and not for a court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the respective matters that are required to be taken into account in the exercise of a statutory power. His Honour noted that in some circumstances a court may set aside an administrative decision which has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but that in such a case the relevant ground of review is not the failure to take into account a relevant consideration or the taking into account of an irrelevant one, but that the decision is "manifestly unreasonable". Telstra does not rely upon a ground of manifest unreasonableness.

122 Section 152CR(1) provides that in making a final determination ACCC must take into account the seven matters listed in paras (a)-(g) of that subsection and s 152CR(2) provides that ACCC may take into account any other matters that it thinks are relevant. Also, s 152AQA(6) provides that ACCC must have regard to the LSS Pricing Principles if it is required to arbitrate an access dispute. The factor that should be given "fundamental weight" as against the others is the LTIE mentioned in para (a) of s 152CR(1) because s 152AB(1) provides that the object of Part XIC is "to promote the [LTIE]...".

123 "Telstra's cost model" to which Grounds 1, 2(a) and 3 refer, is described in an affidavit of Iain Robert Little, Group Manager Economic Analysis for Telstra, as comprising two Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets on a CD which estimate Telstra's top-down LSS-specific costs and calculate a per-unit cost for the LSS. Telstra provided the CD to ACCC. The words and figures on each of the two Spreadsheets constituted only a short vertical column or table. In the hard copy version in evidence, each occupied about half a page.

157 Request points out that Telstra can succeed on the "relevant consideration" ground only if ACCC was bound to take Telstra's cost model into account and that doing so "could" or "might" have had a material impact on the outcome: see Peko-Wallsend at 30-31 (Gibbs CJ); 39-40 (Mason J).

158 Section 152CR(2) allowed ACCC to take into account any matters it thought relevant. In Peko-Wallsend at 39-40, Mason J stated that where factors to be considered enumerated in a statute are not exhaustive, the Court should turn to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute in determining what matters a decision-maker is bound to take into account. Telstra submits that in the present case this approach leads to a conclusion that ACCC was bound to take into account Telstra's cost model because it was central to the issues that ACCC was required to determine and to matters that it was expressly obliged to take into account, for example Telstra's "direct cost" of providing access to the LSS (see s 152CR(1)(d)).

159 In its submissions, Telstra did not draw a clear distinction between the course of reasoning by which it contends that s 152CR(2) coupled with general law principles produced the result that ACCC was bound to take into account Telstra's cost model, and the course of reasoning by which it contends that s 152CR(1)(d) produced that result.

160 I turn now to the duty imposed by s 152DB(1)(b). Telstra submits that s 152DB(1)(b) (set out at [42] above) supports its case while Request submits that, if anything, it assists the respondents. Provisions such as s 152DB(1)(b) are troublesome. It is questionable whether ultimately they have any effect at all in shaping the duty incumbent on a decision-maker. The starting point in s 152DB(1)(b) is a legislative demand for speed, but apparently someone appreciated that speed can come at too great a cost, and so the demand for speed is reduced to a demand that ACCC "must act [only] as speedily as a proper consideration of the dispute allows". In order to make it plain that excessive speed is to be shunned, it is acknowledged that ACCC must inquire into and investigate the dispute "carefully". Apparently it is then thought that too much care may detract from the desideratum of speed, so the words "and quickly" are added after "carefully". Adding to the confusion is the legislature's comprehensive demand that ACCC "inquire into and investigate the dispute and all matters affecting the merits, and fair settlement, of the dispute" (my emphasis). The demand is that ACCC inquire into and investigate all matters affecting the merits of the dispute and all matters affecting the fair settlement of the dispute.

192 The relevant test was described by Mason J in Peko-Wallsend at 40:
 Not every consideration that a decision-maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re-exercised according to law. A factor might be so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision. 
More recently, a Full Court of this Court in Martincevic v Commonwealth (2007) 164 FCR 45 observed (at [68]) that:
 It is not for the court to guess what view [the decision-maker] would have taken of the report and its significance. It is enough that it cannot be said that the failure to have regard to the report was so insignificant that it could not have materially affected the decision.

561 Second, in exercising the discretion under s 152DNA(7)(b), ACCC must take into account relevant considerations that ACCC is required to take into account in the light of the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act (citing Peko-Wallsend at 39-40 in support of this proposition). True backdating under s 152DNA(1) is merely adjectival to the making of a final determination under s 152CP and ACCC is required to take into account the matters specified in s 152CR(1) both when making the final determination and when exercising its discretion in respect of backdating that determination. According to Telstra, if this were not so, backdating could undermine ACCC's findings and its balancing of the matters identified in s 152CR(1). 
 Resolution

562 In my opinion, cl 5A(i) was not merely an exercise of the backdating power to which s 152DNA(7) applied, and s 152CR(1) and s 152AQA(6) did not apply.

563 There is a distinction between the backdating power contained in s 152DNA(1) and the power to decide upon the substantive provisions of a final determination that is recognised in s 152CR(1) and (2) on the one hand, and s 152DNA(7) on the other. The latter is addressed to substantive provisions which it assumes have been decided upon following the application of the s 152CR(1) and (2) criteria.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v State of Western Australia (1996) 67 FCR 40</tocase>
<text>179 Telstra points to the fact that no officer of ACCC was called to give evidence that regard was had to the two Spreadsheets. Telstra refers to the "rule of evidence" associated with Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 305, 308, 320-321. That rule has been recognised as having scope for operation in applications for judicial review of administrative decisions: see the authorities cited in Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v State of Western Australia (1996) 67 FCR 40 at 61. In that case the Full Court stated (at 62):
 The application of the rule requires ... that there be inferences available from the evidence which favour the other party. The failure of the Minister to call evidence does not provide positive evidence that he did not consider the representation but, unexplained, it leaves the Court in a position where opposing inferences can be more confidently drawn because they stand uncontradicted by the person who could say something about the true state of the facts: Jones v Dunkel at 308. The question then is what inferences were open on the evidence.

182 I therefore do not think the principle recognised in Jones v Dunkel is appropriately invoked in the present circumstances. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Western Australia is distinguishable. Unlike ACCC, the Minister was not arbitrating a dispute pursuant to an arbitration regime laid down by statute.</text>

 Telstra's Ground 1 
 
 To what extent, if at all, did ACCC in fact engage with the Telstra cost model?

168 Request puts its submission that ACCC engaged with Telstra's cost model in two ways. First, it submits that it should be inferred that ACCC did in fact read the Spreadsheets on the CD, but did not appreciate that they were the complete or final version of Telstra's cost model that was referred to in Telstra's submissions. Second, it submits that the FD Statement of Reasons shows that ACCC took into account the essential features of Telstra's cost model that were reflected in the Spreadsheets, even if it did not read the Spreadsheets themselves.

169 Request submits that the passages from the FD Statement of Reasons on which Telstra relies (section 4.1.8, the relevant extracts from which were set out at [152] and [153] above) show only that ACCC considered that it had not received from Telstra the complete or full version of Telstra's cost model that it was expecting to receive. Request argues that Telstra ignores the heading's use of the word "Summary" and the simplistic nature of the two Spreadsheets which Telstra now characterises as constituting the cost model.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/32.html</AustLII>
<text>113 In support of this "fundamental weight" submission, Telstra relies on R v Hunt; ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322 ( Sean Investments ) which concerned s 40AA(7) of the National Health Act 1953 (Cth). That Act provided for the approval of premises as nursing homes, and made approval subject to a condition that the fees charged in respect of nursing home care of a "qualified nursing home patient" would not exceed fees payable in accordance with a scale determined by the Permanent Head of the relevant Department. Section 40AA(7) directed the Permanent Head to "have regard to costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in the nursing home".

114 Mason J held that those words required the Permanent Head to take those costs into account and "to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making his determination" (at 329). His Honour gave two reasons for this conclusion. First, they were the only matter explicitly mentioned as a matter required to be taken into account, and second, the scheme of the provisions was that once premises were approved as a nursing home, the proprietor was bound by the conditions of approval not to exceed the scale of fees fixed. His Honour observed that in many cases it was to be expected that the scale of fees would be fixed by reference to the costs necessarily incurred plus a profit factor, and that in the nature of things the costs necessarily incurred were a fundamental matter for consideration.

115 Sean Investments is distinguishable. It is readily understandable that the fees to be fixed must cover the costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in the particular nursing home. Approval of the particular nursing home would be frustrated if the level of fees permitted to be charged did not cover those costs. In the present case, there are a range of factors that ACCC is required to take into account.</text>

<tocase>R v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/13.html</AustLII>
<text>102 ACCC made submissions only in relation to issues of law of general importance relating to its power and procedures under the Act, and other exceptional matters. ACCC referred to the principles established in R v The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 ( Hardiman ) at 35-36 as the reason for its limited participation. ACCC's submissions related to aspects of Section A (Telstra's Cost Model), Section B (Invalidity of Final Determination) and Section F (Disconnection Charges, Backdating and the "No Charge Period"). (ACCC also addressed submissions to Telstra's Ground 11, but, as noted previously, that ground is no longer relevant).

103 Request concedes that the Final Determination is amenable to review under the ADJR Act. No party addressed submissions independently to s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act). In its written closing submissions, Request for the first time submitted that it was "unlikely" that the Court had jurisdiction under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act on the ground that ACCC, as distinct from its Commissioners, was not an "officer of the Commonwealth". Nothing turns on the point. In addition to its jurisdiction under the ADJR Act, the Court has relevant jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 163A of the Act.

104 Within Div 8, the "Arbitration of access disputes" is the subject matter of Subdiv C (ss 152CO-152CU) and the "Procedure in arbitrations" is the subject matter of Subdiv D (ss 152CV-152DMA).

180 Request responds by referring to the limited role permitted to a decision-maker such as ACCC in defending its decisions: see Hardiman at 35-36. The role of ACCC is one of arbitrating an access dispute between a carrier or carriage service provider and an access seeker.

181 In my opinion, the counsel given to administrative tribunals by the High Court in Hardiman applied to ACCC in that role. As noted at [102] above, ACCC has led no evidence, and has made submissions only on particular issues that it has perceived to be of general importance in relation to its powers and procedures. ACCC informed Request and Telstra prior to the hearing that it would act in accordance with Hardiman . It was open to Telstra or Request to subpoena ACCC officers to attend to give evidence or to produce documents. The absence of more direct evidence of the course of ACCC's deliberations is not to count against either of them more than it is against the other.</text>

<tocase>Re Michael; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511</tocase>
<text>19 On the hearing there was a suggestion that there may be a difference between a legislative requirement to "take into account" something and a legislative requirement to "have regard" to something, one being more demanding than the other. I do not agree (see Re Michael; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 ; (2002) 24 ATPR 41-886 ( Epic Energy ) at [55]). I am not persuaded by the fact that within Pt XIC itself the legislature has sometimes used one expression and sometimes the other (compare, for example, s 152AB(2) at [17] above and s 152CR at [40] below). I will use the expressions interchangeably.

20 It will be noted that subs (3) of s 152AB makes the list in subs (2) an exhaustive list of the matters to which regard may be had for the purpose of determining whether a particular thing promotes the LTIE.

21 Subsections (4) and (6) of s 152AB identify certain matters to which regard must be had in connection with the subs (2)(c) and (e) considerations respectively, but subss (5) and (7) respectively make it clear that subss (4) and (6) do not limit the matters to which regard may be had.

<text>518 Jurisdictional error occurs where a decision-maker fails to exercise the jurisdiction it has by making or refusing to make an order or decision by reason of "a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or disregard of the nature or limits of jurisdiction" ( Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177). In Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416 at 420, Jordan CJ said that there was a failure to exercise jurisdiction where the decision-maker "misunderstand[s] the nature of the jurisdiction which [he or she] is to exercise, and ... appl[ies] a 'wrong and inadmissible test' ... or ... 'misconceive[s his or her] duty,' ... or '[fails] to apply [himself or herself] to the question which the law prescribes' ... or '... misunderstand[s] the nature of the opinion which [he or she] is to form'".

<text>485 A party liable to be directly affected by a decision (such as Telstra) is, however, entitled to have its mind directed to the critical issue or factor on which the administrative decision is likely to turn ( Kioa v West at 587; Sinnathamby v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1986) 66 ALR 502 at 517; Broussard v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 21 FCR 472 at 481-482; Somaghi v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs [1991] FCA 389 ; (1991) 31 FCR 100 ( Somaghi ) at 108). This does not mean that the party is entitled to have its mind directed to the provisional views of the decision-maker so that it may have a further opportunity of criticising the decision-maker's mental processes before a final decision is reached ( Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1074 ; (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 590-592). Similarly, a decision-maker is not required to alert parties to "evaluative conclusions" on the material before the decision-maker ( Somaghi at 108). What the rules of procedural fairness require depends on the statutory framework and the facts and circumstances of the particular case: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152 at [26] .

<tocase>Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451</tocase>
<text>184 Telstra submits that in order for ACCC to take Telstra's cost model into account, it had to engage in an "active intellectual process" in relation to it. In support, Telstra refers to Tickner v Chapman (1995) 57 FCR 451 at 462, 464 per Black CJ and Tobacco Institute of Australia v National Health and Medical Research Council (1996) 71 FCR 265 at 277-279 per Finn J.

185 As Black CJ observed in Tickner v Chapman (at 462-463), "[t]he degree of effort that the consideration of a particular representation may involve will of course vary according to its length, its content and its degree of relevance".

186 The question arises whether, in the light of my factual conclusions above, ACCC's consideration of Telstra's cost model was sufficient to amount to an "active intellectual process". More specifically, did an "active intellectual process" require ACCC to manipulate or sensitivity test Telstra's cost model?

187 Telstra points to statements made by ACCC in the context of ACCC's consideration of similar cost models in regulatory matters, which Telstra says demonstrate the importance that ACCC places on sensitivity testing in order to gauge the value of cost models. In my view, evidence of this kind shows only that in the circumstances of those matters and those models ACCC considered that sensitivity testing assumed some importance.</text>

<text>208 The ultimate question for the Court is whether it is in the interests of justice that the further evidence be admitted (see, for example, Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 at [24] ; Daniel v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 849 ; (2004) 138 FCR 254 ( Daniel ) at 269; Urban Transit Authority of NSW v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 at 478-479 (per Clarke JA, Mahoney &amp; Meagher JJA agreeing); Dumitrov v SC Johnson and Son Superannuation Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] NSWSC 42 at [7] ).</text>
