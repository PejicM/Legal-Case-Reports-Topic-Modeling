<tocase>Harris v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1983] FCA 242 ; (1983) 50 ALR 551</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1983/242.html</AustLII>
<text>The s 9(2) obligation to make s 9(1) documents available is not unqualified. Relevantly for present purposes, s 9(4) does not require the making available of a s 9(1) document containing "exempt matter" (the term "exempt document" to which this refers is defined in s 4(1)), though it does require, where practicable, the making available of a redacted version excluding that matter. I would note in passing that, whether or not identifying a s 9(1) document itself involves the making of a decision this is considered below the making available of it necessarily involves a decision that it does not contain exempt matter: see Harris v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1983] FCA 242 ; (1983) 50 ALR 551 at 558.

Though only relevant as providing part of the context of s 9, s 10(1) of the Act is noteworthy as providing some legislative recognition that documents may not have been made available or included in a statement, despite the requirements of s 9. Section 10(1) provides: 
 
 " 10 Unpublished documents not to prejudice public 
 

 
 
 (1) If a document required to be made available in accordance with section 9 , being a document containing a rule, guideline or practice relating to a function of an agency, was not made available, or was not included in a statement made available at each Information Access Office , as referred to in that section, before the time at which a person did, or omitted to do, any act or thing relevant to the performance of that function in relation to him or her (whether or not the time allowed for publication of a statement in respect of the document had expired before that time), that person, if he or she was not aware of that rule, guideline or practice at that time, shall not be subjected to any prejudice by reason only of the application of that rule, guideline or practice in relation to the thing done or omitted to be done by him or her if he or she could lawfully have avoided that prejudice had he or she been aware of that rule, guideline or practice."
 (Emphasis added.) 
 
 The AD(JR) Act

The claim prosecuted now by Mr Duncan relates to s 13 of the AD(JR) Act. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that, subject to specified exceptions, s 13(1) provides that where a person makes a decision to which the Act applies, any person who is entitled to apply to this Court or to the Federal Magistrates Court under s 5 in relation to the decision may, by giving written notice to the decision maker, request that person to provide him or her a statement in writing setting out the findings on material questions of fact relating to that decision, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based and giving reasons for the decision.

A person who is "aggrieved" by a decision to which the Act applies may apply for an order of review of that decision on the grounds specified in s 5 of the AD(JR) Act. I would note in passing that one of Centrelink's bases for opposing Mr Duncan's application is that Mr Duncan is not a "person aggrieved" for s 5 purposes, hence he was not entitled to make a s 13(1) request in any event. It is equally contended that the CEO (or his delegate) makes no "decision" for AD(JR) Act purposes when performing the function imposed by s 9 of the Act. Other Matters

I earlier noted that the CEO did not, as s 13(3) of the AD(JR) Act requires, give Mr Duncan a notice that the CEO was of the opinion that he was not entitled to make his latter two requests. Absent such a notice Mr Duncan could not apply to this Court under s 13(4A) of the Act for an order that he was entitled to make a s 13(1) request. It would seem that for this reason, he has sought declaratory relief to the same end under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Additionally, no reliance has been sought to be placed upon the provisions of s 7(2) of the AD(JR) Act.

It is common ground that the provisions of s 26 of the FOI Act (which relate to the provision of reasons for a decision refusing to grant access to a document to which access had been requested) is of no present relevance. I would note in passing that s 13(1) of the AD(JR) Act does not apply to such a refusal decision: see s 26(1A) of the FOI Act.

One final matter of statutory and jurisdictional significance that I should mention arises out of observations I made at the hearing of Centrelink's strike out motion. In giving Mr Duncan leave to file an amended application I expressed the view that what, possibly, he was seeking was an order that the CEO discharge the statutory obligation imposed by s 9. Relief to that end has not been sought in the present application. Rather the relief sought is the provision of a statement of reasons in relation variously to a decision that the FOI manual was not one to which s 9 applied and/or a decision to prepare a s 9(2)(b) statement which did not list all documents of the types enumerated in s 9(1).</text>

<text>Subject to what I have to say below, I am prepared to assume for present purposes, that, given his apparently ongoing disputes with Centrelink, Mr Duncan has had a special interest in the proper performance of the statutory obligations imposed by s 9 above that of an ordinary member of the public: see Australian Conservation Foundation Inc v Commonwealth (1980) 146 CLR 493 at 547-548; Bateman's Bay Local Aboriginal Land Council v The Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund Pty Ltd [1998] HCA 49 ; (1998) 194 CLR 247 at 261; insofar as those obligations relate both to the making available of, and to including in the s 9(2)(b) statements, documents used in Centrelink's making decisions or recommendations concerning him. I am, in consequence, prepared to assume that he could have been "a person aggrieved" if, for the purposes of s 5(1) of the AD(JR) Act, the CEO had taken a "decision" to which s 5 applied: see Mark v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1991] FCA 570 ; (1991) 32 FCR 476 at 477.</text>

<tocase>Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50</tocase>
<text>I do not consider that Mr Duncan has, throughout, been acting simply as "an effective and faithful representative of the public interest in due administration of the [FOI Act]": Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50 at 84; notwithstanding that he has made comments suggesting this in his affidavits. I would also note that s 10(1) of the FOI Act, to which I earlier referred, lends support to the view that a person could in fact be prejudiced by the reliance by a decision maker on a document not made publicly available, or included in the s 9(2)(b) statement, when making a decision in relation to that person.

Secondly, I am prepared to assume (a) that, subject to the s 9(4) exempt matter question, the FOI Manual was of such character that it ought to have been made available to the public and to have been specified in the 2006 statement as Centrelink, through Ms Terry's evidence, seems to accept; and (b) that its non-inclusion in the documents made available could found an application under s 5(1) of the AD(JR) Act by an aggrieved person, if such resulted from a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment.

For the reasons I will shortly give, I am satisfied that, in discharge of the s 9 obligations, a decision making process was adopted for which the CEO was responsible and that a decision of a type that was amenable to AD(JR) Act review was taken by Ms Terry for the CEO which resulted both in the omission of the FOI Manual from the documents made publicly available and in no reference being made to it in the statement.</text>

<tocase>Peverill v Meir (1990) 95 ALR 401</tocase>
<text>The intent of s 9 is obvious enough. It is to have made publicly available for inspection and purchase documents having the characteristics prescribed in s 9(1), though subject (inter alia) to exceptions as in s 9(4). Moreover, it is mandatory in its requirement. The exceptions apart, no discretion is given as to whether documents having those characteristics will be made available, i.e. whether the s 9(2)(a) function ought be performed at all or in a given instance, but then a discretion is not the necessary requirement for a decision to which the AD(JR) Act applies: see s 3(1) "decision to which this Act applies". Provided a decision is of an administrative character required to be made under an enactment, that suffices: cf Peverill v Meir (1990) 95 ALR 401 at 421.</text>

<tocase>Guss v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/88.html</AustLII>
<text>It is, in my view, improbable that Parliament intended s 9(1) as identifying objective facts on which s 9(2)(a) would operate rather than as setting criteria which, though largely factual in character, does involve deliberative evaluation and could give rise to questions of judgment and degree (e.g. was a document "used by the agency or its officers" in the manners specified and for the purposes specified). When coupled with the need to negative the operation of s 9(4) before making the determination to make a document available, s 9(2)(a) clearly required that a mental process be engaged in requiring the application of consideration to a variety of matters posed by the s 9(1) criteria and by the s 9(4) exception before reaching a decision which had its external manifestation in the s 9(2)(b) statement. That determination, in a practical sense, ordained whether or not a document would be made available for public inspection and purchase. I am not in this suggesting that there was a decision made under s 9(2)(b) to make available the statement specifying the s 9(2)(a) documents. That action itself did not emanate from a deliberative or reasoning process: cf Guss v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88 at [75] , [82]. It was simply a routine mechanical (or ministerial) act that was required to be done. Rather, I am of the view that the s 9(2)(b) statement was the formal manifestation of the CEO's decisions as to the documents that were required to be made available under s 9(2)(a).

Further, the CEO's decision was "of an administrative character made under an enactment". Its object was the ascertainment of the documents which members of the public would be entitled as of right under the Act to inspect and purchase. In this its administrative character was obvious enough.</text>

<tocase>Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/7.html</AustLII>
<text>In Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 , Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in commenting on the mirror "made under an enactment" formula of Queensland's Judicial Review Act 1991 (Qld), observed (at [89]): 
 
 "The determination of whether a decision is 'made ... under an enactment' involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment. A decision will only be 'made ... under an enactment' if both these criteria are met. It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise. Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question. Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice."
 (Emphasis in original.)

The statutory right presently in question was a right the FOI Act intended Mr Duncan to have as a member of the public. It was affected by the decision manifested in the non-inclusion of the FOI Manual in the 1 August 2006 statement. The travails he had in securing his statutory entitlement up until the decision to give him the manual evidence the possible significance of the right itself to a member of the public. He was denied that to which the Act gave him an entitlement.

Accordingly I would be satisfied that, but for the provision to Mr Duncan of the manual on 8 August 2006, and on the assumptions that I have been making, Mr Duncan would have been entitled to the declaration that he is now seeking, i.e. that he is entitled to the provision of a statement of reasons for the non-inclusion of the FOI Manual in the documents made available to the public under s 9(2)(a) of the Act, which was manifest in the 1 August 2006 statement. Nonetheless, as a matter of discretion, I am also satisfied that declaratory relief ought be refused.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1990/427.html</AustLII>
<text>Of immediately present relevance to the duty to provide reasons under s 13(1), the Court as a matter of discretion ought not, except in exceptional circumstances, make a declaration in relation to the entitlement to a s 13(1) statement where the decision to which the statement relates has been set aside, revoked or superseded: see United Airlines v Secretary, Department of Transport and Communications [1990] FCA 427 ; (1990) 26 FCR 598 at 607. The reason for this is that in such cases the "real question" will not relate to the failure to give reasons as such, but to the correctness or otherwise of an existing operative decision for which the reasons have been sought.

Having made all of the assumptions I have made in Mr Duncan's favour, he has not satisfied me that to make the declaration he seeks has real practical consequences. On 25 July 2006 he sought reasons for the decision not to make the manual available for inspection by members of the public. His complaint in substance, though, was that at that time he personally was aggrieved by the decision. On his making of that request, the CEO was likelihood bound to furnish that statement for the reasons I have given. I do not consider it necessary here to enter upon the question whether because of the decision of 21 July 2006 to give him the manual under s 9 he ceased to be aggrieved even though he was not aware of this decision until 27 June 2006, i.e. two days after he made his request for reasons. As with Hill J in United Airlines at 606-607, I incline to the view that duty once enlivened, was "not abrogated" by the later provision to him of the manual. What the later provision of the manual did, though, was to eliminate the substance of his grievance. He had been provided by the internal review officer in accordance with his s 9 entitlement with the manual to which he claimed the right to inspect and purchase. Mr Duncan has put on extensive evidence alleging ongoing causes of grievance to him. His complaint now is essentially that Centrelink still has not identified all the documents falling within s 9(1). The present is not an application for preliminary discovery with all of the conditions required to be satisfied before "information discovery" is allowed: see St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1360 ; (2004) 211 ALR 147 at [26] . My sole concern, as ultimately was accepted at the hearing, was with the manual and its non-provision.</text>
