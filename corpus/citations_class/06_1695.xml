<text>17 The test of whether a person 'had reasonable grounds to expect ... that the company would comply with the agreement' is an objective test. The issue is thus whether, having regard to those existing circumstances of which Mr Blaikie knew or, had he acted reasonably, ought to have known, it was reasonable for him to expect that Employment would comply with its Payment Agreement ( Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Saunig [2002] NSWCA 390 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 722 at 729-730). As Williams JA, with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed, observed in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo [2005] 2 Qd R 232 at [24]:
 
 'an agreement pursuant to s. 222ALA is not to be entered into lightly, and any director must be conscious of the implications for the company so doing. Almost invariably the company will be in some financial difficulty and any director acting reasonably would appreciate that special steps would need to be taken if the company was to comply with its obligations thereunder.'</text>
