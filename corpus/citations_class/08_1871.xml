<tocase>Aberdeen Construction Group Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1978) 52 TC 281</tocase>
<text>56 In the United Kingdom, the distinction between the 'value' of an asset and its 'state' or 'nature' was drawn in Aberdeen Construction Group Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1978) 52 TC 281 which was concerned, in part, with para 4(1)(b) of Sch 6 to the Finance Act 1965 (UK).

57 Section 160ZH(3)(c), which was introduced into the Act later in time is in similar, but not identical, terms to this UK provision. The taxpayer did point out that the first limb of the UK provision requires that expenditure be incurred on the asset, but I do not regard that a difference determinative of the issue before me and the way I consider the s 160ZH(3)(c) should be interpreted.

58 Under paragraph 4(1)(b) of Sch 6 of the UK provision, one of the sums allowable as a deduction in the computation of the gain accruing to a person on the disposal of an asset was:
 (b) the amount of any expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred on the asset by him or on his behalf for the purpose of enhancing the value of the asset, being expenditure reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of the disposal ...

59 In construing paragraph 4(1)(b), UK courts have indicated that the state or nature of a share does not include its value. In Aberdeen Construction 52 TC 281, Lord President Emslie found that expenditure by the taxpayer in the form of loans to a company that were later waived was not the kind of expenditure to which paragraph 4(1)(b) was directed and the paragraph was therefore not applicable. However, the Lord President went on to state (at 290):
 In any event, by no reasonable stretch of the imagination is it possible to classify the making of the loans or their waiver as expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred "on" the shares and I find it impossible to say that either were reflected in the state or nature of the shares which were sold. The waiver of the loans may well have enhanced their value but what para 4(1)(b) is looking for is, as the result of relevant expenditure, an identifiable change for the better in the state or nature of the asset, and this must be a change distinct from the enhancement of value.

60 Lord Avonside said that the loan 'may have enhanced [the share's] value in so far as it might give [the company] working capital helpful to its trading. When the loan was waived the shares remained in their state and nature unchanged' (at 294).

61 This issue was not considered by the House of Lords when the matter went on appeal, although the appeal was successful.

63 The Commissioner before me relied upon above passages in the UK authorities, and particularly the last sentence in Fenston's case. On the other hand, the taxpayer submitted that the UK authorities have no precedential value, either because in the case of Aberdeen the actual decision relied on was overturned by the House of Lords, and in the case of Fenston , the comments relied upon were clearly dicta. The taxpayer also contended that the dicta relied upon by the Commissioner before me in the above passages was wrong.

66 The comments therein relied upon by the Commissioner do support the approach to the concepts of 'value', and 'state or nature' included within similar legislation which accord with my own view of the operation of s 160ZH(3)(c). It may not have been strictly correct to refer (as was done by the Lord President in Aberdeen ) to 'an identifiable change', or a 'change distinct from the enhancement of value'. The UK provision, like s 160ZH(3)(c) does not specifically talk in terms of 'change', only the need for the expenditure being reflected in the state or nature of the asset. However, the clear approach taken by the UK authorities is to treat 'value' as a concept falling outside the concept of 'state or nature' in similarly worded legislation dealing with the same subject matter.

67 Finally, in the taxpayer's submission, excluding the capital contribution from the cost base of the NMUK shares would give rise to an anomalous result. Payments into shareholders' funds may take a variety of forms, including the purchase of shares, the payment of calls on shares, and as here, by the making of capital contributions. It was contended that to allow some of these payments to be taken into account in determining cost base, but not others (being the capital contribution), is not capable of rational explanation.

68 The Commissioner responded to this submission by contending that the exclusion of the capital expenditure of &#8356;42.912 million from the reduced cost base of the shares does not give rise to an anomalous result. It may be that the amount would have been part of the cost base if it had taken some other form. However, the way in which a company raises capital can take many forms, each with different taxing consequences. Moreover, it was submitted that the provision is not specific to cost base in respect of shares, but to assets generally. The way in which the taxpayer here determined to contribute capital to NMSLAL should not dictate the proper construction of the section because the taxpayer may have been able to secure the expenditure as part of the cost base if it had been done differently.</text>

<text>64 At the outset, I reject the Commissioner's submission that I should elevate the UK decisions or the dicta contained therein to decisions or dicta which I should presume the Commonwealth Legislature treated as correct and adopted in relation to the meaning of the words now under consideration in s 160ZH(3)(c): see, eg, Airservices Australia v Canadian Airlines International Ltd [1999] HCA 62 ; (2000) 202 CLR 133 , at [282]-[283]; and PT Ltd v Maradona Pty Ltd (No 2) (1992) 27 NSWLR 241, 251.</text>

<tocase>Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1948] HCA 28 ; (1948) 77 CLR 143</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1948/28.html</AustLII>
<text>44 It is then convenient at this point to consider the notion of a share. A share was described by Williams J in Archibald Howie Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) [1948] HCA 28 ; (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 156:
 In Borland's Trustee v. Steel Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd. (1901) 1 Ch. 279, at p 288, Farwell J., in a passage which Lord Russell of Killowen in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Crossman (1937) A.C. 26 , at p 66 described as an accurate exposition of the nature of a share, stated that a share is the interest of a shareholder in the company measured by a sum of money for the purpose of liability in the first place and of interest in the second, but also consisting of a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with ... the Companies Act ... a share is an interest measured by a sum of money and made up of various rights contained in the contract, including the right to a sum of money of a more or less amount. (emphasis in original) 
More recently, the joint judgment of McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pilmer v Duke Group Limited (in Liquidation) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 , 179 cited the statement of Farwell J as the classic description of a share. However, their Honours went on to say that 'the reference to measuring the interest of a shareholder in a company by a sum of money is no longer apt under present corporations law in Australia following the abolition of the concept of par value and of authorised capital' (at [19]).

46 More specifically, a share comprises 'a congeries of rights in personam ' ( Archibald Howie [1948] HCA 28 ; 77 CLR 143 at 154 per Dixon J) which includes the right to participate in dividends, the right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a winding up, and the right to receive capital upon a reduction of capital by the company: Sydney Futures Exchange Ltd v Australian Stock Exchange Ltd [1995] FCA 1106 ; (1995) 56 FCR 236 at 255.</text>

<tocase>Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Company Ltd [1923] AC 744</tocase>
<text>47 It may be said that these aspects contribute to the economic content of a share. Some commentators make mention of the 'economic' character of a share. For example, Professor R Pennington in (1989) 10 Company Lawyer 140 concluded that 'they are a species of intangible movable property which comprise a collection of rights and obligations relating to an interest in a company of an economic and proprietary character, but not constituting a debt'. After all, a share is a fractional part of the capital, and thus confers upon the shareholder a certain 'interest' to a proportionate part of the assets of the corporation whether by way of dividend or of distribution of assets in winding up (see Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Company Ltd [1923] AC 744 , 767 per Lord Wrenbury), and that that 'interest' might come to represent in value far more than the original capital which had been contributed (see Ord Forrest Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1974] HCA 57 ; (1974) 130 CLR 124 , 132 and 133 per Stephen J).

48 It was on the basis of these bundle of rights in personam , the taxpayer submitted that capital expenditure in relation to shares will be 'reflected' in the 'state or nature' of the shares where the amount of the contribution increases shareholders' equity thereby increasing their value, and the amount of the contribution remains available for return to the shareholders pursuant to the rights attaching to the shares.

49 In the present case, the payment of the capital contribution to shareholders' funds of NMSLAL was made for the purpose of, and to the extent of [sterling]42.912 million had the effect of, increasing the embedded value of NMSLAL and the embedded value of NMUK, and thus, the value of the shares in NMUK. The benefit of the contribution to the extent of [sterling]42.912 million remained reflected in the value of shares in NMUK at the time of their disposal. Moreover, after April 1993 and until the date of sale, the amount of the contribution to the extent of [sterling]42.912 million remained in existence and was available to be returned to the shareholders' funds of NMSLAL, and distributed as capital to NMUK and by NMUK to the taxpayer pursuant to the rights attaching to the shares. This is how, as it was argued by the taxpayer, the capital contribution was reflected in the 'state or nature' of the shares in the context of s 160ZH(3)(c).

50 I was taken to a number of dictionary definitions of the words 'state', 'nature' and 'value'. Relevantly, the first definition given by the Macquarie Dictionary (4 th ed) for 'state' is 'the condition of a person or thing, as with respect to circumstances or attributes'. The definition of 'nature' relevantly refers to 'the particular combination of qualities belonging to a person or thing by birth or constitution', referring to the inherent qualities of a person or thing. 'Value' is relevantly defined as 'material or monetary worth, as in traffic or sale' and 'the worth of a thing as measured by the amount of other things for which it can be exchanged, or as estimated in terms of a medium of exchange'.</text>

<tocase>Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation 1998) [1998] FCA 1655 ; 83 FCR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1998/1655.html</AustLII>
<text>69 One is reminded by these submissions of the comments of Black CJ and Sundberg J in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1998] FCA 1655 ; (1998) 83 FCR 511 , 518-19:
 In our opinion the plain language of the sections is confirmed by the only directly relevant extrinsic material, which shows that parliament intended the consequence that is said by the appellant to be anomalous. Especially when different views can be held about whether the consequence is anomalous on the one hand or acceptable or understandable on the other, the Court should be particularly careful that arguments based on anomaly or incongruity are not allowed to obscure the real intention, and choice, of the Parliament. ... [w]e are unable to conclude that the operation of ss 118 and 119 on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative purpose.

70 I do not accept that any anomaly arises from the construction pressed by the Commissioner in this case. I accept the submissions of the Commissioner that the taxpayer, having chosen a particular way in which to organise its affairs, must then be bound by any fiscal consequences that follow, and this does not lead to an anomaly, but arises because of the application of the legislative provision to the facts.

71 In light of the above reasons, the application should be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding seventy-one (71) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.

<tocase>Falconer v Pederson [1974] VR 185</tocase>
<text>51 Whilst a useful reference, one should be careful not to be restricted by dictionary definitions and one should look at the context in which each word appears in s 160ZH(3)(c) and the context in which s 160ZH(3)(c) itself appears: see, eg, Falconer v Pederson [1974] VR 185 , 187.

52 I have already attempted to explain that context. Looking at the context in which the concept 'state or nature' is used in s 160ZH(3)(c) referable to a share, I do not consider that concept includes a share's value. As I have said, s 160ZH(3)(c) in my view, clearly distinguishes the concept of 'value', with 'state' or 'nature'. I do not mean by this to treat the term 'state or nature' as a composite phrase, but I do consider it appropriate to view both words in the context in which they appear alongside 'value' as found in the first limb of s 160ZH(3)(c). Undoubtedly, a share as an item of property differs from property such as land in that a share's characteristics are fixed primarily by the obligations and rights in the contract between company and shareholder. In the case of land, as the example in the Explanatory Memorandum would indicate, 'value' would not be included within the concepts of 'state' or 'nature'. Similarly, in the case of a share 'value' is not included within the concepts of 'state' or 'nature'.

53 Even by just considering the words 'state' or 'nature' themselves, I am also of the view that it cannot be said in relation to a share as an item of property, which may be bought and sold, that 'value' forms any part of the nature or state of that form of asset. The 'nature' of a share refers to the bundle of rights (and obligations) attaching to a share, as described previously, being the inherent qualities of a share. Those rights exist, and may be exercised, irrespective of their value. The 'state' of a share does not refer to its 'value', but refers to other matters, such as whether a share is fully paid up or not. The value of a share does not affect the 'state' of a share, if one focuses on the particular condition of a share as an item of property.</text>

<tocase>Re Australian Federation of Construction Contractors; Ex parte Billing [1986] HCA 74 ; (1986) 68 ALR 416</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/74.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Both parties, in support of their own constructions, referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Capital Gains) Bill 1986 (Cth) which inserted s 160ZH(3)(c) into the Act. I note that care must be taken in the use of an explanatory memorandum: see, eg, Re Australian Federation of Construction Contractors; Ex parte Billing [1986] HCA 74 ; (1986) 68 ALR 416 , 420.

42 The Explanatory Memorandum stated (although in this text referring to 160ZH(1)(c) which is in the same terms as s 160ZH(3)(c)):
 An example of the type of expenditure which may be included in the cost base to a taxpayer of an asset under paragraph (c) would be expenditure incurred on the extension of a building. Generally, expenditure on rates, interest and repairs will not fall within the cost base of the asset as these items of expenditure may be classed as expenses of a revenue nature and not of a capital nature. Note that expenditure incurred in enhancing the value of the asset must be reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of disposal. For example, if a carport is erected adjacent to an income-producing property but at a later stage is dismantled and a garage erected, the expenditure incurred in erecting the carport would be disregarded in calculating the cost base of the property as it is no longer reflected in the state or nature of the asset. Similarly, paragraph (c) is designed to exclude from the cost base any expenditure incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of the asset by way of improvements which have wasted away prior to disposal.

43 In considering the competing submissions on the construction of s 160ZH(3)(c), the Explanatory Memorandum provides little assistance, although it does indicate an approach to the intended operation of the provision in relation to tangible assets. The example given of the type of capital expenditure covered by s 160ZH(3)(c) is that of expenditure incurred to erect a carport adjacent to an income-producing building. The example continues that if the carport were to be subsequently dismantled prior to sale, the expenditure would be disregarded as it would not be reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of the sale. Such an example is not easily translatable to intangible property such as shares as the example assigns physical characteristics to 'state or nature'. The example does indicate, however, that any physical changes brought about by the expenditure must continue and must not have dissipated prior to disposal of the asset, for a taxpayer to take advantage of the provision.</text>

<tocase>Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1304 ; (2004) 58 ATR 1172</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2004/1304.html</AustLII>
<text>55 I have considered the issue for determination without reference to any direct authority on s 160ZH(1)(c). The phrase 'reflected in the state or nature of the asset' has not been authoritatively considered by Australian courts. The only consideration of the phrase, appears in Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 1304 ; (2004) 58 ATR 1172 , in which Member G A Barton considered the identical phrase as found in ss 160ZH(1)(c) and (2)(c) of the Act. Member Barton found that the taxpayer was not entitled to include capital expenditure by way of incentive payments in the cost base of the shares in calculating the capital gain on the sale of those shares, as they were not reflected in the 'state or nature' of the shares at the time of disposal. There was no dispute that the incentive payments constituted expenditure of a capital nature. Member Barton concluded, however, that (at [43]):
 The Tribunal finds that none of the rights that constituted the applicant's shares in the proprietary company and, subsequently, in the new company, was reflective of the incentive payments. There was no evidence before the Tribunal on which it could find that the applicant's shares in the proprietary company or in the new company, constituted a class of shares reflecting the amount of the incentive payments because they included a special or additional right attributable to such payments. The fact that the issued shares in the new company were listed on the boards of the London and Australian stock markets did not make the state or nature of the applicant's shares reflective of the amount of the incentive payments. The state or nature of the applicant's shares in the new company was indistinguishable from that of other issued shares in the new company. The Tribunal rejects the proposition that any causal link between the incentive payments and the listing of the issued shares in the new company makes the state or nature of the applicant's shares in that company reflective of the amount of the incentive payments for the purposes of ss 160 ZH(1)(c) and (2)(c) of the ITAA 1936. So the Tribunal finds that the state or nature of the applicant's shares in the proprietary company did not reflect the amount of the incentive payment when they were exchanged for shares in the new company, and the state or nature of the shares in the new company did not reflect that amount when the applicant disposed of them. In the light of this finding it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the incentive payment was incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of the applicant's shares in the proprietary company and in the new company and whether the indexed cost base of the trustee's shares in the new company included any part of the incentive payment.</text>

<tocase>The Trustees of the FD Fenston Will Trusts v The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (unreported, Special Commissioners, 7 February 2007)</tocase>
<text>62 In The Trustees of the FD Fenston Will Trusts v The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (unreported, Special Commissioners, 7 February 2007), the Special Commissioners considered s 38(1)(b) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (UK) which likewise contains the phrase 'reflected in the state or nature of the asset'. The expenditure in this case was made by the trustees as capital contributions to a company in which they held shares. Those shares were the relevant assets. The appellants submitted that the shares increased in value following the expenditure and the expenditure was therefore reflected in the state or nature of the shares at that time, continuing through to the time of disposal. However, the Special Commissioners found at [23] that state or nature could not be equated with value:
 It is clear from the provision that Parliament did not intend that all expenditure incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of an asset should be deductible in computing capital gains. Only such expenditure as would be reflected in the "state and nature of the asset at the time of the disposal" was to be allowed. Further, "state and nature" for these purposes must be something other than merely the value of the asset otherwise this phrase would add nothing to the immediately preceding words. In this case the Capital Contributions did not result in any increase in the number of shares in issue, or result in any change in the rights or restrictions attaching to the shares. The only effect of the Capital Contributions was to increase the surplus of the company which would increase the amount available for distribution to shareholders, and therefore presumably the value of the shares. We do not consider this sufficient for the expenditure on the Capital Contributions to be reflected in the state and nature of the shares, either at the time the expenditure was incurred or at any time subsequently. (emphasis added)

63 The Commissioner before me relied upon above passages in the UK authorities, and particularly the last sentence in Fenston's case. On the other hand, the taxpayer submitted that the UK authorities have no precedential value, either because in the case of Aberdeen the actual decision relied on was overturned by the House of Lords, and in the case of Fenston , the comments relied upon were clearly dicta. The taxpayer also contended that the dicta relied upon by the Commissioner before me in the above passages was wrong.</text>
