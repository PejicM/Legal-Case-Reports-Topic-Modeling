<text>It is evident from the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court that the submissions before that court, understandably enough perhaps with a person appearing for himself, ventured into the factual merits of the visa application. The learned Federal Magistrate correctly observed, by reference to pertinent authority, namely Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 , that merits review before that court was not open.

There is certainly nothing inherently implausible about the prospect of strong passions and perhaps even, sadly, acts of violence being engendered in respect of a relationship which bridges a religious divide. However, the assessment of whether or not, in this particular case and against such a background, a visa application ought to be successful was a matter for the Minister and his delegates in the first instance and on external merits review by the independently constituted Refugee Review Tribunal.

Where, as here, a Tribunal has made findings based on conclusions as to credit which are not inherently illogical, it would transgress the role consigned to the courts on judicial review to interfere with a conclusion of the Tribunal. Against such a background, there was no error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court in refusing the judicial review application. Further, whilst it may have been a counsel of perfection for that court to have explained in detail the nature of a judicial review proceeding to an unrepresented person appearing before it, particularly one whose first language was not English and whose culture was different to that of Australia, there was no obligation on that court so to do.</text>
