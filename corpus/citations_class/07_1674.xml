<text>29 Even though the text of s 9(1)(e) and of s 70(5)(d) are similar, this circumstance does not detract from the conclusion that the wrong test was applied by the Tribunal. The failure of the Tribunal to refer to the correct statutory provision demonstrates that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question. Jurisdictional error therefore exists in its decision: see Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1968] UKHL 6 ; [1969] 2 AC 147 at 171; Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179.

<text>49 In view of the above findings of error in the decision of the Tribunal, the Court is not of the opinion that it would be 'futile to remit the matter' : see Arnott v Repatriation Commission [2001] FCA 262 ; (2001) 106 FCR 83 at [36] . Rather the Court considers that there is a possibility that a different result would be reached on such remitter: see Santa Sabina College v Minister for Education (1985) 58 ALR 527 at 540; and Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 88 FCR 206 at 213-214.</text>

<text>48 The Court is not satisfied that if the Tribunal had addressed the correct questions, its decision would be the same, irrespective of the error: see Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 384. The errors of the Tribunal include the reference to eligible service under s 9(1) when the correct test was contained in s 70(5) of the Act; the reference to 'war service' when the only service relevant was Mr Robertson's 'defence service'; the failure to refer to the correct provisions in s 70(5) of the Act; and the finding made in the absence of evidence of Mr Robertson's alcohol dependence. The Tribunal did not identify the correct issues which it was required to determine and accordingly fell into jurisdictional error: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 347-348.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/15.html</AustLII>
<text>20 Mr Robertson agrees with the Commission's submission and agrees that the Tribunal erroneously referred to s 9(1)(e) of the Act. It is also agreed that the Tribunal erroneously referred to 'war caused' disease of Mr Robertson in its decision instead of 'defence caused'. Mr Robertson acknowledges that because his PTSD was found to have had its clinical onset in 1994 (after termination of Mr Robertson's defence service), the Tribunal's reference to 'the contribution, to a material degree' adopting the wording of s 9(1)(e) and s 70(5)(d) was irrelevant as the issue raised by these sections is whether an injury or disease was contributed to in a material degree or was aggravated by any eligible war service or defence service respectively rendered after the injury was suffered or the disease was contracted. Mr Robertson refers to Comcare v Sahu-Kahn [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at [16] and submits that the adoption by the Tribunal of the wording in s 9(1)(e) and s 70(5)(d) required a more onerous test than that required by s 70(5)(a) of the Act which Mr Robertson submits is the section to which the Tribunal should have had regard. Such provision renders an injury 'defence-caused' if it arose out of, or was attributable to, defence service.

21 The Commission submits that Clauses 5(b) and 6 of the SoP for PTSD give effect to s 70(5)(d) of the Act. Accordingly s 70(5)(d) precluded the Tribunal from finding that Mr Robertson's PTSD was defence caused unless either Mr Robertson developed PTSD during, or prior to, his defence service and the PTSD was contributed to or was aggravated by his defence service. Because the Tribunal did not refer to s 70(5)(d) it failed to apply the correct test for determining whether Mr Robertson's condition was contributed to in a material degree or was aggravated by defence service rendered after he developed PTSD.

22 Mr Robertson submits such errors made no difference because the statutory provisions which establish the necessary causal relationships between the service and disease or injury contained in s 9(1) and s 70(5) respectively are virtually the same for 'eligible war service' and 'defence service'. The relevant SoP all applied to 'eligible service' which is defined in clause 8 of each SoP to include 'eligible war service' and 'defence service' with the result that the factors required by the SoP for both forms of service were identical.</text>

<text>34 The term 'clinical onset' is not defined in the Act. The parties accept the definition provided in Re Robertson v Repatriation Commission (1998) 50 ALD 668 at 670 that:
 
 there is a clinical onset of a disease, either when a person becomes aware of some feature or symptom which enables a doctor to say that the disease was present at that time, or when a finding is made on investigation which is indicative to a doctor of the disease being present at that time.

However it is essential to identify the stressor occurring during defence service which resulted in the PTSD to satisfy Clause 5(a) of the SoP for PTSD. Unless such stressor or stressors experienced during defence service led to such clinical onset, they are irrelevant.</text>

<tocase>Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316</tocase>
<text>15 However the Tribunal found that Mr Robertson's PTSD did not have its clinical onset until 1994. The Tribunal concluded that if such incident was the sole cause of the PTSD, it occurred outside his period of 'eligible service' because the incident occurred before 7 December 1972 (see s 68 of the Act). Accordingly it was not related to his 'eligible service'. The Tribunal also considered that other incidents namely the diving incident in Hong Kong in 1974 while on board HMAS Stuart, the stress episodes which occurred at least three to six times per year suffered by Mr Robertson whilst continuing to serve on HMAS Melbourne, and a fire on HMAS Supply, were each severe stressors ('the subsequent stressors'). The Tribunal found:
 
 On the basis of the expert evidence I am satisfied that the later stressors "add their measure" to the final manifestation of Mr Robertson's post traumatic stress disorder in 1994 ( Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission ). In any event, the SoP operates, by factor 5(a) to establish a connection to service (experiencing a severe stressor prior to the clinical onset of post traumatic stress disorder).
 Section 120B of the Act establishes war causation where there is material that raises a connection between a disease and service and a SoP upholds that connection. Both requirements are met here and so Mr Robertson's post traumatic stress disorder is war caused.

16 As to Mr Robertson's claims of alcohol dependence, the Tribunal considered the relevant factor for alcohol dependence to be that the person was 'suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse' : see clause 5(a) of the SoP for Alcohol Dependence. The Tribunal found that Mr Robertson's alcohol dependence ' had its clinical onset sometime in the 1990s but no later than 1997' when it was formally diagnosed. The Tribunal concluded that 'on the balance of probabilities, Mr Robertson had post traumatic stress disorder at the time of the clinical onset of his alcohol dependence' .

17 The relevant factor for major depression as found by the Tribunal, requires the claimant to 'have a clinically significant psychiatric condition within the one year immediately before the onset of depressive disorder' : see clause 5(b) the SoP for Depressive Disorder. The Tribunal found that Mr Robertson's major depression 'had its clinical onset in the mid 1990s' and continued:
 
 Given this time range and the clinical onset of post traumatic stress disorder in 1994, I find it more probable than not that Mr Robertson had post traumatic stress disorder within one year immediately before the clinical onset of major depression.

33 Since the Tribunal found that Mr Robertson's PTSD had its clinical onset in 1994 namely after his defence service had concluded there could be no scope for any contribution to or aggravation of his PTSD by the subsequent stressors suffered during his defence service as considered in Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316 unless they were severe stressors which caused the PTSD: see the observations of Heerey J in Deledio v Repatriation Commission (1997) 47 ALD 261 at 275 with whom the Full Court agreed (see Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 95-96).
