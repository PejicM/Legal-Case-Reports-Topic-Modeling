<tocase>Ayres v Evans (1981) 39 ALR 129; 56 FLR 235</tocase>
<text>5 No forms of request are prescribed and there are no Regulations or Rules of Court setting out any procedural requirements. The general procedure has a long history (briefly reviewed by Fox J in Ayres v Evans (1981) 39 ALR 129; 56 FLR 235 at 239) but the details have varied over time. The complexities of modern cross-border insolvency make it likely that this beneficial provision will be exercised more in the future than it has been exercised in the past. Jersey is a prescribed country by reason of reg 3.01 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 . Therefore, the Court is obliged to act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, Jersey courts with jurisdiction in bankruptcy (s 29(2)(a) of the Act). A request pursuant to s 29(4) is not limited to the court of a prescribed country. Although there is no requirement to establish that it is likely that the foreign court will honour the request before the court should act under s 29(4) ( Clunies-Ross v Totterdell (1988) 20 FCR 358 at 361), the evidence establishes that the Royal Court of Jersey will so act.</text>

<tocase>Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lyons [2000] FCA 1428 ; (2000) 104 FCR 486</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1428.html</AustLII>
<text>7 The application has not been served on any party. In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Lyons [2000] FCA 1428 ; (2000) 104 FCR 486 Tamberlin J explained why it will normally be necessary to give notice to a live bankrupt see also Re Hudson (2005) 3 ABC(NS) 350 illustrating the exceptions to that principle. It may be accepted that a similar principle would normally apply in the case of a bankrupt deceased estate where probate has been granted. Even where probate has not been granted there may be occasions where it would be appropriate to serve the next of kin. The present case is somewhat out of the ordinary. The next of kin applied for the administration of the deceased estate in bankruptcy. The wife and children of the deceased are aware of this application and support it. In those circumstances, formal service is not necessary.

 I certify that the preceding seven (7) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.

<tocase>Re Mann (1887) 13 VLR 590</tocase>
<text>6 I am satisfied that a request is appropriate in the circumstances. I am satisfied that the form of the request is appropriately specific in accordance with Re Mann (1887) 13 VLR 590. I would leave for another day the question whether that authority should continue to be applied to the provision as now framed. It is not clear to me that a request should not be general in form, the "matter" being the administration of the particular bankrupt estate, leaving it to the foreign court to decide precisely how the assistance might be afforded.</text>
