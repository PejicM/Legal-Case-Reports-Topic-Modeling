<tocase>Coleman v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1943) 45 (SR) 27</tocase>
<text>57 Section 8(9B) does not have a retrospective operation. The amendment has a future action on past events and not a prior effect on past events (Pearce DC and Geddes RS, Statutory Interpretation in Australia at [10.4], Coleman v Shell Co of Australia Ltd (1943) 45 (SR) 27). ' It takes account of antecedent facts and circumstances as a basis for what it prescribes for the future, and it does no more ' ( Robertson v City of Nunawading [1973] VR 819 at 824).</text>

<tocase>Doro v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1960] VR 84</tocase>
<text>52 Mr Perry relies on s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides that, unless the contrary intention appears, the repeal of s 8(9) cannot affect his rights acquired under the SRC Act. He submits that the language of the Amending Act and s 8(9B) in particular, does not include clear indicia of retrospectivity nor clear indication that the "unjust result" or "palpable injustice" of an effect on his right to compensation were intended ( Doro v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1960] VR 84 at 86 per Adam J).

53 The words of s 8(9B) make it clear that the subsection is intended to apply to former employees and also to a person who subsequently ceases to be an employee. This is also apparent from the extrinsic material. The Second Reading Speech refers to "former employee" and the Explanatory Memorandum to ' people who are no longer employed by the Commonwealth ' as well as to ' former employees '.

54 The right to this compensation under s 8(9B) is not a right unlimited as to time or entitlement. It is activated when the employee ceases employment. It ceases if the employee ceases to be incapacitated. Weekly payments of compensation under the Act with respect to future weeks are contingent upon the employee being incapacitated for work as a result of his or her injury during those future weeks.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/20.html</AustLII>
<text>56 Mr Perry's situation is different to those in Kraljevich and Esber v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430. In Kraljevich it was held that the injured employee had an entitlement to be compensated ' for a sum of money calculated in a particular way ' (at 650 per Latham CJ). This was, however, in the context of a right of redemption, which accrued on injury. Similarly, in Esber , there was a substantive right in existence at the time of the relevant repeal and amendment.</text>

<text>51 Subject to a reasonably certain intention to the contrary, an amending Act should be understood as not applying to facts or events that have already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law had defined by reference to the past events ( Maxwell v Murphy [1957] HCA 7 ; (1957) 96 CLR 261 at 267 per Dixon CJ). Prima facie, it is construed as having a prospective operation only and as not attaching new legal consequences to facts or events which occurred before its commencement ( Fisher v Hebburn Ltd [1960] HCA 80 ; (1960) 105 CLR 188 at 194 per Fullager J).</text>

<tocase>Kraljevich v Lake View and Star Ltd [1945] HCA 29 ; (1945) 70 CLR 647</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/29.html</AustLII>
<text>50 Mr Perry contends that his rights to compensation by way of payments calculated under s 8(9) before amendment accrue as at the date of injury, or impairment. He says that those rights to payment continue in perpetuity until certain events prescribed in the statute take place, which are not relevant, or Parliament legislates to alter or remove those rights. That must be done clearly and the intent made clear before such an amendment would have retrospective effect to take away his rights ( Kraljevich v Lake View and Star Ltd [1945] HCA 29 ; (1945) 70 CLR 647). The right to payment or compensation extends to the manner of calculation ( Kraljevich at 650 per Latham CJ). If s 8(9B) affects those rights to compensation, he submits that it operates retrospectively. Accordingly, he submits, the subsection does not apply to an injury which occurred before the commencement date.

56 Mr Perry's situation is different to those in Kraljevich and Esber v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430. In Kraljevich it was held that the injured employee had an entitlement to be compensated ' for a sum of money calculated in a particular way ' (at 650 per Latham CJ). This was, however, in the context of a right of redemption, which accrued on injury. Similarly, in Esber , there was a substantive right in existence at the time of the relevant repeal and amendment.

58 The Amending Act does not differentiate between injuries that occurred before and after it came into force. It does not affect employees' rights to payments due on cessation of employment but only the calculation of those payments as made from week to week, the procedure or mode of calculation (cf Kraljevich ). The rights of the employee are fixed by reference to the injury and the continuation in or cessation of employment. The changes brought about by amendment were not to those rights but to the practice and procedure applied to enforce or calculate them ( Maxwell at 267 per Dixon CJ). Those changes do not have a retrospective operation on Mr Perry's rights.</text>

<tocase>Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd [1997] HCA 53 ; (1997) 191 CLR 85</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/53.html</AustLII>
<text>46 The second construction satisfies the direction in s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act . I am of the view that the second construction applies to subs (9B) and that it is neither an unreasonable nor unnatural construction ( Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd [1997] HCA 53 ; (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 113 per McHugh J). Section 8(9B) does not apply to deprive Mr Perry of the increment. It follows that the decision of the Delegate was correct and the Decision incorrect. That is, Mr Perry is entitled to continue to receive the increment as part of the calculation of his normal weekly earnings.

47 As I have determined that s 8(9B) does not deprive Mr Perry of his entitlements under s 8(6), it is not necessary to decide the question whether s 8(9B) has a retrospective effect. However, as that was the basis of the Tribunal decision, I shall consider it briefly.</text>

<tocase>Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>48 Both before and after amendment, s 8 applied to persons who had been injured. Section 8(9B) refers to the circumstance ' if the employee has ceased, or ceases, to be employed...' . These are words which should be given a meaning ( Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ). Section 8(9B) specifies application both to a person who has been injured and has already ceased to be employed and to a person who has been injured and who ceases to be employed. Contrary to the Tribunal's conclusion and Mr Perry's submission, the subsection does apply to persons injured before the commencement date. It applies to periods of incapacity after its commencement and changes the method of calculation of normal weekly earnings.

49 As s 8(9B) is drafted, it is not the injury but the cessation of employment that is the condition that imports the application of the subsection, with effect from each future indexation date in relation to that cessation, by reference to the Wage Cost Index. There is no dispute that Mr Perry suffered an injury prior to the commencement of the Amending Act and the operation of s 8(9B) and ceased to be employed after that date. Mr Perry contends that, if s 8(9B) applies to preclude him from payment of the increments to which he would have been entitled under s 8(6) but for the amendment, it will visit new legal consequences on facts or events occurring before its commencement.</text>
