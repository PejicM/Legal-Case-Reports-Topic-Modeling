<tocase>Re One.Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 40 ACSR 83</tocase>
<text>20 However, in the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs made it clear that the form of direction sought was based upon, and confined to, a direction of the kind made by Austin J in Re One.Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 40 ACSR 83 (' One.Tel '), and/or by Hodgson J in Re Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hodgson J, 17 August 1989) (' Vartex' ). It was accepted by counsel for the plaintiffs that the revised form of direction would be appropriate in the circumstances and the defendants did not oppose a direction expressed in those more limited terms.

23 Similar views have been expressed in other cases. In One.Tel , Austin J said that there is some doubt as to whether directions of a court given under a section of this kind can bind anyone, even a party to the application, citing Best &amp; Less : at 93 [37]. In Vartex , Hodgson J was less equivocal, stating that a direction would not bind a director of the company who was represented before the court.

26 In One.Tel, Austin J made a similar observation, at 98 [65]:
 
 'In these circumstances, it seems to me that a direction in terms of [the proposed direction] is justified. I hesitate to use the word "declare", which suggests a binding declaration of right rather than a direction having the more limited significance that I have described. I note that the word "declare" is used in some of the cases, no doubt in a special sense, but I have decided it would be better to use the word "direct", which is sanctioned by s 424 itself. While Hodgson J in Vartex Petroleum indicated a willingness to direct that the proposed sale was not "improper" by virtue of the mere fact that it was from a receiver to the mortgagee, I would prefer not to use the word "improper", which might suggest a conclusion with respect to the factual circumstances of the sale and the bona fides of the plaintiff.'

27 Other limits on the court's power to give directions under s 424 have been discussed in the authorities. In particular, the authorities make it clear that it is not appropriate for the court to give directions about the commercial propriety or reasonableness of a transaction that the receiver proposes to enter into: see One.Tel at 91 [30], 92 [33] and 93 [38]; and Best &amp; Less at 247, 249 and 250. In Franbridge Pty Ltd v Societ&eacute; &amp; Generale Finance Corporation Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 304 (' Franbridge') , Einfeld J refused to make directions to the effect that a particular transaction was not improper and, more particularly, that the receiver had acted reasonably: at 308, 309.

36 The cases make it clear, however, that it may be appropriate to make a direction to the effect that a particular transaction is not unlawful solely because the counter-party to the transaction is a company associated with the entity which appointed the receivers and managers. This is precisely what was done by Hodson J in Vartex. In that case, his Honour referred to the principle of mortgage law that a mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself ('the mortgagee principle') and went on to find that the mortgagee principle does not apply so as to prevent a receiver appointed by a mortgagee from selling the mortgage property to the mortgagee who appointed him. The same approach was adopted by Austin J in One.Tel at 95-97 [51]-[60]. Moreover, in Re Actwane Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 572 (' Actwane' ), Austin J followed the approach in Vartex and One.Tel and made a direction that:
 
 '... notwithstanding the principle of mortgage law that the mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself, it would not be unlawful for the plaintiff to... enter into an agreement with Temujin Securities Pty Ltd solely by reason of the fact that the Appointor of the Receiver and Manager under a Deed of Appointment dated 1 August 2001 is also the director and sole shareholder of Temujin Securities Pty Ltd.'

38 In the circumstances that I have described and in the light of the authorities I have discussed, I consider that it is appropriate in this case to make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs. That form closely adheres to the form of order made by Hodson J in Vartex. In my view, it is much clearer to provide that the Contract is not 'unlawful solely by reason of' the relationship between TIGA and Thorney than to use the form of words which appeared in the originating process in this case, namely 'notwithstanding the relationship between' TIGA and receivers' appointor, Thorney. I appreciate that Austin J in One.Tel used the form of words 'notwithstanding' etc, but I prefer the more direct expression 'not unlawful solely by reason of'. I also note that Austin J used the expression 'solely by reason of' in Actwane .

39 Like Austin J in One.Tel and Hodson J in Vartex , I would stress that the direction is intended to establish only that the Contract is not unlawful by reason of the relationship between TIGA and Thorney. The direction does not deal with the position of the plaintiffs under the law concerning the proper exercise of powers of sale by a receiver and manager, which depends upon considerations relating to good faith, proper procedure and fair price. I am not expressing any view about those matters; nor is it appropriate to do so in a summary procedure such as this, where a limited direction only was sought. However, I would add that nothing I have seen on the evidence before me suggests any impropriety on the part of the receivers and managers.

42 Several grounds were advanced by the defendants in support of the application. Firstly, the originating process filed by the plaintiffs sought a direction that was expressed in wider terms (the defendants say significantly wider) than the revised form ultimately obtained by the plaintiffs without opposition from the defendants. The original form of the direction concerned not only the lawfulness of entering into the Contract with TIGA, notwithstanding its relationship with Thorney, but also sought a direction that the Contract was not 'improper' 'on the facts and in the circumstances presently known to them'. The defendants submitted that the original form was suggestive that the plaintiffs were seeking a direction from the Court which went towards the commercial reasonableness of the plaintiffs' conduct, and was a direction of the kind that Austin J refused to make in One.Tel .

43 Secondly, the defendants argued that their appreciation of the wide scope of the original form of the direction was a reasonable one in view of Mr White's affidavit of 15 February 2006. Paragraph 152 of the affidavit expressed Mr White's belief that he had taken all reasonable care in selling the Lake Federation property and had performed his obligations under s 420A(1) of the Corporations Act to sell the property for market value, and that he had sufficiently tested the market so as to obtain an offer that was not less than market value. Mr White's affidavit does, to some extent at least, tend to support the defendant's view that they thought they were coming to oppose a direction which sought court approbation of the reasonableness of the receivers' conduct. Perhaps another factor relevant to the defendants' appreciation of the scope of the direction sought by the plaintiffs is the form of the special condition and definition of 'Court Approval' in the Contract.

45 In opposition to the defendants' application for costs, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that, as a matter of substance, the direction sought by the plaintiffs was always confined within the limits indicated by the Vartex and One.Tel cases. Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the lengthy affidavit by Mr White was entirely appropriate because the Court needed to have before it a full account of the transactions that had led up to the contract of sale in question. I accept the latter point that the affidavit material was entirely appropriate in supporting the discretionary order that was sought from the Court, even assuming it was always limited in the form of the direction that I have made. However, I consider that the defendants were affected in their opposition to the direction because of the wider way in which it was originally cast.</text>

<tocase>Re Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hodgson J, 17 August 1989)</tocase>
<text>20 However, in the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs made it clear that the form of direction sought was based upon, and confined to, a direction of the kind made by Austin J in Re One.Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 40 ACSR 83 (' One.Tel '), and/or by Hodgson J in Re Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hodgson J, 17 August 1989) (' Vartex' ). It was accepted by counsel for the plaintiffs that the revised form of direction would be appropriate in the circumstances and the defendants did not oppose a direction expressed in those more limited terms.

23 Similar views have been expressed in other cases. In One.Tel , Austin J said that there is some doubt as to whether directions of a court given under a section of this kind can bind anyone, even a party to the application, citing Best &amp; Less : at 93 [37]. In Vartex , Hodgson J was less equivocal, stating that a direction would not bind a director of the company who was represented before the court.

25 In Vartex , Hodgson J was careful to point out that the direction he proposed to make had a very limited operation. The direction in Vartex was to the effect that a particular agreement for sale would not be improper merely because the purchaser was the appointor of the receivers. His Honour said that such advice would say nothing about the possibility that the sale may be improper because of particular dealings which may or may not have occurred between the appointor and the plaintiff, or on any other grounds unconnected with the mere identity of the purchaser as the mortgagee.

36 The cases make it clear, however, that it may be appropriate to make a direction to the effect that a particular transaction is not unlawful solely because the counter-party to the transaction is a company associated with the entity which appointed the receivers and managers. This is precisely what was done by Hodson J in Vartex. In that case, his Honour referred to the principle of mortgage law that a mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself ('the mortgagee principle') and went on to find that the mortgagee principle does not apply so as to prevent a receiver appointed by a mortgagee from selling the mortgage property to the mortgagee who appointed him. The same approach was adopted by Austin J in One.Tel at 95-97 [51]-[60]. Moreover, in Re Actwane Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 572 (' Actwane' ), Austin J followed the approach in Vartex and One.Tel and made a direction that:
 
 '... notwithstanding the principle of mortgage law that the mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself, it would not be unlawful for the plaintiff to... enter into an agreement with Temujin Securities Pty Ltd solely by reason of the fact that the Appointor of the Receiver and Manager under a Deed of Appointment dated 1 August 2001 is also the director and sole shareholder of Temujin Securities Pty Ltd.'

37 In the present case, the deed of charge dated 17 October 2003 provides that the receiver and manager from appointment is the agent of the chargor, Lake Federation. As Hodson J pointed out in Vartex , the consequence of that agency is that the sale of property by the receivers and managers to a company associated with the appointor does not infringe the mortgage principle: see also Franbridge at 308 and Actwane at [13]-[15].

38 In the circumstances that I have described and in the light of the authorities I have discussed, I consider that it is appropriate in this case to make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs. That form closely adheres to the form of order made by Hodson J in Vartex. In my view, it is much clearer to provide that the Contract is not 'unlawful solely by reason of' the relationship between TIGA and Thorney than to use the form of words which appeared in the originating process in this case, namely 'notwithstanding the relationship between' TIGA and receivers' appointor, Thorney. I appreciate that Austin J in One.Tel used the form of words 'notwithstanding' etc, but I prefer the more direct expression 'not unlawful solely by reason of'. I also note that Austin J used the expression 'solely by reason of' in Actwane .

39 Like Austin J in One.Tel and Hodson J in Vartex , I would stress that the direction is intended to establish only that the Contract is not unlawful by reason of the relationship between TIGA and Thorney. The direction does not deal with the position of the plaintiffs under the law concerning the proper exercise of powers of sale by a receiver and manager, which depends upon considerations relating to good faith, proper procedure and fair price. I am not expressing any view about those matters; nor is it appropriate to do so in a summary procedure such as this, where a limited direction only was sought. However, I would add that nothing I have seen on the evidence before me suggests any impropriety on the part of the receivers and managers.

44 Thirdly, the defendants point to Hodgson J's view in Vartex concerning the costs of an opposing director. It appears from Hodgson J's reasons for judgment that the form of direction sought in Vartex was wider than the one ultimately made and, in the result, Hodgson J ordered that the costs of the director be paid out of the funds in the hands of the receiver: see also Actwane . The defendants sought a similar order in the present case.

45 In opposition to the defendants' application for costs, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that, as a matter of substance, the direction sought by the plaintiffs was always confined within the limits indicated by the Vartex and One.Tel cases. Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the lengthy affidavit by Mr White was entirely appropriate because the Court needed to have before it a full account of the transactions that had led up to the contract of sale in question. I accept the latter point that the affidavit material was entirely appropriate in supporting the discretionary order that was sought from the Court, even assuming it was always limited in the form of the direction that I have made. However, I consider that the defendants were affected in their opposition to the direction because of the wider way in which it was originally cast.

46 The plaintiffs have not obtained the full ambit of the relief which they originally sought. In the circumstances, I propose to make an order to the same effect as the order which Hodgson J made in Vartex . I will order that the costs of the defendants of and incidental to the application be paid out of the funds in the hands of the plaintiffs in their capacity as receivers and managers of Lake Federation.

47 Pursuant to s 424 of the Corporations Act , I will make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs, that:
 
 It is not unlawful solely by reason of the relationship between TIGA (Ballarat) Pty Ltd (ACN 117 812 030) ('TIGA') and the appointor of the plaintiffs, Thorney Properties (Ballarat) Pty Ltd (ACN 106 693 725), for the plaintiffs to enter into the contract of sale dated 17 January 2006 ('Contract') between Lake Federation Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) ('Lake Federation') and TIGA in respect of the property described in Sch 1 of the Contract.

48 I will also order that the defendants' costs of and incidental to the application be paid out of the funds in the hands of the plaintiffs as receivers and managers of Lake Federation.

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Best &amp; Less (Wollongong) Pty Ltd (1992) 7 ACSR 245</tocase>
<text>22 A number of cases indicate that a direction under s 424 of the Corporations Act has the limited force I have described. In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Best &amp; Less (Wollongong) Pty Ltd (1992) 7 ACSR 245 (' Best &amp; Less' ), Lockhart J said that the extent to which directions of the court under s 424 and similar sections can bind anyone is a matter of considerable doubt: at 246. His Honour said that the court plainly cannot give directions as to the rights of persons who are not parties to the hearing of the application. Moreover, even if persons are joined as parties to the application, his Honour said that it is doubtful they can be bound in a sense that can give rise to an issue estoppel. Lockhart J added at 246 that:
 
 '[i]t would still be open for a company or person to sue a receiver and manager... for breach of duty, even if he had followed the court's instruction, although he could rely upon the giving of those directions if he seeks relief under s 1318 of the Corporations Law.'

23 Similar views have been expressed in other cases. In One.Tel , Austin J said that there is some doubt as to whether directions of a court given under a section of this kind can bind anyone, even a party to the application, citing Best &amp; Less : at 93 [37]. In Vartex , Hodgson J was less equivocal, stating that a direction would not bind a director of the company who was represented before the court.

27 Other limits on the court's power to give directions under s 424 have been discussed in the authorities. In particular, the authorities make it clear that it is not appropriate for the court to give directions about the commercial propriety or reasonableness of a transaction that the receiver proposes to enter into: see One.Tel at 91 [30], 92 [33] and 93 [38]; and Best &amp; Less at 247, 249 and 250. In Franbridge Pty Ltd v Societ&eacute; &amp; Generale Finance Corporation Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 304 (' Franbridge') , Einfeld J refused to make directions to the effect that a particular transaction was not improper and, more particularly, that the receiver had acted reasonably: at 308, 309.

35 The cases decided under s 424 show a distinct disinclination on the part of courts to make any direction that approves, or appears to approve, the undertaking of a commercial transaction by a receiver. Likewise, the courts have resisted the notion that they should make a direction under s 424 that a receiver has acted reasonably in the performance of his duties pursuant to s 420A. There is a good reason for this caution. Unless directions are carefully worded, they might give a false public perception that the court is placing its imprimatur upon a particular transaction: see Lockhart J in Best &amp; Less at 249 and Franbridge , where Einfeld J said at 308:
 
 'The court should not be asked to make orders, give directions or make declarations that would convey to the public, quite wrongly, for the reasons Lockhart and Hodgson JJ point out, that the court is giving judicial approval to the sale after due consideration in accordance with regular procedures when, however the words are hedged, in fact it is not doing that at all.'</text>

<tocase>Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha (2001) 39 ACSR 355</tocase>
<text>24 The same view has been expressed in the context of the provision of the Corporations Act that permits directions to be given for the benefit of a liquidator of a company. In Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha (2001) 39 ACSR 355 (' Re Ansett' ) at 370 [59], the Court referred approvingly to the following passage in the judgment of McLelland J in Re GB Nathan &amp; Co Pty Ltd (in liq) (1991) 24 NSWLR 674 at 679-680:
 
 'Modern Australian authority confirms the view that s 479(3) "does not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments" and that the function of a liquidator's application for directions "is to give him advice as to his proper course of action in the liquidation; it is not to determine the rights and liabilities arising from the company's transactions before the liquidation".'</text>

<text>27 Other limits on the court's power to give directions under s 424 have been discussed in the authorities. In particular, the authorities make it clear that it is not appropriate for the court to give directions about the commercial propriety or reasonableness of a transaction that the receiver proposes to enter into: see One.Tel at 91 [30], 92 [33] and 93 [38]; and Best &amp; Less at 247, 249 and 250.

Likewise, the courts have resisted the notion that they should make a direction under s 424 that a receiver has acted reasonably in the performance of his duties pursuant to s 420A.

<tocase>Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/30.html</AustLII>
<text>29 In Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at 279-280, the High Court said that the powers conferred by s 447A are wide, but they are not entirely without limit. The High Court found that there is nothing on the face of s 447A(1) that suggests it should be read down; it confers power to make orders which will have effect in the future. Their Honours said that the orders contemplated by s 447A(2) go beyond a curial determination of what is the effect of existing provisions of the Part in relation to a particular company, and contemplate orders that alter how Part 5.3A is to operate in relation to a particular company under administration.

30 The power under s 447A is extremely wide. This may explain the preparedness of the Goldberg J in Re Ansett to give directions approving a particular agreement to be entered into by the administrators. In that case, Goldberg J noted that it is not the role of the court to make a commercial judgment for the liquidators or administrators or to substitute its judgment for their judgment, but then added at 371:
 
 [A]lthough courts will not pronounce upon the commercial prudence of a particular transaction, they will act in an appropriate case to protect liquidators and administrators from claims that they have acted unreasonably in entering into particular transactions. That protection will remain so long as the liquidators or administrators have made a full and fair disclosure to the court of all facts material to the subject-matter under consideration.'

31 In Re Ansett , Goldberg J give a direction under s 447A that the Court approved a particular contractual arrangement that the administrators proposed to enter into.</text>

<tocase>Re Ansett Australia Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 605</tocase>
<text>32 Another case to similar effect is Re Ansett Australia Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 605 at 615-616 [44]-[46] and 618 [54]. In that case, Goldberg J acknowledged that the Court should not give directions as to whether or not a decision made by the administrators is a commercial decision. However, his Honour said at 616 [46]:
 
 '... where issues as to the propriety or reasonableness of the conduct undertaken, or the decision made, by an administrator is called in question, it is open to the court to give a direction which, in substance, sanctions or approves the conduct undertaken, or decision made, by the administrator.'

33 His Honour also said that in so far as it might be thought that it was implicit in his reasons for directing that the administrators may properly perform and give effect to the agreement, that was a necessary and inevitable consequence of a consideration of the propriety and reasonableness of the conduct of the administrators in entering into and seeking to perform and give effect to the agreement: at 618 [54].

34 It therefore seems that, while ss 424 and 447A of the Corporations Act have their respective limits, the courts have been prepared to go further into the commercial arena in making directions under the wider power conferred by s 447A than they have in giving directions to receivers under s 424.</text>
