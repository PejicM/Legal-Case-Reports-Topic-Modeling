<text>5 In those circumstances, two issues arise on the present application. The first is whether it was open to Mr Pascoe to rely upon the provisions of s 1072C of the Act. I have been taken this afternoon to a number of authorities which deal with the effect of that section. The decision of Campbell J in the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Buffier (2005) ACSR 839 seems to me plainly to support the applicability of s 1072C to authorise Mr Pascoe to pass the resolution. Other authorities to the same effect include the decision of Sackville J in Prentice v Cummins [2002] FCA 1165 at [7] ; the decision of Hasluck J in Nilant v RL &amp; KW Nominees Pty Ltd [2007] WASC 105 ; and the decision of Heerey J in Rambaldi; in the matter of Weeden, a bankrupt v Weeden [2008] FCA 1597 at [40] .</text>
