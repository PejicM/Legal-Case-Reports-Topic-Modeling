<tocase>Re Felix Resources Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1182</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1182.html</AustLII>
<text>His Honour's reasons for making those orders are to be found in the reasons for judgment which he gave that day: see Re Felix Resources Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1182.

These reasons for judgment should be read in conjunction with those given by his Honour on 28 September 2009. The proposed scheme is more particularly described in his Honour's reasons for judgement. I do not, therefore, take time to recite again the nature of the scheme as proposed.

Since 28 September 2009 there has been a further development.

The explanatory memorandum, to which I have already referred, has been sent. Section 412 of the Corporations Act requires, inter alia, that the explanatory memorandum sent to shareholders contain: 
 
 Any other information that is material to the making of a decision by a member whether or not to agree to the arrangement.</text>

<tocase>Re Coates Hire (No 2) [2007] FCA 2105</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/2105.html</AustLII>
<text>Felix Resources apprehends, in light of a further development, that it is appropriate to seek court approval for the sending of a supplementary memorandum. There is no doubt that it is a prudent and appropriate course for Felix Resources to have taken to seek such approval, note the criticism voiced in Re Coates Hire (No 2) [2007] FCA 2105 at [7] in respect of a corporation that sent such material without first obtaining court approval.

The original explanatory memorandum disclosed that Felix Resources would be declaring a second 50 cent dividend. What that memorandum did not disclose was the timing of the dividend and the circumstances relating to the way in which the company would pay that dividend. As it transpires, the directors of Felix Resources propose to fund that dividend with the use of funds borrowed from particular shareholders. It is that development and that proposal which has provided the occasion for the making of this application. On 10 November 2009, the board of directors of Felix Resources declared a fully franked 50 cent dividend payable to each share in the company. That dividend is payable on 9 December 2009. It is on the day after members met to vote on the scheme and the day before the hearing of the application for court approval.

The material before me discloses, candidly, that Felix Resources does not presently have sufficient cash resources to meet the second 50 cent dividend payment on 9 December 2009 while at the same time complying with financing arrangements which it has with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. It is against that background that Felix Resources proposes to borrow the full amount needed for the payment of the second dividend from its three largest shareholders. It has entered into loan agreements with each of those shareholders to that end. Pursuant to cl 4.3 of an implementation agreement in cl 6 of the deed poll Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited (Yanzhou), which I note is represented today by leave by its solicitors, and its subsidiary, Austar, have agreed to put in a place a letter of credit from the Bank of China's Sydney branch which will guarantee repayment of amounts outstanding under the shareholder loans to which I have referred.</text>
