<text>7 The defendant, apart from responding to all three grounds relied upon by the plaintiff, also contended that the plaintiff had failed to comply with s 459G(3) of the Act, compliance with which goes to jurisdiction. The defendant contended that as a result, the jurisdiction of the court had not been enlivened and the court could not make an order setting aside the demand either pursuant to s 459H(3) or s 459J(1)(a) or (b). The merits of that contention are dealt with at [16] to [37] of the reasons for judgment ( Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722).

8 I have had the benefit of receiving and considering submissions from both the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to the principles governing the exercise of the discretion as to costs in the light of the judgment and urging the exercise of the discretion in a particular way.

9 Since the plaintiff failed to establish the first two grounds of challenge to the statutory demand and the defendant was unsuccessful in relation to the contention going to s 459G(3) , the final question to be determined was whether the plaintiff's material adequately demonstrated the subsistence of a genuine dispute between the parties as to the existence or amount of a debt to which the demand related.</text>
