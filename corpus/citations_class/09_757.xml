<text>251 They also distinguish Application by GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd [2003] ACompT 6 ; [2004] ATPR 41-978 ; [2003] ACompT 6 (GasNet) at [47] as directed to the need to apply the CAPM in a conventional way. According to their submissions, the Tribunal was not there suggesting that the CAPM formula could be applied only in a way that was consistent with an acceptance of its underlying assumptions.
 Consideration
 General

252 As previously noted, Telstra led expert evidence from Professor Stephen Faulkner Gray, Professor of Finance at UQ Business School, University of Queensland, and also the Managing Director of The Strategic Finance Group: SFG Consulting. Also as noted above, Optus led expert evidence from Jason Peter Ockerby, a director of the Competition Economists Group. The non-Optus access seekers led expert evidence from Dr Thomas Nicholas Hird, also of the Competition Economists Group. The three economists provided a "Joint Report of Experts" (Joint Report) to the Court. They also provided their own independent reports and gave extensive oral evidence.
 The authorities

253 The authorities referred to by Telstra (see [219] above) concerned statutory contexts different from the present one. They required that a "value" or a value of a particular kind or an amount of "compensation" be determined, and in some instances the basic expressions were elaborated upon or defined. Accordingly, the argument was open in those cases that the statute had been misconstrued.

270 I see no ground for criticism of ACCC's reasoning process by which it rejected Telstra's capital strike proposition. It was at liberty to consider that in the real world investors do not behave in the way in which the capital strike proposition would have them behave. Accordingly, in this respect ACCC did not behave unreasonably or irrationally, and neither error of law nor Wednesbury unreasonableness is made out.
 Inconsistency and Application by GasNet Australia (Operations) Pty Ltd [2003] ACompT 6 ; [2004] ATPR 41-978 ; [2003] ACompT 6

271 Telstra's contention that there is a fundamental inconsistency in relying on the CAPM and accepting the heterogeneity of investor expectations is well expressed at [68] of Telstra's submissions to ACCC:
 
 ...the conventional versions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (" CAPM "), [to] which both the Commission and the Tribunal refer in their previous regulatory decisions, do not extend in any simple way to heterogeneous investor information and expectations. As a result, if the Commission and the Tribunal genuinely hold the view that investors have heterogeneous information and expectations, they cannot continue to rely on the models they have conventionally used to determine allowed rates-of-return. To do so would be to contradict the requirement the Tribunal has set out in earlier decisions that the CAPM be applied in a manner consistent with its underlying assumptions. 

 
The reference in the last section to "earlier decisions" is a reference to the Tribunal's decision in GasNet at [47]. The Tribunal there stated:
 
 The ACCC erred in concluding that it was open to it to apply the CAPM in other than the conventional way to produce an outcome which it believed better achieved the objectives of s 8.1. In truth and reality, the use of different values for a risk free rate in the working out of a Rate of Return by the CAPM formula is neither true to the formula nor a conventional use of the CAPM. It is the use of another model based on the CAPM with adjustments made on a pragmatic basis to achieve an outcome which reflects an attempt to modify the model to one which operates by reference to the regulatory period of five years. The CAPM is not a model which is intended to operate in this way. The timescales are dictated by the relevant underlying facts in each case and for present purposes those include the life of the assets and the term of the investment. 

 
The reference to "s 8.1" is a reference to s 8.1 of the National Third Party Access Code for Natural Gas Pipeline Systems. Section 8.1 set out the objectives according to which a "Reference Tariff" and "Reference Tariff Policy" were to be designed. I do not think that the Tribunal's observation at [47] set out above is relevant to the question whether ACCC was obliged, in order to be consistent, to accept as according with the real world the assumptions according to which the CAPM was formulated.
 Inconsistency and the expert evidence

272 I do not find it necessary or think it desirable to attempt to describe comprehensively the effect of the totality of the evidence of the expert witnesses, but certain aspects of the Joint Report, in particular, are noteworthy.

273 The experts agreed that:
 the required return on equity capital cannot be estimated with great precision; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM relies on a number of assumptions that are unrealistic, one of which is that of homogeneous investor expectations about the future prospects of each firm; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM pricing relation can be derived adopting assumptions different from those originally employed by Sharpe and Lintner, one of those different assumptions being that investors have heterogeneous expectations about the future prospects of each firm, but other assumptions are required to arrive at the relation, and the pricing relation may hold only approximately; the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM allows investors to have heterogeneous attitudes towards risk (different levels of risk aversion); the pricing relationship used by ACCC was consistent with that originally developed by Sharpe and Lintner and also that subsequently derived from it using the assumption of heterogeneous expectations and other additional assumptions; heterogeneity of risk aversion is already allowed for in the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM.</text>

10 The second respondents can be conceived of as falling into groups according to their legal representation. Mr A Robertson SC with Mr S J Free of counsel appeared for Optus and XYZed. I was told that those companies form part of the Singtel Optus group. Ms M Sloss SC with Mr M J Hoyne of counsel appeared for Agile, Adam, Amcom, Network, Macquarie, PowerTel, Request, Chime and Primus. Mr M J Hoyne of counsel appeared for TPG.

11 In all proceedings Dr J E Griffiths SC and Ms M N Allars appeared for Telstra. Mr J S Hilton SC and Mr M H O'Bryan appeared for ACCC.

193 Ground 6(b) is Wednesbury unreasonableness (cf Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223), both under the general law and as reflected in s 5(1)(e) when read with s 5(2)(g) of the ADJR Act. The FD is said to be illogical, irrational and perverse because it was based on a manifestly erroneous economic analysis.

194 In its amended application for an order of review, Telstra gives particulars of Ground 6 in 10 paragraphs that can be paraphrased as follows:
 
(i) ACCC determined the WACC on the basis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM);
 
(ii) A fundamental assumption of the CAPM is that all investors require the same return from investment in a particular asset irrespective of their risk preferences;
 
(iii) Telstra put a "welfare asymmetry argument" to ACCC to the effect that the WACC should be set so as to take sufficient account of the social consequences of underestimating it, such as that necessary investment may not be undertaken because of the perceived inadequacy of the return on capital invested;
 
(iv) ACCC rejected this submission on the ground that it was based on an assumption that all investors have homogeneous expectations as to the return required from a particular asset, when, in practice, they have heterogeneous expectations as to that return;
 
(v) The basis on which ACCC rejected Telstra's submission in (iii) and made the finding in (iv), contradicted a fundamental assumption in ACCC's setting of the WACC using CAPM, namely, that all investors have homogeneous expectations as to the return required from a particular asset;
 
(vi) Further, or in the alternative to (i) to (v) above, ACCC rejected Telstra's submission referred to at (iii) on the basis of the availability of capital at a lower than normal rate of return in relation to an asset;
 
(vii) ACCC's conclusions referred to in (v) and (vi), even if the CAPM economic framework is not adopted, are based on the manifestly erroneous premise of markets being in a state of disequilibrium and/or of investors being irrational;
 
(viii) By reason of (i) to (vi) above, ACCC's setting of the WACC on the basis of an erroneous principle was an error of law;
 
(ix) By reason of (i) to (vii) above, ACCC's setting of the WACC was illogical, irrational and perverse;
 
(x) In the result the FD is invalid (or liable to be set aside) as infected by jurisdictional error on the grounds stated in ss 5(1)(f) and 5(1)(e) (when read with s 5(2)(g)) of the ADJR Act.
 Some principles of economics

195 It is common ground that a fair or efficient price must include as one component the fair return that Telstra is required to give in return for the equity and loan capital that it needs. In the regulatory framework, the standard practice for calculating this fair return is by reference to an estimate of the regulated firm's WACC. The WACC is a weighted average of:
 
(a) the return that would be required by the providers of debt capital to the firm as a sufficient incentive to provide that debt capital;
 
(b) the return that would be required by the providers of equity capital to the firm as a sufficient incentive to provide that equity capital.

227 In support of proposition (a), Telstra refers to cases in which the ground of review often referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness has been described.

228 In relation to Telstra's proposition (b), Telstra refers to the discussion of steps (b) to (f) in relation to Ground 6(a) above.

229 In respect of proposition (c), Telstra submits that ACCC's reasons for rejecting the welfare asymmetry argument were fundamentally illogical and perverse in at least two ways.

245 Optus submits that the Wednesbury unreasonableness ground of review does not extend to an error of reasoning in making a finding of fact about a matter that is one of many factual elements in the determination of an access dispute.
 Non-Optus and XYZed access seekers' submissions

246 The non-Optus and XYZed access seekers, to whom I will refer as the non-Optus access seekers, emphasise that the CAPM and the WACC provide only estimates, and that it is not possible to observe whether the figures that they give are correct or not. They are only formulae, cannot take into account all of the real world effects, and their inputs are unknowns.

247 The non-Optus access seekers identify two major questions on which the expert witnesses disagree:
 
(a) Is it a necessary assumption of the CAPM formula used by ACCC that investors have homogeneous expectations?
 
(b) If it is, is there any illogicality in ACCC's using the CAPM to arrive at the WACC, then rejecting Telstra's welfare asymmetry argument on the basis, inter alia, that investors do not have homogeneous expectations?

249 In their written submissions, the non-Optus access seekers summarise the experts' evidence in relation to these questions, but submit that it is not necessary for the Court to resolve the debate between them. Those parties submit that if the Court should conclude that ACCC's approach is supported by a respectable body of economic thought, that suffices to defeat Telstra's claim based on error of law and Wednesbury unreasonableness. Nonetheless, they submit that the evidence and Telstra's submissions do not demonstrate illogicality in ACCC's reasoning process for a number of reasons on which they elaborate.

250 The non-Optus access seekers distinguish the valuation of land cases relied on by Telstra as turning on the terms of particular statutes. They note that Telstra purports to concede (as it must) that illogicality or unreasonableness do not necessarily constitute reviewable error unless there is a legal principle or statutory provision that attracts that consequence: they cite Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20 / 2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 ; [2003] HCA 30 ( S20 ) at 61 per Gleeson CJ. Whether relying on Wednesbury unreasonableness or "illogicality, unreasonableness and perversity", as in S20 , one must identify a particular statutory provision or other legal principle that has been infringed. The non-Optus access seekers submit that Wednesbury unreasonableness is directed at outcomes, whereas S20 illogicality is directed at processes of reasoning: see S20 [2003] HCA 30 ; 198 ALR 59 at 76 per McHugh, Gummow JJ, 88 per Kirby J.

257 In para 6 of its amended application for an order of review, Adam referred to Wednesbury unreasonableness as "further or in the alternative" to the error of law ground, and gave the same particulars of both (see [194] above). In its submissions, however, while acknowledging substantial overlap between the two grounds, Telstra distinguished between them (see [218] (error of law) and [226] ( Wednesbury unreasonableness) above).

261 While I will examine the alleged error, illogicality, irrationality and perversity of which Telstra alleges ACCC was guilty, in my view the alleged inconsistency in reasoning process on which Telstra seizes does not constitute either error of law or Wednesbury unreasonableness, because Telstra has not related it to a particular statutory provision or legal principle that the inconsistency is said to have infringed.
 The assumptions underlying the CAPM

262 In the report annexed to his first affidavit, filed in the Adam LSS proceeding, Professor Gray noted that the CAPM is mathematically derived under a number of formal assumptions which are set out in most standard finance textbooks. Citing C Jones, Investments: Analysis and Management (John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 2002) at 531, Professor Gray listed the assumptions as follows:
 All investors have identical probability distributions for future rates of return; they have identical (or homogeneous) expectations with respect to the three inputs of the portfolio model (expected returns, the variance of returns and the correlation matrix). Therefore, given a set of security prices and a risk-free rate, all investors use the same information to generate an efficient frontier;
 All investors have the same one-period time horizon;
 All investors can borrow or lend money at the exogenously given risk free rate of return and there are no restrictions on short sales of any asset;
 All assets are marketable (perfectly divisible and perfectly liquid) and there are no transaction costs;
 There are no personal income taxes investors are indifferent between capital gains and dividends;
 There is no inflation;
 There are many investors and no single investor can affect the price of a stock through his or her buying and selling decisions. Investors are price takers and act as if prices are unaffected by their own trades; and
 Capital markets are in equilibrium.

263 In oral evidence, Professor Gray explained the nature of economic models and the unrealistic nature of the assumptions underlying them as follows (T541):
 
 Every assumption of every economic model is unrealistic. ... I should expand upon that, perhaps. The way every economic model works is to start with a set of assumptions that are necessarily unrealistic, which is why they are called assumptions. They are not descriptions of reality. Based on those simplifying assumptions, we apply an internally consistent set of logic or mathematical derivation, and that produces some outputs. When evaluating the use or worth of an economic model, we don't have any regard to the reality of the assumptions. We look at the effectiveness or the use to which the outputs can be put. So that might be, in terms of in this example, determining what an appropriate return would be for a regulated monopoly asset. 

 
 If the model works, if it's useful, if it explains something or makes some useful predictions that are supported empirically, then it will be a successful model. All of the models in economics are based on a set of assumptions that try to simplify very complex phenomena into something that can be modelled. That is the whole reason for having those assumptions. Indeed, every assumption in every economic model is for that reason unrealistic. That is the whole point of having those assumptions.

270 I see no ground for criticism of ACCC's reasoning process by which it rejected Telstra's capital strike proposition. It was at liberty to consider that in the real world investors do not behave in the way in which the capital strike proposition would have them behave. Accordingly, in this respect ACCC did not behave unreasonably or irrationally, and neither error of law nor Wednesbury unreasonableness is made out.

284 In my view neither the error of law ground nor the Wednesbury unreasonableness ground is made out in respect of the WACC.
 E LINE COSTS 
 Introduction

285 Telstra raises two grounds in respect of "line costs" in the Amcom, Adam, Agile, Primus (the acronym "AAAP" has been used to refer to these four access seekers who made a joint submission in the ACCC arbitrations), Network and TPG proceedings. These are all six of the LSS proceedings. I will refer to Adam as representative.

286 Both grounds concern the access seekers' business plans, and, in particular, the question whether those business plans provided a justification for not including a contribution to line costs in the annual charge for access to the LSS (LSS Annual Charge).

385 Telstra contends that s 152DB(1)(b) had the effect, in the circumstances of the present case, of requiring ACCC to inquire into and investigate a particular matter. Telstra submits that this statutory duty may be no less than the duty developed at common law in connection with Wednesbury unreasonableness, and refers to Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170 per Wilcox J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] - [79] ; Visa International v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at [623] - [627] . That common law rule is that a failure by a decision maker to obtain "centrally relevant" information on a critical issue which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have proceeded to make the decision without making an inquiry with a view to obtaining the information, in default of which the decision will be an invalid exercise of power.

386 Telstra, however, disclaims reliance on Wednesbury unreasonableness ( Wednesbury unreasonableness is recognised by the ADJR Act as a ground of review under ss 5(1)(e) and 5(2)(g) of that Act).

387 The access seekers submit that the duty under s 152DB(1)(b) can be no greater than the common law duty referred to above. This is because, so they argue, the legislative purpose and primary provision of s 152DB(1)(b) is to require ACCC to act as speedily as possible, while the remainder of para (b) sets a limit on this requirement. That remainder does not impose additional obligations on ACCC.

388 Telstra, on the other hand, argues that primacy must be given to the investigation and inquiry mandated by s 152DB(1)(b), and suggests that the duty to act with speed indicates the manner in which that inquiry and investigation are to be undertaken.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>339 In this context, a finding involves an error of law when there is no evidence at all to support it ( Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355-356 and 358 per Mason CJ ( Bond ). It is not sufficient, however, that the decision-maker draws an inference by illogical reasoning. Rather, it must be established that there was no evidence permitting the drawing of the inference by any process of reasoning ( Bond at 356).

340 The factual findings in question made by ACCC in each of the LSS arbitrations are:
 that introducing a contribution to line costs within the period of the LSS FD would require significant changes to the access seeker's business (see [331] of Adam LSS FD Statement of Reasons set out at [334] above); that the access seeker will have formed its business plan in expectation that ACCC would act consistently with the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles (see [331], [332] of Adam LSS FD Statement of Reasons set out at [334] above); and that introducing a contribution to line costs into the LSS Annual Charge would be likely to necessitate a shift in the access seeker's business model and divert it from conducting its business (see [335] and [376] of Adam LSS FD Statement of Reasons set out at [334] and [335] above). 
I will call these "the Findings" or "the Four Findings" and will refer to them individually by number, e.g. Finding 1, 2, 3 and 4.
 Telstra's submissions in general

341 Telstra complains that there was "no material or other evidence" before ACCC in each proceeding to support the Findings (Telstra's words are similar to those found in s 5(1)(h) of the ADJR Act, but Telstra does not raise that ground of review (see [362] below)). In particular, Telstra complains that although the access seekers' submissions allege various matters in respect of their business plans, no document was produced (apart from the statement of Mr Hicks, discussed below):
 recording any business plan; showing the likely effect on a business plan of an LSS Annual Charge that included a line cost contribution; identifying the amount of the LSS Annual Charge that an access seeker expected to be charged; containing a financial model that revealed the basis of any business plan of an access seeker; demonstrating the effect of an LSS Annual Charge above the $2.50 level which was, in the event, set by ACCC.

353 Therefore, the access seekers argue, the inferences drawn by ACCC were "reasonably open" (see Bond at 356). No profit and loss statements were necessary, so the access seekers contend, for those conclusions to be supportable.
 The parties' submissions relating to Mr Hicks's statement

354 I turn now to Mr Hicks's statement.

355 It will be recalled that in his statement that was annexed to AAAP's submissions to ACCC (see [305] above), Mr Hicks referred to an assumed LSS price that was used in Adam's business models at certain times. Telstra submits that Mr Hicks's statement directly contradicted ACCC's findings (in the case of Adam) as distinct from merely not supporting it. Telstra does not specify the supposed contradiction. Telstra points out in addition that Mr Hicks's statement does not refer to any expectation on the part of Adam that the LSS price would not include a contribution to line costs.

362 In discussing the ground of review provided for in s 5(1)(f) as compared with that in s 5(1)(h) (the "no evidence" ground in the ADJR Act), Mason CJ said in Bond (at 358):
 
 The better view, one which seeks to harmonize the two grounds of review, is to treat "error of law" in s 5(1)(f) as embracing the "no evidence" ground as it was accepted and applied in Australia before the enactment of the [ADJR Act] and to treat the "no evidence" ground of review [that is, s 5(1)(h)], as elucidated in s 5(3), as expanding that ground of review in the applications for which pars (a) and (b) of s 5(3) make provision. Within the area of operation of par (a) it is enough to show an absence of evidence or material from which the decision-maker could reasonably be satisfied that the particular matter was established, that being a lesser burden than that of showing absence of evidence (or material) to support the decision. 

 
The limitations provided for in s 5(3) of the ADJR Act therefore have no application, but the strictures associated with the no evidence ground at common law apply.

363 It is necessary to bear in mind the following features of the Div 8 arbitrations as they were conducted by ACCC:
 
(1) ACCC was not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence, and was entitled to inform itself of any matter relevant to the dispute in any way it thought appropriate (s 152DB(1)(a) and (c));
 
(2) ACCC had power to give generally all such directions and do all such things as were necessary or expedient for the speedy hearing and determination of the access disputes (s 152DC(1)(f));
 
(3) In accordance with ACCC's directions, the arbitrations were not divided into evidentiary and submissions stages as would be the case in litigation, and ACCC was entitled to "inform itself" by means of the parties' "submissions";
 
(4) ACCC had long since made it clear that ideally entities accessing the LSS should contribute to Telstra's line costs, but that since ACCC considered that Telstra was already recovering those costs, it was a condition of the inclusion of a contribution to line costs that there be a rebalancing as between LSS on the one hand and ULLS and WLR on the other hand, in order to ensure that Telstra would recover no more than its line costs and did not "double dip";
 
(5) ACCC reasoned, as it was entitled to do, that a rebalancing would create an incentive to move from LSS to ULLS or WLR because an access seeker that accessed the LSS alone would be less competitive compared with those that accessed the ULLS and WLR because of the reduction in Telstra's charges to the latter resulting from the rebalancing.

364 Understandably, in the report accompanying the DFD, ACCC accepted that a rebalancing would take time, have the potential to disrupt competition in DSL services, and would involve Telstra in restructuring its existing charges for other services. ACCC sought submissions from the parties as to whether there was a real prospect for a rebalancing to take effect prior to the proposed expiry date of the proposed FDs (which was then only a matter of months away; see [294] above).</text>

<text>481 The 2007 LSS Pricing Principles did not expressly revoke the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles. It is well established, however, that the making of a later statutory instrument that is inconsistent with an earlier one revokes the earlier one to the extent of the inconsistency: see, for example Ward v Repatriation Commission (1997) 46 ALD 454 at 461 and the authorities there referred to, as well as Caloundra City Council v Netstar Pty Ltd [2008] 1 Qd R 258 at [8]-[14].</text>

<text>466 ACCC submits that when exercising its power to backdate the Adam LSS FD, s 152DNA(7) allowed it to have regard to matters it considered relevant and those matters included, in the circumstances, the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles. Finally, ACCC submits that it is not the case that s 152AQA(6) gives anyone an accrued right to have an access arbitration determined in accordance with pricing principles that were current at the time of notification of the access dispute or at any other time. ACCC refers to Esber v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430 at 440.
 Consideration
 Ground 2(a)

467 The way in which Telstra's Ground 2(a) was expressed in the amended application for an order of review in the Adam proceeding does not sit comfortably with the way in which Telstra's submissions were put. In the amended application, Ground 2(a) depended on the invalidity in whole or in part of the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles: see [400] [401] above. The invalidity was said to arise from the fact of the continuing and operative 2002 LSS Pricing Principles or from inconsistency between them and the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles.

468 Telstra's submission, however, is that ACCC erred by having regard to both the 2002 and 2007 LSS Pricing Principles.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1908/55.html</AustLII>
<text>460 ACCC refers to the ordinary principles of statutory construction that a later legislative instrument will repeal an earlier one by implication if the provisions of both cannot stand together, either because the two are inconsistent or because effect cannot be given to both. ACCC cites Mitchell v Scales [1907] HCA 66 ; (1907) 5 CLR 405 at 417 and Goodwin v Phillips [1908] HCA 55 ; (1908) 7 CLR 1.

482 In my view the determination of the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles by necessary implication revoked determination of the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles in toto and not merely to the extent of the inconsistency. This view is supported by the following considerations:
 the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles evince an intention to deal comprehensively with the principles relating to the price of access to the LSS, i.e. to cover the subject matter that had been the subject matter of the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles, namely, the "principles relating to the price of access to a declared service [the LSS]" (cf s 152AQA(1) of the Act, and see on the implied repeal of legislation Mitchell v Scales [1907] HCA 66 ; (1907) 5 CLR 405 at 417; Goodwin v Phillips (1908) 7 CLR 1 at 7, 10); the 2002 and 2007 LSS Pricing Principles were made in exercise of the same statutory power; the LSS Declaration Review considered the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles and subsequent events, and discussed at length and comprehensively in the light of them the question of "appropriate pricing principles" to be determined; the 2007 LSS Pricing Principles re-stated the first of the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles rather than leaving it to remain stated in the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles.</text>

243 Optus submits that while an error of principle in arriving at a value may amount to an error of law, the cases in which that has been held to be so have concerned statutory valuation exercises, and in any event the approach should be treated with caution: Optus cites Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5 ; (2008) 233 CLR 259 ( Walker Corporation ) at 269-272. Optus submits that in any event Telstra has failed to identify the "principle" which it says ACCC ignored or misapplied. Optus distinguishes the particular substantive principles considered in Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads [1979] AC 426 and the related authorities cited by Telstra (see [219] above). In Walker Corporation the High Court (at 270) cautioned against importing into one case general "principles" derived from other cases that arose in different statutory contexts. Optus submits that Telstra has not identified in Pt XIC of the Act or in the common law a source of any "principles" that control the arbitral powers conferred on ACCC by Div 8 of that Part.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>118 It is not conceivable that ACCC would come to a different decision if the matter were to be returned to it: cf Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 31 (per Gibbs CJ) and 40 (per Mason J). The reasoning expressed in the 2008 ULLS Pricing Principles and Indicative Terms, to which s 152AQA(6) would require ACCC to have regard, are inconsistent with the 2003 ULLS Model Terms over which they must prevail to the extent of the inconsistency: s 152AQB(10)(b).
 Severance

119 In the further alternative, Optus also argues that if there was an error by ACCC, it related only to the decision to backdate and so the Optus ULLS FD, in so far as it relates to the period from 18 November 2005 to 30 June 2006, can be severed from the FD in so far as it relates to the period after the latter date.

120 Telstra, on the other hand, argues that it is not possible to identify parts of the Optus ULLS FD or of the Optus ULLS FD Statement of Reasons that can be excised so as to save the remainder, from invalidity.

213 In two important paragraphs, [472] and [473], ACCC stated:
 
 [472] The conceptual argument presented by Telstra obviously does not allow for heterogeneity in terms of risk profiles, or requirements as to returns among investors or participants in capital markets. Put another way, the assumption made here is that all investors and by extension financiers in capital markets share a common view as to an appropriate WACC for an investment project. This implies that all investors have similar expected marginal costs and revenues (as this impacts the margin necessary for the project to be considered viable). In addition, it assumes that all potential investors have a homogenous risk profile.
 [Original emphasis] 

 
 [473] In the Commission's view these assumptions are unlikely to reflect how investment decisions are actually made in practice. More generally, in the Commission's view, the decision as to whether or not to invest in a specific project can differ among different groups of investors, and over time, is dependant on factors such as the relative risk aversion and the expected returns required on different investments. As these are likely to differ among different investors and institutions, it is unlikely that there will always be a common view among investors and capital markets as to appropriateness of a particular return on capital. Rather investors will have different risk and return profiles for investment projects, and it is precisely the possibility to take advantage of these differences which arguably drive capital markets. For this reason, it is possible to observe in practice a combination of both high risk investments being undertaken at high rates of return, and at the same time, relatively low risk investments with correspondingly lower rates of return.

214 ACCC set out (at [487]) in a table the "resulting WACC values" in respect of the years 2000-01 to 2007-08. The WACC (post-tax vanilla) ranged from a high of 9.66% (in 2000-01) to a low of 8.26% (in 2003-04). The WACC (post-tax vanilla) for the most recent year in the table (2007-08) was 9.25%.

215 In order to estimate the WACC, ACCC used the same standard CAPM that it had used in the past. This was the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM. Telstra submits (at para 3.14) that it is not disputed that this CAPM gives a flat supply schedule (a horizontal straight line) for equity capital. However, Dr Hird and Mr Ockerby say that the CAPM that was used by ACCC can also be derived using homogeneous expectations.

389 I addressed the question of the duty imposed on ACCC by para (b) of s 152DB(1) in the Earlier Reasons at [164]-[166] where I said:
 I regard s 152DB(1) as a general exhortatory provision: it exhorts ACCC to strive to achieve broad objectives. Some of those broad objectives, at least if regarded in isolation, are antithetical to one another. The notions of "speed", "proper consideration of the dispute", "careful inquiry and investigation", "quick inquiry and investigation", "inquiry into and investigation of ... all matters affecting the merits" (emphasis added) and "fairness" pull in different directions: cf the discussion of ss 420 and 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in Sun Zhan Qui v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Lindgren J, 6 May 1997) at 39-41, and see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu (1999) 197 CLR 611 at [49] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J.
 It may be noted in passing that achievement of the objectives depends not only on the diligence, awareness and qualifications of ACCC officers: it also depends on the levels of funding and workload of ACCC as they respectively exist at any particular time and from time to time. I do not imply, however, that these extraneous considerations have the potential to give rise to a fluctuating construction of s 152DB(1)(b). 
 I find it difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a court would find that a failure to achieve the goal of speed or that of carefulness would, without more, provide a ground for the granting of relief in respect of an administrative decision. Surely the person aggrieved would have to show that the failure had had consequences in terms of one of the recognised grounds of judicial review. For example, absence of care (perhaps arising indirectly from excessive speed) could give rise to an overlooking of a relevant consideration or a failure to accord procedural fairness. It is not obvious what ground of judicial review, if any, might arise directly from a failure to act "speedily" or to inquire "quickly". It is another question whether the decision-maker could invoke the requirement of speed "in defence" against the consequences, in terms of grounds of judicial review, of a lack of care, but it is to be doubted. [My emphasis]

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>258 Observations made in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 ( Eshetu ) and S20 are, in my view, relevant to both grounds.

259 In Eshetu , at [40], Gleeson CJ and McHugh J stated:
 
 Someone who disagrees strongly with someone else's process of reasoning on an issue of fact may express such disagreement by describing the reasoning as "illogical" or "unreasonable", or even "so unreasonable that no reasonable person could adopt it". If these are merely emphatic ways of saying that the reasoning is wrong, then they may have no particular legal consequence.

260 In S20 , after referring to Eshetu , Gleeson CJ stated (at [5]) that if it is suggested that there is a legal consequence of illogical, unreasonable or irrational reasoning:
 
 [I]t may be necessary to be more precise as to the nature and quality of the error attributed to the decision-maker, and to identify the legal principle or statutory provision that attracts the suggested consequence.

389 I addressed the question of the duty imposed on ACCC by para (b) of s 152DB(1) in the Earlier Reasons at [164]-[166] where I said:
 I regard s 152DB(1) as a general exhortatory provision: it exhorts ACCC to strive to achieve broad objectives.

<text>385 Telstra contends that s 152DB(1)(b) had the effect, in the circumstances of the present case, of requiring ACCC to inquire into and investigate a particular matter. Telstra submits that this statutory duty may be no less than the duty developed at common law in connection with Wednesbury unreasonableness, and refers to Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170 per Wilcox J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] - [79] ; Visa International v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at [623] - [627] . That common law rule is that a failure by a decision maker to obtain "centrally relevant" information on a critical issue which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have proceeded to make the decision without making an inquiry with a view to obtaining the information, in default of which the decision will be an invalid exercise of power.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; [2004] HCA 32</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/32.html</AustLII>
<text>393 Telstra submits that the language of s 152DB(1)(b) imposes an obligation on ACCC to investigate, and is not merely facultative (cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SGLB (2004) 207 ALR 12 ; [2004] HCA 32 at [43] ). In my view, while s 152DB(1)(b) does not expressly impose an obligation to inquire and investigate, it assumes the existence of a "need to carefully and quickly inquire into and investigate the dispute and all matters affecting the merits, and fair settlement, of the dispute". That need is a matter that ACCC is required to take into account when it attempts to discharge the express obligation to act speedily.

394 I therefore accept that s 152DB(1)(b) implicitly requires ACCC, if it is not otherwise so required , "to carefully and quickly inquire into and investigate the dispute and all matters affecting the merits, and fair settlement, of the dispute".

395 Whatever the precise scope of that obligation, I do not think that ACCC was obliged to make any further inquiry in the present case because I am not persuaded that there was anything in Mr Hicks's statement that was "centrally relevant" information on a critical issue that ACCC was required to address. "Proper consideration" of the dispute and careful inquiry into and investigation of the dispute, even without reference to the calls for speed and quickness, did not demand further inquiry and investigation.

396 Even if I did consider that Mr Hicks's statement contained something of the kind described, I doubt that any duty of ACCC to inquire into and investigate it would have been imposed by s 152DB(1)(b), as distinct from by the general law. This is because of the inescapable conflict between "carefully" and "quickly". The general law may have imposed an obligation to inquire and investigate "carefully" but it would not, in the absence of special circumstances in a particular case, impose an obligation to investigate and inquire "quickly".

397 I respectfully suggest that exhortatory provisions of the present kind would be better placed and identified by the drafter as a statement of objectives rather than as substantive legislative provisions.

<text>163 It is trite that such expressions as "relating to", "in relation to" and "in respect of" are very wide and that their meaning will be determined by context: cf Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487 at 491; HP Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 126 ; (2005) 143 FCR 553 at [35] ; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Narain [2008] FCAFC 120 ; (2008) 169 FCR 211 at [68] , [69]. The relationship which the expressions invoke is not a merely accidental or remote relationship (see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [87] ) and must be a relevant relationship. The sufficiency of a particular relationship, association or connection is a matter for judgment, and depends on, inter alia, the subject matter, the legislative history and the facts in the particular case.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 ; [2003] HCA 30</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/30.html</AustLII>
<text>250 The non-Optus access seekers distinguish the valuation of land cases relied on by Telstra as turning on the terms of particular statutes. They note that Telstra purports to concede (as it must) that illogicality or unreasonableness do not necessarily constitute reviewable error unless there is a legal principle or statutory provision that attracts that consequence: they cite Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Applicant S20 / 2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 ; [2003] HCA 30 ( S20 ) at 61 per Gleeson CJ. Whether relying on Wednesbury unreasonableness or "illogicality, unreasonableness and perversity", as in S20 , one must identify a particular statutory provision or other legal principle that has been infringed. The non-Optus access seekers submit that Wednesbury unreasonableness is directed at outcomes, whereas S20 illogicality is directed at processes of reasoning: see S20 [2003] HCA 30 ; 198 ALR 59 at 76 per McHugh, Gummow JJ, 88 per Kirby J.

258 Observations made in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 ( Eshetu ) and S20 are, in my view, relevant to both grounds.

260 In S20 , after referring to Eshetu , Gleeson CJ stated (at [5]) that if it is suggested that there is a legal consequence of illogical, unreasonable or irrational reasoning:
 
 [I]t may be necessary to be more precise as to the nature and quality of the error attributed to the decision-maker, and to identify the legal principle or statutory provision that attracts the suggested consequence.</text>

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) (2008) 251 ALR 372 ; [2008] FCA 1640</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1640.html</AustLII>
<text>7 I have previously heard and determined three proceedings in which Telstra challenged FDs made by ACCC in relation to access disputes under Div 8: see Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1436 ; (2008) 171 FCR 174 (Earlier Reasons) and Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Others (No 2) (2008) 251 ALR 372; [2008] FCA 1640.

121 I considered the issue of severance of a backdating provision of an FD in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) (2008) 251 ALR 372 ; [2008] FCA 1640 at [4] ff, and concluded (at [48]) that the provisions of the FDs relating to the backdated monthly access charges in those proceedings could be severed, with the result that those FDs remained effective in so far as they resolved all other aspects of the access disputes. The issue of the backdated monthly access charges was remitted to ACCC.

122 If I am wrong in concluding that ACCC did not fail to take into account the ULLS Model Terms, I would conclude that the charges in relation to the year represented in the column headed 2005-06 in Schedule 1 to the Optus ULLS FD (see [91] above) are severable, and adopt what I said in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) above, mutatis mutandis , in relation to the severance issue.
 Conclusion

123 For the above reasons the ULLS Model Terms ground is not made out.
 C CALL DIVERSION 
 Introduction and Annexure

124 This ground is relied on in three ULLS proceedings. It is Ground 4 in each of the Optus and Chime ULLS proceedings and Ground 1 in the Primus ULLS (Connections) proceeding. It is the only ground relied on in that proceeding.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/7.html</AustLII>
<text>156 ACCC also submits that it is irrelevant, if it be the fact, that call diversion itself could have been declared a "declared service". ACCC points to the breadth of the chapeau to s 152CP(2) and to the examples found in paras (d) and (e) of that subsection. ACCC calls in aid of its construction of s 152CP the special nature of Div 8 arbitrations as exercises that are to take place in the public interest, not just the private interests of Telstra and the access seeker (ACCC refers to Telstra Corporation Ltd v Commonwealth [2008] HCA 7 ; (2008) 234 CLR 210 at [32] ff).
 Consideration

157 I have concluded that s 152CP(2) authorised ACCC to include the provision for the charge to be paid "in respect of call diversion as part of a ULLS connection" in the Optus, Chime and Primus ULLS (Connections) FDs.

158 First, however, I will briefly refer to s 152CP(1).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/977.html</AustLII>
<text>385 Telstra contends that s 152DB(1)(b) had the effect, in the circumstances of the present case, of requiring ACCC to inquire into and investigate a particular matter. Telstra submits that this statutory duty may be no less than the duty developed at common law in connection with Wednesbury unreasonableness, and refers to Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170 per Wilcox J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 ; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le [2007] FCA 1318 ; (2007) 164 FCR 151 at [60] - [79] ; Visa International v Reserve Bank of Australia [2003] FCA 977 ; (2003) 131 FCR 300 at [623] - [627] . That common law rule is that a failure by a decision maker to obtain "centrally relevant" information on a critical issue which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available, may be so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would have proceeded to make the decision without making an inquiry with a view to obtaining the information, in default of which the decision will be an invalid exercise of power.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/5.html</AustLII>
<text>243 Optus submits that while an error of principle in arriving at a value may amount to an error of law, the cases in which that has been held to be so have concerned statutory valuation exercises, and in any event the approach should be treated with caution: Optus cites Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5 ; (2008) 233 CLR 259 ( Walker Corporation ) at 269-272. Optus submits that in any event Telstra has failed to identify the "principle" which it says ACCC ignored or misapplied. Optus distinguishes the particular substantive principles considered in Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads [1979] AC 426 and the related authorities cited by Telstra (see [219] above). In Walker Corporation the High Court (at 270) cautioned against importing into one case general "principles" derived from other cases that arose in different statutory contexts. Optus submits that Telstra has not identified in Pt XIC of the Act or in the common law a source of any "principles" that control the arbitral powers conferred on ACCC by Div 8 of that Part.</text>

<text>481 The 2007 LSS Pricing Principles did not expressly revoke the 2002 LSS Pricing Principles. It is well established, however, that the making of a later statutory instrument that is inconsistent with an earlier one revokes the earlier one to the extent of the inconsistency: see, for example Ward v Repatriation Commission (1997) 46 ALD 454 at 461 and the authorities there referred to, as well as Caloundra City Council v Netstar Pty Ltd [2008] 1 Qd R 258 at [8]-[14].</text>
