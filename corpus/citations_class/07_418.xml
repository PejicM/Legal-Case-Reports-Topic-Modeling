<text>2 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to quash the RRT's decision on the basis that it was tainted with jurisdictional error: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476. On 30 June 2006 that application was dismissed. This is an appeal from that decision.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The appellant appeared in person before the Federal Magistrate and on this appeal. Clearly, he was at some disadvantage in identifying precisely the jurisdictional error which he claimed the RRT had committed. His contentions lapsed at times into an attempt to re-argue the merits of the case, even though neither the Federal Magistrates Court nor this Court on appeal can inquire into the merits of the case. The Court's jurisdiction is limited to determining whether jurisdictional error is established. Review of the factual merits of the decision of the RRT in order that the Court substitute its view of the facts is not within the jurisdiction of either Court: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.</text>

<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte HB [2001] HCA 34 ; (2001) 179 ALR 513</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/34.html</AustLII>
<text>4 In the appellant's submissions to this Court, I discerned two threads of asserted jurisdictional error which, if established, might lead to the appeal being allowed and the RRT decision being set aside so that the protection visa application should be reheard by the RRT differently constituted. Those grounds were:
 
 1. that the RRT had not approached its review with a mind open to persuasion, or at least that it approached its task in a way which gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on its part;
 2. that the RRT, although it recited the applicable law correctly, somehow then misapplied the law so that it did not in fact address the question which it was required to address. 

Either of those matters, if made out, may constitute jurisdictional error: see e.g. per Kirby J in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte HB [2001] HCA 34 ; (2001) 179 ALR 513; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128. The first of those matters remains available as a ground of jurisdictional error, notwithstanding s 422B of the Act: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lat [2006] FCAFC 61 ; (2006) 151 FCR 214.</text>

<tocase>Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/28.html</AustLII>
<text>38 The test for apprehended bias in relation to a body such as the RRT is whether a hypothetical fair-minded lay person who is properly informed as to the nature of the proceedings, the matters in issue and the conduct which is said to give rise to an apprehension of bias might reasonably apprehend that the RRT might not bring, or might not have brought, an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided: see per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425 at 434-435, at [27]-[28] and the cases cited at fn 7.

39 There is nothing to suggest the RRT conducted the hearing in a way which might indicate a closed mind on its part. The only evidence as to how it conducted its hearing is from its own recital of those events. They disclose only a firm testing of the claims made by the appellant, in some instances by confronting him with inconsistencies in documentary materials and in the statements of himself and others.</text>

<tocase>SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749</tocase>
<text>40 It will be rare that an allegation of ostensible bias will be made out on an analysis of evidentiary materials before the RRT and its assessment of them, where otherwise no legal error is disclosed in its reasoning: see SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749 at 756, at [44] and the cases cited there.

41 I do not consider that the RRT's reasons demonstrate that it may have approached its task with a closed mind. It has carefully analysed the evidentiary material. Where there is apparently genuine documentary material, it has accepted that material. The difficulty confronting the appellant was that that material did not accord in significant respects with his evidence, or with his and others' evidence, so as to present a consistent and cogent detailed version of events. It is only by taking the appellant's evidence at a high level of generality that the inconsistencies pointed out by the RRT would be of no significance. The RRT, when concerned about the credibility of a claimant, does not demonstrate ostensible bias by a firm and sometimes vigorous testing of the evidence. It was entitled to compare the detail of the evidence to assess whether it is consistent both with the appellant's own claims and internally. It was entitled to look carefully at the appellant's own claims and the material which related to them to assess whether that material was itself consistent. If there were discrepancies in that material, even of detail, it was entitled to explore those discrepancies to see if there were satisfactory responses to them and to assess their cumulative significance.

42 Of course, the existence of discrepancies in detail is not necessarily of great moment. Experience shows that records are not necessarily always complete; the person making the record may not fully record information or may record information inaccurately. Human memory is not perfect. In stressful circumstances such as those the appellant asserts, and especially with the passage of time, perfect consistency of detail is not to be routinely expected. The RRT would be aware of such matters, and sympathetic to them.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59</tocase>
<text>44 I have not overlooked the extent to which the appellant's claims were supported by independent witness statements. The RRT has not overlooked them. It has rejected them, including the evidence of Sadaunichy who now resides in Australia. It is not sufficient for the appellant to demonstrate legal error to assert that others may have given more weight to that evidence. Nor is it an error of law to have rejected Sadaunichy's evidence corroborating parts of the appellant's claim, in effect because it rejected the appellant's evidence: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 at [11]-[19] per Gleeson CJ, [46]-[52] per McHugh and Gummow JJ, [173] per Callinan J. Even though the corroborative statements were quite extensive, the RRT's approach to them does not demonstrate in my view ostensible bias on its part.

45 The general description of the RRT having misapplied the law can be addressed in particular respects, and by way of a general overview.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304</tocase>
<text>46 The appellant complained that the RRT did not take evidence from Baluyeva, Antoshin and Grechko orally by telephone, despite the request that it should do so. The nature of the RRT's obligation under s 426(3) of the Act is discussed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304, a case concerning the analogous obligation on the Migration Review Tribunal under s 361(3) of the Act. It is obliged to give genuine consideration to such a request. In doing so, it must have regard to matters such as the relevance and potential importance of the proposed evidence, the sufficiency of any written evidence already provided, and other matters: see the discussion in W360/01A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 211 ; (2002) 124 FCR 449 at [2] , [30]-[32].</text>

<tocase>NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/263.html</AustLII>
<text>53 The appellant also contended that the RRT had failed to consider the claim that he had a well-founded fear of being persecuted if he returned to Belarus by reason of his membership of a particular social group, namely the social group comprising those who participated in trade union demonstrations. I do not accept that contention, simply because I do not consider that it was raised before the RRT. The appellant's claim to a protection visa was based upon feared persecution for his political beliefs and activities, and not for his membership of a particular social group; see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1.

54 Finally, as the appellant invited the Court to do, I step back to see if some jurisdictional error must have been committed by the RRT even if it is not readily discernible. His claim was based upon events which the RRT accepted: the existence of an opposition active trade union movement involved in anti-government demonstrations including on particular dates, and evidence of persecutory behaviour at least towards those promoting those protests, including in the BNF. His claim of having suffered injuries on or about the times of two significant protests was accepted, namely a fractured finger and a kidney injury. His claim was apparently verified by several witnesses. Despite all that material, his claim failed because the RRT thought he was fabricating his claimed role as an activist, and consequently it rejected the confirmatory and apparently independent corroborative evidence, as well as corroborative evidence from his wife and son. It did so by a close analysis of the oral evidence and documentary material, indicating some discrepancies between his evidence and that of his witnesses or of the other material. Some of those discrepancies might be seen to be minor: for example, the assumption that a hospital medical certificate issued some six months after treatment would necessarily replicate fully the details of the examination, and not simply the principal injury, may not be made by all fact-finders. The analysis of the discrepancies by the RRT has not, however, persuaded me that it may not have approached its task with an open mind. And there are other discrepancies, such as the appellant's explanations about his movements between Belarus, Moscow and Poland about the time he last left Belarus, which do not lend themselves to such ready explanation.

55 Notwithstanding the apparently cogent material in support of the appellant's claim, I do not think that the RRT has been shown to have somehow reached its decision by some latent error of law. It is not the role of the Court to form a view as to whether it would have reached a different factual conclusion on the evidentiary material.</text>
