<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The Appellants' complaint is properly characterised as dissatisfaction with the findings made by the Tribunal. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the " particulars " provided, which asserted in part:
 (4) [The Tribunal failed] to accept the fact that the Applicant tried to relocate to another part of India but failed to lead a life without the fear of persecution. (5) ... the Tribunal failed to accept the fact that the Applicant would face serious harm if he returns back to India even after he was ordered to leave the country by the above criminal elements. 
The task of accepting or rejecting evidence, and weighing such evidence that is available, is a task entrusted by the legislature to the Tribunal alone -- it is not a task that can be undertaken by either the Federal Magistrates Court or this Court on appeal: cf Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J.

14 Nor is there any substance in the contention that the Tribunal erred by not offering another date for hearing. Before the Federal Magistrates Court, and before this Court, there was a copy of the transcript of the Tribunal hearing. At the outset of that hearing the Tribunal member said:
 "Thank you. I have lost my voice. We will begin by having the interpreter promise not to divulge any information he hears during the hearing. Thank you." 
Two questions thereafter, the Member again stated:
 "I have lost my voice unclear interpret You wife hasn't attended today" 
The hearing started at 1:46pm and concluded at 2:11pm. Nothing in the transcript reveals anything further being said in respect of the Tribunal member being unwell. Furthermore, nothing in the transcript gives any support to a submission found in the " particulars " that the Tribunal proceeded " in haste ", had any " pre-conceived notion ", or had not given " the Applicant the opportunity to reply to the Tribunal ". Rather than proceeding " in haste " and not extending such an " opportunity to reply ", the transcript records the following exchange at the conclusion of the hearing:
 [SZJXP]: I don't want to go back. [Tribunal member]: I understand that. I will have to think about what you have said. Ok. Anything else you want to say? [SZJXP]: I am just asking my life back. 
Rather than being dismissed " in haste " and not giving the First Appellant an " opportunity to reply ", the Tribunal member quite properly invited him to add to the matters which had been covered if he so wished.</text>

20 Albeit not raised by any of the Grounds of Appeal , Counsel for the Respondent Minister quite properly did not oppose exploring the question as to whether there had been a breach of s 425 by reason of the Appellant not having the opportunity to place further documents or further information before the Tribunal. However, it was contended by the Minister that, in the absence of any basis upon which it could be concluded that the Tribunal was on notice that potentially there may have been further information or documents relevant to its consideration (but not then available to the now First Appellant at that hearing), it is difficult to conclude that the obligation in s 425 to afford an opportunity has been breached. The Tribunal in discharging its function is engaged in an " inquisitorial process " -- but there must nevertheless remains a reason or a basis upon which it can be said that it should inquire beyond that factual material placed before it. In SZJBA Allsop J thus observed:
 [53] ... the obligation of the Tribunal to give a real and meaningful invitation to comment carried with it the obligation to take reasonably open and regular administrative procedural steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the real and meaningful nature of the invitation, where not to take such steps would undermine or subvert the meaningfulness or the reality of the invitation. That obligation involves such mundane things as opening letters, reading them once opened and taking at least basic simple steps that would be taken in any well-run commercial, professional or governmental office, conformable with the recognition of the importance of the response to the invitation to the rights of the applicant and the review process contained within Pt 7 of the Migration Act . This does not rest on some posited duty of inquiry. It is not engaging in steps that require for their enforcement some express statutory power. ... ... [57] These conclusions can be fortified by the recognition, so often stated, that the Tribunal is engaged in an inquisitorial process ... [58] This inquisitorial function has become relevant in a number of contexts. In Applicant S 217 CLR 387 at [76] McHugh J said: If the Tribunal had considered the issue that it was legally required to consider, it was open to the Tribunal to investigate whether such a perception existed, whether within the Afghan society or some section of it, or objectively. Indeed, arguably in the context of its inquisitorial process, the Tribunal had a duty to seek evidence concerning this vital matter. 
Where there is material which on its face suggests that the Tribunal is not in receipt of all materials, the Tribunal should normally " take simple administrative steps to address the issue ": SZHVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 600 at [63] per Middleton J.</text>

<text>4 The Federal Magistrates Court on 12 September 2007 dismissed an application to review the decision of the Tribunal: SZJXP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1603. The Appellants now appeal to this Court.

5 A Notice of Appeal was filed on 24 September 2007 and an Amended Notice of Appeal was filed on 1 May 2008. It is understood that the Grounds of Appeal upon which the Appellants wish to proceed may be summarised as being:
 
(i) jurisdictional error; 
 
(ii) bias on the part of the Tribunal; and 
 
(iii) a failure to comply with s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 
None of these grounds has been made out and the appeal is dismissed.

6 The Appellants appeared before this Court unrepresented, although they had the assistance of an interpreter.</text>
