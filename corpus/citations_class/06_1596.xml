<tocase>Carr v J A Berriman Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 31 ; (1953) 89 CLR 327 </tocase>

<text>18 It is common ground that Bective Station did not make full payment under its first contract to purchase wheat from AWBA until a date which the evidence does not fix precisely but which was shortly after 19 August 2003. It was on 19 August 2003 that AWB Limited (presumably acting on behalf of AWBA) issued a statement of liquidated claim against Bective Station in the District Court of New South Wales. Clause 12 of the Standard Terms authorised AWBA to withhold delivery under the Second Contract until all overdue payments were made under the first contract. AWBA was thus entitled to withhold delivery throughout March 2003 and, indeed, until at least late August 2003. Bective Station did not thereafter request delivery of wheat or purport to terminate the Second Contract for breach because of AWBA's failure to deliver wheat under the Second Contract. Clause 15 of the Standard Terms, which provided that stipulations as to time were of the essence, did not operate to bring the contract to an end; assuming clause 15 to have not earlier ceased to operate because of Bective Station's overdue payments, it authorised an innocent party to elect to terminate the contract ( Carr v J A Berriman Pty Ltd [1953] HCA 31 ; (1953) 89 CLR 327 per Fullagar J at 348).

19 The contentions of Bective Station that the Second Contract was terminated in March 2003 by reason of non-delivery of the wheat as required by the Second Contract, or alternatively on or before 31 August 2003 by effluxion of time, therefore fail.

20 Bective Station's further alternative contention that the Second Contract was terminated on 20 October 2003, or five days thereafter, is founded on AWB Limited's letter dated 20 October 2003. Omitting formal matters that letter was in the following terms: 
 
 'The purpose of this correspondence is to formerly [sic] notify Bective Station Pty Ltd of their default in relation to taking delivery of AWB sales contract 2301055 (AWB reference) dated 6 th November 2002. The expiration date of the contract was 30 th August 2003. 
 
 Under the terms and conditions of the contract AWB has the right, at AWB's discretion, to resell the quantity of grain in default at fair market value. Bective Station Pty Ltd, as the party in default, is liable for the loss incurred by AWB as a result of reselling the grain at a reduced price. 
 
 If AWB does not receive direction from Bective Station Pty Ltd within 5 business days of receiving this letter, AWB in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract will washout Bective Station. AWB have obtained third party independent advice quoting fair market value for wheat delivered into a buyers nominated store in the Liverpool Plains region. Should you accept a washout AWB will apply market value as at the end of the contract the price being $215/MT, if not AWB will apply spot market price to determine fair value, indication as at 20/08/03 of $200/MT. 
 
 A washout cost per metric tonne is based off the contract (2301055) price for August of $395.50 less fair market value, the net cost of the washout is on 7000MT and is due 30 days end of week. AWB will issue a tax invoice within 5 business days. For your information the cost of a washout basis the October price is $1,368,500. 
 
 Should you wish to formerly [sic] accept washout of the contract as at the end of August please contact me directly on [telephone number given] .'</text>

<tocase>Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886 ; (2000) 106 FCR 51 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1886.html</AustLII>
<text>80 The nature of tendency evidence was considered in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd [2000] FCA 1886 ; (2000) 106 FCR 51 by Sackville J, with whom Whitlam and Mansfield JJ agreed. In that case the appellant alleged that the respondent's agent had made misrepresentations which induced the appellant to lease certain premises in a shopping centre. The appellant sought to adduce evidence that the agent had made similar representations to other prospective tenants of the shopping centre. Sackville J accepted that the admissibility of the evidence sought to be adduced was to be determined by reference to s 97 as evidence that the agent had a tendency to act in a particular way.

81 In my view the affidavit evidence of Messrs Rowland, Setter and Gillogly referred to above is not relevantly distinguishable from the kind of evidence sought to be adduced in Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd . It is therefore to be regarded as tendency evidence falling within s 97. I note incidentally that in each case the evidence may, in any event, have been admissible in reply because of the evidence of Mr Adams that, in effect, he would never have said anything to the effect that 'there will be no wheat in Australia from March 2003 until the harvest begins in October '. The application on which I was invited to rule, however, was an application to adduce the evidence pursuant to s 97(1).

82 For the evidence of Messrs Rowland, Setter and Gillogly to be admissible under s 97(1) it was necessary for the requirements of both paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection to be satisfied. As mentioned above, Bective Station had given the notice required by paragraph (a).

83 In determining that their evidence had significant probative value I took into account that:
 
 (a) each of them gave evidence of a conversation with Mr Adams which took place within a few days of the conversation between Mr Vickery and Mr Adams;
 (b) each of them gave evidence of Mr Adams using language similar to the language which Mr Vickery claimed that Mr Adams had used in conversation with him;
 (c) each of them gave evidence of Mr Adams saying words to the effect that the supply of wheat could or would run out; and
 (d) Mr Adams' affidavit evidence was that he definitely did not say words to the effect that 'there will be no wheat in Australia from March 2003 until the harvest begins in October' as such a statement was, in his opinion, ridiculous because he could not conceive of any circumstances where the supply of wheat in Australia would ever run out.</text>

<tocase>Port Jackson Stevedoring Proprietary Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Proprietary Limited [1978] HCA 8 ; (1978) 139 CLR 231 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/8.html</AustLII>
<text>35 A claim for damages for breach of contract must ordinarily be brought within six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued ( Limitation of Actions Act 1958 (Vic) s 5 ; Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) s 14). However, the parties to the contract may agree a shorter limitation period ( Port Jackson Stevedoring Proprietary Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Proprietary Limited [1978] HCA 8 ; (1978) 139 CLR 231 per Barwick CJ at 239-9).

36 The parties are in agreement that the time within which AWBA was obliged to institute a proceeding to recover damages from Bective Station for breach of the Second Contract is governed by the Second Contract, and in particular by the Standard Terms. However, there is a dispute between the parties as to the proper construction of the Standard Terms in this regard.

37 Bective Station placed reliance on clause 9 of the Standard Terms and argued that as the cross-claim was not filed within 12 months of the termination of the Second Contract it is time barred. The cross-claim was filed on 24 March 2005.</text>

<text>32 As Mason CJ, with whom Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ agreed, observed in Sunbird Plaza Pty Ltd v Maloney [1988] HCA 11 ; (1988) 166 CLR 245 at 260-261:
 
 'Loss of bargain damages are recoverable only if the contract is at an end. Once termination due to the defendant's wrongful conduct is established the plaintiff is entitled to damages for loss of bargain ... Barwick C.J. suggested in Ogle [ Ogle v Comboyuro Investments Pty Ltd [1976] HCA 21 ; (1976) 136 CLR 444 at 450], that termination is not an essential element in an action for loss of bargain damages, except in the case of anticipatory breach, but the preponderant opinion in Australia and England is against his view' .
