<tocase>Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 513</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/513.html</AustLII>
<text>7 In proceeding V 74 of 1999, Mr Spalla contested the appointment of Messrs Beck and Home as receivers and managers of the property of Irlmond and APS. Finkelstein J held that their appointment was lawful: see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 513 (" Spalla (No 1) "). In his reasons, his Honour addressed the question of whether Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed. Mr Spalla contended that the companies were not insolvent at that time. His Honour held, however, that "the fact that the companies were insolvent is an inescapable conclusion from the evidence": see Spalla (No 1) at [140].

8 Mr Spalla appealed against the decision of Finkelstein J to the Full Court. The Full Court, which was constituted by Heerey, Sundberg and Weinberg JJ, upheld his Honour's decision: see Spalla v St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1566 (" Spalla (No 2) "). The Full Court held, amongst other things, that the primary judge was correct to find that Irlmond and APS were insolvent at the time receivers were appointed: see Spalla (No 2) at [61]-[70].

9 In proceeding V 7877 of 1999, St George Wholesale Finance unsuccessfully petitioned for a sequestration order against Mr Spalla based on an alleged failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice. The notice claimed that Mr Spalla owed a debt pursuant to the judgment obtained in proceeding V 74 of 1999 before Finkelstein J. Mr Spalla contested the sum specified. In St George Wholesale Finance Pty Ltd v Spalla [2000] FCA 1094 at [40] - [41] , Heerey J concluded that "St George is not sure itself what is really owing under the judgment" and that "this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the procedures provided by the Act".

27 The primary proceeding began on 17 October 2002, when Still &amp; Co filed the original application and statement of claim on behalf of the then applicants. Those applicants were Mr Spalla and his wife, Stella, Mr Still, and Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd ("Anstella") as the holder of all shares in Irlmond and APS. Irlmond was not one of the original parties to the primary proceeding. The original respondents included St George Motor Finance, St George Wholesale Finance, Messrs Beck and Home, and Deloittes. By their original statement of claim, the applicants alleged that the respondents had given false evidence in the proceeding before Finkelstein J and raised various claims relating to the receivership of Irlmond and APS. The applicants also claimed that the respondents had conspired wrongly to subject Mr Spalla and Mr Still to criminal conspiracy charges.

28 Prior to May 2003, Mr Rambaldi retained the firm of Darrer Muir Fleiter to advise him with respect to the primary proceeding and, in particular, as to Irlmond's prospects if it were to join in the proceeding. On 22 November 2002, Mr Rambaldi sought quotations for insurance litigation funding. In a facsimile dated 3 February 2003, Mr Rambaldi's solicitors subsequently wrote to Mr Spalla's solicitors stating that, as liquidator of Irlmond, Mr Rambaldi was not in a position to join in the primary proceeding, or institute his own proceeding, until he had entered into an acceptable funding arrangement, although Mr Rambaldi had "his own legal advice that various claims against the Respondents, or a combination of them are likely to be successful".

29 Throughout February and March 2003, Mr Rambaldi, assisted by Mr Vasudevan negotiated with IMF (Australia) Ltd ("IMF"), represented by Mr Clive Bowman, to secure litigation funding and, in particular, concerning the terms of a litigation funding agreement, which Mr Rambaldi required before agreeing to Irlmond becoming an applicant in the primary proceeding. The contemporaneous correspondence shows that control of the litigation was an important issue. By a letter dated 6 March 2003, IMF specifically noted that it wanted to avoid "Spalla attempting to block, or interfere with, a settlement which Irlmond wishes to pursue". It reiterated this concern in an email of 29 April 2003. Ultimately, a funding agreement was reached with Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd ("ILF"), a wholly owned subsidiary of IMF. Before concluding the funding agreement, Mr Spalla retained the services of Mr Borden to act on his behalf in place of Still &amp; Co.

32 At the hearing of the motion on 8 May 2003, Finkelstein J allowed Mr Iain Jones, as counsel for two of the St George parties in their capacity as creditors of Irlmond, to appear and make submissions. Mr Jones argued that the agreement, as then drafted, improperly limited the liquidator's discretion to settle claims on behalf of Irlmond. Mr Jones noted that clauses 13 and 14 of the proposed funding agreement allowed the Spalla Interests to object to the liquidator accepting a settlement offer made only to Irlmond and, in the event of such an objection, delegated to an arbitrator the decision whether to accept such an offer. Mr Jones claimed that this arrangement was an unlawful restraint on the liquidator's discretion. His Honour said that it appeared that Mr Jones was correct on this point. Mr Jones also argued that the proposed funding agreement which allowed ILF to withdraw at any time on seven days' notice but still take part in a distribution of any recovery gave ILF a potential windfall if it withdrew shortly after executing the agreement.

33 After the hearing of 8 May 2006, the parties to the proposed funding agreement negotiated further, in order to amend it so as to meet the concerns expressed by Finkelstein J. In particular, as part of these further negotiations, the parties considered the issue of control over any settlement offer to Irlmond and the issue of ILF getting a 'windfall' if it withdrew its indemnity shortly after executing the agreement. They prepared a new draft funding agreement. On 12 May 2003, Mr Rambaldi filed this new draft in the Court, together with counsel's supplementary submission in support of the new agreement.

34 This supplementary submission stated that the amendments to the proposed funding agreement "address the criticisms made by Mr Jones". It continued:
 "The effect of the amendments is to: 
 
 
 (a) remove any restriction on the power of the liquidator to accept a settlement offer made to the company. No limitations are imposed upon the liquidator at all in this regard; 
 (b) in the event that ILF terminates its indemnity pursuant to clause 6.2, to restrict the entitlement of ILF to the "Recovery" to simply a reimbursement of monies it has paid pursuant to clause 6.2."

35 The new agreement deleted the former clauses 13 and 14 from the earlier draft. Clause 9, relating to control of the proceedings, was unchanged except "clause 14" was substituted for the words "clause 13" in clause 9.3. A new clause 13 dealt with "Recoveries". A new clause 14 relevantly read: 

 "14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE 
 
 
 14.1 If at any time, a dispute or difference arises in connection with this Agreement and that dispute or difference has not been able to be resolved by negotiations between the parties then a party may provide the other parties with a written notice addressed to the other parties outlining the dispute or difference, and if capable of remedy, requiring remedy on the expiry of 3 Business Days from receipt of the written notice. 
 
 
 
 
 
 14.2 If the dispute or difference communicated to the other parties by written notice is not remedied or is not capable of remedy, then the parties agree to submit to mediation prior to the institution of Court proceedings utilising the following procedure:- 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The parties shall jointly appoint a mediator. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator within 2 Business Days of receipt of the written notice by the other parties, the parties agree that any one or more of the parties may request the President for the time being of the Law Institute of Victoria to nominate a mediator. 
 
 (b) The costs and expenses plus any GST payable to the mediator and the costs and expenses of the mediation shall be paid by Anstella. 
 
 (c) If a settlement is reached at the mediation, written terms of settlement shall be entered into immediately upon conclusion of the mediation and shall, unless Court approval of the terms of settlement is required, override the terms and conditions of this Agreement. ..."</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/466.html</AustLII>
<text>36 On 14 May 2003, Finkelstein J delivered reasons for judgment giving approval to Mr Rambaldi as liquidator of Irlmond to enter into the funding agreement in the form attached to his counsel's supplementary submission of 12 May 2003: see Anstella Nominees Pty Ltd v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2003] FCA 466 (" Anstella "). His Honour wrote (at [5]-[8]):
 "The initial version of the draft agreement required the liquidator to surrender his power to control the destiny of the action in the event of disagreement between the liquidator and the other applicants concerning the settlement or discontinuance of the action. The draft agreement provided that the liquidator could not instruct his solicitors to settle or discontinue the proceeding without obtaining the consent of the other applicants. If there was a dispute, the matter had to go to arbitration. ... 
 It seemed to me ... that the proposal gave rise to a ... difficulty, namely whether there are any circumstances under which a liquidator can lawfully give up his statutory powers or duties. There is a view that, while a liquidator may listen to the opinion of others on what steps he should take in a particular situation, in the end he must exercise his own judgment on what is or is not in the best interests of the creditors or contributories. For this reason he cannot give up control of litigation in which his company is a party. This is the view taken by Lightman J in Grovewood Holdings Plc v James Capel &amp; Co Ltd [1995] Ch 80. ... 
 Recognising the potential difficulty he was in, the liquidator sought time to see whether Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd ("ILF") (the company providing the funding) could be persuaded to change the terms. This is in fact what occurred. The liquidator was able to negotiate the removal of the restriction on his ability to settle or discontinue the proceeding if Irlmond became a party to the action."

37 On 15 May 2003, the litigation funding agreement (hereafter referred to as "the LFA") was executed by Mr and Mrs Spalla, Mr Still, Anstella, Mr Rambaldi, Irlmond, and ILF. Other significant provisions of the LFA include:
 &#8226; Clause 4(a)(iv) provided that the "Spalla Interests shall pay and shall at all times remain liable to pay all Legal Costs charged by the Solicitors, Senior Counsel and Junior Counsel in respect to ... Irlmond and the Liquidator's participation in and conduct of the Proceeding." Clause 4.2 required the Spalla Interests to provide the liquidator with a letter confirming that the Spalla Interests have sufficient funds to settle these costs. 
 &#8226; Pursuant to Clause 5.1, the Spalla Interests agreed to indemnify Irlmond and the liquidator in respect of legal costs claimed by their joint representatives in the proceeding.
 &#8226; Clause 6.1 provided that ILF would indemnify the liquidator for any costs for which he becomes personally liable in relation to his and Irlmond's participation in the primary proceeding. Pursuant to Clause 6.2, "[t]he indemnity provided by ILF to the Liquidator in respect of any Costs Order will not be a continuing indemnity, but may be terminated by ILF, in its absolute discretion by giving 7 days written notice to the Liquidator". This right of termination was subject to a proviso that ILF would remain liable for any personal costs orders against the liquidator up to the time of termination.
 &#8226; Clause 7 related to the appointment of solicitors and counsel and provided that solicitors and junior and senior counsel would be retained to act for the liquidator, Irlmond and the Spalla Interests. In accordance with clause 1.1, the solicitors were to be HWL "or such other firm of solicitors retained to act for the Liquidator and Irlmond from time to time" and senior counsel was to be Peter Hayes QC "or such other lead Counsel retained to act for the Liquidator and Irlmond from time to time".
 &#8226; Clause 15 contained certain warranties, including that the "Spalla Interests warrants [sic] that it [sic] has sufficient financial resources to carry out its [sic] obligations under this Agreement and shall continue to have such financial resources."

38 HWL and the Spalla Interests entered into a costs agreement with respect to the primary proceeding in May 2003. Mr Spalla's original retainer with HWL required Mr Spalla to pay $80,000 upfront with the balance to be at HWL's prevailing hourly rates, plus a 20% uplift fee to be paid on the successful outcome of the matter. Mr Spalla was to meet all HWL's disbursements and counsel fees. Mr Spalla reached a similar "no win, no fee" arrangement with Mr Hayes QC. Mr Spalla paid the initial amount of $80,000 to HWL and funded the litigation in accordance with these agreements. He did not, however, have sufficient funds to meet the costs of the litigation had all of the lawyers' costs been due at the time they were incurred.</text>

<tocase>Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1262</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1262.html</AustLII>
<text>45 On 28 September 2004, French J struck out the applicants' further amended statement of claim but gave liberty to file and serve, by 21 October 2004, a substituted application and statement of claim: see Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 5) [2004] FCA 1262 (" Spalla (No 5) "). His Honour also ordered that the applicants pay the respondents' costs of their respective motions. Amongst other things, his Honour held that many of the allegations in the further amended statement of claim involved allegations of fact that contradicted the factual findings made by Finkelstein J in proceeding V 74 of 1999. In these respects, the further amended statement of claim could not stand "against the res judicata estoppel and the issue estoppels generated by the judgment in the first proceedings": see Spalla (No 5) at [4]-[5] and [44].

46 The primary proceeding was originally fixed for trial beginning on 19 July 2004. As a result of the various strike-out motions, that date was vacated and the matter was re-listed for hearing in February 2005. On 13 October 2004, HWL advised Mr Spalla (by a letter, which was also copied to Mr Rambaldi) that they would terminate their retainer with Mr Spalla if the February 2005 hearing date were vacated for any reason. Amongst other things, the letter said, "[w]hilst we regret having to take this position, we simply cannot afford the ongoing burden of the case and the impact it is having on the firm overall".

47 Some days later, on 19 October 2004, HWL wrote to Mr Spalla that:
 "In line with our obligation to keep you apprised of the costs incurred thus far, we advise that as at 18 October 2004 the total time recorded on this matter is $620,519.50 of which $80,000.00 has been paid leaving an unpaid work in progress of $540,519.50. This does not include any uplifting fee which was outlined in our costs agreement." 

HWL copied this letter to Mr Rambaldi.

48 Also on 19 October 2004, Mr Beck sent Mr Bowman a facsimile on Deloittes' letterhead. In this facsimile, Mr Beck referred, amongst other things, to the order for costs that French J had made on 28 September 2004 against the applicants and in favour of the Deloitte parties. He stated that his solicitors had informed him that the Deloitte parties' costs were about $50,000 on a party and party basis and that the Deloitte parties sought these costs from ILF "in its capacity as a non-party". He also wrote that if "the matter proceeds and Irlmond is unsuccessful, we will look to ILF for its entire costs of the matter and we reserve all our rights to seek those costs from ILF, not only on a party and party basis but on an indemnity basis".

49 The next day, on 20 October 2004, Mr Beck sent a facsimile to Mr Rambaldi in similar terms to that sent to Mr Bowman. Mr Beck again referred to the order for costs that French J had made in favour of the Deloitte parties and to the Deloitte parties' solicitors' estimate of the amount of these costs. He wrote that the Deloitte parties sought these costs from Mr Rambaldi personally and added that, should the matter proceed and Irlmond fail, the Deloitte parties "will look to you personally for [their] entire costs of the matter ... not only on a party and party basis but on an indemnity basis".

50 Pursuant to French J's orders of 28 September 2004, a third further amended application and a third further amended statement of claim were filed in the primary proceeding on 19 October 2004. This statement of claim named Mr Spalla, Mr Still and Irlmond as the first, second and third applicants. No other applicants were named. The first to fifth and seventh and eighth respondents were the same as those in the present proceeding. The sixth respondent was the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC").

51 By the third further amended statement of claim, Irlmond brought numerous claims against the St George parties and the Deloitte parties arising out of the receivership of Irlmond. Against the St George parties, Irlmond claimed breach of mortgagee's duties, conversion and contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Against the Deloitte parties, Irlmond claimed breach of receiver's duties and conversion and sought restitution of the receiver's fees. Irlmond claimed restitution of the sum of $1.3 million together with other payments against St George Motor Wholesale.

52 Also by the third further amended statement of claim, Mr Spalla and Mr Still brought claims against Messrs Beck and Home for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood. Mr Spalla and Mr Still also brought a claim for malicious prosecution against ASIC.</text>

<tocase>Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6 ) [2004] FCA 1699</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1699.html</AustLII>
<text>53 On 20 December 2004, French J ordered that most of the statement of claim in the primary proceeding be struck out: see Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6 ) [2004] FCA 1699 (" Spalla (No 6) "). In essence, his Honour held that most of the statement of claim was an abuse of process because it sought to relitigate issues that had been determined by Finkelstein J in proceeding V 74 of 1999: see Spalla (No 6) at [2]-[3], [71]-[108]. His Honour struck out all of Irlmond's claims for conversion and breach of duties against the St George and the Deloitte parties.

54 The only claim of Irlmond that was not struck out was the claim for $1.3 million against St George Motor Wholesale. That claim related to the application of proceeds of the sale of Essendon Mitsubishi which was a discrete event that post-dated the judgment of Finkelstein J. For this reason, his Honour concluded (at [91]-[92]) that the claim should not be struck out as an attempt to relitigate a matter already determined by Finkelstein J. At [92], however, his Honour expressed doubt as to whether "the impugned payment of $1.3 million" would be shown "to be anything other than a continuation" of practices already approved by Finkelstein J. His Honour did not strike out Mr Spalla's and Mr Still's claims for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood: see Spalla (No 6) at [110]-[116].

55 On 24 December 2004, Messrs Beck and Home filed a notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from the interlocutory orders of French J allowing Mr Spalla and Mr Still liberty to continue their claims for malicious prosecution and injurious falsehood. This application was given proceeding number VID 54 of 2005. On 31 January 2005, Irlmond also sought leave to appeal from the orders of French J that were unfavourable to it. This application was given proceeding number VID 83 of 2005. These two proceedings (hereafter "the appeals") were to be heard together.

56 With the judgment of French J in December 2004 and the institution of the appeals in January 2005, the primary proceeding entered a new stage and, so far as ILF, Irlmond, Mr Rambaldi and HWL were concerned, led to their reappraisal of the litigation.

57 On 13 January 2005, prior to Irlmond filing its appeal, Mr Vasudevan, Mr Bowman and Mr Stephen Foale from ILF, and Mr Borden and Ms April Arslan met at the offices of Pitcher Partners, in order to discuss French J's judgment. Mr Rambaldi did not attend although, as copies of Mr Vasudevan's emails of 13 and 23 January 2005 attest, Mr Vasudevan kept him informed. In these emails, Mr Vasudevan reported to Mr Rambaldi that Mr Bowman was concerned about ILF's exposure to any personal costs liability incurred by Mr Rambaldi or its own liability for costs as a "third party" beneficiary of the action. Mr Vasudevan also reported to Mr Rambaldi that HWL estimated that solicitor/client costs for the respondents would be between $1 million and $2 million. Significantly for present purposes, Mr Vasudevan notified Mr Rambaldi that:
 "There may be a possibility that Delloites [sic] may entertain the possibility of settling the matter or ending the matter where each party bears [its] own costs, and in that regard, Borden was prepared to help with the appeal. Spalla will not be a factor in settlement negotiations as if he does not come to the party, then IMF, HWL and the liquidator will drop this matter." 


 
 Mr Vasudevan advised Mr Rambaldi that, after HWL left, Mr Bowman told Mr Vasudevan, that ILF was considering withdrawing its indemnity, although it would not do so until after the appeal was lodged and "if settlement negotiations do not go well".</text>

<tocase>Beck v Spalla [2005] FCAFC 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/82.html</AustLII>
<text>70 As already noted, the applications for leave to appeal and the appeals were listed for hearing on 10 and 11 May 2005. The mediation was scheduled for 29 April 2005. A Full Court, which was constituted by Hill, Finn and Kenny JJ, heard argument in proceeding VID 54 of 2005 on 10 May 2005 and, on 13 May 2005, granted leave to appeal and dismissed the appeal: see Beck v Spalla [2005] FCAFC 82. On account of what happened at the mediation on 29 April 2005, proceeding VID 83 of 2005 did not proceed before the Full Court on 10 May 2005.

71 On 27 April 2005, two days prior to the mediation, Mr Rambaldi and Mr Vasudevan, Mr Foale, Mr Borden and Ms Arslan, and Mr Spalla and Mr Ian Still attended a meeting, to discuss the forthcoming mediation. I accept that a file note of that meeting, which Mr Borden had prepared the following day, accurately records the discussions at that meeting.

72 At the meeting of 27 April 2005, Mr Rambaldi repeated that ILF was considering withdrawing its litigation support and that he would be unable to continue with the litigation if it did so. He also said that, if ILF withdrew after the mediation, he would take whatever offer was made, including a walk-away offer. Mr Borden's file note of the meeting specifically recorded that:
 "Gess [Rambaldi] reported that he had been informed that ILF was considering withdrawing its support. He reported that if ILF withdrew its support, he would not be able to proceed any further with the litigation. He requested ILF to advise whether they would continue support past Friday, as he will need to know this when taking on board any offers that might be made. If the support is withdrawn after Friday, Gess advised that he would take whatever offer was made including a walk-away if that was available." 


 
 Mr Rambaldi also asked the solicitors what they thought the Irlmond claim was worth. Mr Borden's file note records that Ms Arslan "advised that the bottom line was somewhere between $2 [million] and $3 [million] plus interest and costs".</text>

<tocase>Rambaldi v Spalla [2005] VSC 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSC/2005/162.html</AustLII>
<text>115 The application was heard by Hansen J on 6 May 2005. Mr Randall appeared for Mr Rambaldi. Mr Spalla appeared in person. Mr Randall said that, although Mr Rambaldi had come to Court to put the option of allowing the officers of Irlmond to take over the litigation, "his preference is that the court declines to make the orders". Mr Spalla spoke also. He expressed disapproval of how Mr Rambaldi had acted in signing the Deed and said that he wished to take control of the litigation. At the conclusion of the hearing, his Honour declined to make the orders sought and gave reasons: see Rambaldi v Spalla [2005] VSC 162 (" Rambaldi ").

116 Hansen J found that he had insufficient information to form a view on the likelihood of success of Irlmond on appeal or at trial: Rambaldi at [19]. Therefore, he was unable to determine if it was in the best interests of the company to continue with the litigation. He noted that Mr Spalla had not made any "proposal by which the position of the company in relation to the adverse costs orders which are to be released under the settlement could be secured, that is to say if authority was given to Mr Spalla to continue with the proceeding, that the company would be no worse off than it would be in that respect under the settlement": Rambaldi at [20]. Similarly, his Honour noted that he had no "assurance beyond that stated by Mr Spalla, as to how the company's ongoing costs are to be paid": Rambaldi at [20].

117 Later that day (but before 5.00 pm), Mr Rambaldi procured the consent of his partners to the Deed.

118 Before turning to the parties' submissions, I note that Mr Borden properly conceded that he could not recollect the precise words used at the mediation or in pre-mediation conferences and that, in general, his file notes are likely to be more reliable than his present recollection. I accept this and further I accept that Mr Borden's handwritten notes, which were made at the time of the mediation, are even more reliable than his typed notes of the mediation.

202 On legal advice, Mr Spalla did not make an application to take over the carriage of the primary proceeding for Irlmond. Having sought his own independent legal advice, Mr Rambaldi did apply to the Supreme Court. Mr Spalla claims that the application to the Supreme Court was not made in good faith because Mr Rambaldi did not support it. Mr Rambaldi explained that he did not support the orders sought by the application because he did not believe that Mr Spalla was an appropriate person to have conduct of the Irlmond claim in the primary proceeding. He explained that, in his view, Mr Spalla was too emotionally involved with the litigation and might not be able to bring sufficient objectivity to the commercial decisions associated with managing litigation on behalf of a company in liquidation. This does not show that Mr Rambaldi brought the application in bad faith. As liquidator of Irlmond, Mr Rambaldi was required to advise the Court of his position in relation to the application. Although he did not support the application, by bringing it he gave Mr Spalla the opportunity to seek an order giving him authority to conduct the litigation. As Hansen J explain in Rambaldi at [18]:
 " [D] oubtless out of some thought for the other interests involved, [Mr Rambaldi] has brought this application which may be thought to have been designed to draw Mr Spalla to seek authority to conduct the litigation under the guise of the originating process. As I have said, Mr Spalla takes the opportunity to seek that authority. He wishes to be able to conduct the litigation and, as discussed with counsel, I could make such an order under s.511(1)(b) of the Act if, in my view, it was otherwise appropriate to do so." 
 Similarly, I do not find that the application was brought in bad faith. I find that it was filed in a good faith attempt to seek the guidance of the Court and to allow Mr Spalla an opportunity to put his case to the Court. Overall, I find no reason to conclude that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in the week before the Deed was ratified.</text>

<tocase>Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1998) 29 ACSR 448</tocase>
<text>122 Mr Spalla relied on s 1321 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") as a basis for his application. That section allows a "person aggrieved by any act ... or decision" of a liquidator to appeal to the Court in respect of the act or decision. The Court can "confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision". Citing Westpac Banking Corporation v Totterdell (1998) 29 ACSR 448 (" Westpac v Totterdell ") , Mr Spalla submitted that he had standing to bring an appeal under this section as a creditor of Irlmond, of which he was also the sole director. Mr Spalla also maintained that he had standing as an applicant and the funder in the primary proceeding. He also pointed out that he and his wife were the owners and controllers of Anstella, which in turn held all the issued shares in Irlmond. Mr Spalla identified "the decision of Mr Rambaldi to execute the Deed of Settlement on 29 April 2005 and subsequently seek and obtain the ratification of the Deed by his partners on 6 May 2005" as the subject of the appeal.

123 Under r 14.1(2) of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules ("the Rules") any appeal under s 1321 of an act, omission or decision of a liquidator must be filed within "21 days after the date of the act, omission or decision appealed against". Mr Spalla argued that his appeal was not out of time because, even though his initial notice of motion did not refer to s 1321 of the Act , this proceeding was initiated within 21 days of the execution of the Deed. In the alternative, Mr Spalla sought an extension of time to bring an appeal under s 1321. He argued that an extension of time was appropriate because his initial notice of motion put Mr Rambaldi and other interested parties on notice of the nature of Mr Spalla's complaints against him.

124 Mr Spalla also sought to rely on s 536 and s 1324 of the Act . As I accept that s 1321 is an appropriate vehicle for Mr Spalla's challenge to the Deed, it is unnecessary to discuss these sections of the Act further.

169 In the context of this case, two considerations must be borne steadily in mind. First, s 545(1) of the Act provides that a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property. Secondly (by way of reiteration) the courts are generally "loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents, at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision": see Star v Silvia (No 1) (1994) 12 ACLC 600 at 604 per Young J; Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd (1986) 4 ACLC 114 at 116 per Young J; Northbourne at 440; Westpac v Totterdell at 453-454 per Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon and White JJ agreed); and Cook v Northoak Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 25 ACSR 517.</text>

<tocase>Re Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (In Liquidation); Rosseau Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) v Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (2004) 50 ACSR 565</tocase>
<text>125 Mr Spalla conceded that, where an appeal under s 1321 of the Act is against a liquidator's discretionary decision or a decision involving business judgment, the Court would not reverse the liquidator's decision unless it was satisfied that the liquidator acted unreasonably or in bad faith: see Re Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (In Liquidation); Rosseau Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) v Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (2004) 50 ACSR 565 (" Jay-O-Bees ") at 575 per Campbell J. Mr Spalla submitted that there were many grounds for concluding that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith by executing the Deed. As he raised so many grounds, Mr Spalla's submissions were somewhat diffuse. In what follows, I attempt to outline his main arguments.

126 Perhaps foremost among Mr Spalla's arguments is his claim that Mr Rambaldi acted in breach of the LFA. Additionally, he argues that, by his conduct, Mr Rambaldi breached his obligations under the Act , including under s 180. In particular, in breach of the LFA, Mr Spalla alleges that Mr Rambaldi breached clauses 9.1, 9.3, 14 and 21 of the LFA. Under clause 9.1, HWL were to "conduct the Proceeding on behalf of the Liquidator and the Spalla Interests". In Mr Spalla's view, Mr Rambaldi breached clause 9.1 by negotiating the terms of the Deed without consulting his solicitors.

127 Under clause 9.3, the Liquidator was not permitted to instruct the solicitors to settle the "proceedings as a whole" or to "settle, amend, vary, abandon or discontinue any claim made or the relief sought by the Spalla Interests" without consent of the Spalla Interests. Mr Spalla argued that the words "any claim made" included the claim made on behalf of and in the name of Irlmond.

165 The decision to accept a settlement on behalf of Irlmond, and the preliminary decision to sign the Deed, were clearly discretionary decisions of the liquidator. They also involved matters of business judgment. It is well settled that where an appeal is brought against such a decision "the court will reverse the liquidator's decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith": see Jay-O-Bees at 575 and the authorities referred to. This is in contrast to an appeal against a rejection of a proof of debt where the Court hears the issue de novo: see Jay-O-Bees at 575-576. The "general approach ... in a case like this is that [the Court] should not interfere with a decision made by the liquidator unless either there is fraud, or it can be said that the discretion has not been exercised bona fide, or it can be said that the liquidator has acted in a way which no reasonable liquidator could have acted": Bridgeport at 161-162 quoting Yeomans v Walker (1986) 5 NSWLR 378 at 383 per Hodgson J.</text>

<tocase>Watson v Foxman (2000) 49 NSWLR 315</tocase>
<text>145 Although Mr Rambaldi asked the Court to prefer his evidence to that of Mr Spalla in so far as their evidence conflicted, he did not ask the Court to make a negative credibility finding with respect to Mr Spalla. Rather, Mr Rambaldi relied on the principles referred to by McLelland CJ in Watson v Foxman (2000) 49 NSWLR 315 at 319: 
 " [H] uman memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience." 
 Mr Rambaldi said that these considerations were especially apposite in this case where Mr Spalla has a very high degree of personal involvement in the proceedings. Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Spalla has been caught up in litigation including the failed criminal prosecution for many years now. Mr Rambaldi submitted that these difficult circumstances have impacted on Mr Spalla's ability to consider the issues and events relating to this case in a dispassionate manner. According to Mr Rambaldi, this has lead to Mr Spalla misremembering some conversations such as the meeting at the conclusion of the mediation.

146 Mr Rambaldi submitted that, as Mr Spalla alleged bad faith, the Court is not being asked to decide whether Mr Rambaldi achieved the best settlement possible. Mr Rambaldi sought to distinguish bad faith from negligence. With bad faith, he submitted, the enquiry is directed to the actual state of mind of the decision-maker against whom bad faith is alleged. He argued that there is no such thing as constructive bad faith.</text>

<tocase>Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>147 Mr Rambaldi argued that bad faith is a serious allegation and that the Court must reach a comfortable satisfaction that the case is made out in accordance with the Briginshaw test: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 (" Briginshaw ") at 361-362 per Dixon J. He submitted that, as there is no precise definition of bad faith, whether the case is made out will depend on the particular facts. Mr Rambaldi contested that there were any grounds in this case for concluding that he had acted in bad faith. Mr Spalla had failed, so Mr Rambaldi said, to adduce evidence to satisfy the Court, on the balance of probabilities, that, in entering into the irrevocable offer, Mr Rambaldi was actuated by bad faith.

148 Further, counsel for Mr Rambaldi contended that Mr Rambaldi, at all times, acted in good faith. Counsel asked for a positive finding that Mr Rambaldi was acting in good faith when he entered into the offer and recommended to his partners that it should be given effect. A key element of Mr Rambaldi's submissions was his claim that a liquidator who is not funded or is without indemnity is not expected to continue a proceeding. Accordingly, Mr Rambaldi could not have been expected to continue his involvement in the primary proceeding beyond 6 May 2005. Mr Rambaldi noted that Mr Borden, who was the lawyer of Mr Rambaldi and Mr Spalla jointly, had said that Mr Rambaldi could not be expected to continue the proceedings without an indemnity and would be entitled to accept a walk-away offer in those circumstances.

149 Mr Rambaldi argued that, once he was informed on 29 April 2005 that his indemnity was to be withdrawn, he knew that he would not be able to continue with the litigation after 6 May 2005 and he behaved reasonably to protect the interests of creditors in those circumstances. He said that he procured an offer at the mediation that would stay open for seven days, thereby providing an opportunity for options for continuing the litigation to be explored. He claimed that he procured his partners' consent to the Deed only after no reasonable way to continue the litigation was found. He said that his conduct was consistent with the LFA. Mr Spalla was utterly wrong to characterize what he did to preserve Mr Spalla's position for seven days as a "facade".

166 Mr Spalla has attempted to satisfy this standard of review by showing that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith in executing the Deed. This is a serious allegation, involving the imputation of moral turpitude. The standard of proof to be applied is proof on the preponderance of probability with due regard to the seriousness of the particular issue being determined. As Dixon J said in Briginshaw at 361-362: 
 " [W] hen the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. ... Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature or consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters 'reasonable satisfaction' should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences." 
 An allegation of bad faith is a serious claim affecting reputation and the Court should have regard to this when considering the evidence.

167 Section 181(1) of the Act relevantly provides that an officer of a corporation a term that includes a liquidator (s 9) - must exercise powers and discharge duties in good faith in the best interests of the corporation and for a proper purpose. Whether there has been bad faith will depend on the particular circumstances of the case.</text>

<tocase>Northbourne Developments Pty Ltd v Reiby Chambers Pty Ltd (1989) 19 NSWLR 434</tocase>
<text>160 Various statutes have used the expression "person aggrieved" and courts have discussed its meaning in numerous cases: compare the much quoted passage in Ex parte Sidebotham; In re Sidebotham (1880) 14 Ch D 458 at 465-466 per James LJ; Northbourne Developments Pty Ltd v Reiby Chambers Pty Ltd (1989) 19 NSWLR 434 (" Northbourne ") at 437-438 per McLelland J; and Bridgeport Advisers &amp; Asset Managers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 146 (" Bridgeport ") at 162 per Barrett J. As Gibbs CJ said in Koowarta v Bjelke-Peterson [1982] HCA 27 ; (1982) 153 CLR 168 at 184-185, the meaning of the expression must ultimately depend on the context of the particular statute. Having regard to the circumstances outlined above, I find that Mr Spalla has standing under this provision. None of the respondents contended that he did not.

162 I am satisfied that Mr Spalla has standing because of his role in the primary proceeding. Mr Spalla is a moving party in the primary proceeding, which is the subject of the Deed and settlement, and, under the LFA, he (and others) undertook to pay the legal costs in the primary proceeding of Irlmond and Mr Rambaldi. Even though the Spalla Interest claims were not settled (see below), it is reasonable to assume that the settlement of the Irlmond claim would significantly affect Mr Spalla as a party to the primary proceeding and deprive him of the advantage of Irlmond's participation. It also affected his rights and obligations under the LFA. Thus, for example, the Deed did not include any release against costs orders in favour of Mr Spalla and the Spalla Interests. Because of this, Mr Spalla claims that the Deed left him exposed to adverse costs orders in relation to Irlmond's claim in the primary proceeding. Mr Spalla has a "legal grievance": compare Northbourne at 438. Mr Spalla's role in the primary proceeding, both as a principal party and under the LFA, is sufficient to give him the standing as a "person aggrieved" under s 1321.

163 Under r 14.1 of the Rules, Mr Spalla requires an extension of time to bring an appeal pursuant to s 1321 of the Act . Mr Spalla did not purport to bring an appeal under this section until 18 April 2006 well outside the 21 day period for which r 14.1(2)(a) provides. The Court has the power to grant an extension of time under r 14.1(3) of the Rules. When deciding whether to grant such an extension, the Court has regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the extent and circumstances of the delay and any potential prejudice to other parties. In this case an extension is warranted. As Mr Spalla submitted, his notice of motion of 18 May 2005 was filed within 21 days of the challenged act and put Mr Rambaldi on notice of the points he wishes to raise in the appeal. In all the circumstances of the case, and in light of this fact and the fact that the respondents have not opposed an extension of time, I would grant the extension Mr Spalla seeks.

169 In the context of this case, two considerations must be borne steadily in mind. First, s 545(1) of the Act provides that a liquidator is not liable to incur any expense in relation to the winding up of a company unless there is sufficient available property. Secondly (by way of reiteration) the courts are generally "loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents, at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision": see Star v Silvia (No 1) (1994) 12 ACLC 600 at 604 per Young J; Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd (1986) 4 ACLC 114 at 116 per Young J; Northbourne at 440; Westpac v Totterdell at 453-454 per Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon and White JJ agreed); and Cook v Northoak Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 25 ACSR 517.</text>

165 The decision to accept a settlement on behalf of Irlmond, and the preliminary decision to sign the Deed, were clearly discretionary decisions of the liquidator.

It is well settled that where an appeal is brought against such a decision "the court will reverse the liquidator's decision only when it is satisfied that he was acting unreasonably or in bad faith": see Jay-O-Bees at 575 and the authorities referred to. This is in contrast to an appeal against a rejection of a proof of debt where the Court hears the issue de novo: see Jay-O-Bees at 575-576. The "general approach ... in a case like this is that [the Court] should not interfere with a decision made by the liquidator unless either there is fraud, or it can be said that the discretion has not been exercised bona fide, or it can be said that the liquidator has acted in a way which no reasonable liquidator could have acted": Bridgeport at 161-162 quoting Yeomans v Walker (1986) 5 NSWLR 378 at 383 per Hodgson J.

203 Finally, I turn to the issue of whether the settlement was so unfavourable for Irlmond that it evidences that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith. Absent any other evidence of bad faith, the question must be whether or not, in executing the Deed and ultimately settling Irlmond's claim, Mr Rambaldi acted in a way that no reasonable liquidator could have acted: compare Bridgeport at 161-162. In this context, it must be borne in mind that courts are especially reluctant to second-guess settlement decisions. Public policy favours settlement. As Chesterman J said in Dew v Richardson [1999] QSC 192 at [42] , settlement helps "reduce the level of disharmony in society and conserve the resources both of litigants themselves and the community which funds the courts." Others have seen the virtue of settlement in promoting certainty that permits litigants to deal with their affairs in an orderly way looking to the future. For example, in Kelley v Corston [1998] 3 WLR 246 at 259, Judge LJ said: 
 "Every lawyer in practice and every judge knows that there is no such thing as the case which is bound to succeed. Experience shows that cases with the brightest prospects of success somehow fail and it is difficult to underestimate the value of the certainty provided by a settlement as opposed to the continuing risks of litigation through to judgment".</text>

<text>161 I do not base this finding on Mr Spalla's claim to be a creditor of Irlmond. Mr Spalla's claim to be a creditor is in tension with the fact that, in this and the primary proceeding, Mr Spalla relied on the report by Banks Group Services, which, amongst other things, estimated directors' loans to be $1,230,000. The evidence as it stands does not permit me to find whether in fact Mr Spalla was a creditor of Irlmond. As previously noted, some important issues concerning the financial status and dealings of Irlmond have already been found to be subject to res judicata and issue estoppels. This proceeding has focussed on the conduct of Mr Rambaldi, particularly in entering the Deed. I have not been required to make findings about the financial affairs of Irlmond. Nor have I been presented with a proper evidentiary foundation to make such findings. It is unnecessary to decide whether it is sufficient for standing under s 1321 that Mr Spalla claims to be a creditor of Irlmond: compare Starmaker (No 51) Pty Ltd v Mawson KLM Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] SASC 313 at [49] - [51] per Layton J.</text>

The "general approach ... in a case like this is that [the Court] should not interfere with a decision made by the liquidator unless either there is fraud, or it can be said that the discretion has not been exercised bona fide, or it can be said that the liquidator has acted in a way which no reasonable liquidator could have acted": Bridgeport at 161-162 quoting Yeomans v Walker (1986) 5 NSWLR 378 at 383 per Hodgson J.</text>

<text>168 Want of good faith on a liquidator's part in the present context and elsewhere in the Act (e.g., in s 181) is not precisely the same as the concept of want of good faith in other areas of the law, as for example, in public law. The Act does not, however, define the concept of "good faith"; and the concepts of good and bad faith in the common law and elsewhere in statute are plainly related to the present matter. Thus, "there are many ways in which bad faith can occur and it is not possible to give a comprehensive definition": SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749 (" SBBS ") at 756 per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Jacobson JJ. The focus of an inquiry concerning an allegation of bad faith is the state of mind of the decision-maker. The Court is not simply evaluating the wisdom of an impugned decision. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SBAN [2002] FCAFC 431 , Heerey and Kiefel JJ said at [8]: 
 "As with other areas of the law where wrongful intent is in issue, reckless indifference may be the equivalent of intent. But this is not to say that the test is objective. The inquiry is directed to the actual state of mind of the decision-maker. There is no such thing as deemed or constructive bad faith. It is the ultimate decision ... which must be shown to have been taken in bad faith." 
 Compare also Secretary, Department of Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs v Prince (1997) 152 ALR 127 at 130 per Finn J. This means that "mere error or irrationality does not of itself demonstrate lack of good faith ... [b]ad faith is not to be found simply because of poor decision-making": SBBS at 756 [45]. Rather, the circumstances must show dishonesty (or capriciousness) on the part of the decision-maker: compare Pledger v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2002] FCA 1576 at [70] - [78] per Weinberg J. Something is done in "good faith" when done honestly. Something is done in "bad faith" when done dishonestly. These general principles must be applied to each of the purported bases of bad faith as alleged by Mr Spalla.</text>

Secondly (by way of reiteration) the courts are generally "loath to enter into the area where the professional liquidator has made a commercial decision which he considers benefits the stakeholders whom he represents, at least unless something is pointed to which suggests that there are some vitiating factors which entered into the making of the decision": see Star v Silvia (No 1) (1994) 12 ACLC 600 at 604 per Young J; Sanderson v Classic Car Insurances Pty Ltd (1986) 4 ACLC 114 at 116 per Young J; Northbourne at 440; Westpac v Totterdell at 453-454 per Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon and White JJ agreed); and Cook v Northoak Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 25 ACSR 517.</text>

<text>173 Further, I reject Mr Spalla's suggestion that I should draw inferences (under the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298) against Mr Rambaldi because Mr Rambaldi failed to call those with whom he negotiated the terms of Deed. Mr Spalla claimed that there was no explanation for the failure to call these witnesses and that they could have provided evidence as to whether the parties understood the Deed to operate as an offer of settlement. While the surrounding circumstances may be relevant to construction, the terms of the condition precedent are clear. No reasonable observer could have interpreted the Deed as anything other than an offer. The language of the document admits of only one meaning: compare Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australian Performing Right Association Ltd [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 (" ABC v APRA ") at 105-107 per Barwick CJ and 114-115 per Stephen J.

176 The LFA was a commercial contract. The High Court outlined the principles for construing such contracts in Pacific Carriers and Toll . In Pacific Carriers at 462 the High Court said that the process of construction "requires consideration not only of the text of the documents, but also the surrounding circumstances known to [the parties to the contract], and the purpose and object of the transaction": Pacific Carriers at 462. This approach was reaffirmed in Toll , where the High Court said at 179:
 "It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations. What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement. The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean. That, normally, requires consideration not only of the text, but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties, and the purpose and object of the transaction ."

<text>174 In the afternoon of 29 April 2005, Mr Spalla had asked Mr Rambaldi not to come to an agreement with the respondents without first consulting him. At no time that day, did Mr Rambaldi conclude an agreement with the respondents. Mr Spalla was notified of the respondents' offer at the close of business that day. At that point, he had seven days in which to satisfy Mr Rambaldi that Irlmond, with Mr Rambaldi as liquidator, should continue to pursue the primary proceeding and the appeals, alternatively, to make some other arrangement that would permit Irlmond to litigate its claims, though without Mr Rambaldi. It is true that it was not for Mr Spalla to decide whether to continue with or terminate Irlmond's participation in the primary proceeding. This decision was left with Mr Rambaldi, who might or might not act to secure his partners' consent. This was, however, in keeping with the LFA and the duty of a liquidator to act independently, in the best interests of the company and its creditors: compare Re Club Superstores Australia Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) (1993) 10 ACSR 730 at 734-735 per Thomas J (and the cases there cited); Re Allebart Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) and the Companies Act [1971] 1 NSWLR 25 at 28 per Street J; and AR Keay, McPherson The Law of Company Liquidation (4 th ed, LBC information Services, 1999) at 291. In any event the effect of the offer was made clear at the meeting at the coffee shop on the Monday morning. Mr Rambaldi acted consistently with this in the days prior to 6 May 2005.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/1999/192.html</AustLII>
<text>203 Finally, I turn to the issue of whether the settlement was so unfavourable for Irlmond that it evidences that Mr Rambaldi acted in bad faith. Absent any other evidence of bad faith, the question must be whether or not, in executing the Deed and ultimately settling Irlmond's claim, Mr Rambaldi acted in a way that no reasonable liquidator could have acted: compare Bridgeport at 161-162. In this context, it must be borne in mind that courts are especially reluctant to second-guess settlement decisions. Public policy favours settlement. As Chesterman J said in Dew v Richardson [1999] QSC 192 at [42] , settlement helps "reduce the level of disharmony in society and conserve the resources both of litigants themselves and the community which funds the courts." Others have seen the virtue of settlement in promoting certainty that permits litigants to deal with their affairs in an orderly way looking to the future. For example, in Kelley v Corston [1998] 3 WLR 246 at 259, Judge LJ said: 
 "Every lawyer in practice and every judge knows that there is no such thing as the case which is bound to succeed. Experience shows that cases with the brightest prospects of success somehow fail and it is difficult to underestimate the value of the certainty provided by a settlement as opposed to the continuing risks of litigation through to judgment".</text>
