<tocase>BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389</tocase>
<text>Three grounds under this section were advanced. These were: 
(a) The Statutory Demand was not made in compliance with s 459E of the Act because it was not in the prescribed form (see s 459E(2)(e) of the Act) and was not accompanied by an affidavit that:
 
(i) Verified that the claimed debt was due and payable by BMG as at 21 August 2007; and
 
(ii) Complied with the Rules of Court.
 
(see s 459E(3) of the Act).
 
The alleged non-compliance with each of the provisions referred to above was said to be constituted by the failure on the part of Adelaide Bank to verify the Statutory Demand or otherwise include in the affidavits read in support of its case on the present Application a statement by an appropriately qualified witness to the following effect:
 
I believe there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the debt. 
 
 
In support of these contentions, Mr Watts relied upon the decision of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd [2003] FCA 533. 
 
(b) The Statutory Demand was issued for an improper purpose. That purpose was said to be the purpose of preventing or delaying BMG, Mr Watts and Mrs Watts from taking action against Adelaide Bank for damages or compensation by reason of the bank's conduct in allegedly dishonouring various alleged agreements and arrangements and in taking possession of the property and in taking steps to sell it as mortgagee in possession; and
 
(c) The amount of the debt claimed in the Statutory Demand was misstated. At the hearing on 10 December 2008, Mr Watts conceded that there was in existence as at 21 August 2007 a debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank but submitted that the correct amount of the debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank at that time was $16,281.29. Subsequently, in a submission which I allowed Mr Watts to advance as a result of my decision made on 21 April 2009 (see BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389), Mr Watts submitted that no moneys were due from BMG to Adelaide Bank and that Adelaide Bank had an obligation to account to BMG for surplus funds of approximately $86,286.32.</text>

<tocase>Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1208 ; (1995) 17 ACSR 128</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1995/1208.html</AustLII>
<text>Although the expression may well include an unliquidated claim, that claim must be capable of being quantified as an amount of money ( Chase Manhattan Bank Australia Ltd v Oscty Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1208 ; (1995) 17 ACSR 128 at 135).

The claim must exist at the time at which the statutory demand is made ie in this case as at 21 August or perhaps 27 August 2007.

By reason of the terms of the definition of offsetting claim , the claim must be genuine . The concept of genuineness gives rise to the same considerations as those with which I have dealt in respect of the s 459H(1)(a) ground.

The first contention relied upon by BMG in support of this ground is that Adelaide Bank sold the property at an undervalue. This allegation amounts to an allegation that the bank breached the duty owed by it to BMG as mortgagee in possession when exercising its power of sale.</text>

<tocase>Economic Life Assurance Society v Usborne [1902] AC 147</tocase>
<text>Whilst it seems to me that the provisions of cl 11.7 would entitle Adelaide Bank to charge interest at the contractual rate after judgment, the terms of that clause do not authorise the continued charging after judgment of late payment fees and penalty charges in accordance with other provisions of the loan agreements. Whatever rights Adelaide Bank had to levy such fees and charges under the covenants in the loan agreements were merged in the judgment which it obtained on 3 April 2006. After 3 April 2006 its rights were confined to recovering the amount of the judgment plus interest, albeit levied at the contractual rate if it so desired and its rights under its securities (see Economic Life Assurance Society v Usborne [1902] AC 147 ; and Elders Trustee &amp; Executor Co Ltd v Eagle Star Nominees Ltd (1986) 4 BPR 9205 , [1987] ANZ ConvR 14, (1987) NSW ConvR 55 333). A complete copy of the relevant mortgage was not tendered in evidence before me. I will therefore assume that, prior to 3 April 2006, Adelaide Bank's rights in respect of interest and other charges were confined to the personal covenants in the loan agreements. In that event, those rights were merged in the judgment and ceased to exist after 3 April 2006.</text>

<tocase>Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 , (1994) 12 ACLC 669</tocase>
<text>In Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787 788, (1994) 12 ACLC 669 , McLelland CJ in Eq said: 
 It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression "genuine dispute" where it occurs in s 450H. In my opinion that expression connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of considerations as the "serious question to be tried" criterion which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. This does not mean that the court must accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an affidavit "however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the same deponent, or inherently improbable in itself, it may be" not having "sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation as to [its] truth" (cf Eng Mee Yong v Letchumanan [1980] AC 331 at 341), or "a patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence": cf South Australia v Wall (1980) 24 SASR 189 at 194. 
 But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a court required to determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not embark upon an inquiry as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as giving rise to the dispute. There is a clear difference between, on the one hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand, determining the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute. In Mibor Investments (at 366-7) Hayne J said, after referring to the state of the law prior to the enactment of Div 3 of Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Law, and to the terms of Div 3: 

These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute. All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute.
 
 In Re Morris Catering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601 at 605 Thomas J said: 

There is little doubt that Div 3 ... prescribes a formula that requires the court to assess the position between the parties, and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim. That is not to say that the court will examine the merits or settle the dispute. The specified limits of the court's examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a "genuine dispute" and whether there is a "genuine claim".
 
It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster or assertion. But beyond a perception of genuineness (or the lack of it), the court has no function. It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more likely than the other to succeed, or that the eventual state of the account between the parties is more likely to be one result than another.
 
The essential task is relatively simple &#8212; to identify the genuine level of a claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify the genuine level of an offsetting claim (not the likely result of it).
 
 I respectfully agree with those statements.</text>

<tocase>IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd [2003] FCA 533</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/533.html</AustLII>
<text>Three grounds under this section were advanced. These were: 
(a) The Statutory Demand was not made in compliance with s 459E of the Act because it was not in the prescribed form (see s 459E(2)(e) of the Act) and was not accompanied by an affidavit that:
 
(i) Verified that the claimed debt was due and payable by BMG as at 21 August 2007; and
 
(ii) Complied with the Rules of Court.
 
(see s 459E(3) of the Act).
 
The alleged non-compliance with each of the provisions referred to above was said to be constituted by the failure on the part of Adelaide Bank to verify the Statutory Demand or otherwise include in the affidavits read in support of its case on the present Application a statement by an appropriately qualified witness to the following effect:
 
I believe there is no genuine dispute about the existence or amount of the debt. 
 
 
In support of these contentions, Mr Watts relied upon the decision of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd v Shanghai Jerrys Candle Company Ltd [2003] FCA 533. 
 
(b) The Statutory Demand was issued for an improper purpose. That purpose was said to be the purpose of preventing or delaying BMG, Mr Watts and Mrs Watts from taking action against Adelaide Bank for damages or compensation by reason of the bank's conduct in allegedly dishonouring various alleged agreements and arrangements and in taking possession of the property and in taking steps to sell it as mortgagee in possession; and
 
(c) The amount of the debt claimed in the Statutory Demand was misstated. At the hearing on 10 December 2008, Mr Watts conceded that there was in existence as at 21 August 2007 a debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank but submitted that the correct amount of the debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank at that time was $16,281.29. Subsequently, in a submission which I allowed Mr Watts to advance as a result of my decision made on 21 April 2009 (see BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd v Adelaide Bank Limited; In the Matter of BMG Poseidon Corp Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 389), Mr Watts submitted that no moneys were due from BMG to Adelaide Bank and that Adelaide Bank had an obligation to account to BMG for surplus funds of approximately $86,286.32.

In IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 533 , Tamberlin J held that, in circumstances where the Act, Rules of Court and the Regulations made under the Act required a statement to the effect that the creditor believed that there was no genuine dispute about the existence or the amount of the debt to be made as part of the evidentiary requirements supporting a creditor's statutory demand, the failure on the part of the creditor to make such a statement on oath was fatal to the validity of the statutory demand.

In my opinion, however, the circumstances of the present case are quite different from those in play in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 533. In my view, Adelaide Bank was not required to verify the Statutory Demand at all and was not required to include a statement in the form urged by Mr Watts.

Section 459E(3) of the Act is in the following terms: 
 (3) Unless the debt, or each of the debts, is a judgment debt, the demand must be accompanied by an affidavit that: 

(a) verifies that the debt, or the total of the amounts of the debts, is due and payable by the company; and
 
(b) complies with the rules.

In the present case, the amount asserted to be due from BMG to Adelaide Bank in the Statutory Demand is the balance of a judgment debt. Thus, the foundation for the claimed debt in the present case is the judgment, not the loan agreements or the mortgage security. That being so, in my view, the Statutory Demand was not required to be accompanied by an affidavit that complied with s 459E(3) of the Act. It is only if such an affidavit were required that consideration needs to be given to the requirements of the Rules. It is only when those requirements are brought into play that the reasoning of Tamberlin J in IFA Homeware Imports Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 533 is apt.

I reject the first contention made by BMG in support of this ground.

The second contention advanced by BMG in support of this ground has not been supported by any evidence or argument. It too is rejected.</text>

<tocase>Olivieri v Stafford (1989) 24 FCR 413</tocase>
<text>In my opinion, this Court has the power to go behind a judgment in appropriate circumstances, even if the judgment was obtained by default and even if the debtors have unsuccessfully made application to set the judgment aside. This much is made clear in the Reasons for Judgment of Gibbs J in Re Johnson &amp; Mann; Ex parte Greendale Engineering &amp; Cables Ltd [1968] ALR 408 , (1967) 11 FLR 335 at 341. It may be thought that certain observations made by Beaumont J in Olivieri v Stafford (1989) 24 FCR 413 are authority for the contrary proposition. In that case, his Honour said (at 424): 
 As has been said, a court of bankruptcy is concerned to inquire into the "reality" of the matter in hand. Here the "reality" of the matter is that the merits of the respondents' claim have been demonstrated to the satisfaction of one judge of the District Court and another judge of that Court has declined to disturb the judgment. As a matter of substance, it is appropriate, in all the circumstances, for a court of bankruptcy to treat what happened in the two hearings in the District Court as a trial of the merits of the respondents' claim. That is to say, a court of bankruptcy should, I think, accept that a process of adjudication in the District Court has established that the underlying transactions created a true debt which could, in turn, provide a proper foundation for the entry of a judgment in respect of which a bankruptcy notice could properly issue.

In my view, notwithstanding these remarks, his Honour nonetheless recognised that the Court retained a discretion to go behind a default judgment in an appropriate case even where attempts to set aside that judgment had failed. There is no principle which denies the existence of that discretion. In Olivieri 24 FCR 413 , a judgment had been obtained in the District Court by default and two attempts to have it set aside had failed. The approach of Beaumont J was to look at the reality of the matter. In his Honour's view, by the time that the case before him had reached this Court, there was no reason for this Court to examine yet again the underlying basis for the judgment. .

In the same case, Gummow J reached the same result through a different process of reasoning with which, with respect, I agree.

The natural justice arguments advanced by BMG in support of its application to set aside the judgment made in the Supreme Court cannot constitute a defence to the claim of Adelaide Bank for repayment of its loans and other moneys due under the loan agreements. The remaining two broad grounds relied upon by BMG in the Supreme Court (as to which see [42](b) and (c) above) are reminiscent of contentions advanced on behalf of BMG in the present proceedings.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1912/9.html</AustLII>
<text>Further, the position in Australia remains that there is no common law duty in negligence by which a mortgagee can be found liable for damages if it fails to obtain a good price or the best price upon the sale of a mortgaged property (as to which see Fisher and Lightwood's Law of Mortgage , (2 nd Australian edition, 2005) at 496 497 [20.21]). The duty of the mortgagee is one of good faith. That duty requires the mortgagee not to act fraudulently or wilfully or recklessly or to recklessly sacrifice the interests of the mortgagor ( Pendlebury v Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1912] HCA 9 ; (1912) 13 CLR 676 at 680).

BMG tendered no evidence to support its contention that the property was sold at an undervalue. Adelaide Bank, on the other hand, tendered the three valuations which it had obtained. The valuers were not cross-examined. Their opinions were not challenged at all. In addition, Mr Watts' anecdotal recounting of the casual offer made to BMG in mid 1996 of $850,000 tended to support the valuations which Adelaide Bank had obtained.

Furthermore, the obvious difficulties which BMG had encountered in selling the property in 2006 and early 2007 and in procuring sufficient funds to refinance its debts to Adelaide Bank in the same period provide additional support for the conclusion that the property was not likely to have commanded a price much above $850,000 $900,000 viewed from the perspective of a seller looking forward in late 2006 and early 2007.</text>

<tocase>Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/45.html</AustLII>
<text>It was submitted on behalf of Adelaide Bank in support of a contention that no genuine dispute existed that, by reason of the application of the principles articulated by the High Court in Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 , BMG was estopped from arguing that there was any dispute in respect of the judgment and, further, was estopped from arguing in the present proceedings any matter which was in fact raised by it, or could have been raised by it, in support of the application made by it, Mr Watts and Mrs Watts in the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment.

I do not think that these propositions are correct. There has been no adjudication on the merits and no occasion calling for such an adjudication. The exercise of considering and determining an application to set aside a default judgment involves the application of very different principles from those which would ordinarily be in play on a final hearing on the merits.</text>

<text>For s 459H(1)(a) to be engaged, the Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute about the existence or about the amount of the debt. In order for a dispute of that kind to be raised, there must be more than the mere assertion of a dispute or the mere making of a claim (per Lindgren J in Rohalo Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd v RP Scherer SpA &amp; Pharmagel SpA (1994) 15 ACSR 347 , (1994) 13 ACLC 94 at 352/30 354/15, esp at 353/20 25).

The dispute must have an objective existence the genuineness of which is capable of being assessed ( Rohalo 15 ACSR 347 , 13 ACLC 94 at 353/17 25). The test has been equated with the test as to whether the creditor would be entitled to summary judgment on the claim ( Rohalo 15 ACSR 347 , 13 ACLC 94 at 353/42 354/8).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1997/681.html</AustLII>
<text>In Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G &amp; M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 461 464 a Full Court of this Court discussed the relevant principles by reference to a number of the relevant authorities. At 464F G the Court said: 
 In our view a "genuine" dispute requires that: 
 the dispute be bona fide and truly exist in fact; the grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute are real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived.

In her Reasons for Judgment published on 12 February 2008, McCallum J recorded the following (at [12]): 
 Mr Watts does not dispute that there were defaults in the two loan agreements, nor that the penalty charges incurred as a consequence were calculated in accordance with the two loan agreements.

In this Court, Mr Watts did not take a different position. In particular, he made no submission to the effect that the various components making up the judgment debt of $1,028,725.29 had not been charged in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. His attack on the judgment was more fundamental. It was Mr Watts' submission that the penalty charges and fees levied against BMG by Adelaide Bank ought to be disregarded entirely, that the costs incurred by Adelaide Bank in selling the property ought to be disregarded entirely and that BMG should get the benefit of the higher purchase price (viz $1,075,000) apparently negotiated by Mr Watts with Mr Campbell. These views or submissions are reflected in the calculation which I allowed Mr Watts to advance by way of submission earlier this week.</text>

In the passages referred to, the Full Court held that a mortgagee is entitled to exercise the power of sale for its own benefit but must take reasonable steps to obtain a fair price which in turn will involve taking reasonable steps to ascertain the value before selling.</text>
