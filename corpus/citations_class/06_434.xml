<text>13 Various disputes arose in relation to the deed of settlement and the implementation arrangements contemplated by the deed which resulted in further controversy between the Applicant and the Respondents. In particular, controversy arose concerning the requirement contained in the deed of settlement of 4 August 2004 for Mr Rogers to sell the Toogoom property to ALCPL by, on or about 15 August 2004 with clear title. It seems that the title was subject to enforcement processes in respect of two writs, one issued by Dale &amp; Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd and the other by Mr Scott Petersen seeking the recovery of certain debts. ALCPL had discharged the first mortgage but could not secure clear title due to the writs of attachment. The second matter of controversy concerned arrangements in relation to the purchase by Mr Rogers of two further lots at Toogoom located within an estate called Fraser Waters Estate (Lots 41 and 127) and the arrangements between Mr Rogers, Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare concerning the payment of deposits for the purchase of those lots, the ultimate settlement of the purchase for each lot and the basis upon which the title would be held and by whom.

14 On 15 September 2004, a second deed of settlement was entered into between Mr Rogers, ALC, ALCPL, Mr Hare and Mrs Judith Hare which provided for certain loans to be made to Mr Rogers, the acquisition and on-sale of Lots 41 and 127 and the distribution of the ultimate net proceeds of sale of Lots 41 and 127 after the payment of identified outgoings with ultimately the net profit, so defined, to be distributed equally between Mr Rogers and Mr Hare. One of the outgoings to be discharged from the proceeds of sale of Lots 41 and 127 was the performance of an indemnity obligation assumed by Mr Rogers in favour of ALCPL concerning the discharge of the writs of attachment which Mr Rogers had either failed to discharge or had not been able to originally discharge.

15 Otherwise, the deed of 15 September 2004 preserved the operation of the deed of 4 August 2004.

23 On 23 February 2005, Deputy Registrar Baldwin made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Mr Rogers based upon a failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice founded upon a default judgment in favour of a creditor. An application for review of that order was filed on 25 February 2005 in the Federal Magistrates Court. On 15 March 2005, Federal Magistrate Baumann made an order staying the sequestration order pending the determination of the application for review. On 19 May 2005, Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissed the application for review and discharged the stay order of 15 March 2005. On 25 May 2005, Mr Rogers appealed to the Federal Court from the order of Federal Magistrate Baumann dismissing the application for review. Mr Rogers made a further application for a stay of the sequestration order pending the determination of the appeal. His Honour Justice Dowsett on 14 June 2005 dismissed the motion for a stay, ordered Mr Rogers to pay the costs of the motion and made directions in relation to the appeal: Rogers Trading as Living Space Building v Dale &amp; Meyers Timber Trade Centre Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 862. On 5 December 2005, His Honour Justice Dowsett heard and determined the appeal by Mr Rogers, dismissed the appeal and ordered Mr Rogers to pay the costs of the appeal: Rogers v Dale &amp; Meyers Timber Trading Centre Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1891.</text>

<tocase>Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL (1986) 185 CLR 123</tocase>
<text>37 Section 116(1)(b) characterises as property divisible amongst the creditors, "the capacity to exercise, and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in, over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his ... own benefit at the commencement of the bankruptcy or at any time after the commencement of the bankruptcy and before his ... discharge". The notion of property of the bankrupt within s5(1) of the Bankruptcy Act seems to have the same meaning for the purposes of both s58(1) and s 116 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act , consistent with the views of the majority in Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1986) 185 CLR 124 and Cirillo v Citicorp Australia Ltd [2004] SASC 293 at paragraphs [75] [79] per Perry, Bleby and Gray JJ.

38 Accordingly, all legal and beneficial interests of the bankrupt and all rights, capacities and powers exercisable by the bankrupt in relation to those interests vest in the trustee and are divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. The powers referred to in s116(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act are "powers 'which are familiar to all conveyancers and are powers properly so called' as Farwell J pointed out In Re Rose; Trustee of the Property of E T Rose v Rose . In other words, the powers referred to are authorities to dispose of property or interests in property for the benefit of the donee of the power or of some other person": Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL (supra), per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at page 133.</text>

<text>38 Accordingly, all legal and beneficial interests of the bankrupt and all rights, capacities and powers exercisable by the bankrupt in relation to those interests vest in the trustee and are divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. The powers referred to in s116(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act are "powers 'which are familiar to all conveyancers and are powers properly so called' as Farwell J pointed out In Re Rose; Trustee of the Property of E T Rose v Rose . In other words, the powers referred to are authorities to dispose of property or interests in property for the benefit of the donee of the power or of some other person": Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL (supra), per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at page 133.

44 As to the question of whether any of these claims either for final or interlocutory relief fall within the exemption of s116(2)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act thus entitling Mr Rogers to maintain a claim and more particularly a claim for an interlocutory injunction to restrain an exercise of a power of sale by a secured creditor in connection with the property at 13 or 15 Moreton Street, Toogoom, the position seems to be this. In Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales (1988) 79 ALR 591, Kirby P at page 601 made the following observation concerning the phrase "wrong[s] done to the bankrupt":
 
 "It is understandable that a person unversed in the principles of statutory construction and unaware of legal authority on the meaning of [the relevant phrase] should have taken the words 'wrong done to the bankrupt' in isolation and concluded as the claimant did about their meaning. However, the words cannot be taken in isolation. They must, in accordance with the ordinary cannons of construction, be read in the context in which they appear." 
 
 
 And at page 602,
 
 
 "The exemption [relating to proceedings concerning a wrong done to the bankrupt] is limited to those cases where it has been considered appropriate to sever the personal interests of the person subsequently made bankrupt from his property and to reserve to him the prosecution of and benefits derived from such litigation as not being legitimately entitlements of the creditors."</text>

<text>45 In Cox v Journeaux (No. 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 721, Sir Owen Dixon, explained the test to be applied to determine whether the character of the claim is one properly falling within the exemption. His Honour said this,
 
 "The plaintiff says that he himself is entitled to prosecute [the claim] under the proviso as an action for personal injury or wrong done to himself. The test appears to be whether the damages or part of them are to be estimated by immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his mind, body or character and without reference to his rights of property (Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd (1920) A.C. 102 at pp111 and 128 133)."</text>

<tocase>Faulkner v Bluett (1981) 52 FLR 115</tocase>
<text>46 Lockhart J, after considering a number of the early cases and the orthodox approach to a scope of the exemption based upon a wrong done to the bankrupt made this observation in Faulkner v Bluett (1981) 52 FLR 115 at 119:
 
 "The common thread running through these cases is that where the primary and substantial right of action is direct pecuniary loss to the property or estate of the bankrupt, the right to sue passes to the trustee notwithstanding that it may have produced personal inconvenience to the bankrupt. Where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt, the right to sue remains with the bankrupt."

47 Where the claim for final relief arising out of the conduct of a respondent reflects a claim with respect to both the rights of the bankrupt in property and a claim with respect to a wrong done to the bankrupt characterised as a claim by reference to the anxiety, stress and pain felt by the bankrupt, the rights of action in respect of the bankrupt's interests in property vest in the trustee and those rights of action where the essential cause is emotional injury done to the bankrupt (in respect of a recognised cause of action) remain with the bankrupt.

48 It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding, a claim might emerge which, in terms of its material facts, reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss52 , 51AC or 60 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee. At the moment, the material does not establish any such right. The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee.</text>

<tocase>Re Wakim; Ex Parte McNally &amp; Anor [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/27.html</AustLII>
<text>53 I am not prepared to accept the submission that no question of Federal jurisdiction arises in relation to that matter. If appropriate affidavit material or a properly formulated statement of claim raised a question of relief based upon Federal causes of action such as contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and a question arose justiciable at the suit of Mr Rogers (which presently seems unlikely) concerning compliance by the secured creditor with a State Act and that matter arose from a common substratum of fact giving rise to the Federal claims, the accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia would be enlivened: Re Wakim; Ex Parte McNally &amp; Anor [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at paragraphs [135] to [150].

54 The question of whether the secured creditor has complied with pre-conditions to the exercise of power of sale is a matter to be considered by the trustee. So too is the question of whether the secured creditor in publishing advertisements for the sale of the property has mis-described the property at Moreton Street, Toogoom as simply land rather than land upon which a house is built. Ultimately, to the extent that there may be a surplus after realisation of the securities, the trustee has an interest on behalf of the unsecured creditors in that surplus or the interests of the bankrupt in that surplus. Similarly, to the extent that Mr Rogers has an interest in the Fingal Head property, that interest is vested in the trustee and no doubt the trustee would take steps to determine whether an order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as entered properly reflects the order as made especially if giving effect to the order entered will prejudice the interests of the unsecured creditors. Mr Rogers contends that the order as made by His Honour based upon the notice of motion in the Supreme Court of New South Wales is not reflected in the terms of the order entered by the Respondents. Although Mr Rogers makes the assertion, the relevant material is not incorporated in the affidavit material. In any event, the issue is either one to be agitated by the trustee or a party who holds the interest affected by the conduct, which may be Mrs Lynne Rogers.

55 One further matter raised by the trustee concerns the precise status of the deed of settlement dated 8 September 2005. At the moment in time when Mr Rogers entered into that agreement he remained an undischarged bankrupt. His application for review had at that time been dismissed by Federal Magistrate Baumann, the Stay Order of 15 March 2005 had been discharged and Dowsett J had refused a further motion for a stay pending appeal. At 8 September 2005, when Mr Rogers entered into the deed of settlement, he had no standing to deal with any real or personal property of any description or any estate, interest or profit whether present or future, vested or contingent arising out of or incidental to any such real or personal property. Any rights and powers in relation to that property that would have been exercisable by Mr Rogers had he not become bankrupt, became, upon bankruptcy, property of the bankrupt divisible among the bankrupt's creditors and vested in the trustee.

56 It is not necessary for the present purposes to resolve the question of the status of the deed except to say that to the extent that Mr Rogers seeks to rely upon it as the source of rights, the status of the document further weakens a claim which is not otherwise established on the evidence or as a matter of law.

57 There are discretionary factors which influence whether an order for an interlocutory injunction might otherwise be made. In this case, because the Applicant is an undischarged bankrupt, the undertaking as to damages is essentially meaningless. Secondly, in order to restrain an exercise of a power of sale on the part of a secured creditor, an injunction order would not ordinarily be made unless the amount secured by the mortgage is paid into Court or, in a case where the amount owing is disputed, the undisputed portion of the debt is paid into Court. The Applicant for interlocutory relief is not in a position to make any payment into Court of the monies secured by the equitable charge.

58 For the above Reasons, I propose to dismiss the application for interlocutory relief.

59 I reserve the question of costs. I will seek to deal with those costs at the directions hearing on 4 May 2006. 
 I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.
