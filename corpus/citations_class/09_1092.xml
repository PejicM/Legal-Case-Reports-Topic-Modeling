<tocase>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396</tocase>
<text>The debate which had existed as to whether an applicant for interlocutory injunctive relief required to demonstrate a "prima facie" case, or a "serious question to be tried", a phrase, derived from the speech of Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 407 was resolved. These expressions may be used interchangeably so long as their meaning is understood. As their Honours said at [70]: 
 
 There is then no objection to the use of the phrase "serious question" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham .

In any event this application for an interlocutory injunction does not engage the adequacy of damages test set out in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 408. That test applies where the injunction is to restrain interference with a legal right of the plaintiff. The ABCC's application is made in the public interest of improving the building and construction industry under a statutory capacity to so apply. It is not in respect of any interference with any legal right of the ABCC. The legislature plainly conferred on the ABCC powers to obtain interlocutory injunctions, damages and penalties as instruments for effecting that improvement: ICI Operations [1992] FCA 474 ; 38 FCR 248 per French J at [268].

<text>This approach to justification is a useful, if imprecise, analogue for whether action taken in this case was "based on a reasonable concern" under s 36(1)(g)(i). Munro J in AMWU v Rheem Australia Pty Ltd (PR929970, AIRC, 9 April 2003) at [45] thought it to be so in respect to a predecessor provision namely s 124 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) .</text>

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Commission v O'Neil [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>The Court is required to make two main inquiries. The first is whether the applicant has made out a prima facie case in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the applicant will be held to be entitled to relief. The second is whether the inconvenience or injury to the applicant if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury the respondent would suffer if the injunction were granted: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 ; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57.

Gummow and Hayne JJ with whom Gleeson CJ and Crennan J agreed, in ABC v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; 227 CLR 57 at [65] explained the application of "prima facie case" as used in Beecham : 
 
 By using the phrase "prima facie case", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial.</text>

Their Honours then referred to what was said in Beecham at 622: 
 
 How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks.

<tocase>Cahill v Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1292.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 38 of the BCII Act covers acts by persons other than employees. In Cahill v Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 ; (2008) 170 FCR 357 at [49] - [57] , Kenny J held that the words "a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work" in paras (b) and (c) of the definition of "building industrial action" in the BCII Act covered the imposition of bans, limitations or restrictions by unions. Arguably s 38 extends to union officers in a case such as this. In any event the interlocutory injunction as against the CFMEU would, practically, be directed also at its employees, officers or agents.

Further or alternatively, Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan and the CFMEU, are amenable to interlocutory injunctive orders under s 49 of the BCII Act by reason of the accessorial liability provisions of s 48(2) if a prima facie case is demonstrated that each aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contraventions by employees; or in the case of Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan that they were also directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or a party to those contraventions.

It will be sufficient for present purposes in relation to Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan, as respondents, if in due course, I consider only the question of accessorial liability under s 48, which of course depends on primary liability, upon a prima facie basis, being established against the CFMEU.</text>

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/474.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 39(3) is in the same terms as s 80(4) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) said at 256-7: 
 
 Subsections (4) and (5) of s 80 are novel because they empower the court to grant injunctive relief notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage. Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief.
 . . .
 In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pts IV or V of the Act), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly. 
 . . .
 This does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant. For example, it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before or whether imminent substantial damage is likely: but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s 80. That is the effect of subss (4) and (5) (subs (4) in relation to the prevention of conduct and subs (5) in relation to a mandatory injunction). Their presence is not an indication of a new statutory house, rather an old house with some modern extensions. 
 

 
Gummow J at 267 came to essentially the same conclusion.
 Section 49 BCII Act

Section 49(1)(c) and (3) of the BCII Act empower the Court to grant injunctions (including interim injunctions) in relation to a person who has contravened a civil penalty provision. Subsection 49(6) defines an eligible person to make an application under s 49(1) and (3) to include the ABCC. Thus, s 49(1) and s 49(3)(a) empower this Court on the present application, to make an interim injunction in relation to a person who has contravened s 38.

This Court may grant injunctive relief under s 39 and its power to do so may, under s 39(3)(a), be exercised whether or not it appears that the respondents intend to engage again in the relevant conduct. The question of repetition is nonetheless of relevance to the exercise of the discretion, but the relevance is set in the particular context of public interest injunctions, as distinct from those related to private proprietary interests: ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 256/7 per Lockhart J; 267 per Gummow J; 268 per French J. The Court is inclined to grant an injunction in cases of statutory injunctions in the public interest where there has been unlawful conduct, in order to add contempt to the disincentives for repetition: per French J at 268 where his Honour said: 
 
 There is room ... for an injunction that is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court.

In this case, a prima facie case has been established of contraventions which have already occurred twice over a combined period of 4 days. Danger of damage "to any person"

On each of the days that industrial action occurred, the evidence is that the following persons suffered damage or were exposed to damage: 
 
 (a) 5, 6 and 8 June 2009 - Diploma, Commercial Tiling Services Pty Ltd, Action Interiors Pty Ltd, Firesafe Systems Pty Ltd, Planet Plumbing (WA) Pty Ltd, Triple M Mechanical Services WA Pty Ltd, Micos Curtain Wall Australia Pty Ltd, D &amp; Z Constructions, Ward Post Tensioning Pty Ltd, and Betta Bricklaying (WA) Pty Ltd. 
 

 
 
 (b) 24 June 2009 - Diploma, Micos Curtain Wall Australia Pty Ltd, D &amp; Z Construction, Ward Post Tensioning Pty Ltd, and Betta Bricklaying Pty Ltd. 
 

 
 
 (c) 25 June 2009 - Diploma, Traditional Scaffolders Pty Ltd, Micos Curtain Wall Australia Pty Ltd, D &amp; Z Construction, Ward Post Tensioning Pty Ltd, and Betta Bricklaying (WA) Pty Ltd.

There may well have been others including suppliers to the project such as concrete batchers and truck deliverers who may have suffered or been exposed to damage.

In any event this application for an interlocutory injunction does not engage the adequacy of damages test set out in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 408. That test applies where the injunction is to restrain interference with a legal right of the plaintiff. The ABCC's application is made in the public interest of improving the building and construction industry under a statutory capacity to so apply. It is not in respect of any interference with any legal right of the ABCC. The legislature plainly conferred on the ABCC powers to obtain interlocutory injunctions, damages and penalties as instruments for effecting that improvement: ICI Operations [1992] FCA 474 ; 38 FCR 248 per French J at [268].

<tocase>Labor Council of New South Wales v Axis Metal Roofing (2004) 131 IR 272</tocase>
<text>In Labor Council of New South Wales v Axis Metal Roofing (2004) 131 IR 272 , Vice President Justice Walton considered whether, under s 143(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), a strike was based on a reasonable concern for health and safety of employees. There was no requirement for the concern for health and safety to be an imminent risk. Nonetheless his Honour considered the concepts of "imminence", "seriousness", "proportionality" and "justification" which would be relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion: 
 
 (a) Whether it is a "reasonable" concern involves an objective assessment of the nature of that concern; 
 

 
 
 (b) A concern may be reasonable so long as it is not fanciful, illogical or irrational at the time the concern arises, without the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of whether a real risk does in fact exist; 
 

 
 
 (c) There is no need to establish that an actual risk existed at the time; 
 

 
 
 (d) The reasonableness must be assessed from the perspective of an ordinary and reasonable person in the position of the employees involved at the relevant time; 
 

 
 
 (e) The reasonable concern must continue during all times that the relevant industrial action is occurring; and 
 

 
 
 (f) Previous incidents, occurrences or beliefs may be relevant to a basis for a concern for health or safety in the circumstances.

Accordingly the issue is not whether certain matters did in fact constitute a risk to health or safety, but rather whether any employee reasonably held a concern about an imminent risk to their health or safety.

The applicant accepts, correctly in my view, that an employee may have a concern even though his or her concern arose only from something communicated by a union official. However, such a concern must still be objectively reasonable. It will not be reasonable merely because it was raised by a union official. Imminent</text>

<tocase>Leighton Contractors Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASC/2006/317.html</AustLII>
<text>The respondents point to the fact that they are not the employees in question and did not fail or refuse to attend for building work and are therefore not capable of engaging in building industrial action. They rely on Leighton Contractors Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at [26] .

It follows, they submit, that there is no cause of action against the respondents for engaging in building industrial action and, therefore, unlawful industrial action, in the manner alleged in paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of the Details of Claim in the application, and therefore no serious question to be tried in relation to those allegations.

The respondents further contend that the application does not contain any reference to the accessorial provisions found in s 48(2) which treats persons involved in a contravention of a civil penalty provision as having contravened the provision.

Le Miere J in Leighton Contractors Ltd 164 IR 375 at [26] correctly stated that a defendant who was not a relevant employee and who did not fail or refuse to attend for building work is not capable of engaging in building industrial action with the definition in s 36(1)(d). However, his Honour was not there considering accessorial liability under s 48(2). This case does not assist the respondents.</text>

<text>In Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd v Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union Of Australia (1987) 54 NTR 6 at 9, Nader J of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory outlined the following factors relevant to a determination of whether action taken by the respondent Union was justified. Ranger had sued for alleged economic torts. The union said its conduct was justified because its motivating purpose was the protection and promotion of the safety of the workers. His Honour outlined the following factors: 
 
 (a) How seriously did the situation threaten health and safety? 
 

 
 
 (b) What efforts had been made in the past by the workers (or others to their knowledge) to eliminate that risk? 
 

 
 
 (c) What response has the employer made to reduce the risk? 
 

 
 
 (d) Is the issue genuine or is it a pretext to further a less worthy objective?
