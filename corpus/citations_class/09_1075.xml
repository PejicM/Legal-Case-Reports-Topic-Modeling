<text>In circumstances which I have described in two previous judgments delivered by me ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , [2009] ATPR 42-274 and Allphones Retail Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 980) , on 29 August 2008, by Notice of Dispute dated that day ( the Notice of Dispute ), Allphones commenced a dispute resolution process with approximately ninety of its franchisees with whom it was then in dispute.</text>

<tocase>Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) ATPR 42-240</tocase>
<text>The Notice of Dispute expressly referred to proceedings NSD 408 of 2008 and to the Hoy Mobile proceedings which had been decided by Rares J in May 2008 (as to which see Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) ATPR 42-240). In the Notice of Dispute, Allphones also mentioned the prospect that the ACCC might bring proceedings against it pursuant to s 87(1B) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( the Act ). Those foreshadowed proceedings have now been commenced (NSD 869 of 2009). Allphones made quite clear in the Notice of Dispute that it was seeking to resolve all of the issues raised in all of the proceedings to which it made reference in that document.

In the Notice of Dispute, Allphones said that the dispute resolution process was being undertaken pursuant to cl 24 of its old Franchise Agreement and Pt 4 of the Franchising Code of Conduct. Allphones proposed a process of negotiation followed by a mediation, if necessary. At the end of cl 5 of the Notice of Dispute, Allphones said: 
 
 Allphones will invite the ACCC to participate in the mediation. If the ACCC chooses not to do so, Allphones will keep the ACCC informed of the progress of the mediation.

Allphones proposed that Mr Fitzgerald QC be appointed to act as the mediator should mediation be required.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/17.html</AustLII>
<text>In circumstances which I have described in two previous judgments delivered by me ( Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; (2009) 253 ALR 324 , [2009] ATPR 42-274 and Allphones Retail Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2009] FCA 980) , on 29 August 2008, by Notice of Dispute dated that day ( the Notice of Dispute ), Allphones commenced a dispute resolution process with approximately ninety of its franchisees with whom it was then in dispute.

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 17 ; 253 ALR 324 , [2009] ATPR 42-274, I dealt with an application for interlocutory injunctive relief made by the ACCC against Allphones in proceedings NSD 1567 of 2008. At [32] [58] of that judgment, I described certain events leading up to the service of the Notice of Dispute. That description was based upon the evidence before me for the purposes of the application with which I was then dealing and, to some extent, may be controversial. But, allowing for these limitations, the description which I gave in those paragraphs of that judgment is a useful starting point for placing the Notice of Dispute into an appropriate context. Accordingly, I incorporate those paragraphs into these Reasons in order to provide some detail of the context in which the Notice of Dispute came to be issued.

The Notice of Dispute was issued pursuant to the Franchising Code of Conduct and the contractual arrangements then in existence between Allphones and the franchisees upon whom it was served ( the eligible franchisees ). It was served upon all of Allphones existing franchisees who were not operating under its new Franchise Agreement or who had not released Allphones from past breaches of its old Franchise Agreement. The sending of the Notice of Dispute commenced a dispute resolution process in accordance with the provisions of the Franchising Code of Conduct and the contractual arrangements between Allphones and the eligible franchisees. The dispute resolution process commenced in this fashion was, if necessary, intended to culminate in a mediation.

In the Notice of Dispute, Allphones raised ten issues to be addressed by negotiation and mediation with the eligible franchisees. The main issues may be conveniently grouped into four broad categories:</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/185.html</AustLII>
<text>In the present case, Allphones put in train a formal dispute resolution process which involved negotiations with its disaffected franchisees and, if necessary, a formal mediation. In order to make that process worthwhile, at the time when the process commenced (viz on 29 August 2008), Allphones promised that it would provide relevant financial information to those parties with whom it was in dispute in order to facilitate those negotiations and that mediation. It was quite prepared to obtain and to provide to its franchisees an investigating accountant's report in respect of all of the critical matters in dispute. This was contemplated in the Notice of Dispute itself which, of course, was created and served approximately five or six weeks before the undertakings were given to the Court on 9 October 2008. A fair appreciation of the relevant events is that the two BDO reports were always intended to be part of the dispute resolution process and that Allphones had probably always intended to use them in support of contentions which it would make in the various Statements of Position served by it as to the quantum of the levies, charges, fines, bonuses, rebates and other payments in dispute. At common law, documents produced for the purposes of such negotiations attracted without prejudice privilege (see Rabin v Mendoza &amp; Co [1954] 1 All ER 247, [1954] 1 WLR 271 ; and Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 185 at [14] [16]).</text>

<text>These statements were referrable to the common law position. That position may have been extended by s 131 of the Evidence Act although there is a difference of opinion on this question emerging in the authorities. In this Court, in Brown v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 119 FCR 269 at [99], a Full Court expressed the tentative view that the expression "... in connection with an attempt to negotiate the settlement of a dispute ", as it appears in s 131 , appears to extend the scope of the common law privilege.</text>

<tocase>CJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd v Tarnap Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 173</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2006/173.html</AustLII>
<text>The views expressed by Jacobson J are in line with those of Campbell J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In CJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd v Tarnap Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 173 , his Honour said (at [5] [7]): It will be apparent that the letter alludes to there being settlement discussions on foot, but gives no detail of those settlement discussions, and, most importantly, does not involve the writer of the letter either making an admission on behalf of his client concerning the matter of the settlement discussion, or attributing any admission to the recipient of the letter. While the letter alludes to it having been the addressee of the letter who had " indicated the possibility of a global resolution to all outstanding matters ", I do not see that as involving any admission it is possible for a person to want to resolve a dispute which he or she regards as totally unmeritorious. The letter is one which one would not be within the rationale of the common law concerning legal professional privilege. That rationale is that people should be free to explore settlement of disputes, and make admissions in the course of those discussions, safe in the knowledge that any admissions which they make will not be tendered against them later in Court, if the negotiations break down. The wording of section 131(1) is capable, on one reading of the expression " in connection with ", of extending wider than did the common law. There is, in one sense of it, a connection between this letter and the settlement negotiations, because the letter talks about the settlement negotiations. However, the expression " in connection with ", while sometimes capable of referring to a connection of any kind between two subject matters, does not always have that reference: cf Wonall Pty Ltd v Clarence Property Corporation Ltd [2003] NSWSC 497 ; [2003] 58 NSWLR 23 at 44-45. It is necessary to look to the context in which the expression occurs to determine its particular meaning, in that particular context. In the particular context of section 131 , it seems to me that the expression "in connection with" does not extend to any connection of any kind whatever. Rather, the expression needs to be construed by reference to the purpose of the without prejudice privilege. I see no basis for concluding that the rationale of the without prejudice privilege under section 131 of the Evidence Act is any different to the common law. There are some exceptions to the privilege, in section 131(2) , which go wider than the exceptions to the privilege at common law, but I see no basis for concluding that the fundamental prohibition contained in section 131(1) has any different rationale to the common law on the topics.

The ACCC did not suggest that it could invoke any of the exceptions to the operation of s 131(1) specified in s 131(2).

The ACCC's sole submission was that the copy of the first BDO report furnished to it on 26 September 2008 was not protected by s 131(1) because it was provided for mixed purposes, one of which was for use in the litigation between the ACCC and Allphones in this Court. This submission ignores the terms of the Phillips Fox letters of 17 and 26 September 2008 and the terms of the Notice of Dispute itself. In the first of those letters, Phillips Fox deferred any commitment to the proposition that the report could be used for the purposes of that litigation. In the second of those letters, Phillips Fox made quite clear that it was not prepared to accede to the request made by Corrs that Allphones agree that the report be able to be admitted into evidence in the litigation in this Court. It restricted the use to the dispute resolution process then under way and requested that the documents be treated as " confidential and without prejudice ".

In CJ Redman Constructions Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 173 , Campbell J focussed particularly on the rationale for the without prejudice privilege at common law, namely, that people should be free to explore the settlement of disputes and to make admissions in the course of those discussions, safe in the knowledge that any admissions which they make will not be tendered against them later in Court, if the negotiations break down.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1997/3.html</AustLII>
<text>Further, even if the reasoning in Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 could sensibly be applied to documents protected by without prejudice privilege (which I doubt), I do not think it would assist the ACCC in the present case.

The ACCC had a legitimate interest in the Allphones disputes with its franchisees as the relevant regulatory authority under the Act and for the purposes of the Franchising Code of Conduct. Allphones sought to involve the ACCC in those capacities in the dispute resolution process instigated by Allphones. In fact, the ACCC was keeping a close eye on that process. The disaffected franchisees were probably looking to the ACCC for protection. Given the promptness with which the ACCC raised its concerns about Allphones' conduct in relation to that dispute resolution process, I infer that, in the period from early September 2008 to at least January 2009, officers of the ACCC and/or its lawyers were in regular contact with franchisees and their legal representatives about the negotiations and foreshadowed mediation instigated by the Notice of Dispute.

The copy of the first BDO report sent to Corrs on 26 September 2008 was sent in connection with Allphones' dispute with the eligible franchisees. It cannot be tendered in evidence because s 131(1) forbids its tender.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1957/92.html</AustLII>
<text>In Field v Commissioner for Railways for NSW [1957] HCA 92 ; (1957) 99 CLR 285 , Dixon CJ, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ, in a joint judgment, said (at 291 292) 
 
 The law relating to communications without prejudice is of course familiar. As a matter of policy the law has long excluded from evidence admissions by words or conduct made by parties in the course of negotiations to settle litigation. The purpose is to enable parties engaged in an attempt to compromise litigation to communicate with one another freely and without the embarrassment which the liability of their communications to be put in evidence subsequently might impose upon them. The law relieves them of this embarrassment so that their negotiations to avoid litigation or to settle it may go on unhampered. This form of privilege, however, is directed against the admission in evidence of express or implied admissions. It covers admissions by words or conduct. For example, neither party can use the readiness of the other to negotiate as an implied admission. It is not concerned with objective facts which may be ascertained during the course of negotiations. These may be proved by direct evidence. But it is concerned with the use of the negotiations or what is said in the course of them as evidence by way of admission. For some centuries almost it has been recognised that parties may properly give definition to the occasions when they are communicating in this manner by the use of the words "without prejudice" and to some extent the area of protection may be enlarged by the tacit acceptance by one side of the use by the other side of these words: see Thomas v. Austen [(1823) 1 LJ (OS) KB 99]; Kurtz &amp; Co. v. Spence &amp; Sons [(1888) 58 LT 438 , at p 441]; Paddock v. Forrester [(1842) [1842] EngR 146 ; 3 Man &amp; G 903 at p 919; [1842] EngR 146 ; 133 ER 1404 at p 1411]; Hoghton v. Hoghton [(1852) [1852] EngR 446 ; 15 Beav 278 at pp 314, 315; [1852] EngR 446 ; 51 ER 545 at p 559]; In re River Steamer Co.; Mitchell's Claim [(1871) LR 6 Ch App 822 at pp 831, 832]; Walker v. Wilsher [(1889) 23 QBD 335 at pp 337, 338]. Needless to say, the privilege is a matter to be raised by objection to the admissibility of the evidence. For the purpose of deciding such an objection the judge may take evidence on the voir dire .

The Justices who delivered the joint judgment went on to hold that the question of whether the privilege attaches depends upon whether the communication formed part of the negotiations for the settlement of the action or was reasonably incidental to those negotiations ( Field 99 CLR at 292).

In Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 3) [2008] FCA 701 ; (2008) 247 ALR 781 , Jacobson J said (at [72] [74]): 
 
 Communications made "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement" 
 
 The statutory requirement that the communication be "in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement" reflects the language used by the High Court in Field : at 293. There, Dixon CJ, Webb, Kitto and Taylor JJ contemplated that the privilege extends to cover communications that are reasonably incidental to negotiations. The effect of the authorities at common law is that the privilege applies to offers to negotiate and expressions of willingness to do so; it is not necessary that there be an offer capable of acceptance: Arnotts at 72 3. The same position applies under the Evidence Act . It is sufficient that the communication can be described as an "opening shot" in negotiations: GPI Leisure Corporation Ltd v Yuill (1997) 42 NSWLR 225 at 226.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/933.html</AustLII>
<text>The original of the first BDO report is presumably in the possession of Allphones. The original may be a business record of Allphones or, perhaps, of BDO, although I doubt that this is so. For reasons which I will explain, I do not need to decide this point for present purposes (see Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 933 ; (2003) 130 FCR 569 at [9] [21] (pp 571-573) for a discussion of some of the relevant issues).

In my view, the original of the report is not admissible in evidence because the ACCC is prevented from seeking to tender it by s 131(1) of the Evidence Act .

Section 131(1) of the Evidence Act is in the following terms: 
 
 131 Exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations 
 (1) Evidence is not to be adduced of: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute; or
 (b) a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute.</text>
