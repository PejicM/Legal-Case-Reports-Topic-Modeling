<tocase>Sabre Corp Pty Ltd v Russ Calvin's Hair Care Co (1993) 46 FCR 428</tocase>
<text>Specifically, the orders sought are as follows: 
 
 (a) Paragraph 4 seeks an order 'pursuant to Order 15A rule 8 of the Federal Court Rules or otherwise , that the Russian Federation provide discovery' of documents within listed categories in the schedule to the amended notice or as otherwise ordered by the Court;
 (b) paragraph 5 seeks an order, in the nature of a Sabre order ( Sabre Corp Pty Ltd v Russ Calvin's Hair Care Co (1993) 46 FCR 428), requiring FKP and FGUP to take steps to obtain such documents in the possession, custody or control of the Russian Federation, and par 6 seeks an order for the provision of such documents to Spirits together with verifying affidavits;
 (c) paragraph 6A seeks an order that the amended notice of motion be stood over for consideration, if necessary, of a stay of the cross-claim in the event of non-compliance with any order in terms of par 4 or pars 5 and 6.

The 'otherwise' alternative basis to O 15A r 8 of the Federal Court Rules of the order sought in [2(a)] above, is that the Russian Federation is the 'true' or 'real' applicant/plaintiff on the cross-claim, not FKP and FGUP, which are but 'nominal' applicants/plaintiffs.

It is not in dispute that FKP and FGUP are Russian State-owned enterprises; that they are separate legal entities which are distinct from the Russian Federation. FKP is a 'federal treasury enterprise', being a commercial organisation which holds property settled on it by the Russian Federation 'by right of operational management'. FGUP is a 'federal State unitary enterprise', being a commercial organisation which holds property settled on it by the Russian Federation 'by right of economic management'. In her affidavit Ms Mozgonenko confirms the foregoing (at [11] and [12]) and explains what is meant by the terms 'by right of operational management' and 'by right of economic management' (at [13] [19]) and Mr Tsyplakov, in his affidavit, confirms that he 'substantially agrees' with Ms Mozgonenko on all these matters (at [23]).

On the conclusion I have reached, it is not necessary that I deal with the motion insofar as it seeks an order in terms of par 5 of the amended notice a Sabre order requiring FKP and FGUP to take steps to obtain the documents, within the listed categories or as otherwise ordered by the Court, in the possession, custody or control of the Russian Federation, and an order in terms of par 6 thereof for the provision of such documents to Spirits together with verifying affidavits. Nevertheless, again in deference to the submissions that were made, I should indicate why, had it been necessary to consider this aspect of the motion, I would have been minded to dismiss it.

First, there must be a real likelihood that the party, in this case FKP and FGUP, who is to take steps to obtain access to and discover the documents which are in the possession, power or control of a third party, would be given access to the documents upon request: See Sabre at 432 433. This likelihood must be established by evidence: Gambro at [8], [17] [19]. In the present case, Spirits has made no attempt to establish this. There is nothing in the evidence from which the inference could be drawn that any documents within the very broad categories requested by Spirits would be provided by the Russian Federation or its ministries, agencies and instrumentalities.</text>

<text>After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion, not without some hesitation, that the Russian Federation is the 'real,' applicant/plaintiff in the cross-claim because the claims made therein are brought and made on behalf of the Russian Federation by FKP and FGUP, and not in their own right: see Willis &amp; Co v Baddeley [1892] 2 QB 324; Abu Dhabi National Tanker Co v Product Star Shipping Ltd [1992] 2 All E.R. 20, [1991] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 508, cf James Nelson &amp; Sons Ltd v Nelson Line (Liverpool) Ltd [1906] 2 KB 217.</text>

<text>As I have indicated at [2(a)], Spirits seeks an order for discovery 'pursuant to O 15A r 8 or otherwise '. I do not regard this alternative basis as, in substance and effect, a request for third party discovery pursuant to O 15A r 8 of the Federal Court Rules . It is a totally discrete basis founded on s 23 of the Federal Court Act ; wide enough to cover orders requiring the discovery, production and inspection of documents: Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 per Black CJ, Gummow and French JJ; see also Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 581 ; at the same time, accepting that the Court has a general power under s 23 to prevent the abuse or frustration of its processes in relation to matters coming within its jurisdiction ( Hunter v Leahy [1999] FCA 1075 ; (1999) 91 FCR 214) or where it is otherwise necessary to protect the integrity of the processes of the Court: CSR Ltd v CIGNA Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 at 391 392; Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/391.html</AustLII>
<text>FKP and FGUP submitted that an order for third party discovery ought not to be granted against a foreign entity which is not a party to the proceeding and is not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Court. They point out that there is ample authority in the context of applications for leave to serve subpoenas outside the jurisdiction for the proposition that such leave should not be granted in respect of a non-party foreign entity 'except in the most exceptional circumstances': Stemcor (Australasia) Pty Ltd v Oceanwave Line SA [2004] FCA 391 at [12] per Allsop J. See also Arhill Pty Ltd v General Percival Company (1991) 23 NSWLR 454; Aetna Pacific Securities v Hong Kong Bank of Australia Ltd (20 April 1993, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Giles J, unreported). The cases suggest, they submit, that this will particularly be the case where (as here) the foreign jurisdiction in question is a civil law jurisdiction: Arhill .

Underlying this principle is the view that service of an order upon a foreign entity demanding that it do something in Australia on pain of punishment in proceedings to which it has not submitted is an invasion of the foreign territory's sovereignty: Stemcor . In addition, such a subpoena, even if it is served, is not capable of enforcement: Stemcor . The position, they submit, is no different in principle in the case of an order for third party discovery pursuant to O 15A r 8; the order compels production of documents, disobedience of it would give rise to contempt, and leave is required in order to serve it outside the jurisdiction: See O 8 r 3. Compare Arhill . None of the cases included in Spirits' list of authorities, they observe, involved the making of an order for third party discovery against a foreign entity.</text>
