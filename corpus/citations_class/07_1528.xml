<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344</tocase>
<text>94 Paragraphs 18 to 20, dealing with the exercise of the discretion, under the general heading "Ruling" stated, inter alia: 
 
 18. In exercising the discretion under subsection 80G(6A) (paragraph 170-50(2)(d)), the Commissioner is guided by administrative law principles. These include an obligation to identify and consider all factors that may be relevant to the exercise of the discretion and to give them an appropriate weighting. In determining the relevant factors and their weighting, the Commissioner has regard to the policy of section 80G (Subdivision 170-A) and its context within the Act. Although each case must be decided on its merits, this Ruling provides a guide to taxpayers and ATO officers as to what factors may be relevant in the exercise of the discretion.
 
 19. In cases where there has been delay on the part of the relevant companies in effecting an agreement, the principles outlined in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Minister for Home Affairs and Environment ... (1984) 3 FCR 344 ... and subsequent supporting authorities in respect of statutory discretions to extend time, is relevant to the subsection 80G(6A) (paragraph 170-50(2)(d)) discretion. Following Hunter Valley Developments, the statutory time limit is not to be ignored and, prima facie, agreements must be made within time. Therefore, the onus is on the taxpayer to demonstrate to the Commissioner that the case is an appropriate one for the favourable exercise of the discretion. This generally requires the taxpayer to provide an adequate explanation for the delay. 
 
 20. In cases where an agreement is sought to be made out of time as a result of an adjustment to the tax position of the company group by the Commissioner, a relevant factor is the conduct giving rise to the adjustment. For example, where there is fraud or evasion, or a scheme to which Part IVA of the Act applies, this factor weighs heavily against a favourable exercise of the discretion. Conversely, where an adjustment stems from conduct which could not be regarded as culpable, this factor would be weighted in favour of the extension of time being granted.

96 Paragraphs 85 through to 90 dealt with non-compliance with the time limit caused by delay of the taxpayer. Paragraph 85 provided: 
 
 This category encompasses cases where no agreement has been made prior to the date of lodgment of the income company's return or, where an agreement has been made, the group subsequently discovers, for example: 
 
 
 
 (i) there are further losses within the group available for transfer to the income company; or 
 
 (ii) the income company has additional income against which unused losses within the group can be offset. 
 
 

The relevant principles applied were those in Hunter Valley Developments v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344: 
 
 
 86. In these cases, the Commissioner considers that the principles outlined by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments in respect of statutory discretions to extend time are relevant to the subsection 80G(6A) (paragraph 170-50(2)(d)) discretion, although the case was decided in the context of a different statutory provision. 
 
 87. The Commissioner also considers these general principles need to be balanced with a consideration of the underlying policy of section 80G (Subdivision 170-A) (to broadly align the treatment of company groups with divisional companies) and the wider consideration of the proper administration of the Act. 
 
 88. In Hunter Valley Developments, Wilcox J stated that statutory time limits are not to be ignored and the onus is on the applicant to convince the decision-maker that the case is an appropriate one for a favourable exercise of the discretion. This would generally require the taxpayer to provide an acceptable explanation of the delay. 
 
 89. The length of the delay in making an agreement after the prescribed time is relevant to the exercise of the discretion. Generally, the longer the delay, the greater the onus is upon the applicant to demonstrate an acceptable explanation for the delay (see Stergis and Ors v Boucher and Anor (1989) 86 ALR 174; ... Also, it should not be assumed that the Commissioner will automatically exercise this discretion in circumstances where the request is lodged within the objection period relating to assessments. 
 
 90. The Commissioner will weigh the explanation of delay with the other relevant factors referred to in Hunter Valley Developments (for example, public interest considerations and the question of prejudice to either party arising from the exercise or non-exercise of the discretion).

112 The principles enunciated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 were said by the Commissioner in Taxation Ruling TR 98/12 to be relevant to the exercise of the statutory discretion under subs 80G(6A) of the ITAA 1936. The Ruling also stated that these general principles need to be balanced with a consideration of the underlying policy of s 80G which was identified as broadly aligning the treatment of company groups with divisional companies.

113 Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 concerned the circumstances in which an extension of time would be allowed for bringing an application for an order of review of an administrative decision under s 11 of the ADJR Act. Wilcox J outlined a number of positions emerging from the authorities which he suggested could guide, albeit not in any exhaustive manner, the exercise of the Court's discretion. In summary form (omitting authorities) they were as follows: 
 
 1. Although the section does not, in terms, place any onus of proof upon an applicant for extension an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown but the Court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied that it is proper so to do. The "prescribed period" of 28 days is not to be ignored. Indeed it is the prima facie rule that proceedings commenced outside that period will not be entertained. It is a precondition to the exercise of discretion in his favour that the applicant for extension show "an acceptable explanation of the delay" and that it is "fair and equitable in the circumstances" to extend time.
 2. Action taken by the applicant, other than by making an application for review under the Act, is relevant to the consideration of the question whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished. A distinction is to be made between the case of a person who, by non-curial means, has continued to make the decision-maker aware that he contests the finality of the decision (who has not "rested on his rights") and a case where the decision-maker was allowed to believe that the matter was finally concluded. The reasons for this distinction are not only "... for finality in disputes" but also the "fading from memory" problem. 
 3. Any prejudice to the respondent including any prejudice in defending the proceedings occasioned by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. 
 4. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. In this context, public considerations often intrude. A delay which may result, if the application is successful, in the unsettling of other people or of established practices is likely to prove fatal to the application. 
 5. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time can be granted. 
 6. Considerations of fairness as between the applicants and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of exercise of the Court's discretion.

133 In [28] the submission considered what it called "errors of the decision-maker by reference first to the six general principles referred to by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley ". In [29] to [30] it dealt with the subject of delay and in [31] to [39] the imposition of GIC and the alleged culpable behaviour of Development Finance. Paragraphs 40 to 46 dealt with the Asiamet [2004] FCAFC 73 ; 137 FCR 146 decision. Paragraph 47 asserted under the heading "No limitation" that the Commissioner erred in stating that there was nothing in the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 80G which would imply any limitation upon his ability to consider the conduct of a company group giving rise to an adjustment as being a relevant factor to the exercise of the discretion. The final heading "Additional or collateral penalty" complained that the Commissioner erred in treating the refusal of the discretion as reflecting a need to penalise to a greater extent taxpayers involved in serious non-compliance activities.</text>

<tocase>Bellinz v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 84 FCR 154</tocase>
<text>102 Part IVAAA was considered by the Full Court in Bellinz v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 84 FCR 154. The Court drew the following conclusions from the legislative scheme of Pt IVAAA: 
 
 
 1. ... the issue of a public ruling is to be made in accordance with the Act as interpreted by the Commissioner and not in accordance with some practice which the Commissioner may have adopted, to the extent that that is inconsistent with the Assessment Act. What is to be ruled upon is the way in which, inter alia, the Act under which the extent of a liability for income tax of the appellants is to be worked out would apply.
 
 2. A public ruling which is inconsistent with a prior public ruling may be made if the Commissioner decides that the law is otherwise than as stated in the initial public ruling. However the new ruling will not operate retrospectively in respect of arrangements commenced or brought into operation prior to the earlier ruling. 
 
 3. A public ruling which is inconsistent with a prior private ruling may be made if the Commissioner determines that the initial private ruling was wrong. In that case the initial private ruling will be taken to have been withdrawn: ...
 
 4. The binding quality which the legislation gives to a public ruling applies to the tax consequences of the arrangement or class of arrangements to which the ruling relates, and not, ..., to the underlying philosophy behind the ruling. That this is so follows inexorably from the language of s 14ZAAE ...
 
 

The Court was also of the view that Pt IVAAA left no room for the operation of any doctrine of estoppel or the reintroduction of that doctrine through administrative law remedies. Their Honours said (at 169):
 
 
 The public ruling operates as if it is the statutory basis upon which tax is to be levied. No question arises as to whether it is or is not relied upon. 
 

I take that last statement not to be a statement that a public ruling has statutory force. Rather, it reflects a commitment on the part of the Commissioner to a particular approach to the law in those cases to which it applies. That commitment will necessarily be qualified by the extent to which the ruling itself embodies qualifications and conditions in its own terms.</text>

<tocase>Brown v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 118</tocase>
<text>114 Those principles were related to applications for extensions of time to commence judicial review proceedings under the ADJR Act. That kind of discretion differs in purpose and character from the discretion presently under review. As Hill J observed in Brown v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 118, Wilcox J did not say that he was laying down principles of universal application or even covering all applications to commence proceedings for judicial review outside the time prescribed by the ADJR Act. Brown 42 ATR 118 was a case in which a taxpayer had sought from the Commissioner an extension of time for filing an objection against an income tax assessment. An objection to an assessment was quite different from an application for judicial review which would proceed on quite limited grounds. Hill J discussed the nature of the objection process (at 127): 
 
 It is the first step in a process whereby the assessment may be reconsidered by the Commissioner in the light of the objection and if disallowed may be the subject of merits review by an independent tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, or by the court, (although before the court matters involving the exercise of discretion are the subject of judicial rather than merits, review). If the disallowance of the objection is reviewed by the tribunal and a decision adverse to the taxpayer is arrived at there is the possibility of an application to this court by way of an appeal on a question of law.

115 Hill J said that it had been in the past a "reproach to the law" that a taxpayer could be refused independent review of a meritorious objection even in circumstances where the failure to object may not have been his or her fault. While the explanation for delay in lodging an objection would be an important factor, the decision-maker was required to take into account all the circumstances of the particular case against the background that parliament had enacted a procedure to permit extensions of time being granted. Extensions should be granted where the justice of the case required. They should not be reserved for exceptional cases.

116 The emphasis on general considerations of injustice and the need for a balancing process continued in his Honour's judgment at 132, where he said: 
 
 What is required is the balancing of the delay; the explanation for it; the circumstances which gave rise to it and such prejudice if any as may be shown to exist to the Commissioner against the prejudice which may arise to a taxpayer who has by reason of the failure to object in time lost the right to a review of the assessment. In this balancing process the Commissioner or the Tribunal on a review will be guided by what the justice of the case requires. The balancing process should be approached on the basis that while Parliament has stipulated a time in which objections are required to be lodged it has entrusted to the Commissioner a power to extend that time in appropriate circumstances. The decision maker should not lose sight of the fact that s 14ZW is an ameliorating provision designed to avoid injustice.

117 The Full Court in Zizza v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 371 said it would be an error to regard the summary in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 as complete or to treat each of the six principles it contained as necessarily applicable to any particular application for extension of time especially an application under different legislation. The Court agreed with the observations to that effect made by Hill J in Brown 42 ATR 118 (at 376).

125 In any case in which a discretion to extend time is involved the decision-maker must be satisfied that there is a proper basis for it. But there is no basis in the statute for suggesting that the Commissioner should regard the extension of time for an agreement to transfer losses as exceptional. The time limit is a procedural protection of the administrative process. There is no windfall to a taxpayer who is given an extension. The taxpayer is given no more than what would have been its due had the agreement been made within time. The approach undertaken by Hill J in Brown 42 ATR 118 to extensions of time for the lodgment of objections applies also, if not with greater force, to the discretion to extend time to make agreements to transfer losses. This proposition was not reflected explicitly in Taxation Ruling TR 98/12. Indeed the reliance placed in the ruling upon Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 was somewhat at odds with that approach. That is not to say that the policy is therefore unlawful. It did not treat the Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 principles as exhaustive or determinative. The focus therefore must not be so much upon the content of the policy but the way in which it was applied and the discretion exercised in this case.

126 By [35] of the application, DRI and Development Finance alleged that the respondents had a duty, in exercising the power under s 170-50(2)(d) of the ITAA 1997 "to act fairly and in accordance with reasonable public standards". The respondents admitted in their defence a duty to act fairly and reasonably. They submitted in argument that they did so act.

127 DRI and Development Finance did not allege any breach of a free standing statutory duty to act fairly and in accordance with reasonable public standards. The source and content of that duty was not described. No statement of such a duty is to be found in the relevant part of the statute. There was no allegation in the grounds of a breach by the respondents of procedural fairness. The unfairness which was alleged went to the substance of the decision and, together with questions of reasonableness, (not "reasonable public standards") was raised in the following ways in the grounds of review: 
 
 1. In support of the allegation of a failure to take into account relevant considerations which included: 
 
 36(a)(xxiii) the justice of the case and the unfairness to the applicants, their parent company and its shareholders if the losses of BHPBDRI are not able to be used to be offset against taxable income of BHPDF. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 36(a)(xxvii) that the time within which loss transfer agreements were to be made was regulatory and could cause grave injustice if the discretion to extend time was not applied fairly. 
 
 
 2. In support of the allegation that the Commissioner's power was exercised for a purpose other than that for which it was conferred it was said in the particulars to [36(c)]: 
 
 
 In the circumstances of this case, the decision is so unreasonable and unfair that such a purpose should be inferred. 
 
 
 
 3. In the allegation in [36(e)] that the first respondent's exercise of the power resulted in unfairness amounting to an abuse of power. This allegation was also relied upon as a particular of the claim that the first respondent's exercise of the power was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have so exercised it.

128 Having regard to the way in which the application is framed, the alleged duty to act fairly and in accordance with reasonable public standards does not support any identifiable ground of review. No direct breach of such a duty is alleged. It is questionable whether any such "duty" is to be implied into the discretion. The discretion involves the exercise of a statutory power. Its limits are defined, inter alia, by the purposes for which it can be exercised, factors which may be relevant or irrelevant to its exercise and the way in which such a decision should be made including requirements of procedural fairness. There is probably a duty to decide whether to exercise the discretion which may be enforced by mandamus if the Commissioner or his delegate simply failed to respond to a request for an extension of time. Given the way in which the balance of the application was framed, the existence of the duty alleged in [35] and whether it was breached does not fall for decision.

129 The way in which the applicants' submissions were structured did not bear a precise correlation with the grounds in their application. The written submissions began with a survey of the facts: [1] to [12]. This was followed by an outline of the legislation: [13] to [17]. The point was there made that the origin of the requirement to enter into an agreement to transfer losses was procedural only. The change made to s 80G in 1992 did not convert the procedural requirement into something more substantive. The change from giving a notice to making an agreement reflected the introduction of the self-assessment regime and no more. Then it was said that the 1936 and 1997 Acts drew a distinction between procedural steps which the Commissioner or a taxpayer must undertake and the rules which affect substantive liability to tax. The rules in s 170-50 which affect substantive liability to tax include statutory conditions for a valid transfer which were said to achieve the result of broadly aligning "the treatment of company groups with divisional companies".</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Asiamet (No 1) Resources Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 73 ; (2004) 137 FCR 146</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/73.html</AustLII>
<text>119 In Ross Palmer Holdings v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 805, which was concerned with the exercise of the discretion under s 80G(6A) of the ITAA 1936, Spender J identified the purpose of the loss transfer provisions (at 816-817): 
 
 ... to permit and facilitate the transfer of losses within a group of companies so that there is no difference in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as against a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. 
 

The purpose of the provisions was also considered by the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Asiamet (No 1) Resources Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 73 ; (2004) 137 FCR 146 in the judgment of Allsop J (Ryan and Finkelstein JJ agreeing). In rejecting, as overstated, the proposition that their statutory purpose was to allow for the transfer of losses within a group so as to equate the tax treatment of a group to that of a company with divisions, his Honour said (at [141]):
 
 
 That, with respect, overstates the purpose of s 80G. Section 80G is intended to be beneficial to the taxpayer: Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2001] FCA 761 ; (2001) 109 FCR 405 at [18] . There is not, however, a complete equation with the single company. Conditions apply to the transfer of losses, one of which is that the agreement must be made before the date of lodgment of the return of income or the income company, or later as the Commissioner allows. The legislative history of s 80G, and in particular the content of the Asprey Committee Report and the Campbell Committee Report , reveals that a choice was made by Parliament not to adopt the group assessment procedure which might be seen as a complete equation of subsidiaries with divisions. 
 

His Honour accepted the statement of the policy of the section as set out in the Commissioner's Taxation Ruling, TR 98/12 saying (at [142]): 
 
 
 There is, undoubtedly, a beneficial policy underlying s 80G as described at [87] of the ruling: broadly to align the treatment of company groups with divisional companies. That is not to deny, however, that a broad, otherwise expressly unconfined discretion, is reposed in the Commissioner in s 80G(6A)(b). Naturally, the discretion is to be confined by reference to the subject matter, scope and purposes of the provisions and the ITAA as a whole.

123 The legal character of Taxation Rulings as administrative policies was assumed in Asiamet [2004] FCAFC 73 ; 137 FCR 146 when Allsop J rejected the view that it was not open to the Commissioner to adopt a policy in terms of Taxation Ruling TR 98/12. He pointed out that the terms of the Ruling displayed a recognition of the need to make each decision on its merits, a recognition of the purpose and policy of s 80G and a recognition of the important object of the ITAA found in PT IVA. Relevantly for present purposes, he observed (at [143]):
 
 The real issue is whether the Commissioner can promulgate and apply a policy for guidance which identifies as a factor which generally weighs heavily against the exercise of the discretion the fact that the adjustment flows from the application of Pt IVA, though still recognising the need to make each decision on the merits of the particular case. To posit such a policy does not negate the evident beneficial purpose of s 80G, it merely sets up an available countervailing factor of weight, drawn from another important part of the ITAA. To do so does not subvert s 80G, nor does it preclude the decision-maker from taking into account any factor required by the legislation, nor does it require the decision-maker to take into account any factor required by the legislation not to be taken into account, nor does it preclude the decision-maker dealing with any decision on the merits.

124 His Honour also rejected the contention that to disallow an extension substantially on the basis of the application of Pt IVA was to give an impermissibly extended operation to Pt IVA and to increase the penalty beyond that contemplated by the ITAA. He said (at [145]):
 
 I cannot agree. There is no additional or collateral penalty. If the discretion is not exercised and fresh losses are not transferred, there will, or may be, a penalty applicable by the operation of s 226 upon the amount of tax calculated as assessable or that tax less the "claimed tax" within the meaning of s 226(1). If the discretion is exercised so as to create the same position in the Income Companies as had previously subsisted before the application of Pt IVA, no penalty under s 266 arises. It is not a matter of collaterally increasing a penalty by refusing to extend time, but of removing the consequences by way of penalty for participation in a Pt IVA Scheme by extending time. 
 

Those observations of course went to the lawfulness of the policy and not to its proper application.

133 In [28] the submission considered what it called "errors of the decision-maker by reference first to the six general principles referred to by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley ". In [29] to [30] it dealt with the subject of delay and in [31] to [39] the imposition of GIC and the alleged culpable behaviour of Development Finance. Paragraphs 40 to 46 dealt with the Asiamet [2004] FCAFC 73 ; 137 FCR 146 decision. Paragraph 47 asserted under the heading "No limitation" that the Commissioner erred in stating that there was nothing in the subject matter, scope and purpose of s 80G which would imply any limitation upon his ability to consider the conduct of a company group giving rise to an adjustment as being a relevant factor to the exercise of the discretion. The final heading "Additional or collateral penalty" complained that the Commissioner erred in treating the refusal of the discretion as reflecting a need to penalise to a greater extent taxpayers involved in serious non-compliance activities.

143 The core of the argument actually presented by DRI and Development Finance in relation to Mr Duffus' consideration of the "culpable" behaviour of Development Finance focussed on his approach to the way in which evidence of tax avoidance should be weighted in the exercise of the discretion to extend time to transfer losses. The key paragraph in his letter of 14 February 2006 was in the following terms: 
 
 Examples are given in Paragraph 93 [of TR 98/12] of factors which weigh heavily against a favourable exercise of the discretion. The examples listed are where an adjustment is made as a result of fraud or evasion or a scheme to which Part IVA applies. It is suggested in the ruling that these matters should be weighted heavily in considering whether to exercise the discretion. The heavy weighting reflects the need to penalise to a greater extent any taxpayers who are involved in these serious non-compliance activities.
 

It is the proposition that the discretion should be exercised so as to penalise taxpayers who are said to have engaged in such conduct that creates difficulty in this case. Such an approach is not sanctioned by the decision of the Full Court in Asiamet [2004] FCAFC 73 ; 137 FCR 146. In that case Allsop J accepted that it was permissible to disallow an extension of time on the basis of the application of Pt IVA and that to do so was not to increase any penalty on the taxpayer beyond that contemplated by the ITAA. The fact that a penalty would be applicable, absent the transfer of losses, does not mean that a refusal to extend time involved collaterally increasing a penalty. That is a very different matter from applying a "heavy weighting" to culpable conduct in order to "penalise to a greater extent any taxpayers who are involved in these serious non-compliance activities". That does involve, in my opinion, a consideration which is irrelevant to the statutory purposes. It is not to be found in Taxation Ruling TR 98/12. It appears to be based upon a misreading of that Ruling.

144 It is necessary, of course, in reviewing reasons for administrative decisions not to scrutinise them with an eye keenly attuned to error nor to engage in close semantic analysis. It is not for the Court through judicial review to impose the requirements which would "judicialise" the process of administrative decision-making. The passage cited, however, is unequivocal in its import and in the error which it reflects. It is difficult to assess the impact which it may have had on the weight given by the decision-maker to the alleged culpable conduct and the extent to which he had put to one side other aspects of the history to which reference was made earlier. In my opinion reviewable error is disclosed under this head.

145 In support of this ground it was said that the decision was so unreasonable and unfair that such a purpose should be inferred. I am not prepared to make such a finding. However, to the extent that consideration of a need to penalise "to a greater extent" taxpayers involved in serious non-compliance activities is an irrelevant consideration it also reflects a purpose other than a purpose for which the power was conferred.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>95 In the section under the heading "Explanations" which dealt with the discretion it was said, in [82]: 
 
 This part of the Ruling provides a general guide for taxpayers and officers of the ATO when considering the exercise of the discretion. This is desirable in the interests of consistent, efficient administration and equity among taxpayers in similar circumstances. However, the decision-maker must exercise the discretion according to the merits of each case and should not fetter the discretion by inflexibly applying, or acting in blind obedience to a policy or rule ...
 

There were then set out in [83] and [84] "Factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion". Those two paragraphs provided: 
 
 
 83. The exercise of the discretion under subsection 80G(6A) (paragraph 170-50(2)(d)) includes a two-step process of identifying relevant factors and applying a weighting to each of those factors, having regard to the circumstances of the case. Further, it is for the decision-maker to determine the appropriate weighting to be applied to these factors - see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Anor v Peko-Wallsend Ltd and Ors [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24.
 
 84. Applications for the exercise of the discretion usually fall into one of two broad categories. The first is where it can be said that there has been delay on the part of the taxpayer that results in non-compliance with the ... time limit. The second is where the request for an extension of time to make an agreement arises out of an adjustment to the tax position of the company group by the Commissioner. The following paragraphs outline the factors the Commissioner considers to be relevant to the exercise of the discretion ... in both categories, although they are by no means exhaustive.

136 A failure to take into account a relevant consideration or considerations in the exercise of a power is one of the grounds set out in s 5(2) of the ADJR Act for finding that there has been an improper exercise of the power within the meaning of s 5(1)(e) of that Act. In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39 Mason J made the following points about this head of review:
 
 (a) The ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration can only be made out if a decision-maker fails to take into account a consideration which he is bound to take into account in making that decision.
 (b) What factors a decision-maker is bound to consider in making the decision is determined by construction of the statute conferring the discretion. If the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act. 
 (c) Not every consideration that a decision-maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re-exercised according to law. 
 (d) The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind. It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator. In the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations it is generally for the decision-maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power.

137 Paragraph 36(a) of the application set out some 29 matters each of which were said to be a relevant consideration not taken into account by the first respondent. These included various aspects of the factual history which has already been outlined. It is not necessary for present purposes to address each of those matters. This was not done in the submissions. Many of them, as elements of the factual history could not conceivably be mandatory relevant considerations. Rather it is helpful to focus upon those matters, which having regard to the nature of the discretion, could be said to be mandatory relevant factors.

138 Earlier in these reasons a number of matters relevant to the discretion to extend time under s 170-50(2)(d) were set out. Some of them overlapped with those set out by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344. They were however formulated by reference to the scope and purpose of Subdiv 170-A and s 170-50 of the ITAA 1997. While many aspects of the history of dealings between the Commissioner, his officers and DRI and Development Finance could not be said to be mandatory relevant considerations, there were features of that history overall that went to matters at the heart of the statutory purpose. Although the reasons for his decision given by Mr Duffus in his letter of 14 February 2006 made reference to Taxation Ruling TR 98/12 they disclosed no consideration of the general purpose of Subdiv 170-A. There was no reference to the effect on the statutory purpose, in this case, of the requested extension of time. There was no reference to any adverse impact upon DRI and Development Finance of the inability to transfer losses or of any prejudice to the position of the Commissioner for the good administration of the Act were the extension of time to be allowed. A failure to have regard to those general issues may have resulted in a failure to give express consideration to certain of the factual matters referred to in [36] of the application. There was no evidence in the reasons for decision of any balancing of competing considerations having regard to those purposes.

139 It was also a relevant factor, apparently not taken into account by Mr Duffus, that the Commissioner was well aware of the intention of DRI to transfer tax losses to Development Finance when its position had crystallised. That crystallisation took a long time because of the extended audit of the tax position of Development Finance. On 30 November 2004 Mr Killaly wrote to Mr Mulqueen, in respect of extensions for the year ended 30 June 2000 saying that: 
 
 In our view, there is no reason to seek the Commissioner's permission to make additional loss transfer agreements until such time as the loss deductions available to the income companies are finally determined. 
 

And further: 
 
 
 We consider that the appropriate time to seek the favourable exercise of the Commissioner's discretion would be once amended assessments had issued to the income companies (were this to occur).
 

Mr Killaly described the issue at that time as "hypothetical". The letter of 1 December 2004 from Mr Killaly to Mr Clough of Mallesons was to similar effect.

140 This matter is specifically referred to as a mandatory relevant consideration not taken into account in [36(a)(xxvi)]. Importantly, no consideration appears to have been given to the fact that the Commissioner was well aware well in advance of the request that the BHPGroup proposed to request a transfer of tax losses in the relevant years. A finding that the factor of delay should be "taken into account but should not be weighted heavily against the favourable exercise of the discretion" indicates a narrowly based approach to the question of the delay. Had the relevant statutory purposes and the factors of prejudice on both sides together with the ongoing advice of the intention to effect loss transfers been taken into account, then this factor might well have been treated as neutral and not weighed against DRI and Development Finance at all.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189</tocase>
<text>103 Where the Parliament has conferred wide discretions on an official decision-maker, particularly in relation to high volume decision-making, it is entirely consistent with the legislative intention in conferring such a discretion that its exercise will be guided by administrative policies. Indeed it may be inferred that the creation of such policies is contemplated by the legislature when it confers such discretions. As Drummond J and I said in Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray (1994) 50 FCR 189 (at 206): 
 
 This is particularly so in the case of a power which involves high volume decision-making, or which may, in any event, because of its subject matter, be expected to attract policy guidelines ... Common concepts of justice suggest that, while each case is to be considered on its individual merits, like cases will generally be treated similarly. The imputed legislative contemplation of such policies for that purpose must be limited to those which are consistent with the general purposes and requirements, express or implied, of the legislation in question. They cannot be expressed to fetter the exercise of the relevant discretion. 
 

And as we observed in that case an administrative policy may amount to a mandatory relevant consideration such that a significant failure to properly construe and apply the policy may cause the discretion to miscarry. The public rulings issued by the Commissioner are expressly provided for by the TAA. They can have legal consequences in favour of the taxpayer. A failure by the Commissioner to have regard to a public ruling relating to the exercise of a discretion under the tax law could vitiate the decision made in the exercise of that discretion. Whether it would or not, would depend upon the circumstances and the factors properly considered by the decision-maker. That is not to say that the Commissioner is bound to apply any ruling which he has issued. The Act does not say so and there is no principle of estoppel in the exercise of his functions which would prevent him from doing so. Questions of procedural fairness may require the taxpayer to be heard against an unexpected departure from policy with consequences unfavourable to the taxpayer and against which there is no statutory protection.

104 The word "ruling" has an obvious capacity to mislead. It is capable of conveying the impression that rulings published by the Commissioner have legal force. Insofar as it relates to the interpretation of the law, a ruling has no greater status than an administrative opinion. In so far as it relates to the way in which a discretion conferred by law would be exercised, it has no greater status than an administrative policy. There is a risk of an unwarranted elevation of rulings, by virtue of their terminology to a kind of "de facto law". This risk has been discussed in a helpful review of the subject generally in Scolaro D, Tax Rulings: Opinion or Law? The need for an Independent 'Rule-Maker' (2006) 16 Revenue Law Journal 109. The footnotes in that article also make reference to a number of other papers on the topic.

105 Importantly the Taxation Ruling in issue in this case, so far as it related to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to extend the time for making an agreement to transfer losses, stated that the Commissioner was "guided by administrative law principles". It identified two particular factors of significance. The first was the explanation for the taxpayer's delay. The second was the culpability of the taxpayer in relation to any adjustment to the tax position of the company group which gave rise to an application to make an agreement out of time.

106 The "Explanations" part of Taxation Ruling TR 98/12 did not, in terms, form part of the substantive ruling which, in relation to extensions of time was confined to [18] to [20] inclusive. Paragraph 82 and the succeeding paragraphs were of an expository character. They included justifications for the approach taken. So the provision of a general guide for taxpayers and ATO officers when considering the exercise of the discretion was justified in [82] as "... desirable in the interests of consistent, efficient administration and equity among taxpayers in similar circumstances". The administrative law principle that the discretion cannot be confined by an inflexible rule of policy was also recognised in [82] which said: 
 
 However, the decision-maker must exercise the discretion according to the merits of each case and should not fetter the discretion by inflexibly applying, or acting in blind obedience to a policy or rule. 
 

In so far as the ruling identified factors which could be considered by the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion and recognised that no inflexible policy was being laid down, it did not offend against general principles of administrative law.

107 Statutory time limits affecting the exercise of legal rights, the imposition of liabilities or the exercise of powers are created for a variety of purposes. Limitation Acts which bar various categories of proceedings not commenced within a certain time after a cause of action has accrued may serve the following purposes: 
 
 1. To protect defendants from claims relating to incidents which occurred many years ago and about which they, and their witnesses, may have little recollection and no records; 
 2. To discourage plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights; it is in the public interest for disputes to be resolved as quickly as possible; and 
 3. To give an assurance to defendants that after a given period of time any possible claim against them arising out of a particular incident is at an end, that is, to operate as an "act of peace": see The Laws of Australia (Lawbook Co, subscription service) 5 at [5.10.120] and also Halsbury's Laws of Australia (Butterworths, subscription service) Vol 16, at [255.5]. 


Additional considerations affect the imposition of time limits in respect of proceedings brought in tribunals by way of merits review of administrative act decisions or in courts by way of judicial review of such decisions. Such limits are typically expressed in terms of weeks rather than years as is the case with Limitations Acts. They are imposed in part to ensure public administration is expeditious and that decisions once made take effect unless promptly challenged.

108 There are also innumerable examples of time limits imposed by statute upon subjects and decision-makers for taking steps necessary to secure rights or privileges or to exercise powers or impose liabilities. Self evidently they have the common purpose of securing expedition in statutory processes. They may also serve purposes related to the subject matter of the relevant statute.

109 Where the law imposes time limits, whether they bar or extinguish causes of action or rights to seek review or whether they require applications to administrative decision-makers or steps taken by such decision-makers to be done within a particular time, excessive rigidity in their application can lead to absurdity and injustice. There are many examples of statutory discretions to extend time to avoid such mischief.</text>

<tocase>Ross Palmer Holdings v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 805</tocase>
<text>119 In Ross Palmer Holdings v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 52 ATR 805, which was concerned with the exercise of the discretion under s 80G(6A) of the ITAA 1936, Spender J identified the purpose of the loss transfer provisions (at 816-817): 
 
 ... to permit and facilitate the transfer of losses within a group of companies so that there is no difference in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as against a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. 
 

The purpose of the provisions was also considered by the Full Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Asiamet (No 1) Resources Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 73 ; (2004) 137 FCR 146 in the judgment of Allsop J (Ryan and Finkelstein JJ agreeing). In rejecting, as overstated, the proposition that their statutory purpose was to allow for the transfer of losses within a group so as to equate the tax treatment of a group to that of a company with divisions, his Honour said (at [141]):
 
 
 That, with respect, overstates the purpose of s 80G. Section 80G is intended to be beneficial to the taxpayer: Harts Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2001] FCA 761 ; (2001) 109 FCR 405 at [18] . There is not, however, a complete equation with the single company. Conditions apply to the transfer of losses, one of which is that the agreement must be made before the date of lodgment of the return of income or the income company, or later as the Commissioner allows. The legislative history of s 80G, and in particular the content of the Asprey Committee Report and the Campbell Committee Report , reveals that a choice was made by Parliament not to adopt the group assessment procedure which might be seen as a complete equation of subsidiaries with divisions. 
 

His Honour accepted the statement of the policy of the section as set out in the Commissioner's Taxation Ruling, TR 98/12 saying (at [142]): 
 
 
 There is, undoubtedly, a beneficial policy underlying s 80G as described at [87] of the ruling: broadly to align the treatment of company groups with divisional companies. That is not to deny, however, that a broad, otherwise expressly unconfined discretion, is reposed in the Commissioner in s 80G(6A)(b). Naturally, the discretion is to be confined by reference to the subject matter, scope and purposes of the provisions and the ITAA as a whole.</text>

<text>117 The Full Court in Zizza v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 42 ATR 371 said it would be an error to regard the summary in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd 3 FCR 344 as complete or to treat each of the six principles it contained as necessarily applicable to any particular application for extension of time especially an application under different legislation. The Court agreed with the observations to that effect made by Hill J in Brown 42 ATR 118 (at 376).</text>
