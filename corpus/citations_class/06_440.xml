<text>28 My attention has been drawn by counsel for both parties to well-known authorities dealing with indemnity costs, including NMFM Property v Citibank Ltd [2001] FCA 480 ; (2001) 109 FCR 77, Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 and Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397. The Court has a discretion concerning the scale of costs. The discretion is unfettered except that it must be exercised judicially. The cases concerning indemnity costs illustrate that much turns upon the facts of the particular case. The essential principle is that a discretion can be exercised to order costs on an indemnity basis where the actions of the unsuccessful party have been unreasonable or high-handed or where the claim in question was totally frivolous or hopeless or fundamentally flawed.</text>
