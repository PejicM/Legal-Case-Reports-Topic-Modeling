<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>11 In any event, when one has regard to the terms of the observations made by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1190 especially at paras 15, 17 and 18 and to the exceptions for which s 424A(3) provides, it seems to me that the Tribunal was not under any obligation derived from s 424A , to invite the Appellants to comment upon information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review. Rather, the letter is one which might fairly be categorised as an invitation given, pursuant to s 424(2) of the Migration Act , to give to the Tribunal additional information.

12 However one approaches the contention that the Tribunal has breached s 424A , it seems to me that it must fail.

13 This was not in terms, a ground pursued for the Federal Magistrate. Again, it was not the subject of any written submission on behalf of the Appellants. Further, when invited to expand in oral submissions upon the ground, the male appellant replied, "No". One way of dealing with this ground in those circumstances, would be to treat it as so devoid of particularity as not to amount to a meaningful ground of appeal. Once again, and with respect properly, the Minister sought instead to highlight the way in which the Tribunal had dealt with the question of whether satisfaction of the male Appellant's and hence the female Appellant's status as a refugee had been dealt with in the Tribunal. In effect, the Tribunal's reasons were subjected to a critical analysis in this regard. It appears that this course may also have been followed before the Federal Magistrates Court.

21 This finding was, in my opinion, one reasonably open to the Tribunal. In light of that finding a very real question, indeed, would be raised were there otherwise to be any merit in the grounds appeal, as to whether relief ought to be denied as a matter of discretion, on the basis of futility. See SZBYR at 1197 1198, paras 27 - 29.

22 For these reasons then, the appeal is dismissed.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>15 Read in isolation, and if one were to regard the Tribunal as having a view that satisfaction as to refugee status could only be achieved in the event of a threat to life, there would be very serious concern indeed that the Tribunal had misunderstood the basis upon which satisfaction as to a person's being a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations existed. So reading a Tribunal or, for that matter, any administrator's reasons is something one must not do as a judicial officer. As Brennan CJ and Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ, remarked in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at page 272, the proposition that a court should not be concerned with looseness in the language nor with the unhappy phrasing of the reasons an administrative decision maker is well settled:
 They recognise the reality that the reasons of an administrative decision maker are meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon overzealous judicial reviews by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed.

16 It is always important to read a Tribunal's reasons in the context in which they came to be given. In this case and in this context, it must be recalled that the reasons of the Tribunal are responsive to a claim for a protection visa put on the basis that the male Appellant's life was at risk. There are other passages in the Tribunal's reasons also found at page 214 of the Appeal Book which serve to demonstrate that the Tribunal was under no misapprehension that a protection obligation under the Convention could only arise if an Applicant's life were at risk. Without intending to be exhaustive, I cite the following passages:
 On the basis of the credible evidence before it, the Tribunal cannot be satisfied that any harm experienced by the applicant [the male appellant] at this time were sufficiently serious as to constitute persecution. Moreover, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant experienced ongoing threats to his life or any other form of persecution on a continuing basis after the elections and up until the time of his departure in April 2007. Nor does it accept that he would be at risk of ongoing harm if he were to return to India now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.

17 Then in the sentence which immediately follows, the one which I have earlier in isolation cited, one sees the following:
 Nor is there any evidence to suggest that the applicant would face harm amounting to persecution simply as a member of the Shiv Sena or the VHP without more.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/1.html</AustLII>
<text>18 In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal has made a value judgment based on its assessment of the credibility of the claim for a protection visa advanced by the appellants. As it happens, and having regard to inconsistencies which it highlighted, the Tribunal did not accept the claim advanced. The Tribunal's reasons for so doing are logical. As the learned Federal Magistrate observed at para 30 of her Honour's reasons for judgment by reference to what had been said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex Parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at [67] , credibility is a matter for the Tribunal "par excellence", and the Tribunal's findings were open to it for the reasons it gave on the material before it.

19 There is then, in my opinion, no substance in ground 2.

20 These conclusions are themselves enough to dispose of the appeal. However, it is desirable that attention be drawn to a further passage which appears in the Tribunal's reasons at Appeal Book page 214. The Tribunal there states:
 The Tribunal does not accept the applicant's 
I interpolate, the male Appellant's 
 claim that the police refused to protect him because of the influence of his enemy. The independent information which the Tribunal accepts, overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the police in Gujarat favour the BJP. The Tribunal is satisfied that if the applicant had, in the past, been unable to obtain help from the police, or from his party leaders, it is because any difficulties he had were too trivial. The Tribunal is satisfied that were he to suffer serious harm, or threat of harm amounting to persecution, the state authorities would provide effective protection.</text>
