<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1760.html</AustLII>
<text>21 As I have noted in my judgment in the primary proceedings ( Bing! Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760) an undertaking given by a party to proceedings in Court is enforceable by order of the Court pursuant to O 35 r 11 Federal Court Rules . The submission of the first respondent that it anticipates the applicant submitting that the first respondent "giving the undertaking is not enough" is:
 
&#8226; curious in light of the power of the Court to enforce the undertaking; and
 
&#8226; indicative of the fact that the respondents, in seeking to introduce this additional evidence, are attempting a "second bite" at the case after the trial has concluded.</text>

<text>12 It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved.

13 In Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J conveniently summarised the circumstances in which the Court will permit further evidence to be adduced between conclusion of the hearing and delivery of judgment as follows:
 [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence (Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61 2); (2) inadvertent error (Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts (Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("UTA") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law (UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("Silver Fox") at [22] and [25].

<tocase>MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd (1998) 90 FCR 236</tocase>
<text>22 In my view:
 
&#8226; This is not a case where the first respondent has made a deliberate tactical decision not to adduce, during the proceedings, evidence which was already available. However the occurrence of the events the subject of the 9 April affidavit flow from a deliberate tactical decision of the first respondent during the trial to give an undertaking, the purpose of which as the respondents admit was to bring themselves within the principles articulated in MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd (1998) 90 FCR 236. I consider that, in principle, the distinction between:
 
 o making a deliberate tactical decision during the proceedings not to adduce evidence then available; and
 
 o making a deliberate tactical decision during the proceedings to give an undertaking from which evidence follows after the trial;
 
is minimal in the sense that both decisions relate to the manner in which the first respondent has decided to conduct its case and the evidence to be put before the Court. In summary, it is as a result of decisions taken by the respondents, during the proceedings as to the manner in which their case was to be conducted, that the respondents now seek to put additional evidence before the Court.
 
&#8226; I consider that allowing the respondents to supplement their case after the conclusion of the applicant's case at trial would offend the principle of finality of litigation. It is not in the interests of justice that a litigant should be entitled to adduce additional evidence after the conclusion of proceedings simply to bolster its own position, which I consider is the intention of the respondents here.
 
&#8226; As the respondents concede, the evidence in the 9 April affidavit simply provides additional evidence that there has been compliance with the undertaking given by the first respondent in Court. I do not consider this evidence so material that the interests of justice require its admission. Further, while the evidence in the 9 April affidavit is of relevance to the primary proceedings, I consider that it would be of particular relevance in the event that the applicant subsequently claimed that the first respondent had failed to comply with that undertaking. I make this observation because I consider that the evidence goes primarily to compliance with the undertaking.
 
&#8226; I do not consider that the additional evidence in the 9 April affidavit is evidence which, if believed, would most probably affect the result of the primary proceedings. The undertaking given by the first respondent in Court on 11 March 2008, and supported by an affidavit of Mr Cranitch, is enforceable on its own terms.
 
&#8226; While, as I have already indicated, I consider the applicant has demonstrated little potential prejudice should I exercise my discretion to permit the respondents to adduce this additional evidence, that is not in itself a reason to exercise my discretion in the respondents' favour in light of the other factors I have taken into account.

23 Accordingly the notice of motion should be dismissed. I shall hear submissions as to costs.

 I certify that the preceding twenty-three (23) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

<tocase>Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612</tocase>
<text>12 It is not in dispute that the Court has the power to grant leave for further evidence-in-chief to be adduced after the trial of the proceeding has concluded and judgment reserved. Indeed this jurisdiction is well recognised: Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 , Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd v Londish [1992] FCA 502 , Urban Transport Authority of New South Wales v Nweiser (1992) 28 NSWLR 471, Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR 256 , McCarthy v McIntyre [2000] FCA 1250 , Inspector-General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Hawthorn Glen Pty Ltd v Aconex Pty Ltd (No 1) [2007] FCA 2010.

13 In Bradshaw [2006] FCA 22 , Kenny J conveniently summarised the circumstances in which the Court will permit further evidence to be adduced between conclusion of the hearing and delivery of judgment as follows:
 [24] The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence (Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287; Smith v New South Wales Bar Assn [No 2] (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61 2); (2) inadvertent error (Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts (Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("UTA") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law (UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("Silver Fox") at [22] and [25].

14 With respect to fresh evidence, Muirhead J held in Murray v Figge 4 ALR 612 that fresh evidence should be admitted only when:
 
(a) it is so material that the interests of justice require it;
 
(b) the evidence if believed would most probably affect the result;
 
(c) the evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered before;
 
(d) inadvertence was established; and
 
(e) no prejudice was suffered by the other party by reason of its introduction at a late point of time.</text>
