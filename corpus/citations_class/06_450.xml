<tocase>Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821</tocase>

<text>62 The causes of action pleaded are based on conduct engaged in in the United States. Even though the duties pleaded depend upon conduct in Australia that does not mean that their breach by acts outside Australia gives rise to a cause of action 'arising in the Commonwealth' under O 8 r 1(a). As von Doussa J observed in Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers [2000] FCA 821 , the authorities establish that 'cause of action' within the meaning of O 8 r 1(a) does not refer to all the elements of the cause of action. It refers rather to the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff his cause for complaint. In Distillers Co (Biochemicals) v Thompson [1971] AC 458 at 467, Lord Pearson said (at 468):
 
 It is not the right approach to say that, because there was no complete tort until the damage occurred, therefore the cause of action arose wherever the damage happened to occur. The right approach is, when the tort is complete, to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask the question, where in substance did this cause of action arise? 
 
 Theory no (iii) is that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant, which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint has occurred within the jurisdiction. That is the rule laid down in Jackson v Spittal (1870) LR 5CP 542, which is an authoritative case, and the rule is inherently reasonable, as the defendant is called upon to answer for his wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong.' 
 

In my opinion the causes of action in breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty are not demonstrated, on the current state of the pleadings, to be proceedings to which O 8 r 1 applies.

63 The question that then arises is whether, given that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O 8 r 1, that is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule 'applies to the proceeding' within the meaning of O 8 r 2(2)(b). As to that von Doussa J in Delco Australia said [at 35]:
 
 'In this Court r 1(n) makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs. In my opinion r 1(n) makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r 1. An originating process that includes a claim that does not fall within one or more of the heads is not an originating process that meets the description of r 1, in that it is not one "in" any of the cases described in the rule. It is not a "proceeding to which rule 1 applies" so as to meet the requirement of r 2(2)(c)(b). A similar conclusion was expressed by Wilcox J in Tycoon Holdings Ltd v Tencor Jetco Inc (1992) 34 FCR 31 at 35.'

64 In the circumstances, because of the inclusion of the claims for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty, it is not possible to conclude that 'the proceeding' is one to which O 8 r 1 applies. The order sought by Traxon cannot be made on the current state of the pleadings. It will be necessary to reconsider the pleadings and either plead those facts which would make it clear that the causes of action referred to fall within the scope of the rule or to abandon those causes of action.</text>

<tocase>Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539</tocase>
<text>65 The requirement to show a 'prima facie case for the relief sought' was expounded in Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549. The Court quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Heerey J in Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Specialty Products Inc (1991) 28 FCR 387 at 390 where his Honour said: 
 
 '... the requirement of O 8, r 2(2)(c) has to be met at the outset of the proceedingS. It does not suggest the kind of scrutiny that would occur in a submission of no case to answer following the closure of an applicant's case at trial... It may be therefore that a court at this stage might draw inferences more readily in favour of an applicant, bearing in mind, among other things, that the applicant will not have had the advantage of discovery, subpoena and other procedural aids to the making out of a prima facie case at trial.' 
 

As I observed in Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In liq) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 110: 
 
 
 'A prima facie case is made out if, on the material before the Court, inferences are open which it translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed.' 
 

The requirement for a prima facie case is satisfied by demonstration of a prime facie case 'for the relief sought by the party on the proceeding'. Where the relief sought is based upon more than one cause of action, it is sufficient that there is a prima facie case demonstrated for at least one of the causes of action relied upon. In my opinion it is sufficient to say for the moment that a prima facie case within the meaning of O 8 r 2(2)(c) is raised in respect of the cause of action in breach of contract. It is questionable whether there is a prima facie case shown for misleading or deceptive conduct without more than the alleged breach of the promises embodied in the agreements. There is a disquieting confusion about the documentation comprising the written part of the so called Distribution and Confidentiality Agreement made in 1998. Having regard, however, to my conclusions that the proceeding is not one to which O 8 r 1 applies, these are matters which may be able to be addressed by Traxon prior to a renewal of its motion.</text>
