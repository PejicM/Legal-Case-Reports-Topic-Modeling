<text>4 The application was remitted to this Court pursuant to orders made by Gaudron J following the delivery of judgment in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601.

5 By letter dated 12 November 2004, the District Registrar of this Court notified the applicant that the Court proposed to consider whether there was an arguable case on the basis of the written material that the applicant had given to the Court and without any oral hearing. The applicant was invited to file written submissions on the question of whether the Court should make an order nisi . Written submissions were filed by the applicant on 10 December 2004.

<tocase>Blair v Curren [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1939/23.html</AustLII>
<text>7 Res judicata arises where a cause of action relied on in proceedings has, in former proceedings, passed into judgment so that it has merged and has no longer an independent existence: see Blair v Curren [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532 per Dixon J; Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 597 per Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ ( Anshun ). The doctrine of res judicata represents a complete bar to a new application because the cause of action is extinguished by the judgment: see Anshun at 612-3 per Brennan J.</text>

<tocase>Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Effem Foods Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 406 </tocase>
<text>8 The question to be determined on a plea of res judicata is whether the cause of action relied upon in the proceedings in which the plea is raised is the same cause of action which has been determined in the earlier proceedings. In determining that question, the Court will have regard to the substance rather than the form of the proceedings: Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Effem Foods Pty Ltd (1992) 36 FCR 406 (affirmed (1993) 43 FCR 510).

9 In the draft order nisi , the applicants claim that the Tribunal failed to afford them natural justice because they had not been given an opportunity (or at least an adequate opportunity) to prepare and present favourable material at the hearing or an adequate opportunity to respond to unfavourable material. In her supporting affidavit, the applicant does not give any particulars of the material that she wished to present to the Tribunal or the unfavourable material that she did not have an opportunity to respond to. There is no evidence before me that would support the applicant's claim that she was denied natural justice.

10 The submissions filed by the applicant on 10 December 2004 raise a number of grounds of review. First, the applicant submits that the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether, on the totality of the facts found, she had a well-founded fear of persecution. Secondly, it is argued that the Tribunal misunderstood the elements of the definition of a refugee under the Convention which were supported by the facts of the case. Thirdly, the applicant says that the Tribunal erred in finding that women in India and/or Sikh women did not constitute a social group for Convention purposes. Fourthly, the applicant claims that she was denied procedural fairness as the Tribunal forced her to attend the hearing despite the fact that she had informed it of her psychological condition. Finally, the applicant made a number of claims regarding the merits of the decision of the Tribunal. In particular, the applicant says that the Tribunal did not realise that she suffered because of her husband's involvement in the Sikh movements and that she has a fear of harm by the Indian police authorities, who have provided her with no protection.</text>
