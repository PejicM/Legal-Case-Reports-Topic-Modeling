<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>11 Order 52 r 15(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules provides that a notice of appeal is to be filed 21 days from the date of judgment. In this case, this period ended on 15 November 2006. The application for an extension of time was filed on 21 November 2006. Pursuant to O 52 r 15(2), the time limit may be extended for 'special reasons'. In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187, a Full Court of this Court said, at 195:
 
 "...the expression 'special reasons' is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression 'for special reasons' implies something narrower than this."

12 The applicant was present in Court on 25 October 2006, when the Federal Magistrate delivered his ex tempore reasons. An interpreter was also present to assist him. He has not adduced any evidence that might explain the delay in lodging his notice of appeal. He has not adduced any evidence of 'special reasons' that would satisfy the Court that an extension of time should be granted.

13 Further, as the first respondent submitted in written submissions, the proposed appeal would appear to have insufficient prospects of success to justify an extension of time. The applicant's draft notice of appeal claims that: (a) the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court involved an important exercise of power; (b) the Tribunal failed to provide the applicant with procedural fairness; and (c) he is entitled to a protection visa. The applicant's supporting affidavit rehearses the merits of his claim that he is entitled to a protection visa. I put the first claim to one side since it does not raise any ground for review. I also put the third ground aside since it invites an inquiry into the merits of the applicant's visa application that the Court is not at liberty to make. Neither of these grounds is capable of raising jurisdictional error. Only the applicant's second claim is capable of raising possible jurisdictional error.</text>
