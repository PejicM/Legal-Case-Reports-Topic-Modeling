<tocase>Storey &amp; Keers Pty Ltd v Johnstone (1987) 9 NSWLR 446</tocase>
<text>5 The parties said that this amendment was by consent provided that I considered it should be made under the slip rule (and see O 35 r 7(3)). The Court has an implied or inherent power to correct any clerical mistake or error in a judgment or order if it were the result of an accidental slip or omission: Storey &amp; Keers Pty Ltd v Johnstone (1987) 9 NSWLR 446 at 449E per McHugh JA. He said that the power extended to permit a proposed variation of an order which related to a matter that was in issue in the proceedings or something which was incidental to such a matter if the need for such a variation is the result of an accidental omission or mistake ( Storey &amp; Keers 9 NSWLR at 452F-G; see too Australian Fisheries Management Authority v PW Adams Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 66 FCR 349).

6 In addition to the power under the slip rule and O 35 r 7(3), under O 35 r 7(2)(e) the Court has power to vary or set aside an order after entry where it does not reflect the intention of the Court.

7 I intended that my orders restore BGR and its group to the position they should have been in had the oppressive conduct of Triad and Cordato Partners Services in causing the payment of their costs not occurred. I overlooked the plaintiffs' submissions that I should frame the relief more generally than just affecting BGR.</text>
