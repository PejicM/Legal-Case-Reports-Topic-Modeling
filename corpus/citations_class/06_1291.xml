<tocase>Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397</tocase>
<text>In my opinion, there is sufficient doubt as to whether such a conjunctive construction can be said even to be reasonably arguable to warrant reconsideration by a Full Court ( Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-9).

There was no claim for indemnity made by ARMA during the currency of the first policy.

The primary judge noted that Permanent's case was primarily based on the second policy ( Permanent (No 1) at [20]). The primary judge seems to have accepted that the applicable insurance cover related to the second policy ( Permanent (No 1) at [39]).</text>

<tocase>FAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney (1999) 10 ANZ Insurances Cases 61-443</tocase>
<text>Permanent's submissions to the primary judge were to the effect that the letters from Permanent to Mr Teves were couched in words that did not amount to ' a claim nor an assertion of the breach of duty ' but merely raised ' the possibility of overvaluation, foreshadowing future action in the event of a shortfall ' ( Permanent (No 1) at [23]). It was put to his Honour that, as there was ' no claim as such then pending ' there was no basis for any claim to indemnity unless further events transpired or ' crystallised ' ( Permanent (No 1) at [23]). His Honour referred to the decision of Lindgren J in FAI General Insurance Co Limited v McSweeney (1999) 10 ANZ Insurances Cases 61-443 at 75,033-4 that circumstances ' may give rise to a claim ' where the ' bringing of a claim against the insured in respect of them was a "definite risk" or a "real possibility" or "on the cards" '. The primary judge concluded that it was reasonably arguable that Exclusion 4.1 had no operation, at least because of the lack of clarity in the letters as to whether any loss or damage would crystallise by way of actual sale of the properties in question ( Permanent (No 1) at [39]). On that basis, his Honour concluded that it was open to argument that Exclusion 4.1 may have no operation.

In coming to that conclusion, based upon the crystallisation of the loss of damage, his Honour was considering a "Claim", that is in the sense of a bringing of a claim in the nature of an originating process (as in McSweeney ).

His Honour seems to have dealt compendiously with Claim and claim or, alternatively, dealt with the former but not with the latter. He relied on the absence of any sale of the properties the subject of ARMA's valuations prior to the commencement of the second policy ( Permanent (No 1) at [39]). His Honour recorded the insurers' contention that there was no liability under the second policy because of an absence of disclosure of the notifications by Permanent to Mr Teves ( Permanent (No 1) at [26]). His Honour did not consider the effect of those notifications on Exclusion 4.1. The insurers emphasise that this was not a question of disclosure but of awareness of circumstances. His Honour held that it was open to argument that the exclusion clause had no operation but that was in the context of whether loss or damage relevantly crystallised. That was relevant to whether a "Claim" might result but not a "claim" as defined in the policy.

The next issue was whether, as submitted by Permanent, even if the notification did constitute knowledge of circumstances which might result in a ' claim ', s 33 of the Insurance Act operated to preclude the Insurers from relying on Exclusion 4.1. Section 33 of the Insurance Act provides: 
 
 ' No other remedies 
 
 The provisions of this Division are exclusive of any right that the insurer has otherwise than under this Act in respect of a failure by the insured to disclose a matter to the insurer before the contract was entered into and in respect of a misrepresentation or incorrect statement.'</text>

<tocase>Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (2002) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-515</tocase>
<text>The primary judge accepted that the threshold issue before him was whether the foreshadowed claim against the insurers was reasonably arguable, in the sense that it ' could be seriously put ' ( Permanent (No 1) at [5]). His Honour also recognised that, as stated by Mason P (with whom Meagher and Handley JJ agreed) in Fishwives Pty Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (2002) 12 ANZ Insurance Cases 61-515, the applicable principle is that even though an arguable case against an insurer is established, the Court is ' seized of the discretion to grant leave ' (at [47] citing National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1996) 138 ALR 409 at 418). The insurer is at liberty to argue its right to disclaim liability in the proceedings which follow a grant of leave but ' it does not follow...that a court that is positively satisfied of the insurer's entitlement to disclaim, after issue has been joined on that matter as between the plaintiff and the insurer, must exercise the discretion in favour of the grant of leave ' ( Fishwives at [47]).</text>

<tocase>Pech v Tilgals (1994) 94 ATC 4206</tocase>
<text>The insurers relied upon Pech v Tilgals (1994) 94 ATC 4206 where Dunford J considered a comparable if not identical clause to Exclusion 4.1 and held that it was not concerned with non-disclosure because ' the claims specified are excluded from the cover whether the circumstances are disclosed or not ' (at 4218). The primary judge accepted that Pech was relevant to the second policy. However, his Honour concluded that Pech did not provide ' sufficient bearing ' on the circumstances in this case ( Permanent (No 1) at [30]). His Honour did not consider the impact of the reasoning in Pech on s 33.

The primary judge seemed to accept that the applicable policy was the second policy. The insurers relied upon Exclusion 4.1 to ' destroy ' Permanent's case. The insurers asserted a complete defence to the cause of action because the letters from Permanent to Mr Teves constituted, by their content, circumstances of which, at the least, Mr Teves and ARMA ought reasonably to have realised to be circumstances which might result in or intimated ' an assertion, allegation or complaint of any act or omission causing or potentially causing loss or damage ' or ' an intention to seek compensation, damages or other legal relief '. The insurers assert that this was not a question of non-disclosure because Exclusion 4.1 applies whether the circumstances are disclosed to the insurer or not. The primary judge did not consider the application of Exclusion 4.1 for other than non-disclosure, whether a defence was thereby available and whether it was a total answer to the cause of action.

The primary judge seemed to accept that the reasoning in Permanent v FAI applied with respect to s 33, the consequence being that the insurers could not rely on Exclusion 4.1. Permanent v FAI concerned a failure to disclose. The insurers' submission that Exclusion 4.1 is not relevantly concerned with a failure to disclose and that s 33 has no application was not dealt with. His Honour did not explain why the reasoning in Pech was not applicable.</text>

<tocase>Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 640</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/640.html</AustLII>
<text>In essence it is submitted that there is no arguable case against the insurers, that they have been incorrectly joined in the proceedings and that the primary judge erred in joining the insurers and finding a reasonable cause of action against them in Permanent (No 2) on 4 July 2006 and Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 640 (' Permanent (No 1) ') on 29 May 2006.</text>

<tocase>Permanent Trustee Australia Limited v FAI General Insurance Company Limited (1988) 153 ALR 529</tocase>
<text>Permanent submitted to his Honour that Exclusion 4.1 provides the insurers with a right to disclaim liability for the failure to disclose a matter ' otherwise than under [the Insurance Act]' and could not be relied upon. Permanent relied upon Permanent Trustee Australia Limited v FAI General Insurance Company Limited (1988) 153 ALR 529 in support of its submission that Exclusion 4.1 is, in effect, a non-disclosure clause for the purposes of s 33. The primary judge recognised that, in Permanent v FAI , Hodgson CJ in Eq was concerned with a claimed exclusion from liability for non-disclosure and with whether the insured was aware of the circumstances which might give rise to a claim. In these circumstances, Hodgson CJ in Eq thought s 33 applied ( Permanent (No 1) at [28]; Permanent v FAI at 589).

The primary judge seemed to accept that the reasoning in Permanent v FAI applied with respect to s 33, the consequence being that the insurers could not rely on Exclusion 4.1. Permanent v FAI concerned a failure to disclose. The insurers' submission that Exclusion 4.1 is not relevantly concerned with a failure to disclose and that s 33 has no application was not dealt with. His Honour did not explain why the reasoning in Pech was not applicable.</text>
