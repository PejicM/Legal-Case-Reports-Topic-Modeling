<tocase>Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300</tocase>

<text>7 It will be apparent that in so approaching the matter, the wrong question was asked. The correct question was not whether the applicants should, as a matter of discretion, have a review of Registrar Hedge's order the correct question was what the outcome of that review should be. The orders made by me on 13 August 2008 have not been entered. It follows that there exists a power to recall those orders and reconsider the matter. This is because it is apparent that in dealing with the application I "erred in a material matter in [my] approach to the case": see Pittalis v Sherefettin [1986] QB 868 at 880 per Fox LJ; Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No 2) [1993] HCA 6 ; (1993) 176 CLR 300 at 302 per Mason CJ.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1990) 172 CLR 84</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/9.html</AustLII>
<text>5 The correctness of that statement, albeit in a slightly different context, has been accepted by a Full Court of this Court on at least two occasions: see Martin v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2005) 217 ALR 634 at 635-636 [6]-[7] per North, Mansfield and Katz JJ, and Mazukov v University of Tasmania [2004] FCAFC 159 at [22] - [24] per Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ. It seems to me that that reading is also consistent with the reasoning in Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1990) 172 CLR 84 at 95 per Mason CJ and Deane J, 124-125 per Dawson J, 151 per Gaudron J and 164 per McHugh J. The consequence is that whilst s 35A(6) appears to confer a discretionary power on the Court to order a review by use of the words "may", in fact, the applicants are entitled, by right, to a review. Thus, "may" in s 35A(6) means "must".</text>

<tocase>Jageev Pty Ltd v Deane (1997) 72 FCR 398</tocase>
<text>4 In Jageev Pty Ltd v Deane (1997) 72 FCR 398 at 399, Davies J considered the nature of the power to review conferred by s 35A(6): 
 Although many matters are sent for hearing in the first instance before a registrar, it is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to arrange affairs so that the decision of the registrar is equivalent to a decision of a judge. That is a constitutional problem which of course does not face State courts. The result is that ... the Court must provide a rehearing on the merits of any matter which comes before a registrar and with which one of the parties to the proceedings before the registrar is dissatisfied.</text>
