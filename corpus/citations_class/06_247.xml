<tocase>Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v Boots Company (Australia) Pty Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 287</tocase>
<text>33 Counsel for Lion Nathan submitted that the application for the stay should be considered by reference to the principles stated in the case of Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v Boots Company (Australia) Pty Ltd (1992) 34 FCR 287 ('Sterling Pharmaceuticals') .

34 Counsel did not submit that the proceedings in this Court should be stayed on the basis that the proceedings were otherwise an abuse of process or because they were vexatious or frivolous.

35 Counsel for Plantagenet submitted that the case of Sterling Pharmaceuticals was distinguishable because that case was concerned with two sets of proceedings one of which was in Australia and the other in New Zealand, and therefore beyond the scope of the cross-vesting scheme. Counsel for Plantagenet submitted that, in cases where the parties were amenable to the jurisdiction of the legislation comprising the national cross-vesting scheme, the scheme had ousted the common law principles on whether a court would stay its own proceedings on the basis of forum non conveniens. Counsel relied upon observations made by Ormiston JA in Schmidt v Won [1998] 3 VR 435 ('Schmidt') .

45 In the event that I am wrong in the views that I have expressed, I would decline to stay the Federal Court proceedings. This is because the appropriate test to apply in the circumstances is the test in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and not in Sterling Pharmaceuticals (see BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz [2004] HCA 61 ; (2004) 211 ALR 523 ('BHP Billiton') , the observations of Ormiston JA in Schmidt referred to above and Transport Workers' Union of Australia v Bentley [2001] FCA 671 ; (2001) 112 FCR 580). On the application of that test, it could not be said that the Western Australia District Registry of the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for Plantagenet to commence the Federal Court proceedings. Plantagenet's principal place of business is in Western Australia, the alleged breaches of the TP Act occurred in Western Australia and the alleged losses were suffered in Western Australia.</text>

<tocase>Schmidt v Won [1998] 3 VR 435</tocase>
<text>35 Counsel for Plantagenet submitted that the case of Sterling Pharmaceuticals was distinguishable because that case was concerned with two sets of proceedings one of which was in Australia and the other in New Zealand, and therefore beyond the scope of the cross-vesting scheme. Counsel for Plantagenet submitted that, in cases where the parties were amenable to the jurisdiction of the legislation comprising the national cross-vesting scheme, the scheme had ousted the common law principles on whether a court would stay its own proceedings on the basis of forum non conveniens. Counsel relied upon observations made by Ormiston JA in Schmidt v Won [1998] 3 VR 435 ('Schmidt') .

39 In Schmidt , Ormiston JA made the following observations at 453-454:
 
 'Subject always to the power of the Court to stay frivolous, vexatious oppressive proceedings or any which amount to an abuse of process (the categories for which can never be closed), the Voth principle should be considered as having no continued practical application so far as the exercise of jurisdiction as between the several State Supreme Courts. So the ordinary remedy of parties, who are served in Australia with process issued out of the Supreme Courts of States or Territories other than that in which they reside and who wish to complain that the Supreme Court of that other State or Territory is not the appropriate forum in which the litigation should be heard, is to seek transfer pursuant to the provisions of s 5(2) of one of the State Cross-Vesting Acts. In the light of the complex and sophisticated scheme now in operation in this country, a stay of the kind contemplated by Voth must be seen as an inappropriately heavy-handed means of ensuring that issues are determined in the proper forum, ie in the court within Australia most appropriate to hear the action and most convenient to the parties for that purpose. Transfer under the Cross-Vesting legislation should be seen as now providing the necessary and appropriate weapon to achieve the same end by transferring litigation to a more appropriate jurisdiction within Australia.'

44 In this case the parties were amenable to the cross-vesting scheme, and so it was open to Lion Nathan to have brought an application to transfer the Federal Court proceedings under the Cross-Vesting Act rather than to apply for a stay. The transfer application has now been made by the amendment to the notice of motion. As I have already mentioned, Lion Nathan does not seek a stay of the proceedings on the basis of an abuse of process by Plantagenet, and so this application does not fall into the exceptional circumstances category referred to by Ormiston JA in Schmidt in the observations set out above. In my view, therefore, it is appropriate that I decline to exercise the Court's jurisdiction to stay the proceedings. It is appropriate that the question of the destiny of the Federal Court proceedings be considered by reference to Lion Nathan's transfer application now before the Court.

45 In the event that I am wrong in the views that I have expressed, I would decline to stay the Federal Court proceedings. This is because the appropriate test to apply in the circumstances is the test in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and not in Sterling Pharmaceuticals (see BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz [2004] HCA 61 ; (2004) 211 ALR 523 ('BHP Billiton') , the observations of Ormiston JA in Schmidt referred to above and Transport Workers' Union of Australia v Bentley [2001] FCA 671 ; (2001) 112 FCR 580). On the application of that test, it could not be said that the Western Australia District Registry of the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for Plantagenet to commence the Federal Court proceedings. Plantagenet's principal place of business is in Western Australia, the alleged breaches of the TP Act occurred in Western Australia and the alleged losses were suffered in Western Australia.

49 Section 20 of the SEP Act does not appear in Pt 7 of the SEP Act, and therefore the reference to the word 'Court' in s 20 of the SEP Act is to be construed as a reference to a court of a State. It follows that the reference to 'court' in s 20 of the SEP Act is not a reference to the Federal Court, whose proceedings are not, in any event, served pursuant to the SEP Act. Further, in Schmidt , Ormiston JA at 454 observed that s 20(1) of the SEP Act is to be construed as referring to an inferior court of a State.

50 I, accordingly, decline to stay the Federal Court proceedings under s 20 of the SEP Act as there is no jurisdiction to do so.</text>

<tocase>Bankinvest AG v Seabrook (1988) 14 NSWLR 711</tocase>
<text>38 In the case of Bankinvest AG v Seabrook (1988) 14 NSWLR 711 at 438 ('Bankinvest') Rogers AJA rejected a submission of counsel in that case that the common law principles of forum non conveniens continued to exist concurrently with the cross-vesting legislation, and observed that 'the former has clearly been subsumed by s 5(2)(b)(iii) [of the Cross-Vesting Act].'

52 Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ in BHP Billiton at 527, at [13] quoted with approval the following observations by Street CJ in Bankinvest :
 
 'The cross-vesting legislation passed by the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories both conferred on each of the ten courts Australia-wide jurisdiction and set up the mechanism regulating the transferring of proceedings from one of these ten courts to another. In relation to transfer, the common policy reflected in each of the individual enactments is that there must be a judicial determination by the court in which proceedings are commenced either to transfer or not to transfer the proceedings to one of the other nine based, broadly speaking, upon consideration of the interests of justice...It calls for what I might describe as a "nuts and bolts" management decision as to which court, in the pursuit of the interests of justice, is the more appropriate to hear and determine the substantive dispute.'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/61.html</AustLII>
<text>45 In the event that I am wrong in the views that I have expressed, I would decline to stay the Federal Court proceedings.

51 In BHP Billiton , Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ said at 527, at [14]:
 
 'In the context of the Cross-Vesting Act, one is not concerned with the problem of a court, with a prima facie duty to exercise a jurisdiction that has been regularly invoked, asking whether it is justified in refusing to perform that duty. Rather, the court is required by statute to ensure that cases are heard in the forum dictated by the interests of justice. An application for transfer under s 5 of the Cross-Vesting Act is brought upon the hypothesis that the jurisdiction of the court to which the application is made has been regularly invoked. If it appears to that court that it is in the interests of justice that the proceedings be determined by another designated court, then the first court "shall transfer" the proceedings to that other court. There is a statutory requirement to exercise the power of transfer whenever it appears that it is in the interests of justice that it should be exercised. It is not necessary that it should appear that the first court is a "clearly inappropriate" forum. It is both necessary and sufficient that, in the interests of justice, the second court is more appropriate.'

<tocase>Anderson Formrite Pty Ltd v Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd (2003) 206 ALR 614</tocase>
<text>56 Counsel for Lion Nathan submits that considerable weight must be given to the fact that the distribution agreement contains a clause whereby the parties have submitted to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales. Counsel relies upon observations by Simmonds J in Anderson Formrite Pty Ltd v Baulderstone Hornibrook Pty Ltd ( 2004) 206 ALR 614 at 618 where his Honour observed that weight should be given to a clause where parties have agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of a particular court even if the submission was to the non exclusive jurisdiction of that court, but that greater weight should be given if the parties have submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court.

57 Counsel for Plantagenet submitted that on the proper construction of the clause Plantagenet has not submitted its TP Act claims to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales. The submission to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the New South Wales Court was limited to claims relating to the construction and performance of the distribution agreement, and did not extend to claims of misrepresentation leading to the entry into the agreement.

58 Secondly, counsel argued that the words 'courts of [New South Wales]' in the clause were apt to include the Federal Court which is a court which, inter alia, sits in New South Wales.</text>

<tocase>Green v Australian Industrial Investment Ltd (1989) 25 FCR 532</tocase>
<text>59 A non exclusive jurisdiction clause does not preclude a party bound by that clause from commencing proceedings in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction specified in the clause. The effect of the clause is that the contracting parties agree to submit to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the court specified in the clause, the claims that are within the scope of the clause. I accept the argument of counsel for Plantagenet that there is a relationship between the scope of the choice of law clause and the scope of the submission to the non exclusive jurisdiction in cl 24.7 of the distribution agreement. I also accept Plantagenet's argument that the words 'The Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this [agreement]' in that clause, refer to claims relating to the construction and performance of the distribution agreement and do not refer to claims of misrepresentation inducing the entry into the distribution agreement (see Green v Australian Industrial Investment Ltd (1989) 25 FCR 532 at 543 ('Green') ). However, a significant part of Plantagenet's claim in the Federal Court proceedings relates to allegations of breach of contract by Lion Nathan and, therefore, the fact that Plantagenet is party to a non exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the courts of New South Wales must be taken into account. In my view, the effect of the clause is that the parties have agreed that New South Wales is an appropriate forum to consider claims falling within the ambit of the choice of law clause, and have, thereby, agreed to accept the jurisdiction of that Court for the determination of those claims, but that does not mean that they have agreed that there is no other court, particularly within Australia, which may also be an appropriate forum. I am of the view, therefore, that, given the limited scope of the claims that the parties have agreed to submit to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the New South Wales courts, some, but not much, weight is to be accorded to the non exclusive jurisdiction clause, as a factor in favour of the Federal Court proceedings being transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court.

60 I do not regard it as helpful to address, in this context, the question of whether the Federal Court sitting in Sydney is within the ambit of the expression 'courts of [New South Wales]'. This is because the inquiry at hand requires an assessment of whether, by reference to its connecting factors to the Western Australia District Registry of this Court, as opposed to any other district registry, the Federal Court proceedings should be transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court.

61 I place no weight, additional to that already referred to, on the fact that the distribution agreement provides that the governing law of the distribution agreement is the law of New South Wales. This is because the Federal Court is a national court which applies the common and statutory law of each of the States when it is appropriate to do so. Further, Lion Nathan has not pointed to any distinguishing features in the law of New South Wales which it is anticipated, will assume any importance in the resolution of the controversy (see Green at 544).

62 I place no weight on the claim that the New South Wales proceedings are likely to be determined within a shorter period than the Federal Court proceedings. The evidence of Ms Ward is that the New South Wales proceedings could be heard within approximately six to seven months. The evidence of Ms Allison is that in her recent experience, it is possible for an application to get to trial in the Western Australia District Registry of this Court within a year of the date of issue, even in cases where there have been defaults in the timetable. In her view, if the parties were to comply with the timetable it would be possible to get a matter to trial in this Registry in a substantially lesser period of time. Ms Allison also deposes that she has been informed by Mr O'Connor, a partner of the Sydney law firm, Addisons, that in his experience a trial may be had in the Federal Court in Sydney within four to six weeks of the issue of the application if the disposition of the matter is regarded as urgent. In my view, evidence at this level of generality is of very limited value. What is more significant is that each court has the facilities available to the parties whereby each court is able to make directions, at the instance of the parties, for bringing the matter to trial within a short period of time.

63 I also place no weight on the claim that the proceedings are further advanced in the New South Wales Supreme Court. In this Court, Plantagenet has filed an application and a statement of claim. In the New South Wales proceedings, Lion Nathan has filed a statement of claim and a commercial list statement. In neither of the proceedings has a defence been filed. Further, in neither of the proceedings have directions been made for the progress of the proceedings to trial. Further, I place no weight on the submission that solicitors and counsel retained in New South Wales will have acquired such a familiarity with the case that it would be inefficient to waste that expertise. There has not been any contested application heard in the New South Wales proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool of WA [2000] FCA 974</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/974.html</AustLII>
<text>76 In the case of Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool of WA [2000] FCA 974 , Heerey J at [12] observed:
 
 'Financial aspects loom large in this matter. Cultivaust is a small company with an annual income of less than $200 000. Grain Pool is a substantial statutory corporation with revenues in excess of $600 million. The objective of access to justice is just as applicable in the area of commercial litigation between corporations as it is when individuals are involved. The extra expense involved in a transfer would be a substantial burden on Cultivaust and would exacerbate the existing imbalance of financial resources between these two litigants.'

77 Although those observations were made in the context of an application to transfer proceedings in the South Australia District Registry of this Court, to the Western Australia District Registry, Heerey J's observations are, in my view, equally applicable to an application for the transfer of proceedings under the cross-vesting legislation.

78 I accept the submissions by counsel for Plantagenet that there is a large disparity in financial resources between Plantagenet and Lion Nathan, and that the effect of having to conduct interstate litigation would be substantially more onerous on the financial resources of Plantagenet than it would be on the financial resources of Lion Nathan.

79 It has been necessary for Plantagenet to engage an additional firm of solicitors to act as its solicitors in New South Wales on instructions from Plantagenet's firm of solicitors in Perth, and that Plantagenet has also been required to engage counsel in New South Wales as well. By contrast, Lion Nathan has used its Sydney based firm of solicitors and counsel both in the New South Wales proceedings and the Federal Court proceedings. Lion Nathan can continue to do so in the event that the Federal Court proceedings are not transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court. No doubt if the Federal Court proceedings were to be tried in Perth, Lion Nathan may well have to incur the additional costs of transporting and accommodating its legal representatives in Perth for the trial, but those costs would be relatively minor, in comparison to the costs that Plantagenet would have to incur in having to retain for the duration of the proceedings a second firm of solicitors and a counsel in Sydney.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/671.html</AustLII>
<text>45 In the event that I am wrong in the views that I have expressed, I would decline to stay the Federal Court proceedings. This is because the appropriate test to apply in the circumstances is the test in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and not in Sterling Pharmaceuticals (see BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz [2004] HCA 61 ; (2004) 211 ALR 523 ('BHP Billiton') , the observations of Ormiston JA in Schmidt referred to above and Transport Workers' Union of Australia v Bentley [2001] FCA 671 ; (2001) 112 FCR 580). On the application of that test, it could not be said that the Western Australia District Registry of the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum for Plantagenet to commence the Federal Court proceedings. Plantagenet's principal place of business is in Western Australia, the alleged breaches of the TP Act occurred in Western Australia and the alleged losses were suffered in Western Australia.</text>
