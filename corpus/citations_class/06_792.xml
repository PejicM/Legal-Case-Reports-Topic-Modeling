<tocase>Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/36.html</AustLII>
<text>5 On 3 February 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment concerning the applicant's motion for default judgment and made the orders that Mr Armitage now seeks to have set aside: see Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 (" Wu ").

6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents. I found (at [52]-[53]) that the first and second respondents had failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence and were in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules. My reasons for judgment record that:
 
&#8226; The applicant (hereafter referred to as Ms Wu) was required to bring an application to the Court for an order for substituted service as regards Mr Armitage ([7]-[8]).
 
&#8226; Ms Wu applied twice by motion for orders that the respondents, including Mr Armitage, provide their lists of documents and the respondents, including Mr Armitage, breached orders of 8 October 2003 and 16 December 2003 for the provision of these lists ([10]-[13]). From September 2003 until 14 April 2004, Mr Armitage and the other respondents retained a solicitor (Mr Joseph Guss) ([8] and [15]). 
 
&#8226; Mr Armitage failed to make documents available for inspection, despite orders by the Court on 8 October 2003, 16 December 2003 and 9 June 2004 ([10]-[17]). Following an order for further discovery on 4 March 2004, Mr Armitage filed an affidavit stating that the first respondent's accounts and statutory records were "mistakenly removed by a waste paper removalist with various other papers and records" and that he was unable to locate his file in respect of Ms Wu's application for an Australian visa and her alleged investment in the first respondent ([14]). 
 
&#8226; After 14 April 2004, Ms Wu's solicitor's attempted to contact the respondents, including Mr Armitage directly. By a letter dated 21 April 2004, Mr Armitage informed Ms Wu's solicitors that he was "unable to facilitate" the inspection of the discovered documents because they were "located at the office of Joseph Guss" ([15]).
 
&#8226; On the first occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that she was instructed by solicitors who expected to act in the matter. This expectation was not fulfilled ([17]). 
 
&#8226; On the second occasion when Ms Wu's motion for default judgment came on for hearing, different counsel appeared for Mr Armitage. Counsel advised that he was instructed by solicitors, who subsequently advised the Court that they were no longer retained to act for Mr Armitage (or any other respondent) in the proceeding ([19]).
 
&#8226; Although it was made clear in court on 13 October 2004 that it was open to the respondents to serve a subpoena on their previous solicitor (Mr Guss) to produce the discovered documents to the Court the respondents did not take steps to do this until 3 December 2004 ([19] and [21]).
 
&#8226; On 3 December 2004, George Liberogiannis and Associates went on record as solicitor for the Armitages, including Barry Armitage. Mr Liberogiannis did not, however, appear on the return of the subpoena. The subpoena was not discharged against Mr Guss until 16 February 2005 ([21]-[22]).
 
&#8226; At the adjourned hearing of the motion for default judgment on 27 April 2005, Mr Liberogiannis sought leave to withdraw as the solicitor on the record. His evidence was that Barry Armitage and his son had failed to keep appointments with counsel and to provide him with instructions for the conduct of the matter, notwithstanding his numerous calls to their cell phones and place of residence. His firm filed a notice of ceasing to act for Barry Armitage and his son on 28 April 2005 ([24]).

7 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons stated in Wu at [54] and following, I declined to make orders in terms of the motion for default judgment. At [54]-[55], I said:
 
 "I would not order that judgment be entered without more because, following the return of the subpoena directed to Mr Guss, there remains no continuing and unexplained default on the respondents' part. If Barry Armitage's evidence is accepted, there is nothing more the respondents can do to facilitate inspection of documents. Although Mr Guss did not produce all of the documents the subject of the subpoena, Barry Armitage has affirmed that the remaining documents remain in Mr Guss' custody. Ultimately, the credibility (or lack thereof) of Barry Armitage's claims regarding these and like matters will be an issue for trial: see Australian Finance Group Ltd v Accent Financial Group Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 66 at [33] per Nicholson J. Whether he is believed or not is likely to have other consequences for this litigation. 
 
 I note too that there may be circumstances that partly explain the delays. These circumstances include the ill health of Barry Armitage and of a family member and the disturbance caused by changes in legal representation. Moreover, although the respondents have needed repeated prompting by Ms Wu's solicitor, they have filed their defence, various affidavits responding to Ms Wu's claims and lists of discoverable documents. They have mostly participated in court hearings and they were represented at the mediation by their solicitor. Barry Armitage ultimately took steps to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, in order that Ms Wu have access to the first and second respondents' discovered documents."

10 Mr Armitage's earlier affidavits, the affidavits of the third and fourth respondents and Ms Saldaneri are mentioned in Wu at [27] and [31]. Mr Armitage's lengthy affidavit of 16 May 2006 deposes to matters of fact. It also contains what are in truth submissions on his motion. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that Mr Armitage claimed (amongst other things):
 
&#8226; Mr Armitage was unable to collect his documents relating to this matter from previously retained counsel (Mr Dennis Baker) until 4 May 2006. He had not previously seen some of these documents. 
 
&#8226; Prior to the hearing on 27 April 2005, Mr Armitage had no knowledge of the affidavit of Anna Maria Krycer of 12 April 2005; that Mr Lieberogiannis intended to seek leave to withdraw from the proceeding; and that he would be unrepresented at that hearing. He claimed that he was denied an opportunity to respond to Ms Krycer's affidavit and Mr Lieberogiannis' evidence.
 
&#8226; After receiving a copy of the 27 April 2005 order (granting leave to Mr Lieberogiannis to cease to act) Mr Armitage asked Registry "what was happening with the proceedings" and was told that "no other date had been appointed, and that it appeared that there was no further action or procedure contemplated". He returned to the Registry on two further occasions. He assumed the action was not proceeding.
 
&#8226; When the respondents retained Mr Guss, they gave Mr Guss all relevant documents and did not retain any copies. In early April 2004, there was a dispute between Mr Guss and Mr Armitage (and other respondents), as a consequence of which Mr Guss ceased to act for them. Mr Guss claimed a lien over the respondents' documents. Mr Armitage photocopied the documents on the Court file.
 
&#8226; After Mr Guss ceased to act, the respondents decided to draft instructions, affidavits and other documents needed in the proceeding and to engage counsel "to finalise documents and make any necessary Court appearances". Ultimately, a barrister's clerk "agreed to arrange for solicitors (not then known to the Respondents) to provide the 'Back Sheets' required to brief counsel". Mr Armitage added:
 
 "In practice, the arrangement ... did not provide a proper level of legal services and ... Mr Baker agreed to provide a 'budget-type' representation for the Respondents." 
 
 
 &#8226; Mr Liberogiannis agreed to act as solicitor on the record, "with the Respondents providing all secretarial-type support, full written instructions, and the like". Mr Baker agreed to supervise the work and retain the documents relevant to the proceeding. Mr Baker therefore held all relevant documents and the respondents retained no copies.
 &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son (the third respondent) attended Mr Baker's chambers frequently, "often on two occasions a week". Mr Armitage deposed: 
 
 "In the period leading up to 27 April 2005 I was aware that the matter was to come back before the Court fairly soon, but I was not aware of the nature of the anticipated proceedings." 


 
 &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son were unable to keep an arrangement to meet Mr Baker on 22 April 2005 and left a message that they would attend on 26 April 2005. They did not attend Mr Baker's chambers on 26 April 2005 because their car "broke down in the countryside" and they did not contact Mr Baker because "we were in an area of poor mobile telephone reception". &#8226; Mr Armitage did not find out about the 27 April hearing until after the scheduled time of the hearing. He added that "[w]e immediately tried to contact Mr Baker and he told us we should speak to Mr Liberogiannis". &#8226; Mr Armitage and his son made unsuccessful attempts to contact Mr Liberogiannis, whom he ultimately met "by chance" early this year. &#8226; Hereafter, the respondents intended to act on their own behalf and "to retain full control and ensure that all matters requiring attention are dealt with promptly". &#8226; Mr Armitage had severe health problems and associated difficulties, including inability to give "sustained personal attention to ... this litigation". &#8226; Mr Armitage resigned as director of the first respondent because it could be insolvent. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not intentionally avoid service of the documents initiating this proceeding. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not attend court because of his health, the fact he had legal representation, and because Ms Wu, through her solicitors, had threatened him. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware of Ms Wu's desire to inspect the discovered documents until he received a letter dated 20 April 2004 from her solicitors. He responded the next day. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not become aware until late November or early December 2004 that the Court had indicated that it would give leave to issue a subpoena to Mr Guss to obtain the documents for Ms Wu's inspection. He claimed that Mr Guss still held relevant documents. &#8226; Mr Armitage did not know that Mr Liberogiannis had failed to attend on the return of the subpoena. He did not knowingly breach any order of the Court. He "should not be held responsible for ... delays ... during the time" when Mr Guss and Mr Liberogiannis acted for him.

11 In addition, Mr Armitage challenged the reliability of the evidence of Ms Xia but it is unnecessary to provide the details of that challenge here. He also expanded on his claim that the initiating application and statement of claim in the proceeding were "based on a serious fraud and constitutes an abuse of the processes of this ... Court". He asserted that Ms Wu had made fraudulent claims in relation to her migration objective and investment claims. He responded to Ms Wu's claims against him at some length and alleged that her former and present solicitors had acted improperly in various ways. It is unnecessary to set out the details of these various allegations here.

12 In his affidavit of 16 May 2006, Mr Armitage further contended that the costs order of 3 February 2006 was unjust. This was because the primary matter in dispute had been the production of documents, over which he had no control. Also, so he said, Ms Wu's claims were fraudulent and, if he were required to meet the costs order before the determination of the proceeding, he would be prevented from defending himself. Mr Armitage specifically noted that paragraphs 36 and 38 of the statement of claim alleged that he acted dishonesty.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/363.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Counsel for Ms Wu opposed Mr Armitage's motion, noting that Mr Armitage was represented by counsel on the hearing of Ms Wu's motion on two occasions when the motion was part heard. It was only on the third and final occasion, when the hearing of the motion was completed, that Mr Armitage's solicitor obtained leave to withdraw. Counsel submitted that the relevant principles were contained in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black on White Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 363 (" Black on White ") and Microsoft Corporation v Crosslink Marketing Group [2005] FCA 1817 at [21] . He argued that there were no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify setting aside the orders in question. In this regard, he pointed out that Mr Armitage was heard, through his counsel, on the motion on two occasions and the affidavit material on which he relied was before the Court. The fact that his solicitor "went off the record" on 27 April 2005 "did not make any difference to the Orders". Further, counsel submitted that, having regard to the contents of Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006, it is not reasonably probable that he would have obtained orders other than the orders made on 3 February 2006 had that affidavit been before the Court. Finally, Mr Armitage's affidavit did not, so counsel submitted, establish fraudulent conduct and satisfy the requisite tests for setting aside on the ground of fraud.

25 Some care must be taken in dealing with the authorities that concern the setting aside of judgment or orders. The force of judicial observations in this area depends on the circumstances in which application to set aside is made, including whether the judgment or order has been entered or is final or interlocutory. For present purposes, it suffices to refer to the observations of the Full Court in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 at 552 that the jurisdiction to set aside orders made after they have been entered is "exceptional": see also Black on White at [14]-[16].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1966/36.html</AustLII>
<text>22 First, I accept that the orders made on 3 February 2006 were interlocutory in nature. "[A]n order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se, although it may, of course conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made, is interlocutory only": Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440 per Taylor J. It is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(c).

23 Secondly, I accept that Mr Armitage was not in court when the relevant orders were made on 3 February 2006 and that he was absent from a part of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion. That is, Mr Armitage was represented by his counsel at the hearing of the motion on 23 August and 13 October 2004, but was effectively unrepresented at the hearing on 27 April 2005, when his solicitor successfully obtained leave to withdraw. Accordingly, it is open to Mr Armitage to call in aid O 35 r 7(2)(a).</text>

<text>24 Thirdly, although Mr Armitage sought also to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b), he has not adduced sufficient evidence to make out a case that the order was obtained by fraud. Plainly, any allegation of fraud is extremely serious. Before an order can be set aside on the ground of fraud, there must be sufficient evidence of the facts that establish the alleged fraudulent conduct and the part played by the party having the benefit the order. The fraudulent conduct must be "directly material" to the order and the evidence of the fraud must be evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered with reasonable and proper diligence before the order under challenge was made: see Monroe Schneider Associates (Inc) v No 1 Raberem Pty Ltd (No 2) (1992) 37 FCR 234 at 242. Mr Armitage's affidavit of 16 May 2006 did not satisfy these requirements. Accordingly, it is not open to him to rely on O 35 r 7(2)(b).</text>

<tocase>KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung (" KM &amp; A Chadwick ") [1995] FCA 354</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1995/354.html</AustLII>
<text>34 Mr Armitage stated on oath that the respondents made the arrangements that led to the retainer of legal representatives, who knew little or nothing of their case and took little or no responsibility for its ongoing conduct. This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes. Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives. They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute. Nor can they excuse themselves by relying on a series of "unfortunate events", as Mr Armitage sought to do. If it were otherwise, case management would prove virtually impossible: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 (" KM &amp; A Chadwick ") at [15] per Tamberlin J.

35 Ms Wu has, moreover, proceeded to the taxation contemplated by the orders in question, as indeed she was entitled to do. In so doing she has incurred further costs. In this regard, I note, however, that Mr Armitage has been most assiduous in contesting the taxation. His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings.

36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick .

37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence. Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result. That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable. It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence.

38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders. For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion. As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>41 The power of the Court to make an order for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Costs ordinarily follow the event and are awarded on a party-party basis, unless there are particular or special circumstances which warrant the Court departing from this practice and making some other order: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 232-233 per Sheppard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. Since Ms Wu was in substance successful, she was and remains entitled to an order for costs. She continues to submit that an indemnity costs order is appropriate.

42 Whilst the Court has power to make an order for costs on an indemnity basis, the question is whether the Court should so exercise its discretion in the particular case. A court may award indemnity costs in respect of misconduct which causes loss of time to the Court and to other parties: Tetijo Holdings Ltd v Keeprite Australia Pty Ltd (Fed C of A, French J, WAG 55 of 1988, 3 May 1991, unreported) referred to with approval in Colgate-Palmolive at 233; Ugly Tribe Co Pty Ltd v Sikola [2001] VSC 189 at [7] per Harper J. As Mason P, with whom Meagher and Clarke JJA agreed, said in Rosniak v Government Insurance Office (1997) 41 NSWLR 608 at 616, "the court requires some evidence of unreasonable conduct, albeit that it need not rise as high as vexation" before departing from the usual party and party costs order. The procedural history provides sufficient evidence of unreasonable conduct on the part of Mr Armitage, through his legal representatives or personally, to continue to justify an indemnity costs order on Ms Wu's motion.</text>

The procedural history provides sufficient evidence of unreasonable conduct on the part of Mr Armitage, through his legal representatives or personally, to continue to justify an indemnity costs order on Ms Wu's motion.</text>

<tocase>Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/223.html</AustLII>
<text>45 Mr Armitage is now an unrepresented litigant and has been so since Mr Liberoginnias ceased to represent him on 27 April 2005. Prior to that date, he had legal representation. Like many unrepresented litigants, he is impecunious. Generally speaking, courts are more reluctant to make orders for indemnity costs against litigants in person than against legally represented litigants, although, in an appropriate case, they will make such an order: see Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [57] and [60] per O'Loughlin, Whitlam and Marshall JJ. Further, impecuniosity is generally not a sufficient reason to deprive a party otherwise entitled to a costs order of the benefit of such an order: compare Selliah v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [1998] FCA 469 per Nicholson J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1999/1639.html</AustLII>
<text>47 Order 62 rule 3(2) permits the Court to order that costs be paid forthwith notwithstanding that the proceeding has not concluded. Weinberg J reviewed the authorities in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 , concluding at [38] that "[t]he discretion which is vested in the Court to order that a party's costs be taxed and paid forthwith should be exercised only where the interests of justice in the particular case require that there be a departure from the general practice". See also Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd [1998] FCA 545 per Branson J. In Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd (No 3) [2004] FCA 347 at [21] , Sackville J said that that "[i]t appears to be broadly accepted that some reason must be shown to depart from what Lehane J in Vasyli described as the 'clear practice of the Court'". At [22] his Honour referred to the variety of circumstances that had thus far been regarded as justifying departure from the general rule.</text>
