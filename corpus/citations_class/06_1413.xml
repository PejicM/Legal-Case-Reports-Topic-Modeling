<tocase>Church of Scientology Inc v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/38.html</AustLII>
<text>17 There is no dispute that ASIO may be subject to judicial review. So much was conceded in, and accepted by, the High Court in Church of Scientology Inc v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25. There are limits on the scope of that review but the usual administrative law remedies would be available to the applicants if they are able to establish jurisdictional error.

18 The primary difficulty that each of the applicants faces in bringing his claim is that he has not seen his adverse security assessment and alleges that he does not know the facts or reasoning by which the Director-General made the adverse security assessment. Without this material, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the applicants to make out their claim that the adverse security assessments were not made in accordance with law. It is therefore critical to the applicants that the Court order discovery of, at very least, the adverse security assessments. I therefore ordered, on 1 June 2006, that the parties make submissions on discovery, which they have subsequently done both in writing and at the hearing on 20 July 2006.

40 In Church of Scientology v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25, the High Court had to consider a claim that the Director-General of ASIO did not have a reasonable basis for believing that members of the Church of Scientology were a security risk and therefore had no power to investigate them. It was accepted that judicial review of the ASIO Act was available.

43 It is apparent from these passages that what Brennan J had in mind was not merely discovery, but the dual process of discovery and production. His use of the word discovery appears to be a short-hand reference to this dual process. Because the Court in Church of Scientology did not need to decide whether to order discovery, Brennan J's obiter remarks were directed to difficulties generally in bringing review proceedings against ASIO. They were not directed to the important distinction between discovery and the subsequent production of non-privileged discovery documents. Mason J's judgment also refers to the difficulties in bringing this type of claim. He notes, at 61, that:
 
 "Crown privilege may exclude from consideration the very material on which the plaintiff hopes to base his argument ... [but the] fact that a successful claim for privilege handicaps one of the parties to litigation is not a reason for saying that the Court cannot or will not exercise its ordinary jurisdiction; it merely means that the Court will arrive at a decision on something less than the entirety of the relevant materials."

44 The reference to Crown privilege demonstrates that His Honour has in mind the production of documents at least as much as the discovery of them, for it is at the production stage that a successful claim for privilege may thwart a plaintiff. The Church of Scientology case may have critical implications for the parties at the production stage, but it is not determinative of the discovery question.

45 The Director-General submits that there is no live issue between the parties and that discovery therefore should not be ordered. In order to make out their respective claims, the applicants will need to demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the Director-General. They will need to show that there was no evidence on which ASIO could have formed the opinion that the applicants were security threats. Given the extreme difficulty of this task, the Court should not be satisfied that the applicants have a good case proof of which may be aided by discovery.

46 I am not persuaded by this argument. The applicants' claim is that they have done nothing to justify their security assessments. Therefore ASIO must be wrong to conclude that they are security threats. In order to demonstrate this to a court they need to understand why and on what basis ASIO has formed the view that it has. It stands to reason that they do not yet have the evidence to demonstrate this; that is why they have sought discovery. The Director-General's argument is circular. It is, in effect, that because the applicants do not have the evidence they need, they therefore have no case and so do not need that evidence. In the circumstances of these applicants, it is not possible to say whether they do or do not have any chance of making out a good case. It would be premature at this stage to say that there is no live issue between the parties.</text>

<tocase>Home Office v Harman [1983] 1 AC 280</tocase>
<text>19 Discovery in this Court is discretionary. It is governed by Order 15 of the Federal Court Rules . In particular, r 15.15 provides that the Court will not make an order for discovery "unless satisfied that the order is necessary at the time when the order is made." The exercise of this discretion is usually seen as involving the balancing of competing interests. In Home Office v Harman [1983] 1 AC 280, 308, Lord Keith said:
 
 "Discovery constitutes a very serious invasion of the privacy and confidentiality of a litigant's affairs. It forms part of English legal procedure because the public interest in securing that justice is done between parties is considered to outweigh the private and public interest in the maintenance of confidentiality."

20 Relevant factors in determining whether or not the discretion should be exercised include the burden on the discovering party, the benefits of discovery and the circumstances of the discovering party: see Practice Note 14. Further factors include whether discovery would constitute a "fishing exercise" and whether there are policy reasons not to order it.

21 The ASIO Act, by s 6, continues the operation of ASIO. The Director-General is appointed pursuant to s 7 and, by virtue of sub-s 8(1), controls ASIO.</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 426</tocase>
<text>34 Courts have long been wary of ordering discovery to enable parties to 'fish' for a case. Of the term 'fishing expedition' in the discovery context, Lindgren J in Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 426 at 438 said:
 
 "ex hypothesi, the giving of discovery will often, if not always, reveal documents of which the other party was not previously aware ... What is meant is that discovery must not be used for the purpose of ascertaining whether a case exists, as distinct from the purpose of compelling the production of documents where there is already some evidence that a case exists"</text>

<tocase>WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1980) 41 FLR 175</tocase>
<text>35 In WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman ((1980) 41 FLR 175 at 181-182) Brennan J, with whom Bowen CJ agreed, said:
 
 "In the present case, discovery is sought before there is a tittle of evidence to suggest that the [respondent] did not have the requisite cause to believe which par 6 of the statement of claim would put in issue. Some assistance was sought to be derived from cases where discovery had been given to a party before he was required to give particulars of his claim ... but in cases of that kind there is either an anterior relationship between the parties which entitles one to obtain information from the other, or sufficient is shown to ground a suspicion that the party applying for discovery has a good case proof of which is likely to be aided by discovery. This is not such a case. This is a case where a bare allegation is made ... and, the paragraph being denied, the applicant seeks to interrogate the [respondent] and ransack his documents in the hope of making a case. That is mere fishing."

41 The Court noted that discovery and production were critical issues in any judicial review proceeding under the ASIO Act. Brennan J said, at 75, that "[i]t would be an unusual case, however, if a plaintiff without discovery against the Director-General could discharge the burden of proving that [ASIO] had engaged in the particular activity of which he complains". He continued, at 76:
 
 "discovery would not be given against the Director-General save in a most exceptional case. The secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage, sabotage, etc is essential to national security, and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice 
 ... 
 Nevertheless, the veil of secrecy is not impenetrable, for the public interest in litigation to enforce the limitation of function prescribed by s 17 is never entirely excluded from consideration ... But the veil is not penetrated merely by a plaintiff's deposition that he is not a security risk."

42 Further on, at 76-77, his Honour noted the "large obstacles in the path of a plaintiff" seeking orders against ASIO. These obstacles arise in part because "of the restrictions imposed upon discovery in aid of proving, and upon the admission of evidence in proof of, what is and what is not relevant to security".

43 It is apparent from these passages that what Brennan J had in mind was not merely discovery, but the dual process of discovery and production. His use of the word discovery appears to be a short-hand reference to this dual process. Because the Court in Church of Scientology did not need to decide whether to order discovery, Brennan J's obiter remarks were directed to difficulties generally in bringing review proceedings against ASIO. They were not directed to the important distinction between discovery and the subsequent production of non-privileged discovery documents. Mason J's judgment also refers to the difficulties in bringing this type of claim. He notes, at 61, that:
 
 "Crown privilege may exclude from consideration the very material on which the plaintiff hopes to base his argument ...

<tocase>Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (1990) 51 IR 113</tocase>
<text>36 More recently, it has been observed by Full Courts of this Court that the reluctance of the court to allow a fishing expedition is not as great as it once was: Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (1990) 51 IR 113; Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia v CanWest Global Communications Corp [1997] FCA 578 ; see also Bertran v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1753 at [18] to [23]. There are two significant reasons for this. The first is that the Federal Court Rules do not, as most jurisdictions traditionally did, provide for discovery as of right. The second is the introduction in 1988 of Order 15A and its equivalents in other jurisdictions which permit preliminary discovery and discovery against a non-party. These considerations led Burchett J (with whom Lockhart and Gummow JJ agreed) to conclude in Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (1990) 51 IR 113 at 116 that " This [fishing] objection to applications for discovery of documents does not now have the weight it was once thought to have. Perhaps it should be seen as a metaphor with more colour than substance."

37 In a sense, the present application is a fishing expedition, and as much is admitted by the applicants. But I do not think it is an impermissible fishing expedition. The purpose of the discovery that is sought is not for the applicants to determine if they have a case. If the applicants are right that they have no idea why the adverse security assessments have been made, then it follows that they must have a case that is at least arguable. Their case is that, because they have done nothing to constitute a threat to national security, any finding that they are such a threat must have been made in error. The purpose of discovery is to determine the nature of that error, not whether it exists. The classes of document sought are not overly broad and can be stated simply. The existence of the security assessments is admitted and the existence of documents supporting them can be readily inferred. The 'fishing' allegation does not dissuade me from ordering discovery.

38 I have said at [32] that discovery and production are not the same thing; a party may be entitled to the one but not the other. So far, I have not had to consider whether the applicants would be entitled to have produced to them or to their legal advisers the documents sought in discovery. That question was not addressed in argument. If I were satisfied that under no circumstances could they compel production of the documents sought, then I would be inclined against ordering discovery on the ground that it would be futile. For the same reason that a court will not grant leave to hear an appeal that is doomed to fail, it should not generally order discovery of a document production of which can never be compelled. Courts do not make nugatory orders.</text>
