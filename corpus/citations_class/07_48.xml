<tocase>Gerah Imports Pty Ltd v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) (1993) 61 SASR 557</tocase>
<text>20 It is plain that the examinable affairs of a company (as defined in s 53 of the Act) may include information as to the capacity of a person who is or may be liable to the company in the event of successful proceedings against that person: see Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd v Barber (1994) 48 FCR 301 at 311-312; Gerah Imports Pty Ltd v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) (1993) 61 SASR 557; Re BPTC Ltd (In Liq) (1994) 14 ACSR 460. A liquidator may seek to be in a position to determine, in a commercial sense as well as a legal sense, how the liquidator is best able to discharge duties to the company in liquidation.</text>

<tocase>Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd v Barber (1994) 48 FCR 301</tocase>
<text>20 It is plain that the examinable affairs of a company (as defined in s 53 of the Act) may include information as to the capacity of a person who is or may be liable to the company in the event of successful proceedings against that person: see Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd v Barber (1994) 48 FCR 301 at 311-312; Gerah Imports Pty Ltd v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) (1993) 61 SASR 557; Re BPTC Ltd (In Liq) (1994) 14 ACSR 460. A liquidator may seek to be in a position to determine, in a commercial sense as well as a legal sense, how the liquidator is best able to discharge duties to the company in liquidation.

24 I do not accept that the November Order could not, in the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 596D, require the production of documents relating to Mr Viscariello's capacity to meet any judgment. The authorities are plain that that topic falls within the examinable affairs of a corporation. In Grosvenor 48 FCR, the Full Court (Beaumont, Spender and Cooper JJ) at 311 distinguished between the power of the Court to have made such an order on the one hand, and the control of the examining officer in the course of an examination on the other. Consequently, I do not accept the contention that seeking information about Mr Viscariello's capacity to meet any judgment, even at an early stage of the investigation process, was necessarily inappropriate or that the Court did not have power to order production of documents for that purpose. However, I do not regard the scope of the documents required to be produced by the summons as limited to seeking practical information as to the actual worth of any claim that might be made against Mr Viscariello.

25 The width of pars 2-4 of the schedule to the summons is self-evident. They are in the following terms:
 
 
 "2. All documents, which are in your possession or control, including but not limited to letters, memoranda, notes, invoices, statements or schedules, whether in electronic or hardcopy format, relating to or otherwise concerning your personal financial position from December 2001 to the present, including but not limited to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.1 taxation returns;
 2.2 contracts of employment;
 2.3 share certificates;
 2.4 bank account statements;
 2.5 title deeds;
 2.6 mortgages;
 2.7 certificates of registration; and
 2.8 superannuation returns 
 
 
 
 
 
 of you personally, any trust of which you are a beneficiary, trustee or settlor, or of any private company of which you are a shareholder or member. 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. For the purpose of paragraph 2 above, 'personal financial position' includes, but is not limited to, details of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.1 income received;
 3.2 legal or equitable interests in chattels, including motor vehicles, boats, furniture, jewellery, whitegoods and the like;
 3.3 legal or equitable interests in real property;
 3.4 cash in bank accounts;
 3.5 investment portfolios (including but not limited to share portfolios, managed investment funds, property trusts) in which any interest is held whatsoever;
 3.6 liabilities or debts, including but not limited to credit cards, mortgages and loan facilities, including any such facility relating to either real property or chattels. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. All documents which are in your possession or control, including but not limited to letters, memoranda, notes, invoices or schedules, whether in electronic or hardcopy format, relating to all transfers of any interests in real property or chattels, whether legal or equitable, taking place in the period from December 2001 to the present."

26 Counsel for Mr Lock first sought to justify those paragraphs of the schedule in their terms, but subsequently on instructions proposed that they be somewhat varied so that pars 2.2-2.7 be struck out, and that the documents to be produced be confined to those "referring to or relating to assets or transactions with a value of at least $5000". It was also proposed that par 4 be varied, but not in a way which, in my view, limited its scope. It was proposed to remove the words "whether legal or equitable' and substitute the words "any trust of which [Mr Viscariello] is a beneficiary, trustee or settlor, or of any private company of which [Mr Viscariello] is a shareholder or member."</text>

<tocase>Harvey v Burfield (2002) 84 SASR 11</tocase>
<text>11 A similar contention succeeded in Harvey v Burfield (2002) 84 SASR 11. In that case, there had been no order that the liquidators were appointed severally, so Perry J concluded after a review of the authorities that they should be regarded as having been appointed jointly. Consequently, his Honour said at 16, [37]:
 
 " ... where two or more liquidators are appointed, the appointment should be regarded as joint and not several, so that absent any statutory provision to the contrary, liquidators must act together and are unable to authorise any one or more of them to act on behalf of all of them."
 

The position, as his Honour noted at 17, [42] may be different if the liquidators are appointed jointly and severally: cf Re Parker (1997) 80 FCR 1. Where liquidators are not appointed severally, s 506(4) would permit two of several (in the sense of "more than two or three, but not many" per Perry J at [53]) liquidators to exercise the powers of the liquidators under the Act. Perry J explained the operation of s 506(4) at 18, [55] in the following terms:
 
 "If it is accepted that where more than one liquidator is appointed the liquidators should be regarded as joint liquidators, with the consequence that they must act jointly and not severally in the exercise of any powers which may be conferred upon them, the reason why s 506(4) deals only with the situation where 'several liquidators' are appointed becomes clear. Absent any determination to the contrary made at the time of their appointment, where three or more liquidators are appointed, any power given by the Act may be exercised by any number not less than two ."</text>

<tocase>Re BPTC Ltd (In Liq) (1994) 14 ACSR 460</tocase>
<text>20 It is plain that the examinable affairs of a company (as defined in s 53 of the Act) may include information as to the capacity of a person who is or may be liable to the company in the event of successful proceedings against that person: see Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd v Barber (1994) 48 FCR 301 at 311-312; Gerah Imports Pty Ltd v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) (1993) 61 SASR 557; Re BPTC Ltd (In Liq) (1994) 14 ACSR 460. A liquidator may seek to be in a position to determine, in a commercial sense as well as a legal sense, how the liquidator is best able to discharge duties to the company in liquidation.

22 Mr Viscariello placed reliance upon BPTC 14 ACSR at 463 where McLelland CJ in Eq said:
 
 "The power to require an examinee to produce 'books' either by the terms of the examination summons (s 596D(2) and (3)), or by separate direction (s 97(9)), is similarly discretionary. Numerous recent cases have emphasised the importance of the difference between the legal ambit of these powers, and the appropriateness of their exercise in particular cases. The court must ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the legitimate interests of the person seeking the exercise of the court's power on the one hand, and those of the persons to be affected by any such exercise of power, on the other hand." 
 

It was argued that the legitimate requirements of the examination at present do not extend to investigating the capacity of Mr Viscariello to meet any judgment.

23 An examination under s 596A, as noted, was an entitlement of the liquidators. There was no discretion to decline to permit it. That, of course, does not preclude the Registrar presiding at the examination from deciding that certain questions are oppressive in all the circumstances and so not allowing them to be put. Most, if not all, the cases in which summonses such as the present have been contentious have involved discretionary examination orders under s 596B. Nevertheless, I think similar considerations arise where there is an examination ordered under s 596A and production ordered under s 596D. There may well be circumstances where examination on a particular topic is oppressive because the balance referred to in BPTC 14 ACSR 460 is not maintained at one stage of an examination and is at an adjourned stage of the examination, or is oppressive at one examination but not at any subsequent examination. Counsel for Mr Viscariello acknowledged that Mr Lock and Mr Sheahan might secure a further order for the examination of Mr Viscariello under s 596A at a later date and for the production of documents relating to his personal financial position to assess his capacity to meet any judgment.</text>
