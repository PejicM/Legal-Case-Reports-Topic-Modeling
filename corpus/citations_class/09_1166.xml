<text>Order 7 rule 9 of the Rules applies to service outside the jurisdiction in addition to service within Australia. In Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2007] FCA 124 at [8] , Allsop J noted that the various meanings that can be attributed to the word 'impractical' include 'practically impossible' or ' that (which) cannot be carried out or done '. I am satisfied that it has been impractical to serve the documents in the manner prescribed in the Rules.

I am also satisfied that the proposed course of service, by delivering a copy of the documents both by hand and by mail to Mr Sood at the residential address at which he appears to reside and at his business address and by email at his last known email address, is appropriate for the purpose of bringing the documents to Mr Sood's notice. Accordingly, I make orders 1 to 5 in the notice of motion.
 I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.
