<text>6 The above orders are an interlocutory judgment for the purposes of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act and the applicant needs leave to appeal: Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423. A single Judge has the power to determine the application by reason of s 25(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act .

7 The applicant was born on 1 December 1963 and is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. He arrived in Australia on 24 October 2004. On 2 November 2004 he lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. On 23 November 2004 a delegate of the Minister refused to grant a protection visa.

8 On 30 December 2004 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision, and on 17 January 2005 the applicant was invited to attend a hearing before the Tribunal on 23 February 2005. He was told that, without more, the Tribunal could not make a decision in his favour on the basis of the information before it. The applicant did not respond to the hearing invitation by 17 February 2005, and the Tribunal proceeded to deal with his application under s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). On 24 February 2005 the Tribunal decided to affirm the delegate's decision and it handed down that decision on 17 May 2005.

9 The applicant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his membership of a particular social group or political or religious opinions. This arose, he said, because of his membership of Falun Gong. The applicant claimed that he was the leader of Falun Gong in Tianjin and that he had been given many warnings by the local police. The applicant claimed that in December 1999 he was placed in detention for a period of one month and that in December 2002, after taking part in a demonstration against the local government, he was placed in detention for two months and forced to attend re-education classes.

10 The Tribunal was not satisfied on the information presented to it that the applicant had a genuine fear of persecution or that there was a real chance that he would be persecuted. The Tribunal referred to the information before it as 'very limited, vague and unreliable'.</text>

<text>14 In order to obtain leave to appeal, the applicant must show that the decision of the Magistrate is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by this Court and that substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong. Leave may be granted more readily where substantive rights are at issue, as distinct from cases which involve a point of practice or procedure: Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-400.

15 The Tribunal complied with the requirements of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), ss 425 , 425A , 426A and it was entitled to proceed to make its decision. It was entitled to conclude that the material before it was not sufficient to make out the applicant's claim. There is no arguable case of jurisdictional error and the decision of the Magistrate is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by this Court. In those circumstances, leave to appeal must be refused.

16 The application for leave to appeal is refused. The applicant must pay the first respondent's costs.
