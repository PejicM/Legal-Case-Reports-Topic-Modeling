<text>2 Greenwood J was exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court. There is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain a purported appeal in the Court's appellate jurisdiction from a judgment of the type given by Greenwood J: see s 24(1AAA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Accordingly, the process filed on 29 August 2006 does not engage the Court's appellate jurisdiction and does not otherwise engage the Court's jurisdiction save to the extent that I have jurisdiction to determine whether the Court has jurisdiction. So much was established by Khatri v Price [1999] FCA 1289 ; (1999) 95 FCR 287. I have jurisdiction to exercise the power to make an order under s 23 of the Act dismissing the process filed on 29 August 2006 as incompetent. A similar conclusion was reached by Spender J in BZAC v Refugee Review Tribunal (2005) FCA 675 which was referred to with approval by Conti J in a Full Court in Applicants 325/2002 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCAFC 59.</text>
