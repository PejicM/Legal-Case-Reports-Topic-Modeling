<tocase>Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/19.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The fundamental purpose of s 178 of the Act is to give the court the power in a supervisory role, to review acts, omissions or decisions of a trustee in bankruptcy made in the course of the administration of a bankrupt's estate on the application of any person with appropriate standing. Its operation is to be understood in its historical context ( Macchia v Nilant [2001] FCA 7 ; (2001) 110 FCR 101 ('Macchia') at 119 per French J), and in the context of the broader relationship between the court and the trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court ( Macchia at 116). For present purposes it is sufficient to note the following points about the scope of the section:
 
 1. Under the section, the court is fulfilling a supervisory role judicially, rather than an administrative role standing in the shoes of the trustee. As such, grounds for judicial review must be established by an applicant Re Wheeler; Ex parte Wheeler v Halse (1994) 54 FCR 166 (' Wheeler' ) at 170 per Lee J, and the exercise of the court's power is wholly in its discretion. The court has the 'widest possible discretion as to the appropriate order which should be made in the particular case' ( Re Tyndall; Ex parte Official Receiver (1977) 17 ALR 182 (' Re Tyndall ') at 186 per Deane J).
 2. The impugned act, omission or decision of the trustee in bankruptcy need not be absurd, unreasonable, or taken in bad faith before it is subject to review or a resultant order of the court under the section ( Re Tyndall at 186 per Deane J). Indeed, the act, omission or decision of the trustee may be subject to review even though it was commercially sound at the time it was made: Macchia at 116 per French J. At the same time the trustee's opinion will be a relevant factor in the exercise of the court's discretion, and there is no presumption that the court will intervene in a given case. The fact that the court might have taken a different course to the trustee in bankruptcy at the relevant time is not, without more, a basis to disturb the trustee's decision: Re Tyndall at 186 per Deane J; Macchia at 116 per French J.
 3. The court is able to take into account information which was not available to the trustee at the time of an impugned act, omission or decision ( Gray v Clout (1990) 27 FCR 141, 144 per Pincus J).
 4. The exercise of the discretion is subject to the principle that the court will not unduly interfere with the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate by a trustee in bankruptcy: Re Tyndall at 186 per Deane J.
 5. The section does not provide an avenue for a bankrupt to pursue his or her personal interests at the expense of creditors ( Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL [1996] HCA 19 ; (1996) 185 CLR 124 at 139 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) nor does it 'create a cause of action which sounds in damages', either in tort or under the general law ( Macchia at 119). Both of these propositions reflect the purpose of the section which is to give the court a supervisory role with respect to a trustee in bankruptcy in the administration of the bankrupt's estate. 
 6. Ultimately the question is what result would be 'just and equitable' in the circumstances of the case.

49 The bankrupt submitted that the appeals should proceed because he should be given the opportunity to restore his reputation. He referred to the comments Lander J made about him when considering his credibility as a witness. Those comments were certainly adverse to the bankrupt. I am prepared to assume for the purposes of argument and without deciding that restoration of reputation includes reputation damaged as a result of findings as to the credibility of the bankrupt in the proceedings. There is no suggestion in this case of the trustee being asked to assign any rights in relation to the appeals or of an indemnity for the costs of the appeals being offered to the trustee. Even if there were moneys in the estate a court 'would be unlikely to permit the bankrupt to pursue his personal interests in so far as they are not coincident with the due administration of the estate by the trustee, at the expense of the creditors': Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL (supra) at 139 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. This case is even stronger because there are no undisputed funds to pay for the prosecution of the appeals.</text>

<tocase>Gault, Re , Gault v Law (1981) 57 FLR 165</tocase>
<text>30 Section 179 requires the court to engage in a process which may involve two stages. First, the court must consider whether there is a basis to inquire into the conduct of a trustee in bankruptcy. Secondly, if an inquiry is undertaken, the court must consider what, if any, order should be made as a result of the inquiry. I note the following salient points with respect to the operation of the section in the case of the first stage. It is not necessary for me to consider the second stage because I do not think that there is a basis to inquire into the conduct of the trustee in bankruptcy.
 
 1. The question of whether to order an inquiry is in the broad discretion of the court, and the court should be reluctant to do so unless there are "substantial grounds for believing that the trustee erred in his administration" ( Re Gault , Gault v Law (1981) 57 FLR 165 (' Re Gault ') at 173 per Ellicott J, cited in Macchia at 120 per French J). This requirement has also been put in terms of 'sufficient grounds' ( Re Gault at 173 per Ellicott J), and 'a proper cause to believe that a trustee may have failed to act in relation to a bankruptcy in the manner required by the Act or the general law' ( Wilson v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] FCA 219 at [44] per Branson J). The onus is on the applicant to establish the grounds or case for an inquiry.
 2. As with s 178, the exercise of the court's discretion to order an inquiry is subject to the principle that the court will not unduly interfere with the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate by a trustee in bankruptcy: Re Tyndall at 120 per French J.
 3. As with s 178, s 179 is not a vehicle for a bankrupt or other person to seek damages which go beyond the making good of any loss to the bankrupt's estate caused by improper administration by the trustee in bankruptcy: Re Tyndall at 121 per French J.</text>

 6. Ultimately the question is what result would be 'just and equitable' in the circumstances of the case.

29 Section 179 is governed by similar, but not identical, considerations to those which are relevant to s 178. Unlike s 178, which relates to the review of specific acts, omissions or decisions of a trustee in bankruptcy in the administration of a bankrupt's estate, s 179 reflects the more general aspect of the court's supervisory role and allows it to carry out an inquiry into the 'conduct' of a trustee in relation to a bankrupt's estate or affairs (s 179(1)). As with s 178 the section is to be understood in the context of the role of the trustee in bankruptcy as an officer of the court. The section is typically employed where an allegation of misconduct or error by a trustee in bankruptcy arises ( Macchia at 120 per French J).

30 Section 179 requires the court to engage in a process which may involve two stages. First, the court must consider whether there is a basis to inquire into the conduct of a trustee in bankruptcy. Secondly, if an inquiry is undertaken, the court must consider what, if any, order should be made as a result of the inquiry.

<tocase>Moore v Macks [2006] FMCA 594</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/594.html</AustLII>
<text>20 As I have said, the Federal Magistrate had before him an application issued by the bankrupt on 16 March 2005 and seeking an order removing the trustee. The Federal Magistrate made a decision on the application insofar as it raised matters not related to the trustee's conduct in relation to the appeals ( Moore v Macks [2006] FMCA 594). On 27 April 2006 he made the following orders:
 
 
 '1. That the application filed on 16 March 2005 for orders pursuant to s 179(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act removing the respondent as trustee of the applicant's bankrupt estate and for orders relating to the trustee's conduct, other than his proposed abandonment of appeals instituted by the applicant in SAD175/04 and SAD176/04 in the Federal Court of Australia, be dismissed. 
 2. That further consideration of the application as it relates to orders sought arising out of the proposed abandonment of the said appeals be adjourned to Wednesday, 17 May 2006 at 9.30 am. 
 3. That the interim application filed on 10 April 2006 do stand dismissed.'

21 Those orders made by the Magistrate are the subject of an appeal to this Court which has not yet been heard and determined.

22 It seems that because the appeals had been called over before me, the Federal Magistrate considered that it may be appropriate for me to deal with what was then left of the application and on 13 June 2006 he made the following order:
 
 
 '1. Further hearing of these proceedings be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia before His Honour Justice Besanko on 22 June 2006 at 2.15 pm.'

23 The power to transfer a 'proceeding' to this Court is contained in s 39 of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth).

24 The application before me relates to the trustee's decision that he will not seek to prosecute the appeals. More accurately, in view of the events which have occurred, the decision is the trustee's decision that he will not seek an extension of time to elect for the purpose of prosecuting the appeals. I have considered the application under both s 179 and s 178 of the Act and I have concluded that there are no grounds under either section to impugn the trustee's decision.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/79.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The bankrupt challenged the sequestration order which had been made by a Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court. On 1 July 2005 a Federal Magistrate dismissed the bankrupt's application for review ( Moore v Wilson [2005] FMCA 870). The bankrupt appealed to this Court against the Federal Magistrate's order. On 10 February 2006 a Judge of this Court, exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, dismissed the bankrupt's appeal ( Moore v Wilson [2006] FCA 79). The bankrupt then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal from the Judge's decision. It seems that the bankrupt did not comply with those rules of the High Court which require documents to be filed by a certain date and, as a result, his application was deemed to be abandoned. At a prior hearing before me, the bankrupt told me that there were good reasons why he did not file the necessary documents and that they related to his health. He told me that he would be applying for a reinstatement of his application for special leave to appeal. Whether he has done so, or will do so, is not relevant to the issues raised by the application before me.</text>

It is not necessary for me to consider the second stage because I do not think that there is a basis to inquire into the conduct of the trustee in bankruptcy.
 
 1. The question of whether to order an inquiry is in the broad discretion of the court, and the court should be reluctant to do so unless there are "substantial grounds for believing that the trustee erred in his administration" ( Re Gault , Gault v Law (1981) 57 FLR 165 (' Re Gault ') at 173 per Ellicott J, cited in Macchia at 120 per French J). This requirement has also been put in terms of 'sufficient grounds' ( Re Gault at 173 per Ellicott J), and 'a proper cause to believe that a trustee may have failed to act in relation to a bankruptcy in the manner required by the Act or the general law' ( Wilson v Commonwealth of Australia [1999] FCA 219 at [44] per Branson J). The onus is on the applicant to establish the grounds or case for an inquiry.
 2. As with s 178, the exercise of the court's discretion to order an inquiry is subject to the principle that the court will not unduly interfere with the day-to-day administration of a bankrupt's estate by a trustee in bankruptcy: Re Tyndall at 120 per French J.
 3. As with s 178, s 179 is not a vehicle for a bankrupt or other person to seek damages which go beyond the making good of any loss to the bankrupt's estate caused by improper administration by the trustee in bankruptcy: Re Tyndall at 121 per French J.</text>

<tocase>Wilson v Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 912</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/912.html</AustLII>
<text>6 Mr Wilson and Ms Lawton instituted proceedings in this Court against Manna Hill Mining Company Pty Ltd ('Manna Hill Mining Company'), the bankrupt and six other parties. The proceedings came on for hearing before Lander J in February and April 2004. It is not necessary to describe the nature of the proceedings in detail. The following description of the three issues in the proceedings taken from the reasons for judgment of Lander J ( Wilson v Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 912 at [1] - [6] ) will suffice:
 
 'The applicants were directors of the first respondent, Manna Hill Mining Company Pty Ltd (Manna Hill Mining). The first question in these proceedings is to determine whether they are still directors of Manna Hill Mining. 
 
 The second respondent, Mr Moore, was, and is, a director of Manna Hill Mining and the seventh respondent, Hodgemore Pty Ltd. 
 
 The third respondent, Mr Hagger, was appointed a director of Manna Hill Mining on 12 June 2003 and resigned as a director of that company on 7 July 2003. He is a director of, and effectively controls, the fourth respondent, East Adelaide Company Pty Ltd. 
 
 The fifth respondent, Mr Spratt, and the sixth respondent, Mr Ewen, claim to be directors of Manna Hill Mining. They also claim to hold shares in Manna Hill Mining. The second question in this case is to determine whether those shares were validly issued and allotted on 12 June 2003 and 19 January 2004, and whether Mr Ewen and Mr Spratt were validly appointed as directors on 19 and 20 January 2004. 
 
 Mr Hagger and East Adelaide Company Pty Ltd have advised the Court that they will abide by any decision of the Court. The applicants called Mr Hagger as a witness. 
 
 Manna Hill Mining may or may not be in administration. That depends on the answers to the first two questions and is the third matter to be determined in these proceedings.'

7 The applicants in the proceedings were successful and a number of orders were made by Lander J on 16 July 2004 and 30 July 2004 respectively. The orders made on 30 July 2004 were orders as to the costs of the proceedings and included an order that the bankrupt pay the applicant's costs on an indemnity basis. His Honour delivered reasons for his costs orders: Wilson v Manna Hill Mining Company Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1035.

8 The bankrupt represented himself at the hearing of the proceedings as he did before me. Lander J found that he was an unsatisfactory witness. In his judgment dealing with the substantive issues his Honour said (at [94]-[98]):
 
 'I have had the opportunity of observing Mr Moore whilst he was giving his evidence, cross-examining witnesses and putting his arguments during the trial of these proceedings. 
 Mr Moore is a very determined man. He is consumed by Manna Hill Mining's activities and the activities of two other mining companies, Manna Hill Resources Pty Ltd and Manna Hill Gold Pty Ltd. He is a shareholder and director of all three companies. He worked extremely hard to take Manna Hill Mining out of administration and to resume trading. He is so consumed by the groups' activities that he will allow nothing to stand in his way. 
 He has a strong personality which he uses to dominate others. He is an aggressive and overbearing man. As I have said, he will allow nothing to stand in his way. I assess him as being ruthless and fearless. He is also, unfortunately, unprincipled. 
 For reasons which follow, I am of the opinion that the breakdown of his working relationship with Ms Lawton led him to claim, untruthfully, that Ms Lawton had resigned as a director of Manna Hill Mining on 24 March 2003. Because of the events on 27 May 2003, which I shall address in some detail, he determined to strip Mr Wilson of his control of Manna Hill Mining which he purported to do on 12 June 2003 and 19 January 2004. He then, methodically and ruthlessly, took steps to remove Mr Wilson as a director of Manna Hill Mining culminating in an extraordinary general meeting on 20 January 2004. He then attempted, on 6 February 2004, to put Manna Hill Mining's assets beyond the reach of Mr Wilson, even if Mr Wilson was successful in these proceedings. Lastly, he purported to put Manna Hill Mining into administration on 11 February 2004 to frustrate Mr Wilson's claims. 
 Mr Moore was a very poor witness. He prevaricated. He refused to address questions directly where a direct answer would embarrass his case. He was garrulous when it suited him. He was also untruthful when it suited him so to be. I am not prepared to act on any of his evidence, unless his evidence is corroborated or consistent with the evidence of the applicants and their witnesses. Wherever his evidence is in conflict with the evidence of any other witness, including the evidence of Mr Spratt, I prefer the evidence of those other witnesses. Wherever his evidence is contradicted by any document, I reject his evidence.'

9 I mention these findings of Lander J because the bankrupt told me that one of the reasons he wished to pursue the appeal and the application for leave to appeal was that it would give him an opportunity of restoring his reputation.

10 The bankrupt filed and served an appeal against the substantive orders made by Lander J and an application for leave to appeal against the costs order made against him. For convenience, I will refer to the appeal and the application for leave to appeal as 'the appeals'. The appeals were filed and served on 6 August 2004.

11 The creditor's petition presented by Mr Wilson and Ms Lawton and the sequestration order made on the petition were based on a judgment debt which in turn was based on costs orders made by Lander J in relation to interlocutory applications in the proceedings in March and April 2004.

12 The appeals are actions within s 60(2) and (3) of the Act and upon the making of the sequestration order on 21 January 2005 the prosecution or discontinuance of the appeals was in the hands of the trustee and not the bankrupt. Section 60(2), (3) and (4) of the Act provides as follows:
 
 
 '(2) An action commenced by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt is, upon his or her becoming a bankrupt, stayed until the trustee makes election, in writing, to prosecute or discontinue the action. 
 (3) If the trustee does not make such an election within 28 days after notice of the action is served upon him or her by a defendant or other party to the action, he or she shall be deemed to have abandoned the action. 
 (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, a bankrupt may continue, in his or her own name, an action commenced by him or her before he or she became a bankrupt in respect of: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) any personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, his or her spouse or a member of his or her family; or 
 (b) the death of his or her spouse or of a member of his or her family.'

13 The appeals do not fall within the terms of s 60(4) of the Act.

38 One of the issues before Lander J was whether Ms Lawton had resigned as a director of Manna Hill Mining Company. His Honour found that she had not. The bankrupt asserted that Ms Lawton had completed Centrelink forms in a way which indicated (or would indicate) that she had resigned as a director of Manna Hill Mining Company. The forms were not produced. This issue appears to have been raised at the trial. The issue is not referred to in the reasons for judgment of Lander J.

39 It is difficult to make anything of this because it is not clear precisely what the bankrupt is asserting or what was or can be established by evidence. The trustee was advised that the prospects of success on the appeal were not good and he appears to have adopted that view. The legal advice provided to him dealt with the bankrupt's assertions about the Centrelink forms and their completion by Ms Lawton. Nothing was established before me to suggest that the trustee placed inappropriate weight on this matter.

40 The bankrupt asserted that he was ill during the trial and that in all the circumstances, including the fact that he was not represented, the Judge erred in not adjourning the trial. The legal advice provided to the trustee dealt with this assertion and again, as with the previous matter, nothing was established before me to suggest that the trustee placed inappropriate weight on this matter.

48 The bankrupt submitted that the respondents to the appeals had stolen certain ore samples belonging to Manna Hill Mining Company, that they and others had acted illegally in breaking into his office and that Mr Iles, solicitor for the respondents, had given incorrect evidence before Lander J and acted improperly and illegally in a number of ways. The bankrupt sought to characterise the conduct of certain persons involved in events as illegal and improper but there is no evidence which would substantiate that conclusion. I take by way of example the alleged theft of certain ore samples by Mr Wilson and Ms Lawton. This allegation was the subject of findings by Lander J. His Honour found that Mr Wilson and Ms Lawton did what they did in order to preserve the company's assets. Nothing has been put before me to suggest that that conclusion is wrong. In any event, I am satisfied on all the evidence that the trustee has been independent and has considered in an objective and appropriate fashion the question of whether he should prosecute the appeals.

49 The bankrupt submitted that the appeals should proceed because he should be given the opportunity to restore his reputation. He referred to the comments Lander J made about him when considering his credibility as a witness. Those comments were certainly adverse to the bankrupt. I am prepared to assume for the purposes of argument and without deciding that restoration of reputation includes reputation damaged as a result of findings as to the credibility of the bankrupt in the proceedings. There is no suggestion in this case of the trustee being asked to assign any rights in relation to the appeals or of an indemnity for the costs of the appeals being offered to the trustee. Even if there were moneys in the estate a court 'would be unlikely to permit the bankrupt to pursue his personal interests in so far as they are not coincident with the due administration of the estate by the trustee, at the expense of the creditors': Cummings v Claremont Petroleum NL (supra) at 139 per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. This case is even stronger because there are no undisputed funds to pay for the prosecution of the appeals.</text>
