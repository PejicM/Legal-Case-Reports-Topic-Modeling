<text>296 In Booth v Bosworth [2001] FCA 1453 ; (2001) 114 FCR 39 at [115] , Branson J states:
 
 'In weighing the factors which support an exercise of the Court's discretion in favour of the grant of an injunction under s 475(2) of the Act against those factors which tell against the grant of such an injunction, it seems to me that it would be a rare case in which a Court could be satisfied that the financial interests of private individuals, or even the interests of a local community, should prevail over interests recognised by the international community and the Parliament of Australia as being of international importance.'</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/26.html</AustLII>
<text>54 Further, it is not to the point that the actual forestry operations will be undertaken by Gunns, or sub-contractors to Gunns, when s 8(1)(c)(i) of the Forestry Act vests in Forestry Tasmania exclusive management and control of all State forest. See also Coote v Forestry Tasmania [2006] HCA 26 ; (2006) 227 ALR 481 at 487, per Gummow J.

55 The Commonwealth, which was granted leave to intervene with respect to issue two, did not support the submission of Forestry Tasmania on the application of s 524(2) of the EPBC Act.

56 Gunns completed harvesting in coupe 17E on 16 August 2005. Mr Alec Dean, the then supervising officer from Forestry Tasmania, signed the final Forest Harvesting Monitoring Report on 25 August 2005. There is a current certified Forest Practices Plan for coupe 19D. It estimates that harvesting would have been completed by 30 June 2006. This proceeding ensured that did not happen. The Forest Practices Plan for coupe 19D expires on 31 August 2008. Implementation of that Plan will see the completion of roading and the harvesting of trees in the coupe. Roading is intended to be carried out by Gunns and harvesting by a contractor engaged by Gunns.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Another [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/190.html</AustLII>
<text>91 Mr Mooney's evidence supports the view that the forestry operations in Wielangta in coupes 17E and 19D and the proposed forestry operations in Wielangta in coupes other than 17E and 19D are not likely to have a significant impact on the eagle, having regard to its endangered status and all other threats to the eagle. However, despite that view, a question arises about whether, as a matter of law, an impact may be significant because of its 'cumulative' or 'potential' impacts; see Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Another ( 'Queensland Conservation Council' ) [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 at [60] .

92 As a Full Court said in Queensland Conservation Council at [53]: 
 
 'It is unhelpful, we consider, to attempt to paraphrase the expression "all adverse impacts" in s 75(2)(a) of the EPBC Act by recourse to phrases like "inextricably involved" or "natural consequence". "Impact" in the relevant sense means the influence or effect of an action: Oxford English Dictionary , [2 nd ed] 5. As the respondents submitted, the word "impact" is often used with regard to ideas, concepts and ideologies: "impact" in its ordinary meaning can readily include the "indirect" consequences of an action and may include the results of acts done by persons other than the principal actor. Expressions such as "the impact of science on society" or "the impact of drought on the economy" serve to illustrate the point. Accordingly, we take s 75(2) to require the Environment Minister to consider each way in which a proposed action will, or is likely to, adversely influence or effect the world heritage values of a declared World Heritage property or listed migratory species. As a matter of ordinary usage that influence or effect may be direct or indirect. "Impact" in this sense is not confined to direct physical effects of the action on the matter protected by the relevant provision of Pt 3 of Ch 2 of the EPBC Act. It includes effects which are sufficiently close to the action to allow it to be said, without straining the language, that they are, or would be, the consequences of the action on the protected matter. Provided that the concept is understood and applied correctly in this way, it is a question of fact for the Environment Minister whether a particular adverse effect is an "impact" of a proposed action. However, we do not consider that the Environment Minister did apply the correct test in answering the question of fact which had arisen in the present case.'

93 Mr Mooney's definition of 'impact' as embracing effects 'significantly close to allow it to be said that they are the consequences of forestry operations' provides a more limited view of the word 'impact' than that adopted by the Full Court, that is, the influence or effect of an action.

94 Even though forestry operations in Wielangta (in coupes 17E and 19D) and the proposed forestry operations in coupes other than 17E and 19D will cause a loss of breeding and foraging habitat for the eagle which is relatively insignificant in the context of other factors causing loss to such habitat, that loss can still be considered 'significant' in the context of legislation which is designed 'to protect native species (and in particular prevent the extinction, and promote the recovery, of threatened species)...'. Loss of habitat caused by forestry operations, while small when compared to other causes, has a significant impact on a threatened species where 'to protect' is seen as a duty not just to maintain population levels of threatened species but to restore the species.

295 Construction of the EPBC Act is informed by the Conventions which it implements in compliance with Australia's international obligations. So much was recognised by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc and Anor [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 (' Queensland Conservation Council ') at [2]:
 
 'The EPBC Act was enacted to implement the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity 1992 , and other international environmental agreements into Australian law. It also represents an attempt to consolidate and clarify the Commonwealth's responsibilities for environmental protection within the Australian Federation (see Second Reading Speech, House of Representatives, Hansard, 29 June 1999, at 7770). The objects of the EPBC Act are set out in s 3(1) as follows: 
 
 The objects of this Act are: 
 
 
 (a) to provide for the protection of the environment, especially those aspects of the environment that are matters of national environmental significance; and 
 (b) to promote ecologically sustainable development through the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of natural resources; and 
 (c) to promote the conservation of biodiversity; and 
 
 
 (ca) to provide for the protection and conservation of heritage; and 
 
 
 (d) to promote a co-operative approach to the protection and management of the environment involving governments, the community, land-holders and indigenous peoples; and 
 (e) to assist in the co-operative implementation of Australia's international environmental responsibilities; and 
 (f) to recognise the role of indigenous people in the conservation and ecologically sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity; and 
 (g) to promote the use of indigenous peoples' knowledge of biodiversity with the involvement of, and in co-operation with, the owners of the knowledge.'

297 The Biodiversity Convention referred to by the Full Court in Queensland Conservation Council underpins the EPBC Act. It obliges Australia to take steps to promote conservation and the recovery of threatened species; see Arts 8(d), (e) and (f).

298 Australia is also a signatory to the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (done at Apia, Western Samoa on 12 June 1976), otherwise known as the Apia Convention. Australia acceded to the Apia Convention on 28 March 1990 and it came into force in Australia on 26 June 1990. It requires Contracting Parties to:
 
 
 '1. ... in addition to the protection given to indigenous fauna and flora in protected areas, use their best endeavours to protect such fauna and flora (special attention being given to migratory species) so as to safeguard them from unwise exploitation and other threats that may lead to their extinction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. ... establish and maintain a list of species of its indigenous fauna and flora that are threatened with extinction. Such lists shall be prepared as soon as possible after this Convention has come into force and shall be communicated to the body charged with the continuing bureau duties under this Convention. 
 
 3. ... protect as completely as possible as a matter of special urgency and importance the species included in the list it has established in accordance with the provisions of the last preceding paragraph. The hunting, killing, capture or collection of specimens (including eggs and shells) of such species shall be allowed only with the permission of the appropriate authority. Such permission shall be granted only under special circumstances, in order to further scientific purposes or when essential for the maintenance of the equilibrium of the ecosystem or for the administration of the area in which the animal or plant is found. 
 
 4. ... carefully consider the consequences of the deliberate introduction into ecosystems of species which have not previously occurred therein.'

299 Section 139 of the EPBC Act implements these two Conventions by providing:
 
 'In deciding whether or not to approve for the purposes of a subsection of section 18 or section 18A the taking of an action, and what conditions to attach to such an approval, the Minister must not act inconsistently with: 
 (a) Australia's obligations under: 
 (i) the Biodiversity Convention; or 
 
 (ii) the Apia Convention; or 
 (iii) CITES; or 
 
 (b) a recovery plan or threat abatement plan.'</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/20.html</AustLII>
<text>301 The requirement in s 18(3) of the EPBC Act that an action not occur which is likely to have a significant impact on a listed threatened species must be seen in the context of an Act and Conventions which underlie the promotion of recovery of threatened species. Similarly, the exemption for RFA forestry operations in s 38 of the EPBC Act must be seen, in context, as providing an exception only if an alternative means of promoting the recovery of a species is achieved by a Regional Forest Agreement. Such an approach is consistent with the High Court's view of the influence of Conventions as an aid in interpreting domestic legislation designed to give effect to them; see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Ah Hin Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287 where Mason CJ and Deane J said:
 
 'It is accepted that a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with the established rules of international law.' 
 

That proposition, their Honours said, required courts to:
 
 '...favour a construction, as far as the language of the legislation permits, that is in conformity and not in conflict with Australia's international obligations.' 
 

I have adopted that approach in this judgment.

 I certify that the preceding three hundred and one (301) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.

<tocase>Re Ditfort; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347</tocase>
<text>235 The State of Tasmania refers the Court to Re Ditfort; ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347 (' Ditfort ') where Gummow J said at 370 there would be no 'matter' before the Court if it was required to consider 'undertakings and obligations depending entirely on political sanctions'. His Honour described such 'non-justiciable issues' as including 'agreements and understandings between governments within the federation'. It is noteworthy that in Ditfort , Gummow J held, at 373, that the non-justiciable principle did not apply because the Court had jurisdiction to deal with the matter in question and the issue of inter-governmental relations arose in the course of dealing with issues which were elements of the matter within jurisdiction.

236 I am not required to consider undertakings and obligations which depend entirely on political sanctions. I am required to consider whether s 38(1) of the EPBC Act applies and to perform that task properly I am required to consider whether Forestry Tasmania's forestry operations in Wielangta are conducted 'in accordance with' the RFA. If, in completing that task, this Court finds the RFA is not being applied to Forestry Tasmania's forestry operations in Wielangta, that does not mean the Court must cease dealing with the application, which is unquestionably within jurisdiction.

237 For the above reasons, I reject the contention that the Court cannot consider whether Forestry Tasmania's forestry operations in the Wielangta area will, or have been, carried out in accordance with the RFA by reference to cl 68. It is wrong to say that issue is non-justiciable. It is an issue on an amended agreed list of issues that the parties filed in the proceeding. It is an issue central to the proceeding, in that it must be answered in order to determine whether the s 38 exemption applies under the EPBC Act. I answer it below.</text>

<tocase>Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/203.html</AustLII>
<text>48 As Black CJ and Moore J said in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97 (' Save the Ridge '), 105 at [19]:
 
 'The apparent purpose of s 524 is to take the process of authorisation by governments or government agencies outside the purview of the EPBC Act by excluding certain decisions by those bodies from the concept of relevant "action".'

49 Forestry Tasmania is an agency of the State of Tasmania. It submits that as such it has granted to Gunns Limited ('Gunns') a 'governmental authorisation' under s 524(2) to conduct forestry operations in coupes 17E and 19D. It relies on Save the Ridge where a Full Court of this Court held that Ministerial approval and gazettal of changes to the National Capital Plan of the Australian Capital Territory, necessary to permit the construction of a road, was a decision of a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation to the Australian Capital Territory. Forestry Tasmania contends that an authorisation, when issued by a government body, will be a 'governmental authorisation when issued by the governmental body in its capacity as such' under s 524(2) of the EPBC Act.

50 Forestry Tasmania says the Forest Practices Plans for coupes 17E and 19D constitute the formal documents by which it authorised Gunns to conduct forestry operations. It submits that on this ground alone the application before the Court must fail.

51 The applicant contends that the submission of Forestry Tasmania referred to above depends on a characterisation of Forestry Tasmania's actions ('that is, logging, roading and the like') not as the physical activities involved, but as a product of a process where it authorises such activities to occur.

53 On this aspect of the proceeding, I prefer the applicant's submission. Save the Ridge is distinguishable because the attack in that case was on the steps taken to amend a plan which would authorise the construction of a freeway extension. There was no attack on the construction of the freeway extension. Here, there is no attack on a Forest Practices Plan, but on the work which is planned to take place under a Forest Practices Plan.</text>

<tocase>South Australia v The Commonwealth [1962] HCA 10 ; (1961-62) 108 CLR 130</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1962/10.html</AustLII>
<text>224 Forestry Tasmania (in this regard supported by the State of Tasmania) submits that compliance by the State with its obligations under cl 68 of the RFA is a non-justiciable issue. In that regard, it refers to and relies on South Australia v The Commonwealth [1962] HCA 10 ; (1961-62) 108 CLR 130.

225 Alternatively, Forestry Tasmania submits that forestry operations are 'in accordance with the RFA' if they fall 'within the parameters of the RFA and [do] not conflict with the terms of the RFA, considered broadly and not by weighing its words as if they are diamonds'.

226 Further, Forestry Tasmania submits the protection contemplated by cl 68 of the RFA is 'systemic species protection rather than some guarantee of some right to survival of some individual or individuals forming part of a threatened species...with a view to ensuring survival of [that] species in the long-term'.

234 This proceeding is distinguishable from South Australia v The Commonwealth where a party to an inter-governmental agreement sought to enforce it against the other party. The relevant obligation sought to be enforced did not contain a precise time for its enforcement. The High Court considered the matter to require political rather than judicial resolution.</text>

<tocase>Stocks and Parkes Investments Pty Ltd v The Minister [1971] 1 NSWLR 932</tocase>
<text>197 The Commonwealth and Forestry Tasmania refer to the judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Stocks and Parkes Investments Pty Ltd v The Minister [1971] 1 NSWLR 932 (' Stocks and Parkes Investments' ) at 940, where the Court said:
 
 'There is a great difference between the verb "provide" and the verb "provide for" or "make provision for" and it is this difference which gives a clue to the construction of cl. 16. The difference between "provide" and "provide for" is that the former means to give or to make available in fact, while the latter looks to the planning stage alone. You provide for a school site by "looking forward" and planning accordingly. You provide a school site by actually making it available.'

198 I accept the submissions of the Commonwealth and Forestry Tasmania concerning the meaning of 'provides for'. I see no reason to doubt the analysis of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Stocks and Parkes Investments .

199 The recitals to the RFA refer to the establishment of a CAR Reserve System. 'CAR Reserve System' is defined in cl 2. The RFA refers to the JANIS Report and defines it. The JANIS Report contains agreed criteria for the establishment of a CAR Reserve System. Clause 48 of the RFA commits the parties to the establishment of a CAR Reserve System by reference to JANIS Reserve Criteria. Clause 49 (and the attachments it refers to) goes into some detail about how the CAR Reserve System will be established by referring to different types of reserves and the protection of CAR Values by prescription. Clause 51 refers to an agreement to take appropriate action to establish a CAR Reserve System on Public Land described in an attachment and by reference to a map. It also commits the parties to manage that system and maintain CAR Values consistent with expressed management objectives. Clause 68 contains an agreement to protect Priority Species through the CAR Reserve System or by applying relevant management prescriptions.

200 Given the above, and in the context of the meaning of 'provides for' contained in Stocks and Parkes Investments , I consider the RFA meets the definition contained in subparagraph (b) of the definition of RFA in s 4 of the RFA Act, in that it 'provides for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system'.

201 The provision for a CAR Reserve System does not mean that legally enforceable rights to the creation of such a system must be available. That may be the case if there was an obligation to 'provide' a CAR Reserve System, but that is not the obligation contained in the RFA Act. The same may be said of the lack of a legally enforceable obligation to provide ESFM.

202 The applicant's reference to s 3(c) of the RFA Act concerning the Forest and Wood Products Council is of no assistance. But for the obligation in s 11 of the RFA Act , it would be difficult to see any enforceable obligation on any person to ensure that such a body is set up. If s 11 is considered to be the partner of s 3 in compelling the establishment of the Council, no counterpart to s 11 is aligned to subparagraphs (b) or (c) of the definition of RFA in s 4 of the RFA Act to enforce any obligation referrable to a CAR Reserve System or ESFM.

204 Having regard to the above, and in the context of Stocks and Parkes Investments , I consider the RFA meets the definition contained in subparagraph (c) of the definition of RFA in section 4 of the RFA Act, in that it 'provides for the ecologically sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region or regions'.

205 The RFA is an RFA within the terms of the RFA Act.

206 Under Pt 9 of the EPBC Act, the Minister can approve the taking of certain actions pursuant to an approval process set out in that Part. Section 18(3) of the EPBC Act, referred to at [42] above, is found in Pt 3 of the Act. Part 3 deals with the requirements for environmental approvals for actions. Part 4 provides for exemptions from Pt 3. Section 38 is found in Pt 4. It may be that the issue would have been better expressed by referring to an exemption from Pt 4 as well as, or in lieu of, the reference to Pt 9.</text>

<tocase>Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1</tocase>
<text>117 Where the evidence of Mr Meggs differs from that of Dr McQuillan and Dr Michaels, I prefer the evidence of Dr McQuillan and Dr Michaels. Under cross-examination, Mr Meggs was frequently evasive and appeared to me to be much more of an advocate for the cause of Forestry Tasmania than an independent expert. I accept the applicant's submission that Mr Meggs was a 'partisan polemic' and a 'so-called independent expert'; see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1 at [26], per Wilcox J.

118 The worst aspect of Mr Meggs' lack of independence was his preparedness to alter his affidavit evidence based on 'suggestions' by senior employees of Forestry Tasmania.

119 Mr Meggs gave evidence that his affidavit received 'peer review' from the following people:
 
 &#8226; Dr Sarah Munks from the Forest Practices Authority;
 &#8226; Dr Stephen Read, the Chief Scientist of the Division of Forest Research and Development from Forestry Tasmania;
 &#8226; Dr Hans Drielsma, the then General Manager of Forestry Management for Forestry Tasmania;
 &#8226; Mr John Hickey, the Manager of the Planning Branch (formerly the Principal Research Officer of the Native Forests Branch) of Forestry Tasmania; and
 &#8226; Dr Marie Yee from Forestry Tasmania.</text>
