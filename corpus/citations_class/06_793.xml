<text>7 At the hearing, the parties referred to the debate, recorded in various decisions of this Court, as to the appropriate approach that the Court should take to the question of reviewing a taxing officer's decision under O 62 r 44 of the Rules. The debate is well described in the decision of Hely J in Cachia v Westpac Financial Services Limited [2003] FCA 817 ('Cachia') . On one view, an applicant is entitled to a review de novo by the Court. On the other view, the Court is to apply the approach set out in the observations of Jordan CJ in the case of Schweppes' Ltd v Archer (1934) 34 SR (NSW) 178 at 183. Under that approach, the Court is reluctant to interfere unless the applicant shows that there was an error of principle by the taxing officer or, in respect of a matter involving the taxing officer's discretion, it appears that the taxing officer has not exercised his or her discretion at all or exercised it in a manner which is manifestly wrong; and where the question is one of amount only, the Court will only interfere in extreme cases.</text>
