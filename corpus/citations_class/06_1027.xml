<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (ACN 008 799 040) (2001) ATPR 41-802</tocase>
<text>6 The Commission asked me to incorporate in the orders the findings of fact made for the purpose of determining the appropriate penalties and other remedies. I do not think that it is appropriate to do that for a number of reasons. First, it would make the orders of the court unnecessarily lengthy and it would raise the question of what findings should or should not be included. Secondly, such a course would create a risk of inconsistency between the findings in the orders and the findings in the reasons for judgment: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (ACN 008 799 040) (2001) ATPR 41-802. Reference was made by the Commission to s 83 of the Act, but that section does not suggest that such a course is necessary or appropriate. The findings of fact in the reasons for judgment can be proved in the manner contemplated by the section.

7 Cambur Industries was incorporated in 1962 and it carries on business as an importer and wholesale supplier of electrical goods, homeware products and tableware products. The company's business is divided into three divisions, which correspond to those different types of goods. The evidence is that for the most part the divisions operate separately.

8 The electrical goods supplied by Cambur Industries include kitchen products manufactured under two well-known brand names, Bamix and Magimix, such as stick mixers, juicers, food processors and coffee machines. The coffee machines are referred to as 'dual branded' Nespresso/Magimix. The contraventions in this case relate to the supply of the Bamix and Magimix products and the Nespresso/Magimix coffee machines. I will refer to these products as 'the Cambur products', except where it is necessary to distinguish between them.

9 The head office of Cambur Industries is in Victoria and the company has a regional office in New South Wales. The company has salespeople in Victoria, New South Wales and Adelaide. In the other States and Territories it operates through commission agents. Cambur Industries has about 35 employees, of whom approximately 60 per cent are full-time employees and 40 per cent are part-time employees.

10 The electrical goods division of Cambur Industries has four employees, one of whom is Mr Caulfield, who is the sales and marketing manager. The other three staff members report to him and he in turn reports to the managing director. Mr Caulfield is 57 years old and has worked as a salesperson for a number of years. Mr Caulfield and his wife have a small shareholding in Cambur Industries. Mr Caulfield is effectively the product manager for the Bamix and Magimix products, including the Nespresso/Magimix coffee machines. At the time of the conduct that contravened the Act, he was the one who made the decisions on behalf of Cambur Industries about the marketing and distribution of the Cambur products. At the time of the contravening conduct, Mr Caulfield was working in South Australia.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482</tocase>
<text>93 In fixing the pecuniary penalties, I have had regard to the cases to which I was referred. It is important to bear in mind that other cases are no more than a guide and there is an obvious danger in attempting too close a comparison for the purposes of fixing a penalty. In particular, there is a danger in taking a broadly analogous case and the penalty imposed in that case and then adding for circumstances considered more serious, and subtracting for circumstances considered less serious. Bearing those observations in mind, two cases which I have found quite helpful are Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Westminster Retail Pty Ltd (2005) ATPR 42-084.

103 Injunctions might still be appropriate even if the likelihood of future contraventions is slight, if future contraventions are likely to cause significant damage to other persons: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (supra) at [111] per Goldberg J. Without wishing to minimise the seriousness of the contravening conduct here, I do not think this case falls into that category.

104 For these reasons, I decline to grant the injunctions sought by the Commission.

105 The Commission seeks an order that the respondents pay its costs of an incidental to the proceeding to be agreed or taxed. The respondents do not dispute the fact that they must pay the applicant's costs. The parties have attempted to agree an amount for costs, but have been unable to do so. In the circumstances, it is appropriate to make the order sought by the Commission.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79</tocase>
<text>106 Cambur Industries proffers an undertaking that it will maintain the compliance programme formulated by Mr Dee in January 2006 for a period of three years. The Court's power to accept an undertaking is constrained by the limits of its power to make an order to similar effect as the undertaking. The Court's power to make an order that a contravener comply with a compliance programme is contained in s 80 or s 86C of the Act. As far as s 80 is concerned, a training programme may go no further than the contravening conduct, or, it seems, that Part of the Act in which the section contravened appears: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc (1999) 161 ALR 79 at 88-90 [25], [26] and [36] per French J. The programme which may be the subject of an order under s 86C is a programme relating to 'the contravening conduct, similar conduct or related conduct'.</text>

<tocase>Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ABN 83 975 695 966) [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/21.html</AustLII>
<text>100 The Commission in this case only seeks injunctions to restrain conduct which would constitute a contravention of the Act and does not seek to restrain conduct which would not or may not constitute a contravention of the Act. In an appropriate case it seems the court has the power to make such orders: Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135. In this case, the granting of injunctions would add only one remedy, ie, a remedy for contempt of court, to those provided by the Act.

101 Generally speaking, injunctions which do no more than restrain contraventions of the Act will have little impact in terms of general deterrence. The pecuniary penalties are likely to have the greatest impact in that respect. Injunctions restraining no more than contraventions of the Act may have an effect in terms of personal deterrence and may be granted because of that consideration. They may also be granted because, in a particular case, they will reduce the likelihood of further contraventions. In this case, I am satisfied that the possibility of further contraventions is slight. Although Cambur Industries should have exercised greater control over Mr Caulfield, it was Mr Caulfield who was responsible for the contraventions. I am satisfied that the investigation, court proceedings, and pecuniary penalty I propose to impose has had and will have a very significant impact on him in terms of deterrence and, coupled with the compliance programme put in place by Cambur Industries, means it is very unlikely that he will engage in contravening conduct in the future.

102 As far as Cambur Industries and Mr Jeffs are concerned, I am satisfied that Mr Jeffs' lack of knowledge of the provisions of the Act, his lack of control and supervision of Mr Caulfield, and the lack of education programmes and checks and balances to ensure compliance with the Act have now been addressed and, coupled with the pecuniary penalty I propose to impose on Cambur Industries, means it is very unlikely that the company will engage in contravening conduct in the future.</text>

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248</tocase>
<text>99 Under s 80 of the Act, the court may grant an injunction in such terms as the court determines to be appropriate. The section provides that the court may grant an injunction whether or not the person intends to engage in the relevant conduct again, whether or not the person has previously engaged in the relevant conduct and whether or not there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if the first-mentioned person engages in the relevant conduct: s 80(4) of the Act. These matters, which are often highly relevant to whether a court exercising equitable jurisdiction grants an injunction in an action between private parties, are of much less relevance when a court is considering the power to grant an injunction under s 80. However, they are not irrelevant to the exercise of that power: ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 253-257 per Lockhart J.</text>

<tocase>NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285</tocase>
<text>62 I start by reminding myself of some well-known general principles relevant to the fixing of pecuniary penalties. What follows is taken from the reasons for judgment of Burchett and Keifel JJ in NW Frozen Foods v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285.

63 First, the effect of the respondent's conduct on the function of markets and other economic effects of the conduct will generally be regarded as a significant matter, and the court is likely to be assisted by views put forward by the Commission, or by experts called on behalf of the parties (at 290). In this case, the Commission put forward no direct evidence as to the effects of the respondents' conduct on the function of the relevant market.

64 Secondly, deterrence (both general and personal) is important in assessing the appropriate penalty. It has been described as a 'principal purpose' of s 76 and a factor of 'particular significance' (see the cases referred to at 293). However, at the same time, it is important that the penalty imposed is not oppressive.

65 Thirdly, cooperation and the implementation of a compliance programme by the contravener is also an important matter in fixing the appropriate penalty. Burchett and Keifel JJ said (at 294):
 
 'Where the Commission established to administer the Act is satisfied that an appropriate programme has been undertaken, or the undertaking of it is proved to the Court, this is the most important matter to take into account on penalty.'

66 Fourthly, the penalties imposed in one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in another case. That follows from the fact that the circumstances in two cases are rarely the same or equal.

67 The fifth point is perhaps an observation more than anything else. Burchett and Keifel JJ expressed the view that the penalties imposed by s 76 are not criminal sanctions and their purpose, established now by a long line of cases, is not punishment (at 296-297). Carr J, on the other hand, considered that the question was an open one (at 299).

68 Section 76 identifies four matters which are relevant to the determination of the appropriate pecuniary penalty. They are:
 
 1. the nature and extent of the act or omission;
 2. the loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission;
 3. the circumstances in which the act or omission took place; and 
 
 
 4. whether the contravening company and accessory have been found guilty of previous relevant contraventions.

70 The above matters are not exhaustive of all the relevant circumstances: NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (supra) per Burchett and Keifel JJ (at 292). Other factors have also been identified, such as the respondents' financial position and any profit made by the contravening company. A number of the matters overlap and, clearly, the significance or weight to be accorded to any particular matter will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.

71 As to the nature and extent of the acts constituting the contravening conduct, in the case of Pete N Peppa I have found that there were eight acts which contravened s 48 of the Act. Those acts occurred over a period of about 16 months and the conduct culminated in the withholding of supply of Cambur products. In the case of Tabletop and Kitchen, there were four acts which contravened s 48. Those acts occurred over a period of about three-and-a-half years from January 2002 to July 2005, during which time, as a result of the respondents' conduct, Tabletop and Kitchen did not discount Cambur products.

72 As to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravening conduct, there are two groups which may have suffered loss or damage and they are the retailers and consumers. There is no precise evidence of loss or damage suffered by either group. As far as retailers are concerned, it was suggested that retailers other than Pete N Peppa or Tabletop and Kitchen may have been induced not to discount. Certainly there is evidence to suggest Mr Caulfield was speaking to other retailers about the price of Cambur products, but I do not think that I could find on the evidence that other retailers suffered loss or did not discount so that they or consumers suffered loss and damage. Mr Milosevic of Pete N Peppa gives some general evidence of loss and damage suffered by Pete N Peppa when he says that the Bamix and Magimix products were the best on the market and Pete N Peppa lost money because they were not selling them and were sending customers to other stores. There is no evidence from Mr Mitchell or Ms Gilbert of Tabletop and Kitchen of the effect of the contravening conduct on the business of Tabletop and Kitchen. I am prepared to assume that some loss was suffered by Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen, but I can be no more precise than that. The conduct in each case occurred over a considerable period of time and Bamix and Magimix products were popular in the marketplace. Both businesses sought to discount the products. As far as the effect on consumers is concerned, I am prepared to assume that some loss and damage was caused because consumers could not buy discounted Cambur products from Pete N Peppa and Tabletop and Kitchen.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/75.html</AustLII>
<text>96 It is common ground that it is appropriate to make declarations and the only question is the form of those declarations. A declaration under the Act and s 21 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) must identify the contravening conduct. It must be precise in its terms, such that a person reading the declaration understands the nature of the contravention and, in broad terms, the conduct constituting the contravention. On the one hand, it is not necessary to put all the relevant findings of fact in the declaration, but, on the other, the gist of the conduct (as found) should be identified: Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91 [89] - [90] per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ.

97 The declarations I am prepared to make are set out at the end of these reasons. They are similar to the declarations put forward by the Commission, with the qualification that I have identified eight acts of resale price maintenance in relation to Pete N Peppa and four acts of resale price maintenance in the case of Tabletop and Kitchen. I do not think it offends any principle to declare that some acts referred to in the declarations fall within more than one paragraph of s 96(3) of the Act and I have framed the declarations accordingly.

98 The Commission seeks a series of injunctions against the respondents. The injunctions it seeks against Cambur Industries would restrain it from engaging in conduct in breach of s 48 of the Act by virtue of engaging in conduct which falls within the terms of s 96(3)(a), (b), (d) and (f) of the Act for a period of three years. Similar injunctions are sought in relation to Mr Caulfield, the first restraining him from being involved in contravening conduct by a corporation and the second restraining him from being involved in conduct where the recipient of the goods is a corporation (see s 96(2)).</text>

 5. the size of the contravening company; 
 
 
 6. the degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market;
 7. the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended;
 8. whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level;
 9. whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act, as evidenced by educational programmes and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and
 10. whether the company has shown a disposition to cooperate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.</text>
