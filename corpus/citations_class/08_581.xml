<text>30 As I have noted, there is no dispute that the Minister was required to comply with the rules of procedural fairness before making the decision to cancel the applicant's visa. There is also no dispute that if the Minister failed to afford the applicant procedural fairness, the cancellation decision would be affected by jurisdictional error. In these circumstances, relief in the nature of certiorari would be available to quash the decision: Re Refugee Tribunal; Ex part Aala [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 ; Plaintiff S157 v Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 ; Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA 14 ; (2007) 228 CLR 651.</text>

<text>54 In assessing the reasonableness of the Minister's actions, it is appropriate, in my view, to take account of the serious consequences to the visa holder of a cancellation of his or her visa. Although perhaps the point is self-evident, the Full Court in Minister v George (at 145 [53]) emphasised the potentially devastating consequences of a decision to cancel the visa of a permanent resident of Australia. A useful analogy is the principle that in applying the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities, a court takes account of the seriousness of the factual issue and of the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular adverse finding: Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 , at 343-344, per Latham CJ; at 362-363, per Dixon J. By parity of reasoning, the circumstances relevant to the reasonableness of the Department's attempts to notify a visa holder include the gravity of the consequences for that person of a decision to cancel his or her visa.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/91.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The Minister relies on the decisions of French J in Osborne v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1113 ; (2002) 124 FCR 416 and of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450. These authorities are said to stand for the principle that the requirements of procedural fairness are satisfied if the Department or Minister has made reasonable efforts to notify the visa holder that cancellation of the visa is under active consideration. In this case, the Department had made such efforts over a period of time, including the inquiry made of Centrelink after the notice of intention to consider cancellation of the applicant's visa, sent on 28 June 2007 had been returned undelivered. The Minister submits, therefore, that the present case falls within the principle established by Osborne v Minister and Minister v Ball and that the applicant was not denied procedural fairness despite not receiving any of the three notices sent to him.

29 In his oral submissions, Mr Karp, who appeared for the applicant, contended that the Department had not made reasonable efforts to ensure that the notice of intention to consider cancellation of the visa actually came to the attention of the applicant. He argued that there were obvious steps that the Department could and should have taken once the notice of 28 June 2006 was returned undelivered. In the absence of evidence that the Department had made additional inquiries, the present case could not be said to be governed by the principle applied in Osborne v Minister and Minister v Ball .

37 Osborne v Minister was followed by the Full Court in Minister v Ball . In the latter case, the notice was sent by the Department to an address in Kalgoorlie supplied by the visa holder when she had appeared in court charged with an offence in January 2003. It was also the address she had supplied to the Australian Taxation Office in March 2002. The Department sent the notice on 29 January 2003, but the visa holder had moved to Melbourne a few days earlier. The notice was returned to the Department ' unclaimed ' on 11 March 2003.

41 Shortly after the decision in Minister v Ball , a Full Court addressed similar issues in Minister v George , although the judgment of the Court made no reference to the earlier decision of the Full Court. In Minister v George , the Department sent two letters to the visa holder. The first was sent to an address held by the Department, but it was returned undelivered. The second was sent to an address supplied by the Western Australian Police. The visa holder was not living at this address at the time, although he commenced living there later. The second letter was not returned to the Department, but the visa holder received neither letter. The Minister subsequently cancelled her visa. The Minister believed at the time he made the decision that the visa holder had been notified of the cancellation process and had not taken up the invitation to make submissions.

48 It is not easy to reconcile the Full Court decisions in Minister v Ball and Minister v George . In each case, so it would seem, the Minister erroneously believed on reasonable grounds that the visa holder had been notified of the intention to consider cancellation of the visa. In George such a finding was express. In Minister v Ball it is to be inferred from the finding that the Departmental Issues Paper informed the Minister that the visa holder had been notified and had not responded, but did not inform the Minister that the notice sent to the visa holder had been returned undelivered. The precise holding in Minister v George was that the Minister committed a jurisdictional error by acting on his erroneous belief that the visa holder had received actual notice that cancellation of the visa was under active consideration.

53 The question of whether the Minister or the Department has taken reasonable steps is a question of fact, dependent upon the particular circumstances of the case. In Osborne v Minister , French J thought that sending the notice to the last address provided by the visa holder, which in fact had been his address for three months after his release, was reasonable. His Honour was fortified in that conclusion by the fact that the address was that of the visa holder's mother and the further fact that the registered letter sent to that address had not been returned. In Minister v Ball , the Court was influenced by the absence of any alternative address for the visa holder and the failure of the visa holder's counsel to identify any further step that the Department could reasonably and practically take to notify the visa holder that cancellation was under consideration.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v George [2004] FCAFC 276 ; (2004) 139 FCR 127</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/276.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Regulation 2.55 of the Migration Regulations was made pursuant to the powers conferred by s 504(1)(e) and (3) of the Migration Act : Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v George [2004] FCAFC 276 ; (2004) 139 FCR 127 , at 140 [33], per curiam . Regulation 2.55 applies, among other cases to ' the giving of a document to a holder ... of a visa relating to the proposed cancellation ... of a visa ': reg 2.55(1)(a). Regulation 2.55(3) provides that a document of this kind must be served in one of a number of specified ways including:
 '(c) by dating it, and then dispatching it: (i) within 3 working days (in the place of dispatch) of the date of the document; and (ii) by prepaid post ... 
 
 
 to the person's last residential address ... known to the Minister.'

9 Regulation 2.55(7) provides that if the Minister gives a document to a person by dispatching it by prepaid post, the person is taken to have received the document seven working days after the date of the document.

10 The applicant, his partner and one of their three children gave affidavit evidence in the proceedings. Counsel for the Minister, Mr Kennett, did not object to any portion of the affidavits read on behalf of the applicant. Nor did Mr Kennett cross-examine any of the deponents. There is therefore no dispute about the underlying facts.

41 Shortly after the decision in Minister v Ball , a Full Court addressed similar issues in Minister v George , although the judgment of the Court made no reference to the earlier decision of the Full Court. In Minister v George , the Department sent two letters to the visa holder. The first was sent to an address held by the Department, but it was returned undelivered. The second was sent to an address supplied by the Western Australian Police. The visa holder was not living at this address at the time, although he commenced living there later. The second letter was not returned to the Department, but the visa holder received neither letter. The Minister subsequently cancelled her visa. The Minister believed at the time he made the decision that the visa holder had been notified of the cancellation process and had not taken up the invitation to make submissions.

45 The Minister's alternative contention in Minister v George was that procedural fairness had been satisfied because reasonable steps had been taken to notify the visa holder. The Court considered (at 142 [40]) that this contention raised the following question:
 'where notice is sent to an address that was believed by the Minister or his officers, on reasonable grounds, to be the current residential address of a visa holder, does that satisfy the prerequisite of procedural fairness, when the address has never in fact been an address of the visa holder?'

46 Their Honours answered this question in the negative (at 145 [53]):
 
 
 'Where the Minister believes, erroneously, albeit on reasonable grounds, that a visa holder has been notified and proceeds on that untrue basis, there will be an error. The question is whether that error is a jurisdictional error. In order to determine whether a particular order is jurisdictional, it is essential to consider the relevant statutory context. ... In circumstances where a visa entitles the holder to permanent residence in Australia and cancellation will render that person liable to detention and removal from Australia, a mistake as to whether the person has been notified of the intention to consider cancelling the visa is a very significant one. Such a mistake will be even more significant if the consequences of the cancellation of a visa entitling the holder to permanent residence in Australia may include separation from his family and removal to a country with which he no longer has any social connection. Such a mistake acted upon as it was here, must be regarded as going to the jurisdiction of the decision-maker to cancel the visa where procedural fairness is required before doing so. Failure to do so will normally involve jurisdictional error, notwithstanding that what occurred was subjectively fair from the point of view of the decision-maker, because, on the material and information available to the decision-maker, it was reasonable to conclude that a right to be heard had been afforded. Of course, this general statement is subject to any contrary indications within the relevant statutory scheme including, in this case, the deeming provisions within the Act. However, for the reasons already given, they do not assist in this case.'

47 The Court recognised (at 145 [54]) that there might be circumstances where the procedure followed by the Department is fair, even though the visa holder does not receive the notice. Their Honours gave the example of a person who avoids communicating with the Minister because of a fear that the communication may be detrimental. They also observed (at 146 [54]) that between the clear-cut cases:
 'there will be some circumstances which involve lack of procedural fairness and others where there will be no want of procedural fairness.'

48 It is not easy to reconcile the Full Court decisions in Minister v Ball and Minister v George . In each case, so it would seem, the Minister erroneously believed on reasonable grounds that the visa holder had been notified of the intention to consider cancellation of the visa. In George such a finding was express. In Minister v Ball it is to be inferred from the finding that the Departmental Issues Paper informed the Minister that the visa holder had been notified and had not responded, but did not inform the Minister that the notice sent to the visa holder had been returned undelivered. The precise holding in Minister v George was that the Minister committed a jurisdictional error by acting on his erroneous belief that the visa holder had received actual notice that cancellation of the visa was under active consideration.

50 In view of the decision in Minister v George , it may have been open to Mr Karp to argue on behalf of the applicant that the Minister must have erroneously believed, at the time of the cancellation decision, that the applicant had received actual notification of the intention to consider cancelling the visa. It was obvious from the Issues Paper that the applicant had not received the third notice of 28 June 2007. However, the Issues Paper recorded that ' Receipt of one of the Notices [of 10 January 2000] was confirmed by Australia Post on 15 January 2007 '. This may have supported an inference that the Minister took the Issues Paper to imply that the applicant had received the second notice of 10 January 2007, particularly as a person not familiar with the applicant's signature could well have read the signature as that of the applicant. But Mr Karp made no such submission.

51 Mr Kennett appreciated the potential difficulty for the Minister's case if the applicant submitted that the Court should find that the Minister erroneously believed that the applicant had received the second notice. At the conclusion of his oral submissions, Mr Kennett expressly noted that the applicant had made no suggestion to this effect and that it was therefore not necessary for him to deal with the decision in Minister v George . The Minister's submissions, like those of the applicant, proceeded on the basis that the Minister had not formed a belief that the applicant had actually received a notice warning him that consideration was to be given to cancelling his visa.

52 Mr Kennett accepted that, since the applicant had not been actually notified of the cancellation process, he had been denied procedural fairness unless the Minister could show that reasonable steps had been taken to notify the applicant that the process was under way. Mr Kennett pointed out that the Minister's acceptance of this proposition potentially left room for reg 2.55 to operate by deeming service of the notice to have been effected. However, as will be seen, Mr Kennett placed no reliance on reg 2.55 in the circumstances of this case.

54 In assessing the reasonableness of the Minister's actions, it is appropriate, in my view, to take account of the serious consequences to the visa holder of a cancellation of his or her visa. Although perhaps the point is self-evident, the Full Court in Minister v George (at 145 [53]) emphasised the potentially devastating consequences of a decision to cancel the visa of a permanent resident of Australia. A useful analogy is the principle that in applying the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities, a court takes account of the seriousness of the factual issue and of the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular adverse finding: Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 , at 343-344, per Latham CJ; at 362-363, per Dixon J. By parity of reasoning, the circumstances relevant to the reasonableness of the Department's attempts to notify a visa holder include the gravity of the consequences for that person of a decision to cancel his or her visa.</text>

<tocase>Osborne v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1113 ; (2002) 124 FCR 416</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1113.html</AustLII>
<text>28 The Minister relies on the decisions of French J in Osborne v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1113 ; (2002) 124 FCR 416 and of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450. These authorities are said to stand for the principle that the requirements of procedural fairness are satisfied if the Department or Minister has made reasonable efforts to notify the visa holder that cancellation of the visa is under active consideration. In this case, the Department had made such efforts over a period of time, including the inquiry made of Centrelink after the notice of intention to consider cancellation of the applicant's visa, sent on 28 June 2007 had been returned undelivered. The Minister submits, therefore, that the present case falls within the principle established by Osborne v Minister and Minister v Ball and that the applicant was not denied procedural fairness despite not receiving any of the three notices sent to him.

29 In his oral submissions, Mr Karp, who appeared for the applicant, contended that the Department had not made reasonable efforts to ensure that the notice of intention to consider cancellation of the visa actually came to the attention of the applicant. He argued that there were obvious steps that the Department could and should have taken once the notice of 28 June 2006 was returned undelivered. In the absence of evidence that the Department had made additional inquiries, the present case could not be said to be governed by the principle applied in Osborne v Minister and Minister v Ball .

33 In Osborne v Minister , French J attempted to balance these competing considerations. In that case, the visa holder, a New Zealand citizen, had committed a number of offences. While in prison he told a Departmental officer that, upon his release, he intended to reside with his mother at a particular address. Following the visa holder's release in September 2000, he lived with his mother for three months but then moved to another address. In July and September 2001, letters were sent to the visa holder at the mother's address, but he received neither of them (although friends told him in September 2001 that a registered letter had been sent to him). The Minister cancelled the visa in February 2002 on character grounds, without having received any representations from the visa holder.

34 French J pointed out (at 423) that there is no express provision in the Migration Act requiring notice to be given to a visa holder as a condition of the exercise of the Minister's power to cancel the visa under s 501. Nevertheless, in his Honour's view:
 'prior notice to the visa holder is to be implied as a necessary condition of the power for it cannot be exercised unless: "The person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test." It is not to be supposed that the Parliament intended that condition to be met by the silence of the visa holder in the absence of any notice of the Minister's intention to cancel. Some process of notification is therefore contemplated even though the Act does not set it out. Indeed the regulations seem to assume as much.'

35 French J considered that the implied condition of notification could not be absolute:
 'otherwise a person could defeat the cancellation provisions simply by moving to an address not known to the Minister or his officers. The implied condition requires only that reasonable steps be taken to notify the visa holder. To send a notice of intended cancellation to his last known address is a reasonable step. When that last known address is the address of a close relative of the visa holder, in this case his mother, and with whom he had expressed an intention to resume living, then it is plainly a reasonable process.'

36 His Honour went on to say that the aid of the Migration Regulations (by which he appears to have meant reg 2.55) was not required to determine what was reasonable. He pointed out that, in any event:
 '[t]hey do not in terms condition the effect of exercise of the power under s 501.'

37 Osborne v Minister was followed by the Full Court in Minister v Ball . In the latter case, the notice was sent by the Department to an address in Kalgoorlie supplied by the visa holder when she had appeared in court charged with an offence in January 2003. It was also the address she had supplied to the Australian Taxation Office in March 2002. The Department sent the notice on 29 January 2003, but the visa holder had moved to Melbourne a few days earlier. The notice was returned to the Department ' unclaimed ' on 11 March 2003.

42 The trial Judge held that the limited and unsuccessful attempts to contact the visa holder constituted a denial of procedural fairness. On appeal, the Full Court followed (at 139 [27]) Osborne v Minister , holding that the requirement in s 501(2) that the visa holder ' does not satisfy the Minister that the [visa holder] passes the character test ' implied that some prior notice had to be given of the Minister's intention to cancel the visa. The Court also held (at 139 [29]) that procedural fairness required the visa holder to be given an opportunity, assuming that the Minister was not satisfied that the visa holder passed the character test, to persuade the Minister not to exercise the discretion to cancel the visa.

43 Their Honours observed (at 139 [30]) that, notwithstanding the principles of procedural fairness, it is open to Parliament to specify circumstances in which notification of a cancellation process is deemed to be given to a person. Parliament can also confer on the Executive power to achieve the same result by regulation.

44 The Minister had relied on reg 2.55(7) to support the conclusion that, since the notice was sent to the visa holder at the address supplied by the Police, he was deemed to have received it. The Court held (at 141 [35]) that reg 2.55, in terms, only applies where the notice is sent to the actual address of the visa holder. The addresses to which the Department dispatched the letters were not and never had been addresses of the visa holder. Their Honours were of the view that reg 2.55(7) had no application to letters sent to an address with which a visa holder never had any connection.

53 The question of whether the Minister or the Department has taken reasonable steps is a question of fact, dependent upon the particular circumstances of the case. In Osborne v Minister , French J thought that sending the notice to the last address provided by the visa holder, which in fact had been his address for three months after his release, was reasonable. His Honour was fortified in that conclusion by the fact that the address was that of the visa holder's mother and the further fact that the registered letter sent to that address had not been returned. In Minister v Ball , the Court was influenced by the absence of any alternative address for the visa holder and the failure of the visa holder's counsel to identify any further step that the Department could reasonably and practically take to notify the visa holder that cancellation was under consideration.

65 The Minister's written submissions acknowledged that French J was correct in Osborne v Minister to observe that reg 2.55 does not condition the exercise of power in s 501 of the Migration Act . The Minister accepted that reg 2.55 applies, by its terms, to circumstances in which the Migration Act or the Migration Regulations require a ' document ' to be given to a visa holder. The submissions gave s 107 of the Migration Act as an illustration of a provision to which reg 2.55 applies. Section 107 authorises the Minister to give visa holders notice of any alleged non-compliance with certain statutory provisions.

66 Although the Minister's written submissions asserted that ' the mechanism ' in reg 2.55 had been complied with, the Minister did not contend that the applicant's claims of a denial of procedural fairness could be met by establishing that the terms of reg 2.55 had been satisfied. When the issue was referred to in oral argument, Mr Kennett confirmed that the Minister's position was that French J had held that reg 2.55 could not apply to a notice relating to the possible exercise of the power of cancellation conferred by s 501 of the Migration Act . Accordingly, the Minister did not dispute that reg 2.55 did not apply and thus did not condition the exercise of the power of cancellation.

67 In the absence of any submission that the Minister is entitled to rely on reg 2.55, at least in this Court, I do not need to consider it further.</text>
