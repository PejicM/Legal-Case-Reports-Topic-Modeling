<tocase>Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall, in the matter of Maxwell-Smith [2004] FCA 840</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/840.html</AustLII>
<text>19 On 15 September 2003, a Registrar of the Federal Court made sequestration orders against Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith. The debt which gave rise to the orders was the certificate of assessment of the costs order made by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 8 December 1999. However, on 2 July 2004 Moore J annulled the bankruptcies of Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith under s 153B of the Act ; see Maxwell-Smith v S &amp; E Hall, in the matter of Maxwell-Smith [2004] FCA 840. His Honour was satisfied that the sequestration orders ought not to have been made, on the basis of an "unwitting" denial of procedural fairness before the Registrar; see [20].

20 Moore J observed at [24] that the annulment application was not made upon the basis that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith were solvent when the orders were made. Nevertheless, his Honour recorded an acknowledgment of counsel for the Trustee that "probably" Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith were solvent when the sequestration orders were made. His Honour also noted that counsel for S &amp; E Hall did not dispute this proposition.

21 Moore J went on to say that there was insufficient evidence before him to make a positive finding that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith were solvent. But he said that they may well be solvent, and may well have been when the sequestration orders were made; see at [24]. He took this into account in the exercise of his discretion to make the annulment order.

22 In evidence before me is a letter dated 27 August 2004 from solicitors for S &amp; E Hall to the solicitors then acting for Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith setting out an offer to settle various disputes between the parties. The letter was written "without prejudice". However, counsel for S &amp; E Hall objected to the document only upon the grounds of relevance and hearsay. He did not object to it on the ground that it was not to be adduced under s 131 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). I admitted the letter, along with a number of other exhibits to Mrs Maxwell-Smith's Affidavit filed on 14 June 2006, into evidence but not as proof of the facts.

23 The letter contained the following statement:-
 
 "We note that apparently your clients have instructed their counsel that they have no financial capacity to meet any verdict. This is clearly nonsense. As you are doubtless aware, your clients own an unencumbered property in Tura Beach NSW valued at conservatively $700,000.00. They also own a 50% interest in the property at Jindabyne."

35 The asserted claim for $100,000 for damages caused by the creditor's "misuse" of the Act since September 2003, is apparently a claim in respect of the sequestration order made on 15 September 2003 which was subsequently annulled by Moore J.

38 What was required in order to establish that the claim had substance was some evidence to suggest that the 2003 bankruptcy was obtained for a purpose or object beyond that which was offered by the legal process. The observations of Moore J on the annulment of the bankruptcy do not support such a claim. Nor is there any evidence which would give rise to that suggestion.

39 The same may be said of the second claim which is asserted, namely the administration costs of the "unlawful" bankruptcy arising from the sequestration order of September 2003.

40 There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the third claim, namely the "unlawful" execution of the garnishee order has any substance.

47 Second, the observations made by Moore J in July 2004 make it plain that S &amp; E Hall was aware at that time of the probability that Mrs Maxwell-Smith was solvent.

48 Third, the letter from S &amp; E Hall's solicitors states in unequivocal terms that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith owned assets the value of which greatly exceeded their debts. In my view it is clear from this letter that S &amp; E Hall was aware of Mrs Maxwell-Smith's ability to meet her liabilities in August 2004.

49 It seems to me that what was required of S &amp; E Hall was some evidence to dispel the natural inference arising from lengthy delay and knowledge of solvency, that the bankruptcy notice was issued for a purpose collateral to that of pursuit of insolvency proceedings. Instead, there was no evidence from S &amp; E Hall explaining the delay or demonstrating that Mrs Maxwell-Smith's financial position had deteriorated since 2004.</text>

<text>29 The state of satisfaction required by s 40(1)(g) and s 41(7) involves a weighing of the considerations as to the legal and factual merits of the claim relied upon by the debtor and the justice of permitting the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring those proceedings to await the determination of the claim; Guss v Johnstone (2000) 171 ALR 598 at [40].</text>

<tocase>Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell of Hunt and Hunt Lawyers (2003) 198 ALR 331</tocase>
<text>30 The debtor must satisfy the Court by evidence that there is sufficient substance to the claim to make it one which the debtor ought, in justice, be permitted to have heard and determined rather than be forced to comply with the bankruptcy notice by payment, or to commit an act of bankruptcy; see Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell of Hunt and Hunt Lawyers (2003) 198 ALR 331 at [12]; see also the summary of authorities set out by Lindgren J at [9] [11].

31 Each of the cross-claims asserted by Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith arises out of facts which post-date the High Court's costs order. It would therefore seem that, as a matter of law, the claims could not have been set up in the proceeding in which the judgment was obtained.

32 Nevertheless, I am not satisfied that any of the cross-claims has any legal or factual merit. The claims do not therefore have sufficient substance to warrant their determination rather than to force compliance with the bankruptcy notice, if I am otherwise satisfied of the validity of the notice.

33 It is true that the debtor need not adduce admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case at a final hearing; but the Court must be satisfied by evidence that the claim has a reasonable prospect of success; Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Limited [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 at 351; see also Re Glew at [9].</text>

34 Here, Mrs Maxwell-Smith's evidence shows "no more than that she propounds" a counter-claim or cross-demand; see Ebert at 350.

36 His Honour did not annul the bankruptcy on the ground of the debtors' solvency. Even if Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith were solvent at the time when the order was made, there is no evidence before me which could satisfy the test stated in Ebert as to the reasonableness of the asserted claim.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/27.html</AustLII>
<text>37 There is nothing to suggest that the bankruptcy was brought about by a malicious prosecution or a collateral abuse of process so as to give rise to a claim for damages within the principles stated by the High Court; see Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales [2006] HCA 27 at [3] , and [209] [211]; see also Laferla v Birdon Sands Pty Limited (2005) Aust Tort Rep 81-786 at [121] [122].

46 First, the bankruptcy notice seeks payment of a debt for a small amount of money based on a judgment debt which is over 5 years old. No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the notice was issued after such a lengthy delay. It is true that the debt is not statute barred, but the right to pursue it by invoking the Court's processes must be subject to the operation of the principles respecting abuse of process; Batistatos at [62] [65].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/1445.html</AustLII>
<text>44 However, it is not an abuse of process if a creditor genuinely intends to pursue the matter if there is default in complying with the notice and there is no evidence of collateral purpose or undue pressure; Slack v Bottoms English Solicitors [2002] FCA 1445 at [15] [21].

45 In my view, it is to be inferred from the factual matrix set out above that S &amp; E Hall's purpose in issuing the bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on Mrs Maxwell-Smith to pay the debt rather than to genuinely invoke the Court's bankruptcy jurisdiction. This inference arises from the following.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1951/31.html</AustLII>
<text>53 It is well established that the Court has a discretion to go behind a judgment debt to see whether there is in truth a debt due to the petitioning creditor; Corney v Brien [1951] HCA 31 ; (1951) 84 CLR 343 at 347.

54 However, here there was nothing put before me to enliven the exercise of the discretion to go behind the debt. Indeed, it is plain that there is no reason to go behind the judgment.

55 The judgment debt arose from the costs order of the High Court. Mrs Maxwell-Smith appeared, in person with her husband, to seek special leave. She was named as a party to the special leave application. That is sufficient to meet any suggestion that her failure to sign the building contract avoids liability for the costs order.</text>
