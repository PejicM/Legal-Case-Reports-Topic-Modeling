<text>6 It was said from the Bar table that Deltapine made a conscious decision not to raise this particular claim until late last year. I agree with counsel for Bayer that the decision of the High Court in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 does not mean that parties have a right to withhold amendments or other procedural steps to suit their tactical assessments of the case. Even by the standards of patent litigation in this country, which sometimes are the subject of criticism, this case has been very drawn out. It has been on foot since 2003. Any insertion of a totally new claim or defence needs to have some sound basis, which in my opinion has not been shown in this case.

7 The motion on notice dated 9 March 2007 will be dismissed with costs.
