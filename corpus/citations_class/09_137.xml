<text>The plaintiff's application relies substantially on the principles stated by the High Court in Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 . However, in Black &amp; Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , Finkelstein J observed at [2] that: 
 [P]arties do incur losses resulting from delay that can never be compensated by a costs order.</text>

<text>As McDougall J said in Ingot &amp; Ors v Macquarie &amp; Ors [2004] NSWSC 1219 at [21] , the principles stated by Heydon J in Micallef v ICI Operations Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2001] NSWCA 274 at [63] and [64] need to be taken into account. What Heydon J there said is that justice is the paramount consideration in determining such an application, and this may not necessarily result in complete justice to the party who is in default. Heydon J also pointed out that the ultimate obligation of the court is to strive to attain justice between the parties.</text>
