<tocase>Minister for Immigration v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>On behalf of Mrs Holmes it was submitted that, on a reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole, it should not be concluded that the learned senior member had, as the Secretary alleged, addressed the incorrect question, notwithstanding the commencement passage quoted. To that end, my attention was appropriately directed to the salutary reminder offered by Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration v. Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 , at 272 that an administrator's reasons are " not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed ".

Giving full weight to this reminder, it nonetheless seems to me that, in form, the learned senior member did not address the correct question. The following excerpts from his reasons underscore the impression in that regard created by the commencement passage from the reasons which I have quoted: " The questions for the Tribunal here are fundamentally, whether there was a marriage-like relationship in any ordinary sense, or conversely, whether Mrs Holmes and her husband should be regarded as living separately and apart. " (Reasons, par 16) " The Tribunal must assess whether Mr and Mrs Holmes are in a marriage-like relationship based on the way they function in their relationship and with their children. " (Reasons, par 18) " The period of time spent together is also indicative of whether a marriage-like relationship can be said to exist. " (Reasons, par 32) " I find that the nature of the household does not reflect a marriage-like relationship. " (Reasons, par 33) " I therefore find the social aspects of the relationship do not amount to a normal marital relationship of a marriage-like relationship. " (Reasons, par 36). [In relation to sexual relations] " They were, it seems, satisfying temporal physical needs, but there is not sufficient evidence for it to be seen to be a marriage-like relationship, particularly where there was the absence of other commonly accepted elements of a marriage. " (Reasons, par 39) " I do not find the sexual relationship was typical of a marriage-like relationship where there was a minimal amount of emotional warmth. " (Reasons, par 40) " IS THERE A MARRIAGE-LIKE RELATIONSHIP? 
 The requirements of s 4 require me to evaluate, by distillation of all the evidence, whether there can be said to be a marriage-like relationship. In other words, I must have regard to the weight to be placed on the various elements which characterise the relationship and which might be regarded on the balance of probabilities as being a marriage-like relationship. ... Nevertheless, while there are many factors which have justifiably been raised by the respondent and, on the face of it, point to the applicant being in a marriage-like relationship, the proper inference to be drawn from the analysis of factors in s 4(3) more than tip the scales in favour of Mrs Holmes. ... " (Reasons, pars 45 and 46)

The repetitive use of the term "marriage-like relationship" and the deliberate entitling of a section of the reasons with the rhetorical question, "Is there a marriage-like relationship?" are consistent only with the posing by the Tribunal for itself of a question which was, in the circumstances of Mrs Holmes' subsisting lawful marriage, incorrect.

Even so construed, each question suffers from the vice of being premised on a violation of the reminder given in Wu Shan Liang against over-zealous scrutiny of an administrator's reasons.

The passage to which question 2.6 seems to be directed appears in par 17 of the Tribunal's reasons, " A marriage or marriage-like relationship might be differentiated from other dyadic friendships or relationships and must be expected to have at least some degree of intimacy. " The passage is subordinate to an earlier adoption by the learned senior member of a sense of union and common purpose being the essence of "marriage" when used as part of the expression "marriage-like" in ss 4(2), 4(3) and 4(3A) of the Act. For reasons that I develop below, there is no error in that conception of what the word "marriage" imports in that expression. It is quite wrong to read the quoted sentence out of this context as if its contents were seen by the learned senior member as indicating some additional or overarching requirement.

The suggestion in question 2.7 that the Tribunal has elevated the criterion of the "nature of commitment" to a pre-condition to answering the question as to whether a person was a "member of a couple" as opposed to that criterion being part of "all the circumstances of the relationship" is, on a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, also wrong. A discrete portion of the Tribunal's reasons is entitled "Nature of the Commitment between the Applicant and Mr Holmes", but it is patent from other such headings that this is but a reference to a particular consideration by the Tribunal of such of the criteria specified in s 4(3) as seemed to the Tribunal to require more detailed comment in the circumstances of the case.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/21.html</AustLII>
<text>Also referred to in s 4(2)(b)(iii) of the Act is s 4(3A). That subsection intrudes upon the forming of the Secretary's opinion as to whether a couple in a relationship are in a "marriage-like" relationship by requiring consideration of whether a member of that couple is "living separately and apart from his or her partner on a permanent or indefinite basis". If one reads in isolation the conditional clause at the conclusion of s 4(3A) of the Act, in which the words just quoted appear, one might perhaps come to the view that, in the case of a marriage-like relationship, the condition it posits is an objective absolute. It is to be remembered that there is a very definite distinction in law between a "jurisdictional fact" grounded in the holding of an opinion or state of satisfaction as to whether a given state of affairs exists and one grounded in whether that state of affairs truly exists: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 , at 651, [130] per Gummow J. Yet so to construe s 4(3A) would be to introduce an asymmetry in the definition of "member of a couple" between the position with respect to a couple who are parties to a legal marriage and the position with respect to a couple who, in the Secretary's opinion, are in a marriage-like relationship. Unless the language of the Act was intractable such a construction would introduce an unnecessarily subtle distinction into the operation and administration of a definition of pervasive importance in a statute of wide application in our community.

In the case of a legally married couple what s 4(2)(a) requires is the forming of an opinion by the Secretary as to whether one party to that marriage is " living separately and apart from the other person on a permanent or indefinite basis ". That there is a relationship in form is a given flowing from a prior transaction of lawful marriage with the concern being whether, in substance and having regard to the considerations mentioned in s 4(3), the couple are, in the Secretary's (or in his place the Tribunal's) opinion, living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis. One of those considerations which, in its application to a legally married couple, conceptually surely owes its inspiration to the works of Lewis Carroll, is whether that legally married couple " see their relationship as a marriage-like relationship" : s 4(3)(e)(iv).

In my opinion, reading s 4(2)(b)(iii) and s 4(3A) together yields the result that Parliament intended that the forming of the Secretary's opinion as to whether a couple who are not legally married were nonetheless in a marriage-like relationship would also be informed by and conditioned upon the Secretary's opinion as to whether the persons in that relationship were " living separately and apart from the other person on a permanent or indefinite basis ". The parenthetical reference in s 4(2)(b)(iii) to both s 4(3) and s 4(3A) indicates that the Secretary's opinion is to be formed by reference to the criteria in each of these subsections.

I have already referred to the reminder given by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 as to the distinction in law between a "jurisdictional fact" grounded in the holding of an opinion or state of satisfaction as to whether a given state of affairs exists and one grounded in whether that state of affairs truly exists. Earlier in time and in a passage to which Gummow J drew attention in his judgment in Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 , at 653-654 [136], Gibbs J had observed in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 at 118-119, in relation to the review of a "satisfaction" based decision by a court: 
 "In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously. Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account. Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it. However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached."

In respect of the last of these observations made by Gibbs J, Gummow J added in Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; , (1999) 197 CLR 611 , at 654 [137]: 
" This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question. It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way."

To similar effect is a passage in the speech of Lord Brightman in Puhlhofer v Hillingdon [1986] UKHL 1 ; [1986] AC 484 , at 518, referred to with approval by Gleeson CJ and McHugh J in their separate, joint judgment in Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 , at 626-627 [41], with whose reasons Hayne J (at 659 [158]) relevantly agreed: 
 "Where the existence or non-existence of a fact is left to the judgment and discretion of a public body and that fact involves a broad spectrum ranging from the obvious to the debatable to the just conceivable, it is the duty of the court to leave the decision of that fact to the public body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision-making power save in a case where it is obvious that the public body, consciously or unconsciously, are acting perversely."

The formation of an opinion for the purposes of s 4(2)(a) of the Act as to whether a legally married couple were living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis is a paradigm example of the kind of statutory provision to which reference is made in the passages quoted from Eshetu and Buck v Bavone .</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>A consideration is "irrelevant" in an administrative law error sense only if it is a consideration the taking into account of which is forbidden by the legislation concerned, either expressly or by implication having regard to its subject matter, scope and purpose: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985-1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40.

The considerations that the Act made relevant to the formation of an opinion as to whether Mrs Holmes were living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis were those specified in s 4(3). It is significant that this subsection's opening command is to have regard to all the circumstances of the relationship between two people. In the statutory context of whether she was a "member of a couple", the only effect in law of Mrs Holmes' subsisting legal marriage was that she was in form in a relationship with her husband. That this was the form of the relationship meant nothing more in the circumstances than that the requirement to have regard to the considerations mentioned in s 4(3) came both from the opening words of that subsection as well as from s 4(2)(a) of the Act.

Irrespective of whether its application is engaged via the existence of a legal marriage, the primary direction given by s 4(3) is to assess the nature and quality of a relationship between two people by reference to all of the circumstances of that relationship. The evident intent of Parliament is to ensure that administrative decision-makers concern themselves with the substance, not the form, of a relationship; hence this primary direction in the subsection's preamble. The considerations which follow in that subsection are not intended to be exhaustive. They are though "relevant considerations" in the sense described in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd (ibid).

Depending on the level of abstraction at which one approaches the meaning and application of s 4(3), there is no error in approaching the question of whether to form the required statutory opinion with a pre-conception of what constitutes a "marriage". How else, especially when the members of a couple are legally married, is sensible meaning to be given to the consideration specified in s 4(3)(e)(iv), " whether the people see their relationship as a marriage-like relationship "? In that context, the Act anticipates that a concept of marriage will serve as a touchstone against which is to be measured how the parties to a relationship themselves conceive of their relationship, irrespective of its legal form. The learned senior member, correctly in my respectful opinion makes this very observation in par 16 of his reasons.</text>

<tocase>Re VCG and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ; [2006] AATA 956 ; (2006) 93 ALD 215</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2006/956.html</AustLII>
<text>"Marriage-like" means nothing more than resembling a marriage. In this very general sense some meaning, a usual or "normal" meaning, must be given to the word "marriage". In considering what this meaning might be the learned senior member evidently gained assistance from and came to apply a meaning given to the word by Deputy President Forgie in Re VCG and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ; [2006] AATA 956 ; (2006) 93 ALD 215 , at 223, [15] in which she observed that a general feature of marriage was "..... a sense of union between two people and a common purpose" . That observation by the Deputy President followed a comprehensive survey by her of judicial observations and those in the texts of various religions as to what constituted "marriage". A similar meaning for the word "marriage" is derived by recourse to standard Australian dictionaries, "a lawful union between a man and a woman for life": Macquarie Dictionary, Federation Edition , p. 1172; "the legal union of a man and a woman in order to live together and often to have children": Australian Oxford Dictionary , p. 828. The essential quality of the word, "marriage" is union.

The word "marriage" as used as part of the expression "marriage-like" in ss 4(2), 4(3) and 4(3A) of the Act is intended to apply to persons irrespective of their personal religious beliefs or in the absence of any such beliefs. These subsections are intended to have application irrespective of cultural and religious predominance or difference in our society. Beyond the general level of abstraction that "marriage" as used in this expression involves a sense of union between two people and a common purpose one must be careful to guard against discounting whether a relationship is or is seen to be "marriage-like" because of a priori assumptions concerning marriage grounded, for example, in Judeo-Christian beliefs, however deeply and sincerely one personally holds those beliefs.

Reading the published reasons as a whole, it seems to me that the Tribunal was astute to approach the assessment of the relationship between Mrs Holmes and her husband in this way and without such assumptions. In deciding, as he thought was his task, whether the parties were in a marriage-like relationship or conversely were living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis the learned senior member cautioned that a relationship " is not assessed against some hypothetical standard which assumes that a marriage or marriage-like relationship is mostly full of positive aspects and goodwill. Families and those within them, the adult members and children, are all capable of the range of human emotions including the negative traits such as violence, hatred, selfishness and mental health disorders. The complexity of human behaviour and the capacity for some to withstand the stressors of life to a greater or lesser degree makes it complex and often unpredictable " (Reasons, par 18).</text>

 "A finding by the AAT on a matter of fact cannot be reviewed on appeal unless the finding is vitiated by an error of law. Section 44 of the AAT Act confers on a party to a proceeding before the AAT a right of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia 'from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding' but only 'on a question of law'. The error of law which an appellant must rely on to succeed must arise on the facts as the AAT has found them to be or it must vitiate the findings made or it must have led the AAT to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make. There is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. " (Emphasis added)</text>

<tocase>Morales v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550</tocase>
<text>There is a limited class of case in which an error of law does not vitiate the Tribunal's decision such that, without violating the role consigned to it in an appeal on a question of law, the Court may, in determining the appeal, dismiss the appeal. The authorities concerning this class of case were collected and discussed by Sackville J in Morales v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 60 FCR 550 , at 560-561 where his Honour observed: 
 "In certain circumstances, however, the Court may exercise the power in s 44(4) of the AAT Act and make orders finally resolving the matter. In Harradine v Secretary, DSS, for example, the only question was the construction of a particular section of an Act. The parties agreed that whoever succeeded on that issue was entitled, as a matter of law, to succeed in the AAT. Accordingly, the Court made orders finally disposing of the case without remitting the matter to the AAT (at 36, 43, 49). Similarly, if the Court hearing an appeal from the AAT finds an error of law in its reasons, but nonetheless considers that the decision was clearly correct on the material before the AAT it is open to the Court to dismiss the appeal: Austin v Deputy Secretary, Attorney-General's Department (1986) 12 FCR 22 (FCA/FC), at 26-27; McAuliffe v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1992] FCA 483 ; (1991) 23 ALD 284 (FCA/von Doussa J), at 295-296, aff'd at [1992] FCA 483 ; (1992) 28 ALD 609 (FCA/FC), at 618-619; State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Collector of Customs [1991] FCA 610 ; (1991) 33 FCR 211 (FCA/FC), at 217. 
 
 The scope of the power conferred by s44(4) of the AAT Act is, however, subject to limitations. These flow from both the fact that an appeal from the AAT is on a question of law only and from the language of s44(4) and (5). The limitations were explained by Sheppard J in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gungor [1982] FCA 99 ; (1982) 63 FLR 441 (FCA/FC), at 454- 455: 
 
 'It is in my opinion not correct to say that this Court is by these provisions given wide powers to make such orders as it thinks fit. Implicit in its powers are a number of restrictions. The appeal is expressly limited to error of law, which alleged error is the sole matter before this Court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal. The order which this Court can make after hearing the appeal is also similarly restricted to an order which is appropriate by reason of its decision. It follows that the only order which can be properly made is one the propriety of which is circumscribed by and necessary to reflect this Court's view on the alleged or found error of law. To go further I would see as amounting to exceeding the jurisdiction of this Court under this section. A power to make "such order as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision" is much more restrictive than a power "to make such order as it sees fit" or a power "to make a decision in substitution for the decision" the subject of the appeal. S44(5) confirms, though it states that it does not purport to limit, this as an appropriate reading of the power in s44(4) when it limits its statement to the express power of the Court when setting aside a decision to the making of an order remitting the case to be heard again. Having set aside a decision, it has no express power to substitute what it sees as the correct decision unless such is the appropriate order by reason of its decision on the point of law in the context of the particular proceedings.'"</text>

<text>Later in time and having referred with approval to Morales' Case , the Full Court (Ryan, O'Connor and Weinberg JJ) in Tankey v Adams [2000] FCA 1089 ; (2000) 104 FCR 152 at 183 [119] stated that, " The relief which may be granted will depend on the effect of the error of law on the decision-making process. Errors of law which are 'harmless' or 'trivial' do not normally warrant the setting aside of an administrative decision Department of Social Security v McKenzie." This statement, in my respectful opinion, is peculiarly apposite in the circumstances of the present case. The Tribunal did err in law in formulating the questions before it for decision but, for the reasons I have given, that error was "harmless". It seems to me that this is a case in which it is open to determine the appeal by dismissing it.

After the conclusion of oral argument on the appeal the Court was advised that the Secretary's legal representatives had reached an agreement with those of Mrs Holmes in relation to costs.</text>

<tocase>Victoria v The Commonwealth [1971] HCA 16 ; (1970-1971) 122 CLR 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1971/16.html</AustLII>
<text>At the conclusion of his judgment in Victoria v The Commonwealth [1971] HCA 16 ; (1970-1971) 122 CLR 353 , at 404-405 Windeyer J felt moved to refer to a passage from Edmund Burke's Observations on a Late Publication intituled The Present State of the Nation , written in 1769 which he had recently come across in which Burke had opined, "Men of sense when new projects come before them always think a discourse proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner proposed to be no more than a very unpleasant way of misspending time." That reference, of course, had a particular resonance in a case concerning the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to subject the States to pay-roll tax. The present case concerns not high matters of public finance and constitutional law but government at its most intimate, whether an administrative body's value judgment that a woman subjected to domestic violence was living separately and apart from her husband on an indefinite basis was flawed by error of law such that the case had to be considered on the merits yet again. Seized with the knowledge that the error was one induced by the Secretary and that it was, in the circumstances, harmless, any man of sense might well consider that Burke's description also had application in relation to the Secretary's appeal. It only comes to this, that I dismiss the appeal and make no order as to costs.
 I certify that the preceding sixty-nine (69) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.
