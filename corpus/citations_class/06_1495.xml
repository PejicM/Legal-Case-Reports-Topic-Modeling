<text>This is an application for leave to appeal from the decision given on 8 August 2006 by Barnes FM, who declined to make an order nisi on the basis that no arguable case had been established ( Applicant S117/2005 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1169). The application for leave to appeal from that decision, and the affidavit in support, identified very general grounds of attack upon that decision, but do not tie those grounds back to any part of the reasons of the learned Federal Magistrate. Unsupported by such a reference, those grounds, in themselves, are quite meaningless.

I have explained the position to the applicant and he has, quite frankly, said that he is unable to follow the technical legal aspects of this matter. What he is seeking is another tribunal to properly assess his factual claims, and he would like more time as well. As I have indicated to him, the role of this Court is simply to correct errors in the approach of the Federal Magistrates Court, not to deal directly with the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

This matter has a long history, which I need not go into, but, as I have explained to the applicant, in the absence of his ability to raise an arguable ground of appeal from the learned Federal Magistrate's decision, I am bound to dismiss his application, which I do. The applicant is to pay the costs of the first respondent. 


 I certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
