<tocase>Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470</tocase>
<text>The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in 2002 in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made. Reference has already been made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ in HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd , dealing with the capacity of contractual promises to found representations for the purposes of s 52, which in turn refers to the judgment of Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 503 506 (see also Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217 at 233 241). A practical example of the interplay between contractual promises and misleading or deceptive conduct is seen in the decision of Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151. Nonetheless, some caution needs to be exercised in too readily equating the two ( Effem Foods Pty Ltd (t/as Uncle Ben's of Australia) v Lake Cumbeline Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 15 ; (1999) 161 ALR 599 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [12] and Callinan J at [60]; Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 679; and McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd v LS Booth Wine Transport Pty Ltd (1992) 25 NSWLR 723).</text>

<text>I am satisfied that Naturalcare, through Schadel, did rely upon the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation. Counsel for Pan relied upon some factors to negative reliance, for example, the intention to source product from Amrion; the pattern of purchase from other suppliers; the freedom reserved by Schadel to acquire goods from other suppliers if price were favourable; and the variety of manufacturers Naturalcare had listed with the TGA to manufacture its products. It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight, citing Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55 ; (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 246 n64. 96 Chappel v Hart does not compel that conclusion. Indeed, the absence of such evidence could be fatal to a claim of reliance and causation. In the present case, Schadel's evidence accords with commercial reality. Naturalcare continued to acquire most of its goods from Pan and was lulled into what was a false sense of security by the assurances over the years and entry into the Manufacturing Agreements. It is obvious that if Schadel had thought that there was any real danger of Pan losing its licence because of non-compliance with the Code, he would have taken steps to reorganise the business to minimise dependence upon Pan for supplies. In essence, Schadel was induced not to reorganise the Naturalcare business to reduce dependence upon Pan as a supplier. The misleading conduct does not have to be the sole cause of the action or inaction said to cause the damage ( I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 per Gleeson CJ at [33], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [57], per McHugh J at [90] [93] per Callinan J at [216]). 
 DAMAGES 
 
 The assessment of damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) presents some problems. Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April 2003 and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found. There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment. It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed. If Schadel's evidence is accepted then, on the hypothesis as to liability being explored, he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March 2002, both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan's particular expertise. Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall. In other words, Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan's products. Naturalcare's claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products. It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could, and should, have been put forward ( Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [38] per Hayne J; Optus Vision Pty Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited [2003] NSWSC 288 at [132] [137] (unaffected by the appeal at [2004] NSWCA 61). Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been. It, therefore, would have been likely to have increased its market share. It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative. In my opinion, the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point ( Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at [44] [52]). As it was induced to do nothing, it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train. Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss. Of necessity, the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise. There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment. The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive. If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan's licence, then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct. If reorganisation would not have been completed, there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place. The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the 12 months prior to it. However, the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan, which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply. I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence, even if commenced in March 2002. I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan. The total revenue for the period 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002 was $9 738 748 with an average monthly revenue of $811 562. In the period from 1 May 2002 to 30 April 2003, the total revenue was $11 240 026 with an average monthly revenue of $936 669. In the period from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, the total revenue was $7 841 573 with an average monthly revenue of $653 464. In the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the total revenue was $10 667 344 with an average monthly revenue of $888 945. Thus, in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply, the decrease in total revenue was $3 398 453 and in the ensuing 12 months the decrease was $572 682 in total which together can be rounded up to about $4 000 000. This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period. No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products. I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years. The total lost revenue in the two years would, as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare, understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan. No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products. It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan, Markethaven and Naturalcare. Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly. There was an attempt to use cross-examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly. In my opinion, that endeavour was unsuccessful. Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss. There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so. In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd [1932] UKHL 1 ; [1932] AC 452 (at 506): 
 
 'It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken.' 
 

It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel's reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market. Even if the result was not perfect, I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply.
 
 Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business. It is quite obvious, however, that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss. Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain. There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost. In my opinion, the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s 52. I am satisfied that, in this respect, it is appropriate to adopt a margin of 45 per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness. However, having studied his report, and taking into account his evidence under cross-examination, his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high. In my opinion, they should be approximately 15 per cent in total, rather than 20 per cent as he proposed. Therefore, in broad terms, the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows: loss of revenue $4 000 000 x gross profit margin 45 per cent = $1 800 000, less costs etc x 15 per cent = $270 000, leaving net revenue of $1 530 000. Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied. Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties. The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin. Naturalcare claims a gross margin of 58.5 per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to 55.2 per cent if freight is taken into account. In my opinion, the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid. I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim, ie gross margin of 45 per cent and MSD etc of 15 per cent. The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss. I would then discount the net amount by 20 per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred. I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach. The time has now elapsed. The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss. On that basis, interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss. The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging, costs of registration and so on. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, costs should follow the event. The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons, including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest. The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked.

<text>Naturalcare relies upon two representations. The first is that Pan would so conduct its manufacturing processes as to comply with the Code called the Quality Assurance representation. This representation is alleged to have been made by the 2002 Manufacturing Agreement in the light of previous dealings between the parties. Contractual promises can be the foundation of misleading and deceptive conduct for the purposes of s 52 in some circumstances ( HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 ; (2004) 217 CLR 640 at [13] ). Whether these are such circumstances is best judged in a wider context.

It is also alleged 'further or in the alternative' that Pan represented to Naturalcare that Pan would continue to supply all, or most of, Naturalcare's requirements as to therapeutic goods or, alternatively, Naturalcare's requirements as to soft gel goods and all or most of Naturalcare's requirements as to other therapeutic goods called the Supply representation. That alleged representation is based upon particular statements in various discussions between Schadel and Selim including that Pan was the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia and was compliant with the requirements of the TGA and, accordingly, that the risk associated with Naturalcare's reliance and dependence on Pan continuing to supply Naturalcare with those goods customarily purchased by it from Pan at the quantities customarily acquired was negligible or immaterial; and that Pan was ready, willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with all goods it customarily acquired from Pan at those quantities it customarily obtained from Pan.

It is submitted on behalf of Naturalcare that each of the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation was with respect to a future matter: in the one case, future conduct of the manufacturing process; and the other, the future ability to supply therapeutic goods, each broadly concerned with the continuing supply of therapeutic goods. It is contended that Pan has not established reasonable grounds for making either representation, with the result that the making of each of them was misleading and deceptive, or likely to mislead and deceive. It is further contended that Naturalcare relied upon the misleading conduct by continuing to conduct business on the basis that the bulk of the products it was to sell would be acquired from Pan and did not reorganise its business. This left it vulnerable to the sudden cessation of supply which occurred upon suspension of Pan's licence, leading to losses due to the disruption to its business.

The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in 2002 in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made. Reference has already been made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ in HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd , dealing with the capacity of contractual promises to found representations for the purposes of s 52, which in turn refers to the judgment of Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 503 506 (see also Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217 at 233 241).

<text>I am satisfied that Naturalcare, through Schadel, did rely upon the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation. Counsel for Pan relied upon some factors to negative reliance, for example, the intention to source product from Amrion; the pattern of purchase from other suppliers; the freedom reserved by Schadel to acquire goods from other suppliers if price were favourable; and the variety of manufacturers Naturalcare had listed with the TGA to manufacture its products. It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight, citing Chappel v Hart [1998] HCA 55 ; (1998) 195 CLR 232 at 246 n64. 96 Chappel v Hart does not compel that conclusion. Indeed, the absence of such evidence could be fatal to a claim of reliance and causation. In the present case, Schadel's evidence accords with commercial reality. Naturalcare continued to acquire most of its goods from Pan and was lulled into what was a false sense of security by the assurances over the years and entry into the Manufacturing Agreements. It is obvious that if Schadel had thought that there was any real danger of Pan losing its licence because of non-compliance with the Code, he would have taken steps to reorganise the business to minimise dependence upon Pan for supplies. In essence, Schadel was induced not to reorganise the Naturalcare business to reduce dependence upon Pan as a supplier. The misleading conduct does not have to be the sole cause of the action or inaction said to cause the damage ( I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 per Gleeson CJ at [33], per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [57], per McHugh J at [90] [93] per Callinan J at [216]). 
 DAMAGES 
 
 The assessment of damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) presents some problems. Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April 2003 and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found. There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment. It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed. If Schadel's evidence is accepted then, on the hypothesis as to liability being explored, he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March 2002, both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan's particular expertise. Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall. In other words, Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan's products. Naturalcare's claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products. It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could, and should, have been put forward ( Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 196 ALR 257 at [38] per Hayne J; Optus Vision Pty Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited [2003] NSWSC 288 at [132] [137] (unaffected by the appeal at [2004] NSWCA 61). Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been. It, therefore, would have been likely to have increased its market share. It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative. In my opinion, the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point ( Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at [44] [52]). As it was induced to do nothing, it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train. Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss. Of necessity, the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise. There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment. The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive. If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan's licence, then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct. If reorganisation would not have been completed, there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place. The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the 12 months prior to it. However, the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan, which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply. I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence, even if commenced in March 2002. I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan. The total revenue for the period 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002 was $9 738 748 with an average monthly revenue of $811 562. In the period from 1 May 2002 to 30 April 2003, the total revenue was $11 240 026 with an average monthly revenue of $936 669. In the period from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, the total revenue was $7 841 573 with an average monthly revenue of $653 464. In the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005, the total revenue was $10 667 344 with an average monthly revenue of $888 945. Thus, in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply, the decrease in total revenue was $3 398 453 and in the ensuing 12 months the decrease was $572 682 in total which together can be rounded up to about $4 000 000. This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period. No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products. I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years. The total lost revenue in the two years would, as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare, understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan. No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products. It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan, Markethaven and Naturalcare. Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly. There was an attempt to use cross-examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly. In my opinion, that endeavour was unsuccessful. Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss. There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so. In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Ltd [1932] UKHL 1 ; [1932] AC 452 (at 506): 
 
 'It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken.' 
 

It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel's reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market. Even if the result was not perfect, I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply.
 
 Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business. It is quite obvious, however, that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss. Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain. There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost. In my opinion, the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s 52. I am satisfied that, in this respect, it is appropriate to adopt a margin of 45 per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness. However, having studied his report, and taking into account his evidence under cross-examination, his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high. In my opinion, they should be approximately 15 per cent in total, rather than 20 per cent as he proposed. Therefore, in broad terms, the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows: loss of revenue $4 000 000 x gross profit margin 45 per cent = $1 800 000, less costs etc x 15 per cent = $270 000, leaving net revenue of $1 530 000. Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied. Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties. The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin. Naturalcare claims a gross margin of 58.5 per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to 55.2 per cent if freight is taken into account. In my opinion, the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid. I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim, ie gross margin of 45 per cent and MSD etc of 15 per cent. The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss. I would then discount the net amount by 20 per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred. I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach. The time has now elapsed. The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss. On that basis, interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss. The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging, costs of registration and so on. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, costs should follow the event. The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons, including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest. The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked.

It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel's reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market. Even if the result was not perfect, I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply.
 
 Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business. It is quite obvious, however, that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss. Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain. There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost. In my opinion, the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s 52. I am satisfied that, in this respect, it is appropriate to adopt a margin of 45 per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness. However, having studied his report, and taking into account his evidence under cross-examination, his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high. In my opinion, they should be approximately 15 per cent in total, rather than 20 per cent as he proposed. Therefore, in broad terms, the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows: loss of revenue $4 000 000 x gross profit margin 45 per cent = $1 800 000, less costs etc x 15 per cent = $270 000, leaving net revenue of $1 530 000. Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied. Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties. The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin. Naturalcare claims a gross margin of 58.5 per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to 55.2 per cent if freight is taken into account. In my opinion, the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid. I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim, ie gross margin of 45 per cent and MSD etc of 15 per cent. The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss. I would then discount the net amount by 20 per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred. I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach. The time has now elapsed. The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss. On that basis, interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss. The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging, costs of registration and so on. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, costs should follow the event. The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons, including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest. The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked.

<tocase>Perre v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/36.html</AustLII>
<text>The argument for Naturalcare in tort commenced with the contention that, at least between 1995 and 2002, Pan made a number of representations to Naturalcare to the effect that Pan was ready, willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with therapeutic goods; that any risk to Naturalcare arising out of Naturalcare's reliance or dependence upon Pan for the supply of product was negligible or immaterial and that Pan was, and would continue to be, compliant with the requirements of the TGA. For the purposes of argument, that can be taken as a fair summary of the statements by Selim from time to time and from the dealings between the parties over many years. The following propositions were advanced: 
 
 (1) The representations were made in circumstances in which Pan knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the representations would be relied upon (referring to L Shaddock &amp; Associates Proprietary Limited v Council of the City of Parramatta [1981] HCA 59 ; (1981) 150 CLR 225; Mid Density Developments Pty Limited v Rockdale Municipal Council (1993) 44 FCR 290; Eade v Vogiazopoulos [1999] 3 VR 889 at [115] per Smith J; Perre v Apand Pty Limited [1999] HCA 36 ; (1999) 198 CLR 180 per McHugh J at [124]). 
 (2) Naturalcare was vulnerable to Pan in the sense that it was unable to protect its own interests. Pan was in control of its own manufacturing processes and, to the extent that Naturalcare might have taken steps to protect its own interests, it was induced not to do so by Pan's express representations and conduct (referring to Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 16 ; (2003) 216 CLR 515 at [23] ; Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [10] [13] per Gleeson CJ; at [42] per Gaudron J; at [118] [119] per McHugh J; at [216] per Gummow J; at [298] per Kirby J; at [416] per Callinan J; Fortuna Seafoods Pty Ltd (as trustee for the Rowley Family Trust) v Ship 'Eternal Wind' [2005] QCA 405). 
 (3) Pan had actual foresight of the likelihood that Naturalcare could suffer harm in the event that it manufactured and supplied product otherwise than conformably with requirements of the TGA and the Code. Pan was supplying goods for sale to, and ingestion by, humans. Pan knew that Naturalcare was taking the lion's share of its products from Pan and would be damaged if that supply ceased ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [13] per Gleeson CJ; at [50]; and [133] per McHugh J). 
 (4) The statutory scheme meant that Pan assumed, for its own advantage, particular responsibilities which would give comfort to sponsors in the circumstances of Naturalcare ( Moorabool Shire Council v Taitapanui [2006] VSCA 30 at [3] , [82], [159]). 
 (5) The case falls within at least one of the standard categories in which the common law has previously recognised that a duty of care may arise, namely, the negligent supply of goods ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [96] per McHugh J). 
 (6) The policy consideration relating to indeterminacy of liability does not arise in the present case. Naturalcare was a first line victim. 
 (7) Imposing a duty of care of the kind alleged would not impose an unreasonable burden on Pan ( Perre v Apand Pty Limited at [133] per McHugh J). 

Taking these factors into account, it was submitted that Pan had a duty of care at least to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods it manufactured for supply conformed with the requirements of the TGA and the Code.</text>

Taking these factors into account, it was submitted that Pan had a duty of care at least to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods it manufactured for supply conformed with the requirements of the TGA and the Code.

Counsel for Pan has put forward a number of detailed reasons for its contention that the claim is misconceived. The most important is that Naturalcare was not 'vulnerable' in the sense required if that quality is to be a touchstone of liability as was submitted on behalf of Naturalcare. It would be necessary for Naturalcare to establish that it could not protect itself from the consequences of Pan's want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of the loss on the other party ( Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd at [23] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ; and Perre v Apand Pty Ltd per McHugh J at [120]). The risk of a supplier of goods not being able to maintain supply is an every day incident of commercial life. Many statutes regulate manufacturers and suppliers of goods. There is always a risk that if the statute is not complied with, the supply of goods may be prohibited or suspended. Various strategies to minimise risks of that kind and their impact are available to the intending purchaser. Particular contractual provisions can be framed, insurance can be sought, alternative suppliers located and so on. All available strategies were open to Naturalcare. The answer given on behalf of Naturalcare is that it was convinced by Selim's assurances not to take such prudent steps. That is no answer. It highlights the fact that the real complaint is about the alleged representations, not about failure to take reasonable care to ensure that the requirements of the Code were met.</text>

<tocase>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher [1988] HCA 7 ; (1988) 164 CLR 387</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/7.html</AustLII>
<text>Naturalcare relies upon promissory estoppel as a 'sword', that is, as a source of substantive rights enforceable as a cause of action in its own right. Counsel referred to Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher [1988] HCA 7 ; (1988) 164 CLR 387 at 416 per Brennan J; Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 at 430 per Brennan J; News Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 21 ACSR 553 at 569; and Gray (As Administrator of the Estate of Gray) v National Crime Authority [2003] NSWSC 111 at [153] [159] (cf Australian Crime Commission v Gray (As Administrator of the Estate of Gray) [2003] NSWCA 318 per Mason P at [40], agreed to by Tobias JA at [313]). Counsel for Pan submits that this claim is misconceived and that equitable estoppel can not be used as a sword otherwise than in equity. Counsel submits that Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher does not establish that equitable estoppel is a cause of action in itself capable of sounding in damages (legal or equitable) although it may assist in establishing a recognised cause of action such as breach of contract (as in that case). There is much to be said for that submission. However, the question is controversial (KR Handley, Estoppel by Conduct and Election, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 2006, Ch 13). As I have a clear view that the integers of promissory estoppel are not established, I need not deal further with this fundamental question. It should be noted that the claim for estoppel by convention is not pursued.

The estoppel case pleads the assumption that Pan was, and would continue to be, the exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement, including any renewed term. The case pleads an expectation by Naturalcare that Pan would continue to be its exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare and that Pan would not be free to, or would not, withdraw from that expected relationship for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement, including any renewed term.

That assumption and that expectation are said to have arisen from the same course of conduct as was alleged to have given rise to the Supply Contract, together with some allegations of a general kind as to the relationship between the parties, also relied upon to establish a duty of care. Counsel for Naturalcare referred, in particular, to parts of a conversation between Schadel, Davis and Selim, which took place in 1995.

The next problem is in identifying an appropriate subject matter for the assumption or expectation. Counsel for Naturalcare referred to the passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher where his Honour said, amongst other things (at 428): 
 
 '... the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship;' 
 

Mason CJ and Wilson J referred to 'basic assumptions underlying the transaction between the parties' (at 406). They went on to point out that the failure to fulfil a promise does not, of itself, amount to unconscionable conduct and mere reliance upon an executory promise to do something does not bring promissory estoppel into play (also at 406). It is submitted by counsel for Naturalcare that the legal relationship in question was as supplier of Naturalcare's soft gel business and of the majority of Naturalcare's tablet business. In my opinion, that does not amount to a relevant assumption or expectation. It only illustrates a continuing commercial relationship.

The next problem is that Naturalcare has to establish that the estoppel in the terms alleged was operative in 2003. I have no difficulty in rejecting that contention. Such an assumption would be inconsistent with the course of dealings between the parties up to that time. Naturalcare had acquired soft gel products from non Pan sources and the majority of tablets from non Pan sources. Counsel for Naturalcare was only able to argue that Naturalcare gave Pan almost all of its soft gel business between January 2000 and April 2003, being 89 per cent by value and 48.2 per cent of its tablet products by value and Naturalcare acquired 58.25 per cent of its tablet products (by value) from Pan in the period January 2000 to April 2003, rather than 48.2 per cent but only if Healthy Joints figures are excluded.

Next, it is not at all clear how it is alleged that the assumption and expectation were unconscientiously departed from. The failure to supply products was not the kind of deliberate unconscientious departure from a state of affairs which might found a promissory estoppel. It was the result of action by the TGA pursuant to statute.</text>

<text>The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in 2002 in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made. Reference has already been made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ in HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd , dealing with the capacity of contractual promises to found representations for the purposes of s 52, which in turn refers to the judgment of Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems 2000 (Developments) Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd (1993) 42 FCR 470 at 503 506 (see also Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis [1992] 2 VR 217 at 233 241). A practical example of the interplay between contractual promises and misleading or deceptive conduct is seen in the decision of Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151. Nonetheless, some caution needs to be exercised in too readily equating the two ( Effem Foods Pty Ltd (t/as Uncle Ben's of Australia) v Lake Cumbeline Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 15 ; (1999) 161 ALR 599 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [12] and Callinan J at [60]; Wright v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 679; and McWilliam's Wines Pty Ltd v LS Booth Wine Transport Pty Ltd (1992) 25 NSWLR 723).</text>
