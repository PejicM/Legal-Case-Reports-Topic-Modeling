<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/351.html</AustLII>
<text>11 The procedural background to these proceedings is set out in my judgment delivered on 14 March 2007: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria (No 2) [2007] FCA 351 , particularly at [12] to [39].

12 In this proceeding, a number of notices of motion have been filed by Ms Bahonko at various times. Some of those motions have been completely dealt with, some of them have been partly dealt with, and others have not been determined being left to await the determination of the applications the subject of these reasons. It is useful to set out the parts of the notices of motion that remain open for determination by the Court:
 
 1. As mentioned above, the motion of the NBV, notice of which was dated 15 September 2006, seeking orders that Ms Bahonko be refused leave to extend time for the initiation of this proceeding and, in the alternative, for summary disposal of the proceeding if leave to initiate is granted.
 2. As mentioned above, the Minister's motion, notice of which was also dated 15 September 2006, seeking orders that there be judgment for the Minister against Ms Bahonko under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court Act.
 3. Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was dated 22 September 2006, seeking orders:

 3.2 "That Ms Saunders will be held accountable for the obstruction of justice, trickery, fraud, making false statements";

 3.5 "That a new direction hearing be established and conducted by the Judge without the conflict of interest and permanently allocated to the case";
 3.6 "That extension of time to institute appeal against Justice Ryan orders be granted to applicant". 
 
 
 4. Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was dated 3 October 2006, which seeks, amongst other things, leave to appeal against the directions made by Ryan J on 1 September 2006, and in particular, orders in the following terms: 
 
 
 4.1 "Extra time to lodge application for leave to appeal Justice Ryan Orders of 01/09/06 is granted to the applicant";
 4.2 "Leave to appeal Justice Ryan orders from 01/09/06 are given to the applicant";
 4.3 "Applicant is exempted from the strict following of the Court Rules";
 4.4 "The Court Hearings including trial will be scheduled no more often than on a fortnightly basis". 
 
 
 5. Ms Bahonko's motion, notice of which was dated 31 October 2006, seeking orders that:

<tocase>Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2004] VCAT 1663</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VCAT/2004/1663.html</AustLII>
<text>25 On 4 June 2004, Ms Bahonko filed an application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ('VCAT') for review of the NBV's decision of 24 May 2004 to suspend her registration. On 19 August 2004, on application by the NBV, VCAT decided to strike out Ms Bahonko's application: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2004] VCAT 1663.

26 On 17 June 2004, the NBV held a board meeting to review its decision to suspend Ms Bahonko's registration and it decided to maintain the suspension. A letter was written to Ms Bahonko explaining the NBV's decision to continue the investigations and the suspension of her registration.

27 Ms Bahonko claimed she was told by the NBV's investigator, Ms Miln, that the NBV would lift her suspension, but due to her not signing some papers, this did not occur. However, according to a letter to Ms Bahonko from Russell Kennedy on behalf of the NBV, it was stated that Ms Miln required Ms Bahonko to "cooperate in and assist with the investigation process" in order to have the suspension lifted. It was also stated that a decision to lift the suspension could only be made by the NBV.</text>

<tocase>Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2005] HCATrans 864</tocase>
<text>34 On 25 August 2004, proceedings were filed by Ms Bahonko in the Supreme Court of Victoria seeking, amongst other things, an injunction to restrain the NBV's hearing of the complaints against Ms Bahonko scheduled for 27 September 2004. On 6 September 2004, the Supreme Court proceeding was heard and dismissed on the basis that it had no prospect of success. Ms Bahonko appealed this decision, which was dismissed, and Ms Bahonko's application for special leave to appeal in the High Court was also refused: see Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2005] HCATrans 864 (20 October 2005).

35 The Panel's formal hearing went ahead on 27 September 2004 and was not attended by Ms Bahonko though she had been invited to attend. On 14 October 2004, in its written determination, the Panel found that Ms Bahonko "had engaged in unprofessional conduct of a serious nature". It appears from the Panel's reasons for determination that a number of witnesses appeared at the hearing and the NBV was represented by counsel and Russell Kennedy solicitors. The Panel found that Ms Bahonko showed "a consistent refusal to accept direction that appears to the Panel to be deliberate, repeated and inexcusable". The Panel went on to find that her attitude towards the investigation and hearing was corroborative of the evidence "given in relation to Ms Bahonko's inability to take direction from her professional superiors".

36 The Panel determined to lift the suspension of Ms Bahonko's registration as a nurse and impose the following restrictions on her registration:
 
 
 1. That Ms Bahonko work under clinical supervision for a period of six months following her return to work as a registered nurse; 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. That Ms Bahonko's employer/s provide a report or reports in writing to the Board in relation to her work performance every three months, for two years following her return to work as a registered nurse; 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. That Ms Bahonko undertake counselling with a registered psychologist, approved by the Board, for a period of two years with a therapeutic focus on improving her communication and team-building skills, and that reports on the compliance with counselling be provided by the psychologist to the Board on a confidential basis every three months; 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. That Ms Bahonko supply the Board with the name of the registered psychologist with whom she proposes to undertake counselling within one month of the date of the reasons for this determination; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. That Ms Bahonko successfully complete a course in medication administration, approved by the Board, of at least two days' duration.</text>

<tocase>Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/1325.html</AustLII>
<text>42 Justice Weinberg has usefully set out some other key aspects of the HREOC Act in the recent decision of Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1325 at [14] to [20]. I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. However, leave to appeal from that decision was refused by Tracey J in Bahonko v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2006] FCA 1492 and in my respectful view, the statement of the relevant principles as set out by Weinberg J is correct.

47 Under s 46PO(2), it is clear that the Court has a discretion to grant an extension of time. The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were described by Weinberg J in the decision of Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [21] to [24]. His Honour referred to the principles expounded by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9, which related to an application for an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'), and held that the principles therein stated were applicable to s 46PO. I respectfully agree with Weinberg J that those principles are relevantly applicable to an application under the HREOC Act.

50 However, it was always clear that the matter of the necessity for leave remained an issue. The way in which the proceeding has run its course has been a result of the number of interlocutory applications brought by all the parties which required consideration by the Court. No interlocutory application involved or proceeded on the basis that the issue of leave to file out of time was resolved in favour of Ms Bahonko. There can be no suggestion of waiver or abandonment by virtue of the conduct of the respondents to lead to the view that the extension of time issue need not be determined by me or that it did not remain a live issue for decision. Further, there is no basis to suggest that s 46PR is applicable to issues going to jurisdiction so as to permit me to consider the application for leave otherwise than in accordance with the principles set out above: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at [20] and [70]. Further, there can be no prejudice to Ms Bahonko, as the applications for summary dismissal, which were also before me, required consideration of the merits of the case, and therefore she was anticipating having to deal with the question of the merits of her complaints, and was given ample opportunity to do so.

51 The period of delay is not a significant one. Ms Bahonko explained that she had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11 April 2006 and was still ill from the time the Commission gave her notice of the termination of the complaint on 1 June 2006. She submitted a number of medical certificates which stated she was unfit to work because of the accident from 11 April 2006 to 17 July 2006.

52 On the basis of those certificates, I accept that Ms Bahonko was ill at the time she received notification of the complaint until 17 June 2006. I note that the delay in filing her proceeding is relatively short, and I consider her excuse is acceptable in the circumstances.

63 The Minister referred to the decision of Weinberg J concerning a discrimination proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko against the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ('RMIT') and others: see Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. In that case, his Honour was similarly faced with an application for an extension of time, as Ms Bahonko had filed out of time, and an application for summary judgment made by one of the respondents. After his Honour considered the various claims, he refused to grant Ms Bahonko an extension of time, concluding in relation to the claims against RMIT as follows (at [86]):
 
 It would be quite wrong, in my view, to grant an extension of time in circumstances where there is a paucity of material to support claims of unlawful discrimination which are cast in sweeping, unparticularised and seemingly exaggerated terms. It is clear that the Commission acted correctly in terminating her complaints, having regard to the material that Ms Bahonko placed before it. The additional material placed before this Court in support of her application for review of the Commission's decision takes her case no further.

64 The Minister submitted that Ms Bahonko's material against the Minister was similarly sweeping, unparticularised and exaggerated and that the Commission was right to terminate and finalise her complaints against the Minister on the basis of the material before it. It was submitted that the additional material placed before this Court takes her case no further. In the alternative, it was submitted that if the material does take the case further, it is not the same or substantially the same as those in her complaints, and is therefore outside the scope of review by this Court under s 46PO(3).

116 In any event, I accept the Minister's submissions that the Minister's role in relation to the NBV was limited, in the same way Weinberg J found the role of the Minister for Education and Training was limited in Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325. The Minister was not directly involved in the decisions and conduct of the NBV, but rather the NBV was constituted as a distinct and separate body under the Nurses Act and its decisions were its own.

117 Further, and in any event, s 18A is confined to the acts of agents and employees which, as the Minister submitted, does not extend to the NBV, as the NBV is not an employee or agent of the Minister. True it is that the Minister appoints NBV members, but this does not make the Minister liable for actions of the NBV in relation to investigating professional conduct of nurses and imposing conditions on nurses' registrations: see also Bahonko v RMIT [2006] FCA 1325 at 78.

118 Similarly, Ms Bahonko's claim that the Minister contravened s 122 of the DDA depended upon my finding that the NBV contravened s 42 of the DDA. On the basis of my finding above that there is no evidence to suggest that the NBV contravened s 42 , this claim is without merit.

119 I accept the Minister's submissions that Ms Bahonko did not make any credible claim against the Minister, and refuse her application for an extension of time to bring proceedings against the Minister.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/115.html</AustLII>
<text>129 As to the extension of the jurisdiction of this Court, I know of no basis upon which I can extend the jurisdiction of this Court to include criminal jurisdiction: see also Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 115 at [17] per Jessup J. Therefore, to the extent that application is made seeking to pursue such orders, it should be dismissed.

130 The applicant gave notice pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) that this proceeding involved a constitutional matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. The relevant notice was given by Ms Bahonko to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and of the States, but none of the Attorneys-General made any submissions to the Court.

131 The notice of a constitutional matter, filed with the Court on 17 May 2007, does not provide much indication of the nature of the alleged constitutional matter, save from mentioning s 117 of the Constitution . In the notice, Ms Bahonko made a number of assertions, none of which amount to any proper issue arising under the Constitution or a matter involving its interpretation. Instead, she rehearsed the facts and made a number of bald assertions. There is simply no material to support any claim that any provision of the Constitution has been breached in the way asserted by Ms Bahonko.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/1566.html</AustLII>
<text>95 In relation to Ms Bahonko's submissions on the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic), it must be noted that Ms Bahonko does not seek any relief in her application under that Act. Therefore, even if the Court had jurisdiction to hear a matter arising under that Act, no such matter arises in this proceeding against the NBV or the Minister. There is certainly no evidence that the procedures required to be followed in that Act were followed. Ms Bahonko did not file a complaint with the Commission (as that term is defined in that Act) or that such complaint was referred to VCAT. Further, and in any event, this Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision of the Commission (as defined in that Act) or VCAT, which is properly the subject of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria: see s 148 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998 (Vic); s 211 of the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic); and Scherbakova v Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology [2000] FCA 1566 per Weinberg J.

96 Accordingly, I consider the complaints relevant to Ms Bahonko's application to extend time are those relating to discrimination on the basis of race, descent, ethnic origin and imputed disability under the RDA and the DDA, and I will consider these on the basis of all the material put forward concerning such discrimination.

97 In order to properly consider Ms Bahonko's claims, it is necessary to set out s 9 of the RDA, which prohibits unlawful racial discrimination in the following terms:
 
 It is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</text>

<tocase>Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/12.html</AustLII>
<text>125 Further, and in any event, the application is an abuse of process, because it is foredoomed to fail: see Walton v Gardiner [1992] HCA 12 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393. Whilst Ms Bahonko is certainly aggrieved by a sequence of circumstances, I can find no basis to support any allegation of unlawful discrimination, and the respondents should not be further vexed by unjustifiable proceedings and forced to incur unnecessary costs.

126 Ms Bahonko's claims against Ms Saunders' conduct at the directions hearing on 1 September 2006 before Ryan J are misconceived. There is no evidence to suggest that Ms Saunders has been involved in "deception/fraud" or "obstruction of justice, trickery, frauds, making false statements" on 1 September 2006. There is nothing to suggest that the actions of Ms Saunders were taken other than in the interests of her client and in accordance with her duties to the Court. Accordingly, the orders sought should not be made and the motion will be dismissed.

127 Ms Bahonko made allegations of contempt of this Court against the NBV, the Minister, the Victorian Government Solicitors, Russell Kennedy and Dr Entwisle by way of various motions. She also filed a notice of motion dated 28 May 2007 with an accompanying statement of charge. Her claims focused on their involvement generally in these proceedings, including the bringing of the summary dismissal applications, their management of the evidence in this proceeding, their perceived conflicts of interest, and their applications seeking to appoint a guardian. The crux of her submission was that their behaviour amounted to protection of the primary offenders, and was generally misleading to the Court.</text>
