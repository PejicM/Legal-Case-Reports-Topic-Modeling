<text>The judgment of the Federal Magistrate refusing reinstatement is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered. It is supported by Full Court authority in NALM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 17 at [24] where their Honours held that the certificate in question did not identify a medical condition or explain why it would prevent the applicant from appearing in Court.

No substantive injustice would arise if leave were refused as the Court below carefully considered the merits of the applicant's substantive application and persuasively reasoned that it had no merit. The applicant's challenge to the Tribunal's decision essentially concerned questions of fact rather than the identification of judicially reviewable errors. His Honour correctly found that there was no arguable case for judicial review.

The application for leave to appeal is dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.
