<tocase>ACTEW Corp Ltd v Mihaljevic [2007] ACTSC 39</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//act/ACTSC/2007/39.html</AustLII>
<text>At about the same time that Meltend 75 FCR 511 was decided, Hunt CJ at CL in New South Wales also reviewed the authorities in some detail in Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v Kane (1997) 140 FLR 468. That judgment provides support for the view that a document sent inadvertently or mistakenly would not be disclosed voluntarily within the meaning of s 122 , particularly if the hypothetical reasonable solicitor would have realised that it had been sent by mistake. Not long afterwards, Sackville J said something similar in BT Australasia Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 208 209. The authorities have again recently been reviewed by Harper M in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in ACTEW Corp Ltd v Mihaljevic [2007] ACTSC 39 and Willett v Belconnen Soccer Club Ltd [2007] ACTSC 41. In both cases his Honour followed Meltend 75 FCR 511. Pagone J of the Victorian Supreme Court did the same in Body Corporate No 413424R v Sheppard [2007] VSC 179.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2004] NSWSC 934</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2004/934.html</AustLII>
<text>Faced with that apparent conflict between judges of the Court, in the time available I endeavoured to see what has happened in other courts. That exercise has further confused the picture. For example, counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon the decision of Austin J in Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 521 in which privilege was maintained, notwithstanding inspection of the document by the other side. On the other hand, Austin J considered a similar question in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2004] NSWSC 934 and held that disclosure of documents which could be described as inadvertent, in a situation not unlike the present, was held to be knowing and voluntary pursuant to s 122(2) of the Act without reference to his decision in Sovereign Motor Inns [2000] NSWSC 521. The question is further complicated where the opposing party actually has a copy of the document in his possession available to be used.</text>

<tocase>Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/532.html</AustLII>
<text>Loss of client legal privilege for relevant purposes is governed by s 122 of the Act. Section 122(2) involves a party knowingly and voluntarily disclosing to another person the substance of the evidence. Section 122(4) deals with the substance of the evidence having been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the party to another person. Counsel for the applicant submitted that I should follow the decision of Jacobson J in Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 where his Honour held (at [38]): 
 
 "An inadvertent or unintentional act will not be sufficient to amount to waiver." 
 

I would normally follow such a recent and considered decision of a judge of the Court. However, the other authorities to which I was referred by counsel drew attention to the decision of Goldberg J in Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 511, to which Jacobson J was apparently not referred, in which Goldberg J made a detailed analysis of the statutory provisions and the authorities and concluded that mere inadvertence or unintentional disclosure in itself is not sufficient to maintain privilege particularly where documents have been inspected.</text>
