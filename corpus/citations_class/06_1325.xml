<tocase>Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1531 ; (2000) 105 FCR 573 at [38] - [43]</tocase>

<text>Further, as both Ms Alison O'Brien and Mr Jorgensen submitted, the right of an affected person to apply to this Court for relief under s 46PO is limited to applications in respect of complaints of "unlawful discrimination" made to the Commission under Pt IIB. The effect of s 46PO(3) is to preclude a complainant from agitating in this Court a complaint in relation to other types of discrimination: Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1531 ; (2000) 105 FCR 573 at [38] - [43] per Katz J.

Ms Bahonko has submitted that, pursuant to s 46PR the Court "is not bound by technicalities or legal forms". Accordingly, it should allow her to pursue her complaints regarding religious and political discrimination within this proceeding notwithstanding the fact that her application was brought pursuant to s 46PO. She submitted that this was necessary in order to avoid possible fragmentation of proceedings.

The question whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear a matter, however, is not a mere technicality or legal form. This Court is either vested with jurisdiction to hear the complaints regarding religious and political discrimination, or it is not. It is clear for the reasons initially outlined by Mr Jorgensen, and later taken up by Ms Alison O'Brien, as well as from the provisions of the HREOC Act itself, that this Court has no such jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 pp 348-9</tocase>
<text>The principles to be considered when deciding whether to extend time for the filing of an application were clearly enunciated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9. That case concerned s 11(1)(c) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) 1977 (Cth) which is similar, in terms, to s 46PO(2).

Wilcox J noted that although the section did not place any onus of proof upon an applicant for an extension of time, an application had to be made. Special circumstances did not need to be shown but the Court would not grant the application unless positively satisfied that it was proper to do so. The "proscribed period" (28 days in that case) was not to be ignored. Indeed, it was the prima facie rule that proceedings commenced outside the proscribed period would not be entertained. An applicant for an extension had to show an "acceptable explanation of the delay" and that it was "fair and equitable" in the circumstances to extend time.

His Honour set out other relevant factors, which ought guide the exercise of the Court's discretion. These included the question of prejudice to the respondent. However, the mere absence of prejudice was not enough to justify the grant of an extension. Importantly, he added that the merits of the substantial application were properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted.</text>

<tocase>Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 at [12]</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/624.html</AustLII>
<text>In Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 624 , Cowdroy J held (at [12]) that those principles were relevant to an application under s 46PO. I am of the same view.

In support of her application to extend time, Ms Bahonko tendered a number of medical certificates. She submitted that those certificates explained that she had been ill during the delay period.

Although the medical certificates were not exhibited or attached to any affidavit, the respondents did not object to Ms Bahonko relying on them. Accordingly, the certificates were accepted into evidence.</text>
