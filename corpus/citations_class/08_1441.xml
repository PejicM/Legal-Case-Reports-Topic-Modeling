<tocase>Bushell v Repatriation Commission (1992) 175 CLR 408</tocase>
<text>18 The tribunal's reasons did not deal with that part of the hypothesis in Dr Volker's evidence that the development of Mr Gilkinson's obesity, first observed in 1971, was contributed to by either the effects of shift work alone, or that in combination with the two factors of eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently. Whether or not Dr Volker's hypothesis was right or wrong, it could not be said to be fanciful, impossible, incredible, not tenable, too remote or too tenuous, unless the tribunal found as a fact that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no temporal connection between Mr Gilkinson having to undertake shift work while on operational service and the development of his obesity: Bushell v Repatriation Commission (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 421-422 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ.</text>

<tocase>Byrne v Repatriation Commission (2007) 242 ALR 620</tocase>
<text>22 A finding of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt requires the exclusion of any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the contrary. The question for the tribunal was whether, having regard to the hypothesis of Dr Volker, his obesity could be said beyond reasonable doubt not to have arisen out of or been attributable to Mr Gilkinson's operational service: Roncevich 222 CLR at 125-126 [23]-[28]; see too Byrne v Repatriation Commission (2007) 242 ALR 620 at 633 [58] per Buchanan J, with whom Gyles J at 621 [3] and Edmonds J at 623 [11] agreed.

30 I am of opinion that the amended notice of appeal did state questions of law. As was the case in Roncevich 222 CLR at 126 [28], the questions of law were whether the tribunal posed for itself and answered the two relevant questions. The tribunal's statement in the last sentence of [22] of its reasons, that nothing occurred during the operational service that in any way caused or contributed to Mr Gilkinson's obesity, over and above the existing fact that he was eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently, was a mere conclusion or assertion: cf: Byrne 242 ALR at 632 [53] per Buchanan J, Edmonds J agreeing at [10]. It did not advance a reason for negating beyond reasonable doubt Dr Volker's hypothesis that shift work could have caused or contributed to Mr Gilkinson's eating or not exercising. Instead, the tribunal simply stated a conclusion which indirectly may have rejected the hypothesis. But, it had to make a finding of fact as to whether that hypothesis had been disproved beyond reasonable doubt. Since Dr Volker put forward the hypothesis that shift work contributed to the eating disorder, the tribunal had to make findings which negated any causal effect of shift work on the obesity of Mr Gilkinson first observed in 1971 after he had completed 92 days of operational service for his country.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>24 Of course, the reasons of an administrative decision-maker must not be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error. Those reasons are meant to inform and should not be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which they are expressed. The Court must guard against turning a review of a decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration on the merits of a decision as explained by Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272.

25 Here, the tribunal simply asserted that Mr Gilkinson's eating habits and lack of exercise habits had nothing to do with his operational service. But it never dealt with the questions of any relationship between either or both of those habits and the necessity for him to undertake shift work as a part of his ordinary service and how his being obese may or may not have been arisen from or been attributable to the necessity for him to perform shift work during his operational service.

26 The Commission argued that, at least implicitly, the tribunal must have reasoned that Mr Gilkinson would have reached obesity whether he had gone on operational service or not. That argument recognised, by using the word "implicitly", the tribunal's lack of express reasons to negate any hypothesis concerning shift work. The tribunal was required under s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Act to set out its reasons and not to leave important matters to be dealt with by implications. It was not entitled to leave open the hypothesis, clearly articulated by Dr Volker, that the necessity to perform shift work while on operational service itself contributed to Mr Gilkinson's eating disorder and lack of exercise leading to his obesity. The tribunal dealt expressly with only three of the four factors raised in Dr Volker's hypothesis namely, the plentiful supply of food and alcohol and low levels of physical activity. It did not deal with shift work.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/30.html</AustLII>
<text>14 Where the tribunal gives the reasons for its decision in writing, s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) provides that those reasons must include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. The tribunal need only set out the findings that it actually made: Minister for Immigration v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 349 [77] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. The tribunal's identification of what it considered to be the material questions of fact might demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration: Yusuf 206 CLR at 346 [69]. A complaint that the tribunal failed to make a relevant finding of fact will often amount to a complaint of error of law or a failure to take into account relevant considerations, as their Honours pointed out in Yusuf 206 CLR at 349-350 [78].</text>

<text>15 If a decision-maker does not give any reason for his or her decision, a court may be able to infer that the decision-maker had no good reason for it: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 224 [39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ. They pointed out that the decision in R v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Limited [1953] HCA 22 ; (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120 had held that where a constitutional writ of prohibition was sought, the inadequacy of material on which the decision-maker acted might support the inference that the decision-maker had applied the wrong test or was not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters: Palme 216 CLR at 223 [39].</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Tuite [1993] FCA 39 ; (1993) 39 FCR 540</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/39.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The relevant question for the tribunal was whether there was a reasonable hypothesis that Mr Gilkinson's shift work during the period of his operational service prior to the diagnosis of obesity in June 1971 contributed causally to his being obese at this time. The fact that prior to his operational service Mr Gilkinson may have been well on the way to that physical state, did not mean that when he arrived there his obesity had not arisen out of or been attributable to his operational service at all. The tribunal made findings which dealt with only three of the four factors mentioned by Dr Volker. It gave no reasons why, despite her opinion and her references to literature supporting the theory, shift work could not have contributed to Mr Gilkerson's obesity which first occurred during his operational service: Repatriation Commission v Tuite [1993] FCA 39 ; (1993) 39 FCR 540 at 542 per Davies J. As Burchett and Einfeld JJ said in Tuite 39 FCR at 545:
 "It is true that not everything which occurs while a man is in camp is attributable to his war service. But here the circumstances and incidents of camp life were plainly capable of having a causal influence upon the respondent's decision to take up smoking, and upon his continuance in the habit until the inevitable onset of nicotinic addiction." (emphasis added)

20 Burchett and Einfeld JJ thus found that it was open to the tribunal in that case to conclude that a consequence of camp life is a consequence of war service. Likewise, here it was open to the tribunal to find that a consequence of Mr Gilkinson continuing with shift work during operational service was the onset of obesity. The hypothesis put forward by Dr Volker and the undisputed fact that Mr Gilkinson was undertaking shift work, had been raised before the tribunal. But, the tribunal did not expressly consider in its reasons the impact of shift work either alone or in combination with Mr Glkinson's eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently. All it did was to assert that "nothing that occurred during his operational service" prior to the assumed onset of sleep apnoea "in any way caused or contributed to his obesity over and above the existing fact that [he] was eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently".

21 Mr Gilkinson actually became obese during his operational service, notwithstanding that before that time he was well on the way to being obese. Dr Volker's hypothesis was that the shift work itself that Mr Gilkinson was undertaking during operational service, contributed to his being obese. This issue was like the veteran's having continued to smoke in Tuite 39 FCR at 545 amounting to a matter that the tribunal could conclude was a contributing factor to the veteran's addiction to nicotine. However, the tribunal did not consider or make any finding relating to whether Mr Gilkinson's obesity arose out of or was attributable to the shift work he engaged in on operational service.</text>

<tocase>Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/40.html</AustLII>
<text>4 The use of the disjunctive expressions in s 9(1)(b) "arose out of" and "attributable to" manifested a legislative intention to give "defence caused" a broad meaning: see Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115 at 126 [27] where this construction was given to an analogous provision, s 70(5)(a). McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ held that that meaning was not necessarily circumscribed by considerations such as whether the relevant act of the veteran was one that he was obliged to do as a member in the armed forces. They held that the test of attributibility was capable of being satisfied by a causal link alone or a causal connection without any qualifications. Their Honours held that, by failing to pose and answer to the correct question, the tribunal had committed an error of law which was appellable under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth): Roncevich 222 CLR at 126 [27]-[28].

5 Their Honours had earlier accepted that whether an event arose in the course of an activity or "out of" an activity, depended upon such matters as the nature of the person's employment, the circumstances in which it was undertaken, and what, in consequence, the person was required or expected to do to carry out his or her actual duties. The connection must be causal, not merely temporal: Roncevich 222 CLR at 125 [23]

6 A veteran's claim for a pension in respect of his or her incapacity from a disease has to be assessed by the Commission (and then the tribunal) on the basis provided in s 120(1). If that incapacity related to operational service rendered by the veteran, the Commission had to determine that the disease was a war-caused disease "... unless it is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that there is no sufficient ground for making that determination". Next, in applying s 120(1) in respect of the veteran's incapacity from disease related to service rendered by him or her, the Commission must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is no sufficient ground for determining that it was a war-caused disease. It may only reach this conclusion if the Commission, "... after consideration of the whole of the material before it, is of the opinion that the material before it does not raise a reasonable hypothesis connecting the ... disease ... with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person" (s 120(3)).

7 In addition, s 120A(3) provides that, for the purpose of s 120(3), an hypothesis connecting a disease contracted by a person "... with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person" is reasonable only if there is in force:
 
 
 "(a) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(2) ... that upholds the hypothesis." 
 
 
There is no onus of proof on the veteran or anyone else, including the Commission, which applies to the determination of a claim (s 120(6)).

22 A finding of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt requires the exclusion of any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the contrary. The question for the tribunal was whether, having regard to the hypothesis of Dr Volker, his obesity could be said beyond reasonable doubt not to have arisen out of or been attributable to Mr Gilkinson's operational service: Roncevich 222 CLR at 125-126 [23]-[28]; see too Byrne v Repatriation Commission (2007) 242 ALR 620 at 633 [58] per Buchanan J, with whom Gyles J at 621 [3] and Edmonds J at 623 [11] agreed.

30 I am of opinion that the amended notice of appeal did state questions of law. As was the case in Roncevich 222 CLR at 126 [28], the questions of law were whether the tribunal posed for itself and answered the two relevant questions. The tribunal's statement in the last sentence of [22] of its reasons, that nothing occurred during the operational service that in any way caused or contributed to Mr Gilkinson's obesity, over and above the existing fact that he was eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently, was a mere conclusion or assertion: cf: Byrne 242 ALR at 632 [53] per Buchanan J, Edmonds J agreeing at [10]. It did not advance a reason for negating beyond reasonable doubt Dr Volker's hypothesis that shift work could have caused or contributed to Mr Gilkinson's eating or not exercising. Instead, the tribunal simply stated a conclusion which indirectly may have rejected the hypothesis. But, it had to make a finding of fact as to whether that hypothesis had been disproved beyond reasonable doubt. Since Dr Volker put forward the hypothesis that shift work contributed to the eating disorder, the tribunal had to make findings which negated any causal effect of shift work on the obesity of Mr Gilkinson first observed in 1971 after he had completed 92 days of operational service for his country.</text>
