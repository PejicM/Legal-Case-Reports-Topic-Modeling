<tocase>Bretag v Immigration Review Tribunal (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 29 November 1991)</tocase>
<text>36 As to the question of evidence of subsequent events, I have considered the case of Bretag v Immigration Review Tribunal (unreported, O'Loughlin J, 29 November 1991) (' Bretag '). In that case, the Tribunal had to answer the question of whether two persons in a relationship had a mutual commitment to the exclusion of others. The Tribunal had to determine the question at a particular point in time but made reference to evidence about subsequent events in assessing whether at the relevant time the relationship was exclusive. In reviewing the decision of the Tribunal, the court found that the Tribunal's undue reliance on the evidence of subsequent events disclosed error. The court did not hold that, in all circumstances, evidence of subsequent events was a relevant consideration which the legislation required the Tribunal to consider. Rather, the court held that in determining the nature of a relationship at a particular time, evidence of subsequent events may be taken into account if it tends to logically show the existence or non-existence of the relationship at that particular time. As stated by O'Loughlin:
 
 It is clear, of course, that the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to evidence that dealt with the relationship between Mr Bretag and the applicant and between Mr Bretag and Leanne subsequent to 28 January 1990 for the purposes of testing the claimed relationship between the applicant and Mr Bretag as at that date and as at the date of the application for the PEPAE 7 February 1990. But the evidence of the subsequent history is only relevant so long as it tends to logically show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined.

37 However O'Loughlin J, in finding error in the Tribunal's reasoning process, explained that the Tribunal must be careful not to attribute too much weight to the evidence of subsequent events:
 
 In my opinion the Tribunal erred in law. It correctly identified the test that it had to apply, that is, the "Dhillon test", but having made that correct decision it erred in law by permitting itself to be influenced inappropriately by events that occurred subsequent to the events subsisting at the time of the application...The duty of the Tribunal was to assess the personal circumstances of the applicant and her husband as they existed at the time when the application for the PEPAE was made, that is, as at 7 February 1990. In terms of the "Dhillon test", the dominant question was this: as at 7 February 1990, can it be said that the parties had a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of others. It was a misconception of the limited evidence on the subject of Mr Bretag's state of mind to draw an inference that his relationship to the applicant was not, on that date, either genuine or continuing. 
 ... 
 I have concluded that the Tribunal did not use subsequent events as an aid to determine the existence or non-existence of facts that were relevant to the issue (in the manner permitted by Pochi's case); rather, it permitted itself to be influenced inappropriately by the resumption of the relationship between Mr Bretag and Leanne some two months after this marriage to the applicant.

38 Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, the relevant regulations I am considering clearly focus attention at the time of application. The only relevance of Bretag is the extent to which evidence may impact upon that assessment, and particularly evidence of subsequent events. In my view, the Tribunal here undertook its task in looking at all the material before it, both at the time of application and thereafter. No error of the type identified in Bretag has occurred here.</text>

<text>35 This does not mean that evidence subsequent to the visa application does not need to be considered at all. Evidence of events subsequent to the visa application is relevant if it 'tends logically to show the existence or non-existence of facts relevant to the issue to be determined': see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Pochi (1980) 4 ALD 139 at 160 per Deane J. The Tribunal must consider all relevant evidence, which may include evidence of events subsequent to the date of application insofar as it assists in the task of determining whether the appellant and the sponsor were in a marriage relationship at the time of the application. The question of whether particular evidence is relevant and the weight it is to be given is clearly a matter for the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630</tocase>
<text>39 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal made findings of fact unsupported by the evidence. In particular, the appellant claims that the Tribunal did not give proper consideration to the evidence before it and did not make correct findings of fact based on the evidence. However, the Tribunal is not obliged to deal with in its reasons every piece of evidence submitted by the appellant. In WAEE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630, the Full Federal Court discussed a number of decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal and stated at [46]-[47] that:
 
 It is plainly not necessary for the Tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention made by an applicant in its written reasons. It may be that some evidence is irrelevant to the criteria and some contentions misconceived. Moreover, there is a distinction between the Tribunal failing to advert to evidence which, if accepted, might have led it to make a different finding of fact (cf Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [87] - [97] ) and a failure by the Tribunal to address a contention which, if accepted, might establish that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.... Nevertheless, it is an administrative body and not a court and its reasons are not to be scrutinised 'with an eye keenly attuned to error'. Nor is it necessarily required to provide reasons of the kind that might be expected of a court of law. 
 
 The inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons. But that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point. It may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected. Where however there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the Tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.

40 The claim arises specifically in the context of the Tribunal's consideration of the circumstances prescribed by subreg 1.15A(3). However, an analysis of the Tribunal's findings shows that the Tribunal did consider all the material evidence before it and reveals no error law.

41 The appellant sought to impugn the Tribunal's consideration of the evidence about the financial aspects of his relationship with the sponsor. The appellant claimed that the Tribunal solely considered the evidence of the joint bank account and did not take into account the evidence of the joint utilities bills which post-date the time of the visa application. The appellant further claims that, given the appellant and the sponsor were married only 4 days before the date of the visa application, it was not realistic to expect joint financial commitment immediately, or at the time of the application.</text>
