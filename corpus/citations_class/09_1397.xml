<tocase>Shaw v Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2009] FCA 844</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/844.html</AustLII>
<text>His Honour granted the interlocutory relief on 6 August 2009, pending the hearing of the trial, effectively preserving the status quo until this matter could be heard: see Shaw v Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs [2009] FCA 844. Whether the proceedings should continue as representative proceedings

Both proceedings were commenced as representative proceedings pursuant to the provisions of Part IVA of the FCA Act.

The applicant in the Section 47 proceeding is Ms Shaw. The group members were defined in the amended application at paragraph 2 as the persons who have been granted rights of occupancy of houses in the Alice Springs town camps under agreements entered into by them with the Housing Associations, which in turn have been granted Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases in perpetuity over the town camps land.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/164.html</AustLII>
<text>The correct starting point is the NTNER Act itself. Whilst the NTNER Act and, broadly speaking, what it (and other legislative provisions) authorised as part of the Intervention in response to what is described in the long title to the NTNER Act as a "national emergency", is a matter of legislative policy, it does not routinely follow that each and every administrative decision made under the NTNER Act is thereby immune from the obligations of according procedural fairness to those whose rights or interests may be adversely affected by such decisions: see eg South Australia v Slipper [2004] FCAFC 164 ; (2004) 136 FCR 259 at 280 per Finn J, with whom Branson and Finkelstein JJ agreed. The Minister's contention was not as broad or as coarse as that.</text>

<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>The starting point for the exercise of a power such as that contained in s 47, when its exercise is likely to affect the rights and interests of a particular group of persons, is that its exercise is to be conditioned on the observance of the principles of procedural fairness: unless they are excluded by plain words or necessary intendment: see Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 per Mason J at 584; and per Brennan J at 620; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 per McHugh J at 93 [126].

It is apparent that the legislature was aware of the procedures under the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (Cth) requiring notice of a decision proposing to acquire land, and requiring then an opportunity to be heard, to be given to the person whose land is proposed to be acquired. Such procedures have been expressly eschewed. So too, by reference to the written or unwritten law referred to in s 50(1) , have the procedural fairness requirements which were given effect to in cases such as Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 and Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 been considered by the legislature. The wording of the provisions in Subdivisions A, B and C of Division 2, and Division 3 of Part 4 of the NTNER Act indicate that the legislature was aware that s 47 may lead to the compulsory acquisition of the Alice Springs town camps, and was aware by s 48 that necessarily rights, titles and interests of persons such as the residents may thereby be lost. Nevertheless, s 47 requires only notice to the Northern Territory before it takes effect. That cannot have been by oversight. The particular interests of persons such as the residents may be catered for, in the Minister's discretion, by s 48. But, even then, s 49 shows that such preserved rights may be terminated on effectively no notice.</text>

<tocase>Salemi v MacKellar (No 2) [1977] HCA 26 ; (1997) 137 CLR 396</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/26.html</AustLII>
<text>However, it is necessary to consider the construction of the NTNER Act, including s 47, to determine whether the exercise of the power under s 47 is one which is attended by the obligation to accord procedural fairness to Ms Shaw (and the other residents): see Salemi v MacKellar (No 2) [1977] HCA 26 ; (1997) 137 CLR 396 at 400-1 per Barwick CJ; at 419-20 per Gibbs J; and at 451 per Jacobs J.

There are some general features of the NTNER Act which provide the context for the particular issue, as well as the general context in which it came to be enacted. Its object under s 5 is to improve the well-being of certain communities in the Northern Territory. It specifies by s 4 and Schedule 1 the "prescribed areas" to which it applies; they expressly include the Alice Springs town camps: cl 69 of Part 4 of Schedule 1. It is therefore clear that the NTNER Act reflects the legislative view that improving the well-being of the residents of the town camps, including by improving their living conditions, is a significant element of the response to the "national emergency". The events leading to these proceedings, set out above, show that the Minister had the desire to bring the accommodation and other infrastructure and services in the town camps to the level available to all Australians.

Division 2 of Part 4 of the NTNER Act deals specifically with the acquisition of rights, titles and interests relating to the town camps. Subdivisions A and B deal with resumption and forfeiture of leases or land under the SPL Act and the CL Act respectively. In each instance, the Minister is given the powers of the Northern Territory Minister or Administrator in relation to resumption and forfeiture of such leases or land.</text>

<tocase>Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/1999/6.html</AustLII>
<text>As the Minister points out, that process contrasts sharply with the process specified for the compulsory acquisition of land under the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 (Cth). Under that process, persons whose interests are affected are given an opportunity to be heard before the decision to acquire the land is finally made. Indeed, section 50(2) of the NTNER Act provides, inter alia, that ss 47 and 49 have effect despite anything contained in the Lands Acquistion Act 1989 (Cth). Section 50(1) more generally provides, inter alia, that ss 47 and 49 have effect despite any other law of the Commonwealth or of the Northern Territory, whether written or unwritten. The express reference in s 50(1) to "written or unwritten" laws is, in my view, an expression of the intention that the provisions in (relevantly) Division 2 of Part 4 of the NTNER Act, including s 47, are not to be taken to carry within them the rules of procedural fairness in the face of the meaning of, for example, s 47 as construed in its terms and in its statutory content. Whilst s 50 does not, in express terms, exclude the obligation to give procedural fairness when a decision under s 47 is contemplated, in conjunction with the other provisions to which I have referred that is, I think, the necessary intention of the legislature. See also Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 per Spigelman CJ at 91 [50].

In my judgment, s 47 in its terms and in its context demonstrates an intention that the rules of procedural fairness (relevantly here at least reasonable notice of a decision proposed to be made under s 47 and an opportunity to be heard before the decision is made) be excluded.</text>

<text>In Jarratt v Commissioner of Police for New South Wales [2005] HCA 50 ; (2005) 224 CLR 44 , Gleeson CJ at 56 [25] referred to the "very breadth of the statutory power" as an argument in favour of inferring the intention to preserve procedural fairness in the making of the decision then under challenge, under s 51 of the Police Service Act 1990 (NSW). In the case of s 47 of the NTNER Act, however, I think there are clear words indicating a legislative intention necessarily to exclude such processes.</text>

<tocase>Gerhardy v Brown [1985] HCA 11 ; (1985) 159 CLR 70</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/11.html</AustLII>
<text>Ms Shaw also contended that s 47 of the NTNER Act should be read as requiring procedural fairness to be given to the residents, including Ms Shaw, before a decision is made because s 132(1) declares the provisions of the NTNER Act and actions taken under it for the purposes of those provisions as "special measures" for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). As explained in Gerhardy v Brown (1985) 159 CLR 70, s 8(1) of that Act has the consequence that other provisions of that Act (in particular, those that prohibit racial discrimination in various forms) do not apply to "special measures" as described in Art 1 paragraph 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (defined in s 3 of that Act). Relevantly, special measures are ones "taken for the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups ... as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups ... equal enjoyment" of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was argued that Indigenous wishes about their lands and their participation in such decision-making as may occur under s 47 is of great importance, and so s 132 supports the preservation of procedural fairness when such a decision is to be made. I do not think that s 132 supports the contention in that way. It is a legislative confirmation that the NTNER Act, in its terms as properly construed, and acts which it authorises, will not breach the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) because what is authorised by and under the NTNER Act are "special measures". In other words, I consider s 132 is a legislative declaration that the NTNER Act, and the conduct it authorises, has each of the characteristics described by Brennan J in Gerhardy v Brown 159 CLR at 133. In respect of the town camps, that view is also evidenced also from the Second Reading Speech of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 (Hansard, House of Representatives, 7 August 2007, pages 26-7).

Further, and more fundamentally, s 132(2) of the NTNER Act specifically excludes the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). Section 132(2) provides: 
 
 The provisions of this Act, and any acts done under or for the purposes of those provisions, are excluded from the operation of Part II of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). 
 

 
In my view, the combination of s 132(1) and (2) evinces a clear intention on the part of the legislature to ensure that the NTNER Act and acts done in accordance with that Act, do not contravene the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).
 Did the Minister give procedural fairness to the residents in the circumstances?

My conclusion on the first issue means that it is not necessary to determine this issue. However, as the evidence on this aspect of the case was quite extensive, it is appropriate at least to record my findings on what the Minister and her officers did do in relation to Ms Shaw and the residents and to express my views about it.</text>

 It has long been established that the statutory framework within which a decision-maker exercises statutory power is of critical importance when considering what procedural fairness requires. It is also clear that the particular content to be given to the requirement to accord procedural fairness will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

<tocase>Stewart v Goldman &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1947) 64 WN (NSW) 155</tocase>
<text>The Residents also contend that they will be worse off by the proposed subleases. As a matter of law, I do not consider that is so. I have dealt with that issue above. There are a few additional matters which should be noted. On the evidence, the rent payable from time to time under the tenancy agreements with the Housing Associations was increased. There is the prospect that over time, through the Executive Director, the rents might further increase. That can only occur to the extent that the tenancy agreements in force permit. There is a loss of control as members of the Housing Association of the selection, from the members, of who gets a tenancy of new dwellings in the town camp, but the subleases are subject to the head lease, and so only members of the Housing Associations are eligible. There was no dispute that the proposed subleases would be subject to the terms of the head leases, entitled to the benefits and subject to the burdens of their covenants: Stewart v Goldman &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1947) 64 WN (NSW) 155 at 158. There is also a loss of control as members over the income and expenditure of the Housing Associations, and over what action is taken in the event of non-payment of rent or of other breaches of the terms of a tenancy agreement, because those matters become the function and responsibility of the Executive Director, the Northern Territory or Territory Housing, and then through the Housing Authority. Those decisions may only be made after the consultation with the Housing Associations imposed by clause 10.1(c). As a matter of strict interpretation, despite the consultation provided for, the Executive Director or a Housing Authority may adopt a stricter or different view of what is appropriate on those matters than the Housing Associations have done in the past. Thus, whilst I have concluded that the existing tenancy rights and obligations are preserved by the proposed subleases, there is some scope for those rights and obligations to be enforced in a somewhat different way than has occurred in the past. There is some evidence that, in the past, Territory Housing where it has had such a role has adopted a less tolerant attitude to tenants' contraventions of the terms of the tenancy agreements than have the Housing Associations.

The Northern Territory has pointed out that, if the Northern Territory or Territory Housing is the relevant Housing Authority, any new tenancy agreements will comply with the requirements of the Housing Act (NT) and the Housing Regulations (NT). They are not requirements which in any material way differ from the terms of the existing tenancy agreements. It has also pointed out that, where it has performed or is performing that role in other Aboriginal Communities, it has established a Housing Reference Group to assist in the selection of new tenants from amongst the eligible persons and to ensure its awareness of cultural concerns and issues which might affect its management of such housing. Consultation processes for such purposes are built into the proposed subleases. There is no reason to think that, despite the concerns of the Residents, the Northern Territory or Territory Housing (or any entity) appointed as a Housing Authority under one of the proposed subleases would act inappropriately or unreasonably or inconsistently with the shared intention of improving the housing and support facilities in the town camps. I, therefore, do not consider that the concerns of the Residents discussed in the preceding paragraph of these reasons provide a sound reason for upholding the Residents' primary contentions. Execution of the Proposed Subleases by the Housing Associations

A sublease has been executed by each Housing Association that is a party to the Sublease proceeding, but has not been exchanged. The executed subleases are currently held by the Council, pending the outcome of these proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corporation [1986] 1 Ch 246</tocase>
<text>In my view, there are two steps required to address the primary proposition: 
(1) determining what is authorised by the Constitutions or Rule Books of the Housing Associations; and
 
(2) determining whether the proposed conduct of perfecting the grant of the proposed subleases is, in the circumstances, within the scope of that which is authorised or required.
 
Another way of describing those steps might be to ask whether the grant of the proposed subleases is beyond the express or implied power of the Housing Associations under their Constitutions and Rule Books, whatever organ of the Housing Associations might have made the decision to do so, and secondly whether their grant, although within the express or implied power of the Housing Association under their Constitutions and Rule Books, was not within the powers of the Management Committees or the directors to undertake. In Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corporation [1986] 1 Ch 246 , Browne-Wilkinson CJ at 302-5 described the distinction as between ultra vires in the "narrow sense" and ultra vires in the "wider sense". His Lordship at 303 noted that Cotman v Brougham [1918] AC 514 recognised that "the objects of a company and the powers conferred on a company to carry out those objects are two different things" (at 303) and remarked at 304:
 
 
 The critical distinction is, therefore, between acts done in excess of the capacity of the company on the one hand and acts done in excess or abuse of the powers of the company on the other.

 The critical distinction is, therefore, between acts done in excess of the capacity of the company on the one hand and acts done in excess or abuse of the powers of the company on the other. 
 

 
Mason CJ in Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146 at 162-3 referred with apparent approval to that distinction.</text>

<tocase>HA Stephenson &amp; Son Ltd (In Liquidation) v Gillanders Arbuthnot &amp; Co [1931] HCA 47 ; (1931) 45 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1931/47.html</AustLII>
<text>In HA Stephenson &amp; Son Ltd (In Liquidation) v Gillanders Arbuthnot &amp; Co [1931] HCA 47 ; (1931) 45 CLR 476 Dixon J at 487 said that the question of corporate capacity 
 
 must be ascertained according to the true meaning of the memorandum interpreted by a fair reading of the whole instrument.

In my judgment, a fair reading of the current Constitutions of those Housing Associations does not reveal such a focused and restricted objective or principal objective as the Residents contend for.

Although the name is "town camp specific", the objectives now contemplate each of those Housing Associations serving their objectives beyond that town camp. The definition of "Town Camp" extends to any land owned or leased by an association, and includes the particular town camp. Item 1.3(b) includes serving the objectives in Item 1.3(a) and generally by "obtaining land" for its members. There is no provision now which specifies the only, or primary, objective to operate the particular town camp. Item 1.2, under the heading "Town Camp governed by the Association (clause 1.1)" has the name of the Housing Association itself I take it to be designating the town camp itself but clause 1.1 is a reference to the definitions in the Constitution , and the only relevant definition is that of "Town Camp". Separately, clause 2.2 has the heading "Objects and Purposes" and refers to Item 1.3. The heading to Item 1.2 in that light cannot be the defining purpose or object of those Housing Associations. There is now no expression of the object or the principal object of the Housing Associations being to control the provision and maintenance of housing and other facilities on the land held under their head leases. The objects are more expansive.</text>

<tocase>In Re K.L. Tractors Ltd [1961] HCA 8 ; (1961) 106 CLR 318</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1961/8.html</AustLII>
<text>That rule continued to apply to other incorporated associations. At least in respect of partially executed contracts, the absence of power may not have precluded their enforcement: In Re K.L. Tractors Ltd [1961] HCA 8 ; (1961) 106 CLR 318. That is not this case. There may also be circumstances where, notwithstanding that the corporation has acted ultra vires, relief may be available: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (Butterworths Looseleaf Service) at [12,060]. However, the rule was in any event ameliorated by provisions similar to that in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in most, if not all, of the States' Associations Incorporation Acts: see s 17 Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Vic); s 26 Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Qld); s 27 Associations Incorporation Act 1985 (SA). There was no such provision in the Associations Incorporation Ordinance 1963 (NT) or in the Associations Incorporation Act 1978 (NT). Those enactments were repealed and replaced by the Associations Act (NT), enacted in 2003. There is also no such provision in the Associations Act (NT). Part 6 of the Associations Act (NT) deals with the transfer of property of an incorporated non-trading association. Each of the Housing Associations is not permitted to trade: Item 1.5 of the Schedule to their Constitutions. Section 54 Associations Act (NT) permits the transfer of real property by one association only to another body formed for promoting objects similar to its own or charitable objects, or to a council for the area in which the property is situated. That section also imposes procedural requirements. It is not necessary to refer to them. It is not suggested the grant of the proposed subleases is authorised by s 54 independently of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations. Nor, on the other hand, is it suggested that the grant of the proposed subleases is unlawful so as to prevent the Housing Associations from agreeing to enter into them. Section 54 is expressly subject to s 110. Section 110(2) restricts a Housing Association from disposing of, or charging, prescribed property, which appears to include a lease under the SPL Act or the CL Act (see the definition of prescribed property in s 4), except with the consent of the Minister administering that Act (and, by the NTNER Act, that would include the Minister) without the Minister's consent. It is also not necessary to further discuss those provisions as they were not relied upon, or referred to, either by the Residents or by any of the respondents, as informing the proper construction of the Constitutions of the Housing Associations either to grant or not to grant the proposed subleases. There is no doubt good reason for that.

The CATSI Act does have a provision similar to that in s 125 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Section 96.1 relevantly provides: 
 
 (1) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation has the legal capacity and powers of an individual within and outside Australia. 
 

 
 
 (2) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation also has all the powers of a body corporate, including the power to, if the corporation's constitution permits, distribute any of the corporation's property among the members, in kind or otherwise. 
 

 
 
 (3) An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation's legal capacity to do something is not affected by the fact that the corporation's interests are not, or would not be, served by doing it.</text>

<tocase>ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd (receiver and managers appointed) (1990) 8 ACLC 980</tocase>
<text>The Minister did not rely upon s 96.1 of the CATSI Act as providing the foundation for the Housing Associations incorporated under it to be enabled to enter into the proposed subleases. That may be simply because there are only three of them, and the condition precedent to the activation of each proposed sublease in clause 2.1(a)(i) referred to above would not be satisfied. It may also be because, notwithstanding its apparent effect, there is some authority to suggest its role is confined to validating corporate dealings with outsiders despite deficiencies in corporate capacity, but not to abrogating restrictions on the exercise of shareholders' or directors' powers: see eg per McPherson J (with whom Lee and McKenzie JJ agreed) in ANZ Executors &amp; Trustee Co Ltd v Qintex Australia Ltd (receiver and managers appointed) (1990) 8 ACLC 980 at 988. There may be other reasons. It may be that such a provision does not inhibit a member of such an association from asserting that the common understanding of the members and their general intention was for the association to control the use and development of those town camps, and seeking to enforce that position. That sort of contention has been used to support the winding up of a corporation or the just and equitable ground: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law (13 th ed, 2007, Butterworths) at [12.130] p 744 and the cases there cited. As the issue was not raised, it is not necessary to go beyond those comments.

Consequently, it is necessary to consider the second of the questions I have identified above. That is, it is necessary to determine whether the particular terms of the proposed subleases mean that the agreement to enter into them is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole.

The Residents as members put their contention quite brutally: for $1, the Housing Associations have given up all rights, functions and representative activities in relation to their town camps so they cannot discharge their responsibilities to their members under Item 1.3 of their Constitutions and under their Rule Books. There is "an equation of $1 for no rights for at least 40 years".</text>

<tocase>Gambotto v WCP Limited [1995] HCA 12 ; (1995) 182 CLR 432</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/12.html</AustLII>
<text>Reference was made to Gambotto v WCP Limited [1995] HCA 12 ; (1995) 182 CLR 432 ( Gambotto ) as supporting the proposition that a company can act bona fide and fairly, and for the benefit of the company as a whole, but cannot do so if that overrides the rights of existing shareholders. I do not think that decision takes the Residents' position that far. In that case, a small minority shareholder challenged the validity of a proposed meeting to consider amending the company's constitution to enable a member entitled to 90% of the issued shares to compulsorily acquire the balance. The Court therefore had to address the limits of the power to alter the constitution of the company to enable the appropriation of the shares of a minority. Clearly, it is a very different type of case. The proposed resolution was not shown to be for a proper purpose, nor was it shown to be one which did not operate oppressively in relation to minority shareholders: see per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ at 445 and 448. Their Honours pointed out also at 445 that the position may have been different if the right to expropriation had already existed in the company's constitution.

Senior counsel for the Residents made the submission that the "interests of the members as a whole" was somehow different from the interests of the Housing Associations themselves. In cross-examination of a solicitor from Gilbert + Tobin (the solicitors for the Council) he elicited that their advice to the Council, and to a working group including certain Housing Association representatives, did not separately address the interests of the members of the Housing Associations as distinct from those of the Housing Associations themselves.

The significance of the distinction, if legally there is one, was not made clear. It is argued that the Housing Associations could not alienate their interests in the town camps under the respective Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases either absolutely or for 40 years. That was said to flow from the proper construction and understanding of the objects and purposes of the Housing Associations. I have already addressed that contention. No reason was put why those objects and purposes should impose restrictions on the powers of the Housing Associations which preclude their capacity to agree to the proposed subleases as Housing Associations, and different restrictions on their powers because of the interests of their members as a whole. The plurality judgment in Gambotto 182 CLR pointed out at 444 that the observations of Lindley MR in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671 that the power of the majority to alter the articles of association of a company must be exercised in a lawful manner and "bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole" was inappropriate where the proposed resolution involved a conflict of interests and advantages. The plurality judgment said at 444: 
 
 It seems to us that, in such a case not involving an actual or effective expropriation of shares or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to shares, an alteration of the articles by special resolution regularly passed will be valid unless it is ultra vires, beyond any purpose contemplated by the articles or oppressive as that expression is understood in the law relating to corporations.

Consistent with the expression in Gambotto , in Peters' American Delicacy Co Ltd v Heath [1939] HCA 2 ; (1939) 61 CLR 457 , Dixon J when upholding the validity of an alteration of the articles which discriminated against holders of partly-paid shares in favour of the majority shareholders said at 513 that the resolution 
 
 involved no oppression, no appropriation of an unjust or reprehensible nature and did not imply any purpose outside the scope of the power.

Those propositions require some comment. There is, in my view, some mixing of concepts in them. In the first place, as the High Court pointed out in Gambotto 182 CLR, these particular considerations arise where the proposed conduct of the entity expropriates or is intended to facilitate the expropriation of the interests of particular members at the expense of others. That is not this case. The rights of the members of the Housing Associations inter se are unchanged. Secondly, the measure in fact of what is in the interests of the entity itself and its members as a whole will necessarily depend upon the constitution of the entity: a company formed "for profit" is likely to have a constitution which permits conduct which may not be permitted in the case of a not-for-profit association; in fact, each of the Constitutions and Rule Books of the Housing Associations prohibits them from trading for profit. But it does not follow that, somehow, the measure of what is "oppressive or unfair ... is necessarily" applied more rigorously in the case of not-for-profit associations. The measure will still be the objects and purposes of the association. Thirdly, the second proposition set out in the preceding paragraph is really axiomatic. If a particular course of action is not authorised by the constitution, it may not be undertaken.

On the second issue, it is necessary therefore that the Residents show that the agreement to enter into the proposed subleases is contrary to the interests of the members as a whole, or effectively to the interests of the Housing Associations. Inevitably, on such issues, there are matters of judgment. Different members will make different commercial judgments about what is, or is not, in the interests of the Housing Associations.

The Residents' submission is that their rights as members of the Housing Associations to have the Housing Associations "separately conduct its activities at the town camps for the benefit of its existing members" have been sold for 40 years for $1, without any other return provided as of right for the benefit of the members. I do not accept that contention. It mis-describes their entitlements under the proposed subleases. The general effect of the proposed subleases is set out above. If there is power under the Constitutions or Rule Books of the Housing Associations to enter into arrangements such as the proposed subleases, the aspirational objectives of the Housing Associations may be fulfilled or served by the Housing Associations arranging for another entity, such as the Executive Director, to engage in or conduct activities at the town camps to fulfil or serve those objectives for the benefit of the members.</text>

<tocase>Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Limited (2009) 69 ACSR 365</tocase>
<text>Szencorp Pty Ltd v Clean Energy Council Limited (2009) 69 ACSR 365 , was also an "oppression" case brought in reliance upon the current statutory equivalent, s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), in relation to the conduct of the affairs of an unlisted not-for-profit public company limited by guarantee. It was an entity formed to effect a merger of two existing sustainable energy industry associations. Goldberg J at [59] remarked in the course of his reasons: 
 
 The "contrary to the interests" provision now contained in subpar (d) of s 232 has a separate and distinct area of operation from the "oppression" provisions in subpar (e) of s 232. The manner in which a company is being administered and in which its affairs are conducted may fall within the category of conduct contrary to the interests of the company's members as a whole although it may not be described as oppressive, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against members of the company: Turnbull v National Roads &amp; Motorists' Association Limited [2004] NSWSC 577 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 44 at 52, 57; Campbell v BackOffice Investments Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 95 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 359 at 400. (See also Re Spargos Mining NL (1990) 3 ACSR 1 at 42; Shelton v NRMA Limited (2005) 51 ACSR 278.) An example of such conduct may be found where a company is formed for the purpose of undertaking particular activities but the directors and management disregard those activities and direct the company into different commercial areas.

The Residents correctly point out that, as his Honour said, the assessment of what is in the interests of the members as a whole of the Housing Associations must be assessed by reference to their objects and purposes. That is uncontentious, so long as their interests as a whole are in broad terms synonymous with the interests of the Housing Associations. Goldberg J did not suggest to the contrary. My analysis of their Constitutions and Rule Books is intended to reflect that approach.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/37.html</AustLII>
<text>Having taken that step, that the proper approach is to determine whether those persons acting on behalf of the Housing Associations are acting for proper purposes and could reasonably have engaged in that conduct. Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ said in Harlowe's Nominees Pty Ltd v Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co N.L. [1968] HCA 37 ; (1968) 121 CLR 483 at 493: 
 
 
 Directors in whom are vested the right and the duty of deciding where the company's interests lie and how they are to be served may be concerned with a wide range of practical considerations, and their judgment, if exercised in good faith and not for irrelevant purposes, is not open to review in the courts.

Whether the obligation of the Housing Associations and of those persons on their behalf is founded in the contractual relationship between the Housing Association and its members; or in the fiduciary obligation of the Management Committee of the Housing Associations to the members, or upon the Constitutions and Rule Books of the Housing Associations, in my view the appropriate question is for present purposes the same.

I have referred above to the finding that each Housing Association, although having no legally enforceable right to any particular part of the $100 million, could reasonably expect and assume that a significant proportion of that sum would be spent on housing and facilities at its town camp. They were aware of the fundamental importance of the town camps land to their respective members. They had negotiated with the Minister for over 12 months. They could reasonably conclude that no "better deal" could be reached. They could reasonably conclude that, if they did not agree to the proposed subleases, the town camps would be compulsorily acquired. They understood the very strong desire of their members to avoid alienation of their land (the land held under the Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases), and so were making the decision which would ultimately preserve their lands rather than have them compulsorily acquired. They had secured some consultation rights, both directly and through the Forum. They were aware that the $100 million was a package for all the Housing Associations, and its allocation would follow consultation through the Forum. They were aware that the $100 million was required to be expended over a period of five years, and so would provide promptly benefits to existing members, as well as to future generations. They had consulted widely with their members. They had the support of the Council in their decision. They were aware that, under the terms of the proposed subleases, they could be given a significant and direct ongoing role (as recognised in Recitals I and J of the proposed subleases, and in respect of community land, vacant land and after three years potentially as a Housing Authority). As senior counsel for the Housing Associations argued, the Housing Associations were aware that there was no other realistic opportunity available to secure the potential benefits to the town camps which the expenditure of $100 million would bring; they knew of the past "years of inadequate funding leading to substantial housing and conditions for the members and tenants"; and they believed that that funding to the Housing Associations through clause 6(a) of the proposed subleases would directly serve their primary function of relieving the poverty, sickness and suffering and helplessness of Aboriginal people in Central Australia, including their members. Finally, they were aware that the proposed subleases would not preclude them from continuing to engage in activities directed to the six "means" set out in Item 1.3(b) of the respective Constitutions and Rule Books, save to the extent that certain of those activities would be subject to the role and obligations and activities of the Executive Director under the proposed subleases, and they were also aware of the ongoing important role of the Council.</text>
