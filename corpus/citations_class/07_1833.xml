<text>37 An administrative decision maker does not make an error of law by making a wrong finding of fact: Waterford v The Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77; Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] . Insofar as the Tribunal concluded that there was no genuine spousal relationship, that was a conclusion of fact which is not subject to review by the Federal Magistrates Court or by this Court on appeal.</text>

<tocase>The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>36 It was contended by the first respondent's counsel that the Tribunal's conclusions are factual and not subject to review by either this Court or the Federal Magistrates Court: The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259. That submission must be accepted. There can be no doubt that the Federal Magistrates Court and this Court has no jurisdiction to enter into the merits of administrative decision making. The merits of administrative decision making are for those who have the relevant power to make the decisions.</text>
