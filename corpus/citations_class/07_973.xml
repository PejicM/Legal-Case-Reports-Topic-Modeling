<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 276</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/2006/276.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Contrary to the submission of Counsel for Mr Pritchard, neither the express words of the Corporations Act nor the relevant extrinsic materials (see in particular paras 6.2 and 6.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum extracted at [40] above) support the contention that the provisions are " contemplated to follow criminal prosecution rather than to precede it (with all the risks to the defendant that might entail) except where the subsequent prosecution is affected by the evidentiary restrictions imposed by s 1317Q" . To take just one example, s 1317P is directly contrary to that submission. Moreover, the decision of Fryberg J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings Pty Ltd [2006] QSC 276 does not support that submission. It was not concerned with s 1317E of the Corporations Act or a civil penalty provision but the more difficult question of the power of a court to make a declaration as to whether conduct by a corporation or its officer contravened the Corporations Act when where there is a likelihood or prospect of criminal proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373</tocase>
<text>22 The statutory duties imposed by ss 180 , 181 and 182 of the Corporations Act reflect and, to some extent, refine the obligations of the directors at general law: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (2006) 59 ACSR 373 at [99]. Each is a duty owed by a director to the corporation. However, directors' duties provisions are not concerned with any general obligation owed by directors to conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with the law generally or the Corporations Act . Moreover, the directors' duties provisions do not necessarily make a director liable for a breach by the company of another provision in the Corporations Act . The corollary is that it cannot be said that every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions.

23 That last proposition or principle (that not every breach by a company of the Corporations Act necessarily gives rise to a breach of the directors' duties provisions) is self evident. It is reinforced by the fact that, under s 180(1) of the Corporations Act , the circumstances of the particular company are relevant to the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence. The circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the type of company, the size and nature of the company's business, the director's position and responsibilities within the company, the particular functions the director is performing, the manner in which responsibility for the business of the company is distributed and, of course, the circumstances of the case: Maxwell at [100] and the authorities referred to.

24 The need to consider the circumstances of a particular company in defining the content of the duty of a director to exercise reasonable care and diligence is demonstrated in the case of Mr Pritchard. The circumstances of Warrenmang are outlined in paras [5] to [15] above. There was an " identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders, so that in effect the directors [were] the shareholders ": Maxwell [103]. Ordinarily that fact may make the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing much less acute: Maxwell at [103]. In the case of Warrenmang, the identity of interest between the directors and the shareholders in fact meant the requirement to prevent self-interested dealing was acute because of the following circumstances.
 
 (1) Warrenmang was registered as an unlisted public company on 1 September 2003 with Mr Pritchard holding approximately 20 million of the 20.82 issued shares;
 (2) although at the time of its incorporation, three directors were appointed, Mr Pritchard was at all times the person in charge of Warrenmang's day to day activities including maintenance of its financial records and was its controlling mind;
 (3) on 5 December 2003 and again 10 March 2004, Warrenmang sought to raise funds from the public through the sale shares in Warrenmang and in response to the IPO and the Supplementary Prospectus did in fact raise substantial funds from hundreds of subscribers; and
 (4) the subscription monies were received by Warrenmang and deposited into the Warrenmang Accounts to which Mr Pritchard was the sole signatory.</text>

<text>42 If there is prejudice to any person by ASIC taking the step of first pursuing and securing a declaration of contravention (without seeking a pecuniary penalty order) under s 1317E of the Corporations Act prior to criminal proceedings being started against that person for conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct that constituted the contravention of the civil penalty provision, ASIC takes that step assessing the risk that it may impede any subsequent criminal proceedings whether by application of the principles under the heading of abuse of process or related doctrines (see for example, Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 ; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [29] and [30] (per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) citing Maxwell v The Queen [1995] HCA 62 ; (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 512 and Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42 ; (1994) 181 CLR 251 in relation to stay of criminal proceedings for abuse of process and Williams v Spautz [1992] HCA 34 ; (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 518-520) or otherwise.

<tocase>Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672</tocase>
<text>32 ASIC may apply for such a declaration: s 1317J. Section 1317E(2) prescribes what a declaration under s 1317E(1) must specify, namely:
 
 "(a) the Court that made the declaration; 
 
 (b) the civil penalty provision that was contravened; 
 
 (c) the person who contravened the provision; 
 
 (d) the conduct that constituted the contravention; 
 
 
 
 (e) if the contravention is of a corporation / scheme civil penalty provision the corporation or registered scheme to which the conduct related." 
 
 

 Section 1317F provides that a declaration of contravention is conclusive evidence of the matters referred to in s 1317E(2): Re One.Tel Ltd (in liq); Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2003) 21 ACLC 672. As a result, the court must specify the conduct that constituted the contravention with sufficient particularity to enable the declaration of contravention not only to stand on its own but to meet the statutory requirements and purpose of s 1317E.

33 Other sections provide for the making of pecuniary penalty orders (s 1317G) and provide that the Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters (s 1317L).

34 The intersection between the civil and criminal process is addressed in ss 1317M , 1317N and 1317P . The intersection is not easy. In the present case, it is further complicated by the timing of ASIC's application for declaration of contravention. Section 1317M deals with civil proceedings after criminal proceedings and provides that:
 
 
 "A court must not make a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention ." 
 
 (Emphasis Added)

35 Section 1317N deals with criminal proceedings during civil proceedings and provides:
 
 
 
 "(1) Proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order against a person are stayed if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and 
 
 (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The proceedings for the declaration or order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the declaration or order are dismissed." 
 
 
 

This provision is significant. It provides that proceedings for a declaration of contravention or pecuniary penalty order are stayed if criminal proceedings are on foot at the same time in relation to conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. In this provision, no distinction is drawn between proceedings for a declaration of contravention and proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order.

36 Section 1317P then deals with criminal proceedings after civil proceedings. It provides:
 
 
 
 "(1) Subject to subsection (2), criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a declaration of contravention has been made against the person; or 
 
 (b) a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person; or 
 
 (c) a compensation order has been made against the person; or 
 
 (d) the person has been disqualified from managing a corporation under Part 2D.6 ; or 
 
 (e) an order has been made against the person by ASIC under section 920A (banning orders) or by the Court under section 921A (disqualification by Court)."</text>
