<text>33 In Banque Commerciale SA En Liquidation v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 293, Dawson J observed that pleadings are but a means to an end, not an end in themselves. His Honour referred to an early authority of the High Court in which it was said that the function of pleadings is to state with sufficient clarity the case which the other party to the proceeding is required to meet: Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd (in liq) [1916] HCA 81 ; (1916) 22 CLR 490 at 517.</text>

<tocase>Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) ATPR 41-906</tocase>
<text>42 As Merkel J said in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) ATPR 41-906 at [24], the level of generality permitted in a representative pleading should not be so great that the respondents cannot reasonably be expected to know, with any precision, the case they have to meet. This decision was reversed on appeal on other grounds, but that does not affect Merkel J's statement of the principle.</text>

<tocase>Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd (2006) 58 ACSR 435 </tocase>
<text>34 This principle is no less applicable today. It was reiterated by Young J in Cadence Asset Management Pty Ltd v Concept Sports Ltd (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at [34] [35].

35 Young J observed in Cadence at [35] that the authorities establish that any want of clarity in the pleading can be cured by amendment or by particulars, although he also said that particulars cannot be used to fill gaps in material facts, which must be alleged. His Honour went on to say at [37] that consistent with the rules of pleading, a case can be pleaded at different levels of generality:
 
 But, whatever level of generality is adopted in the statement of claim, it must adhere to the basic principle that the purpose of pleadings is to define the issues and thereby inform the parties in advance of the case they have to meet and so enable them to take steps to deal with it ... On the other hand, a pleading will infringe the applicable practice rules if it contains nothing more than broad conclusions asserted at such a high level of generality that the opposite party cannot understand the case it has to meet.

39 In Cadence at [40] Young J referred to earlier authority of the Court which emphasises that the case management and individual docket system is such that it is well placed to ensure no embarrassment or prejudice about pleadings. Usually this can be addressed by requiring particulars to be supplied or by other means short of striking out the pleading: see Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [1999] FCA 569 at [8] [9] (per Merkel J).

43 The effect of what Young J said in Cadence at [40] is that a strike-out motion is a blunt instrument, to be used only in the event that the Court's case management procedures cannot be adapted to enable the matter to go forward.

44 However, it seems to me that this is a case where the defect in the pleading is so fundamental that it cannot be allowed to stand in this form.</text>

<tocase>Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/180.html</AustLII>
<text>45 The difficulty which arises is that [13] of the Statement of Claim is central to the allegation that statements made in the prospectus, and in the August 2004 and October 2004 announcements, were rendered false by reason of events which occurred later. But as a Full Court observed in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88, the non-fulfilment of a prediction when the time for performance arrives does not of itself establish that the prediction was false when made or that its maker did not have an adequate foundation for its content (per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ).

46 What is required in the present case is a statement of the material facts in terms sufficiently clear to enable the respondents to understand precisely what the facts are that are relied upon to establish the falsity of the alleged representations or the absence of reasonable grounds.

47 The Statement of Claim does not meet this test because the eight adverse profitability circumstances are stated at a level of generality which does not enable the respondents to know what is alleged. In particular, they are not linked to any comparison with the contents, express or implied, of the prospectus or the August 2004 or October 2004 announcements and they are unlimited in point of time.

48 I accept that the actual dates when relevant matters became known are within the knowledge of the directors of Village Life. But it is for Hanne to plead whether by inference from other facts, or otherwise, matters which disclose an arguable case that the directors were, or ought to have been, aware of particular circumstances which affected the accuracy of the earlier predictions.

49 It may well be that Hanne can do so. It is notable that Village Life does not seek to strike out the claim on the ground that the Statement of Claim is hopeless or does not disclose a cause of action. The proximity of the downgrades in February 2005 and May 2005 to the announcements made in late 2004 is pertinent. So too is Mr Gageler's submission that the matters alleged in general terms in [13] of the Statement of Claim did not happen overnight. What occurred was apparently revealed by events over a period of time.</text>

<tocase>P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd (2007) 64 ACSR 53</tocase>
<text>52 Sometimes a Notice to Produce may be an appropriate method of case management: see eg P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Ltd (2007) 64 ACSR 53 at [30] per Heerey J. But that would usually be where the notice, or a subpoena, would be expected to produce documents that have at least potential relevance to the issues in the case: see P Dawson at [31].

53 Here, the difficulty which arises is that the issues are not defined because the pleading is too general to enable that to occur. It is the pleadings which inform the question of the content of a valid Notice to Produce. It is not for Hanne to issue a Notice to Produce to find out what case it might be able to plead. That is not to say that in due course a Notice to Produce may still be impermissible. It will be a question of whether Hanne can plead a case appropriate to what is admittedly an early stage of the proceedings.

54 Moreover, [31] of the Statement of Claim is also defective because it obscures a fact which is fundamental to the claim of reliance. Did Hanne read the prospectus or the August 2004 or October 2004 announcements? If it did, this should be pleaded. If it did not, the pleading should reflect this because there may be serious consequences for the constitution of the proceeding and the composition of the represented group.</text>

<tocase>Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v Nixon [2000] FCA 229 ; (2000) 170 ALR 487 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/229.html</AustLII>
<text>40 In the Full Court decision of Philip Morris (Australia) Ltd v Nixon [2000] FCA 229 ; (2000) 170 ALR 487 at [129] [136], Sackville J set out the principles applicable to pleadings in representative actions under Part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act . His Honour observed that unless the rules of pleading permit a degree of flexibility, serious inroads would be made into the utility of the representative procedure.

41 However, it is clear from what Sackville J said that the level of generality which may be permitted in pleadings in representative actions is concerned with the pleading of facts material to the claims of each member of the represented group: see Philip Morris at [134], [136], cf. Bray v Hoffman La Roche [2003] FCAFC 153 ; (2003) 200 ALR 607 at [122] per Carr J, at [199] per Branson J (dissenting), and at [248] per Finkelstein J.</text>
