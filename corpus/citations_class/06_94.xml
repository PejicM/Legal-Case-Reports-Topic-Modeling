It requires that on the face of the statement of claim there is a claim for relief sought and that the court has jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 1Cellnet LLC [2005] FCA 856 per Nicholson J at [14] and Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Limited [2005] FCA 433 ; cf Wu v Avin Operations Pty Limited (ACN 076 956 913) [2006] FCA 36 at [49] , [57] [58].</text>
