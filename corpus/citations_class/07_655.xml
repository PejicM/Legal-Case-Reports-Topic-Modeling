<tocase>FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/27.html</AustLII>
<text>15 In another High Court decision, that of FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360 at 371, Mason and Wilson JJ stated that s 175 cannot "create a valid assessment where no assessment has been made at all. The section requires an actual assessment as a condition of its operation".

16 Section 175 is often used in conjunction with s 177. Section 177(1) of the ITA Act provides:
 
 The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, shall be conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.

33 It is beyond question that there is no valid notice of assessment until service of the notice has been effected: Bloemen [1981] HCA 27 ; 147 CLR 360. The requirement of service has implications in this case for the validity of the Garnishee Notices, because the effectiveness of the Garnishee Notices depends upon there being a debt due to the Commonwealth, which in turn depends upon service of the notice of assessment being effected prior to the service of the Garnishee Notices. If the notice of assessment was not effectively served on 25 August 2006, then the Garnishee Notices are invalid.

34 According to the evidence of Mr Zafiriou, whom I accept as being a truthful witness, on 25 August 2006, an officer of the respondent, Mr Fisher, placed the notice of assessment in post office box 311 at Dallas Post Office in Victoria, the post office box of the applicant. On the same day, Mr Zafiriou gave the Garnishee Notices to Mr Silvestri and Jason Real Estate Pty Ltd. The evidence is unsatisfactory as to the exact sequence of these events on the 25 August 2006, but because of the view I take, it is unnecessary to consider the evidence in this regard any further.

35 The starting point is s 174 of the ITA Act, which provides that as soon as conveniently may be after any assessment is made, the Commissioner must serve notice thereof in writing by post or otherwise upon the taxpayer: s 174(1). The respondent submitted that the service of the notice was effected on 25 August 2006, and relied upon two submissions.</text>

<tocase>Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] ATC 4,247</tocase>
<text>21 It is also important to remember that the fact that an assessment may be incorrect or based upon insufficient facts does not demonstrate a lack of bona fides. In the decision of Briglia v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] ATC 4,247 the court held that two assessments which included the same amount in the assessable income of two different taxpayers for the same year were valid. At [9], Kenny J held that an incorrect assessment was not sufficient to evidence a lack of bona fides:
 
 Plainly enough, an incorrect assessment does not demonstrate an absence of bona fides on the Deputy Commissioner's part. The decision in Richard Walter also makes it clear that the existence of two assessments, which include the same amount in respect of the same year of income but issued to different taxpayers, does not demonstrate a want of bona fides on the Commissioner's part, providing that at the time the Commissioner made the assessments he was bona fide able to form the view that each assessment could be correct: see Richard Walter at 188, 200, 202 and Darrell Lea at 186. It follows from this that uncertainty on the Deputy Commissioner's part as to the facts relevant to the exercise of his power of assessment does not evidence any absence of bona fides in the Hickman sense. As Brennan J said in Richard Walter at 200-201: 
 
 
 
 It must be remembered that the Commissioner's function is administrative, not judicial. The power to assess is, as s 167 shows, not limited to cases where the Commissioner has enough information on which to make a positive finding of fact. The Commissioner is not required to determine on the balance of probabilities that one person rather than another is the person subject to the tax liability in respect of the particular income.

22 The principles of law are well established and not in dispute as between the parties. Except in very limited circumstances, the taxpayer's rights to dispute liability to taxation are provided for by the objection, review and appeal procedures in Pt IVC of the TAA and are to be pursued by those procedures rather than by proceedings such as this one. However, if it appears, either on the face of a notice of assessment or from elsewhere, that the Commissioner has acted for an improper purpose, has not attempted in good faith to determine the taxable income or has not made an assessment definitive of the tax liability of the taxpayer, the assessment will not attract the protection of s 175.

23 The applicant relied upon a number of factors in support of her contentions, which can be summarised as follows:
 
 &#8226; The assessment was tentative or provisional;
 &#8226; The respondent did not make any real or genuine attempt to assess the applicant's taxable income, nor embarked upon any process of inquiry to determine the applicant's income; and
 &#8226; The assessment was issued solely for the purpose of issuing the Garnishee Notices.</text>

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/23.html</AustLII>
<text>14 Section 175 preserves the validity of an assessment even though there has been some non-compliance with another provision in the ITA Act. However, in the High Court decision of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 at 182 Mason CJ stated of s 175 (footnotes omitted):
 
 This section does not relieve the Commissioner from performing his duty to make an assessment. The section does not create a valid assessment where none has been made at all. The section requires an actual assessment as a condition of its operation. But otherwise, the effect of s 175 is that compliance with particular provisions of the Act is not essential to the validity of an assessment.

17 Subject to the application of the principle in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 ('the Hickman principle'), ss 175 and 177(1) operate to preclude a taxpayer from challenging an assessment except in objection, review and appeal proceedings brought pursuant to Part IVC of the TAA: Richard Walter 183 CLR at 186 per Mason CJ, at 197-199 per Brennan J, at 211 per Deane and Gaudron JJ, at 222-223 per Toohey J; and at 233 per Dawson J.

19 In Richard Walter 183 CLR at 199, Brennan J stated that the Hickman principle should be applied in the construction of s 175 (footnotes omitted):
 
 The jurisdiction of the Federal Court on appeal from, or of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review of, a decision on an objection extends to every issue which affects the amounts ultimately included in the taxable income or tax liability of a taxpayer. If any of these issues be resolved in favour of the taxpayer, an amendment of the assessment so as to reduce the taxable income or the tax liability of the taxpayer must follow. The width of that jurisdiction and the evidence purpose of the Act to channel all issues as to the true tax liability of the taxpayer into the objection, review and appeal procedures found the clearest implication that exceptions to the broadest literal application of s 175 must be narrowly confined and a corresponding operation must be attributed to s 177(1). 
 
 As the scheme of the Act is to protect the validity of notices of assessment while allowing a taxpayer a full opportunity to have the general provisions of the Act affecting tax liability applied, I would construe the term "due making of the assessment" in s 177(1) as extending to every purported exercise of the power to ascertain the taxable income and tax liability of a taxpayer which satisfies the criteria expressed by the Hickman principle.

30 With regard to the applicant's submissions that the assessment was raised for an improper purpose or lacked bona fides and there was no genuine or rational attempt to properly assess and make proper inquiries, I find no proper factual basis upon which this claim can succeed. I also cannot be satisfied that the assessment was tentative or provisional. The notice of assessment clearly sets out the applicant's taxable income, and a fixed sum that is due and payable. There is no indication that the tax liability stated is tentative or provisional: see Richard Walter at 237 per McHugh J.</text>

<tocase>Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Naidoo [1981] 81 ATC 4,537</tocase>
<text>51 It is well to remember the comments of Everett J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Naidoo [1981] 81 ATC 4,537 at 4,543 to 4,544:
 
 I am in no doubt that the action of the officer of the Australian Taxation Office in taking the more direct and expeditious course of visiting the offices of the defendant's tax agents and personally delivering the notices of assessment to a partner of the firm was properly motivated, but I feel bound to hold that it did not comply with relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations. It is obviously an advantage to the Australian Taxation Office in some cases to be able to serve notices and other communications by following the method prescribed by either para (b) or para (c) of reg 59, but I consider that, if it does so, it is bound to adhere strictly to the letter of the regulation. Any departure from a plain and natural interpretation of the words of reg 59 could bring doubt and uncertainty into an area which is clear and definite. Regulation 59 is a protection for the Deputy Commissioner against taxpayers who may seek to evade their tax obligations by avoiding service of documents. The Taxation Office merely has to follow an appropriate option given by reg 59 to be able to pursue its administrative duties. It will only encounter legal difficulties if it disregards strict compliance with reg 59, even though the departure may appear completely technical and really of no significance.

52 His Honour went on to explain that the significance of service in the context of the creation of a tax liability against a person means the requirements of service must be regarded as matters strictissimi juris . In deciding that service was not effected in that case, his Honour held at 4,544:
 
 Despite the natural belief of the Deputy Commissioner in this case that the circumstances warranted the most expeditious and certain means in his judgement of bringing the obligation of the defendant to his personal notice, it remained necessary to comply with the provisions of the Act and the Regulations.

53 The Regulations operate, to the benefit of the respondent, to provide for deemed service in situations where the taxpayer may otherwise avoid being personally served. Strict compliance with the requirements of service is necessary, absent which evidence must be adduced to prove actual service, and here that actual service on the applicant occurred on 25 August 2006 prior to the service of the Garnishee Notices.

54 It is to be noted that the operation of reg 40 does not affect the operation of other laws of the Commonwealth, states or territories that deal with the service of documents: see reg 40(3). However, given that the notice of assessment was not served by post or left at the address of the place of residence or business, neither the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) or the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) assist the respondent. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the notice of assessment was served on 25 August 2006, so there was no debt due and payable to the Commonwealth on that date, and the Garnishee Notices were invalid.

55 Given my finding that the Garnishee Notices were invalid, the question then arises as to what to do with the money paid into Court pursuant to the interlocutory orders made on 20 September 2006. It is clear that the notice of assessment has now been served on the applicant, and the debt is due and payable. The respondent submitted that in the meantime the tax must be paid.

56 I will allow the parties time to consider their position in relation to the money in Court. Accordingly I will hear submissions as to what orders should be made in light of these reasons.
 

 I certify that the preceding fifty-six (56) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.

<tocase>Emhill Pty Ltd v Bonsoc Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 239 ; (2005) 12 VR 129</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2005/239.html</AustLII>
<text>48 The respondent submitted that it had done more than what was required by the relevant legislation and accordingly service was good. In support of this proposition, the respondent relied upon the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Emhill Pty Ltd v Bonsoc Pty Ltd [2005] VSCA 239 ; (2005) 12 VR 129 which concerned service of a statutory demand under s 109X of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). That context is important because service of a statutory demand is something that requires the same rigour as the service of a notice of assessment when one is not relying on actual service.

49 In that case, the legislation provided for service of a copy of the document in question and what was served was an original. The Court of Appeal held that strict compliance with statutory requirements for service did not prevent someone from doing more than what is required in the statute. At 133, Maxwell PA held:
 
 If it is right to regard service of the original as the highest and best form of service, and service of a copy as in that sense only second-best, then it cannot be supposed that a creditor who does more than the statute requires by serving an original rather than a mere photocopy fails to comply. On the contrary, in my view, where doing the lesser would suffice, doing the greater must also suffice.

50 However, whilst such principles are clearly relevant to the question of service of an assessment, there is a significant point of distinction between the circumstances before the Court of Appeal and the case before me. That case concerned actual service. One can easily accept that serving an original document on a person is better, or at least no worst, than serving a photocopy. For a person to attempt to avoid service on such a technicality clearly goes against the doctrine of strict compliance. However, here the assertion is that leaving a document at a place is better than posting the document to that place. That may be true. However, in the circumstances of these proceedings the best form of service is actual service and leaving the notice of assessment at the post office box of the applicant is clearly not a better form of service. Without the benefit of the regulations or there being deemed service upon the applicant, including a deeming as to the time of service, the respondent cannot show that the notice of assessment was actually served upon the applicant prior to the service of the Garnishee Notices. As a fact, I cannot assume that the applicant, even through an agent, became aware on 25 August 2006 that the notice of assessment was placed in her post office box. There was no positive evidence before me that the applicant in fact received notice of the assessment on 25 August 2006. Indeed, the uncontested evidence of the applicant was that as at 29 August 2006 she still had no notice of the assessment.</text>

<tocase>Madden v Madden (1996) 65 FCR 354</tocase>
<text>27 A principal contention of the applicant was that, taking into account the chronology of events and surrounding circumstances, the sole or driving purpose of the making of the assessment was to allow the respondent to issue the Garnishee Notices, and that this was an improper purpose. The applicant relied upon a passage of Einfeld J in Madden v Madden (1996) 65 FCR 354 at 370: 
 
 As tax collection is not part of tax assessment, the Hickman principle that the assessment must have been made in a bona fide attempt to exercise the powers conferred by the Tax Act, that is, the powers of assessment, seems to me to lead to the conclusion that a motive of collection from a known fund rather than by a genuine assessment of tax due is a breach of the principle. It is one thing to raise an assessment having regard to tax collection, even to enhance the ability to collect the tax -- the Tax Act provides as much: see for example ss 167 and 205. However, it is entirely another matter to raise the assessment with speed, imprecision and inadequacy of examination, investigation and inquiry in order to take advantage of a window of opportunity for its simple collection. In other words, raising an assessment in order to collect tax, rather than to determine the tax due, is not a bona fide attempt to exercise the powers of assessment conferred by the Tax Act. 
 
 The consequence of an improper exercise of power is to take advantage of the taxpayer in a way which cannot be redressed within the internal appeal and review procedures of the Tax Act itself. Once the notice of assessment has been served, the taxpayer is liable to tax and s 218 may be activated. In this case the result has been bankruptcy. If the Commissioner was motivated to raise this assessment in order to serve a s 218 notice on the police, the assessment would in my opinion not have been made for a proper purpose and would accordingly be invalid

28 Even if there was a perceived urgency to issue the Garnishee Notices, I am not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that the assessment was raised in order to collect tax. I do not find any "speed", "imprecision", or "inadequacy of examination, investigation and inquiry" in the making of the assessment, or for the purpose of taking advantage of any "window of opportunity" to collect tax. The investigation into the applicant had been ongoing for some time before the assessment was made, and there is no other evidence of any inadequacy of examination, investigation or inquiry. Assuming the approach of Einfied J is correct, I am not satisfied that the assessment was made other than in circumstances of determining the tax due.

29 Even if the assessment was issued in conjunction with the issue of the Garnishee Notices, this does not lead to the conclusion that the assessment is invalid. To my mind there is a similarity to the position confronting the court in Madden 65 FCR 354 where at 395, Foster J (with whom Shepherd J agreed) dismissed an application based on a similar argument in relation to the issue of a s 218 notice, an equivalent to a notice under s 260-5:
 
 As I see it, the appellant's contention amounts really to this. He alleges that the assessment was invalid because it was issued by the Commissioner in abuse of his power to assess..., in that it was not a bona fide attempt to assess the amount upon which tax should be levied but was a mere device to enable the issue of the s 218 notice... 
 
 In the first place, I am unable to attribute any significance to the fact that the assessment was issued in conjunction with and motivated by a desire to take advantage of s 218. There is sufficient indication of urgency in the situation to warrant the steps that were taken. In my opinion, the s 218 connection is a purely neutral fact in the determination of whether the assessment itself was invalid.</text>

<tocase>R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/53.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Subject to the application of the principle in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 ('the Hickman principle'), ss 175 and 177(1) operate to preclude a taxpayer from challenging an assessment except in objection, review and appeal proceedings brought pursuant to Part IVC of the TAA: Richard Walter 183 CLR at 186 per Mason CJ, at 197-199 per Brennan J, at 211 per Deane and Gaudron JJ, at 222-223 per Toohey J; and at 233 per Dawson J.

18 The Hickman principle states that a privative clause (s 175 in this case) is given effect only if the purported exercise of the power is bona fide, relates to the subject matter of the legislation and is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body exercising it.

19 In Richard Walter 183 CLR at 199, Brennan J stated that the Hickman principle should be applied in the construction of s 175 (footnotes omitted):
 
 The jurisdiction of the Federal Court on appeal from, or of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review of, a decision on an objection extends to every issue which affects the amounts ultimately included in the taxable income or tax liability of a taxpayer. If any of these issues be resolved in favour of the taxpayer, an amendment of the assessment so as to reduce the taxable income or the tax liability of the taxpayer must follow. The width of that jurisdiction and the evidence purpose of the Act to channel all issues as to the true tax liability of the taxpayer into the objection, review and appeal procedures found the clearest implication that exceptions to the broadest literal application of s 175 must be narrowly confined and a corresponding operation must be attributed to s 177(1). 
 
 As the scheme of the Act is to protect the validity of notices of assessment while allowing a taxpayer a full opportunity to have the general provisions of the Act affecting tax liability applied, I would construe the term "due making of the assessment" in s 177(1) as extending to every purported exercise of the power to ascertain the taxable income and tax liability of a taxpayer which satisfies the criteria expressed by the Hickman principle.

20 His Honour went on to explain the application of the Hickman principle to a notice of assessment, at 199-200 (footnotes omitted):
 
 The power to make an assessment is exercised by ascertaining the taxpayer's taxable income and defining the resulting tax liability of the taxpayer. If it appears, either on the face of a notice of assessment or from elsewhere that the Commissioner has not attempted in good faith to determine the taxable income or has not made an assessment definitive of the tax liability of the taxpayer, the assessment does not attract the protection of s 175. Nor, in my opinion, does s 177(1) make the production of such a purported notice of assessment conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment.

31 The variety of matters upon which the applicant sought to rely go no further than establishing that the respondent might have taken an alternative view as to the assessment. The matters relied upon could usefully be raised in Pt IVC proceedings in challenging the amount of the tax liability, however, they do not assist in the determination of the validity of the assessment itself in the Hickman sense.

32 Accordingly, the applicant's grounds that challenge the validity of the assessment are not made out and must fail. Given my findings below in relation to the validity of the Garnishee Notices, I need not consider whether the Garnishee Notices were themselves issued for an improper purpose.</text>

<tocase>Sarikaya v Victorian Workcover Authority [1997] FCA 1372 ; (1997) 80 FCR 262</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/1997/1372.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The reference to a 'physical address' lends itself to the concept of an address at which articles may be physically left, as opposed to a place to which articles may be posted. The observations of Black CJ in Sarikaya v Victorian Workcover Authority [1997] FCA 1372 ; (1997) 80 FCR 262 at 263, albeit in a slightly different context, tends to support this view:
 
 In the present context, a post office box is not, in my view, the "address of a place" at which a document may be "left" for a person. The ordinary notion of a "post office box" is of a container at a post office into which mail that has been duly posted is placed by the postal authorities for retrieval by or on behalf of the holder of the box. Whether or not such a box is, in this context, the "address of a place", it is not the address of a place at which a document may be "left" by way of service.

43 Those observations were made by Black CJ in the context of O 7, r 6(1) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) which requires a party to a proceeding to provide an address for service at which documents may "be left for the person". Looking at reg 36 on its own, the question is only whether the address is a physical address, as opposed to the other question of whether the address is one at which articles can actually be left. However, the similarity is more obvious when reg 36 is viewed in conjunction with reg 40(1), which provides that, where a physical address is given by a person, service can be effected by "leaving a copy of the document at that address". Therefore, the question really is whether the address is one at which articles are capable of being left. If one answers that question in the negative the address is not one at which a document is capable of being left it follows that the address cannot constitute a physical address for the purposes of the Regulations.

44 Ordinarily, a person cannot leave articles at a post office box, but rather must send the article by way of post, which the postal authority will then deliver to the box. There is no doubt that the physical post office box is a tangibly identifiable place, and in that sense, it is a physical place. However, it does not follow that it is a physical address for the purposes of reg 40(1). In my view a post office box address cannot constitute a physical address because it is, ordinarily, an address to which articles can only be posted.

45 The second issue is whether the applicant actually gave the respondent a preferred address for service. The evidence shows that the applicant gave the relevant post office box address in her income tax return for the year ended 30 June 2004. Some doubt was raised about this at the hearing, however I am content to proceed on the basis that the post office box address was the applicant's preferred address for service. It is therefore unnecessary to consider reg 38 which provides for substitution of a preferred address for service.</text>
