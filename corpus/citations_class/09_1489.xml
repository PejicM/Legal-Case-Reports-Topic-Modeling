<tocase>Australian Securities Commission v Samson (1997) 24 ACSR 555</tocase>
<text>In these circumstances it is, I think, appropriate for a warrant to be issued under s 530C. Mr Broberg for the liquidator has provided me with a form of warrant which is based on the form granted in Australian Securities Commission v Samson (1997) 24 ACSR 555. With minor modification, I will direct that the warrant in those terms be issued to be executed at the place of business of the second defendant. 
 I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.

 Counsel for the Plaintiff: Mr R Broberg 
 
 Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Irlicht &amp; Broberg 
 Date of Hearing: 1 December 2009
