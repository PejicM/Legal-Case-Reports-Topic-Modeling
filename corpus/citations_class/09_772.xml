<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<text>In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355, the majority of the High Court (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) said at [93]: 
 In our opinion the Court of Appeal of New South Wales was correct ... in criticising the continued use of the "elusive distinction between directory and mandatory requirements" ... and the division of directory acts into those which have substantially complied with the statutory command and those which have not. They are classifications that have outlived their usefulness because they deflect attention from the real issue which is whether an act done in breach of the legislative provision is invalid. ... A better test for determining the issue of validity is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid. 

 
To my mind, s 601FJ(2) offers only limited assistance in considering that question. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (4th ed, Oxford University Press, 1993) defines the word "accordance" as: "Agreement; conformity; harmony." The word "conformity" is defined as: "Correspondence in form or manner ( to, with ); agreement in character; likeness; congruity. ... Action in accordance with some standard; compliance ( with, to ); acquiescence ... ". The BT defendants submit that the words do not generally prescribe strict compliance. In MTM Funds Management Ltd v Cavalane Holdings Pty Ltd (2000) 158 FLR 121, Austin J helpfully summarized a number of the cases. However his Honour was concerned with a slightly different question. For present purposes, it is necessary that I go to those cases.

If I am wrong both in my construction of s 601FM(1) and s 601FJ(2) , so that the resolution is void, the BT defendants submit that it may be validated pursuant to s 1322. Further, as was pointed out in Project Blue Sky (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [100] invalidity may not be the only basis for restraining action in reliance upon a non-compliant resolution. Even an irregularity not leading to invalidity may be a basis for such relief.</text>

<tocase>re Barber (1886) 17 QBD 259</tocase>
<text>In re Barber (1886) 17 QBD 259 at 264 Lord Esher MR said: 
 But, if a bill of sale is a plain and simple document which would not deceive any ordinary borrower, the Court has never said that it must be set aside because it is not in the exact form given in the schedule. In the present case, I am of opinion that the bill of sale is not so intricate, by reason either of its length or the manner in which it is expressed, as to place any real difficulty in the way of the borrower. It is in substance made in accordance with the statutory form, and I think it is not invalid on any of the grounds which have been suggested.

Lopes LJ said at 265: 
 No doubt [the bill of sale] does not servilely follow that form. But it is only necessary that it should follow the form in substance.

At 270 Bowen LJ said: 
 A bill of sale is surely in accordance with the prescribed form if it is substantially in accordance with it, if it does not depart from the prescribed form in any material respect. But a divergence only becomes substantial or material when it is calculated to give the bill of sale a legal consequence or effect, either greater or smaller, than that which would attach to it if drawn in the form which has been sanctioned, or if it departs from the form in a manner calculated to mislead those whom it is the object of the statute to protect. In estimating the effect of a divergence, one must not take into consideration for the moment the provision of s.9 , that the bill of sale if it varies from the form is to be void, for owing to this statutory penalty no material variation can in the end have any legal effect at all.</text>

<text>In Latitude Fisheries Pty Ltd v Minister for Primary Industries &amp; Energy (1993) 41 FCR 536 at 542-543 the Full Court (Black CJ, Burchett and Lee JJ) said: 
 There was debate about the meaning of the expression "in accordance with", which it was suggested is the equivalent of "consistent with". We have no doubt that the expression connotes a substantial measure of consistency, but, beyond making that observation, we do not think it is particularly helpful to substitute for the statutory expression some other expression of closely similar meaning.</text>

<tocase>Walker v Wilson (1991) 172 CLR 195</tocase>
<text>In Walker v Wilson (1991) 172 CLR 195, the High Court was concerned with a provision in relevant Workers' Compensation legislation which provided that a worker was deemed to have suffered personal injury by accident arising out of, or in the course of, his employment "if the journey is undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions of employment ...". At 200, Brennan J said: 
 The qualification will exclude cover for such a journey if the phrase "in accordance with" be construed as "not inconsistently with" the terms and conditions of the workers' employment.

On the other hand, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ said (at 207-8): 
 In our view, however, the reference in sub-par. (iii) to a journey being "undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions of [the workers] employment" should not be construed as requiring that the relevant journey was one which the worker was contractually bound to take. In the context of the particular circumstances to which sub-par. (iii) is confined, that is to say a case where a worker has been " required " by his employer or by the demands of his work to reside temporarily or in a particular place, it would be arbitrary and unfair to construe the requirement that the journey be "in accordance with the terms and conditions of his employment" in a way which would exclude a return journey which was in the contemplation of both employer and worker at the time the worker went to the temporary location, which was made with consent of the employer and which was consistent with the terms and conditions of the employment. In the context of sub-par. (iii) the words "in accordance with" should be construed as meaning "in conformity with" or "consistently with".

In this case the adopted procedure complied substantially with the requirements of Division 2. The primary thrust of the Division is that replacement is to be effected by extraordinary resolution at a meeting called in accordance with the Act. The members of the scheme both must resolve to remove the existing responsible entity and choose a replacement. The requirement for an extraordinary resolution is significant for present purposes. Such a resolution requires the support of holders of 50% of the total number of possible votes. To achieve success in such an undertaking is no mean feat. The adoption of such a resolution says much about the wishes of the members. It is difficult to see why Parliament would have intended that a resolution having such wide support be invalid merely because there was one vote rather than two.

As I have said, the absence of any clear purpose underlying the alleged requirement that there be two distinct votes militates against such a construction. However, if that construction be accepted, the same consideration militates against construing s 601FJ(2) as invalidating a resolution adopted in breach of such requirement.</text>

<tocase>David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 265</tocase>
<text>A preliminary question arises as to the application of s 1322 to a resolution which does not comply with the requirements of s 601FM. The plaintiffs submit that s 601FJ(2) manifests an intention that any such irregularity render such resolution invalid, and so implicitly excludes the operation of s 1322. They rely upon the decision of the High Court in David Grant &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 265 at 275-279, and the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in BP Australia Ltd v Brown (2003) 58 NSWLR 322. David Grant (1995) 184 CLR 265 concerned the operation of s 1322(4) upon an application to set aside a statutory demand made outside the period prescribed for so doing. The relevant provision provided that such an application "may only be made within 21 days after the demand is so served". The Court held that the clear wording of the section, its history, the purpose which the statutory demand fulfilled and the consequence of non-compliance militated against the intention that time for compliance could be extended pursuant to s 1322(4). In BP Australia Ltd v Brown (2003) 58 NSWLR 322 the Court of Appeal came to a similar conclusion concerning a specified time limit in another provision of the Corporations Act , also providing that an application "may only be made" within a specified time and with a specific provision limiting the capacity to extend time.

Neither case bears much similarity to the present circumstances. The plaintiffs' case, at its highest, depends upon the proposition that s 601FJ(2) invalidates proceedings not taken in accordance with Division 2. However it is quite clear that s 1322(4) permits the remediation of invalidity, which term I take to include ineffectiveness, the word used in s 601FJ(2). Something more is needed in order to exclude the operation of s 1322. In both David Grant (1995) 184 CLR 265 and Brown (2003) 58 NSWLR 322 the relevant sections, in terms, prescribed the only circumstances in which the relevant applications could be made. In both cases other circumstances also suggested that it was not intended that s 1322 should apply.</text>

<tocase>Re Westpac Banking Corporation (2004) 53 ACSR 288</tocase>
<text>In their submissions concerning the applicability of s 1322 , both sides seek to rely upon s 601QA. That section authorizes ASIC to exempt a person from a provision of Ch 5C. The plaintiffs submit that it would be inconsistent with the existence of such power in ASIC for the Court to have power, pursuant to s 1322 , to remedy any non-compliance with a provision of that chapter. That submission assumes that ASIC's power may be exercised retrospectively, a proposition about which ASIC apparently has doubts. See Re Westpac Banking Corporation (2004) 53 ACSR 288 at [16]. The BT defendants submit that the existence of such a power demonstrates that compliance with the provisions of Ch 5C is not mandatory. I derive no assistance from either submission.

In my view, s 1322 operates in connection with proceedings pursuant to s 601FM. I propose to deal firstly with the operation of s 1322(2) upon the basis that the alleged non-compliance is a procedural irregularity which may be validated pursuant to that section. I will then deal with the operation of s 1322(4) on the basis that s 1322(2) does not operate to validate the consequences of any irregularity. Section 1322(2)</text>

<tocase>Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434</tocase>
<text>The first question is whether I am here concerned with a "proceeding" as defined in s 1322(1). Counsel for the BT defendants submit that the decision in Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434 is authority for the proposition that a meeting or resolution passed at a meeting is such a proceeding. In that case Austin J certainly treated a meeting as being a proceeding for the purposes s 1322. However, I doubt whether, in declaring that the relevant resolution was ineffective by virtue of failure to comply with the equivalent of what is now s 201E , his Honour was acting pursuant to s 1322. Austin J raised that ground of invalidity after argument and received written submissions concerning it. His Honour's reasons suggest that he was declaring invalidity upon the basis of his construction of the relevant section rather than exercising a discretion to invalidate an otherwise valid resolution. The BT defendants also point out that in Cordiant Communications Australia Pty Ltd v The Communications Group Holdings Pty Ltd (2005) 55 ACSR 185 at [87], Palmer J observed: 
 There is no doubt that the passing of a special resolution of a shareholders meeting is a "proceeding" under the Corporations Act for the purposes of s 1322.

Apart from the plaintiffs' own assertions (which may be taken to be also on behalf of Contra Proferentum), there is no reason to believe that anybody would have voted differently had the two matters been voted upon separately. Nobody attending at the meeting, other than City Pacific and Contra Proferentum, opposed the proposal being considered and adopted in accordance with the notice of meeting. It is common ground that City Pacific and Contra Proferentum had insufficient votes to change the outcome. The plaintiffs bear the onus of establishing injustice for the purpose of s 1322(2). See Howard v Mechtler (1999) 30 ACSR 434 at 441. The plaintiffs have not satisfied that onus. Section 1322(4)

Section 1322(4) will be engaged only if the purported resolution is invalid. The section authorizes the Court to make an order declaring that any act, matter or thing purporting to have been done, or any proceeding purporting to have been instituted or taken under the Act, or in relation to a corporation, is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision of the Act, or a provision of the constitution of a corporation. There is no reference to an act "in relation to" a scheme or a provision of the constitution of a scheme. However the purported resolution was clearly "under" the Act. It has not been suggested that any relief sought in connection with the purported resolution is beyond the power conferred by s 1322(4). In order that the Court may make an order pursuant to s 1322(4)(a) it must be satisfied as to one of the three following matters:

In every case the Court must also be satisfied that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be, caused to any person. Presumably, the conferment of power to validate an act, matter, thing or proceeding which is "essentially of a procedural nature" supplements the power conferred by s 1322(2) to rectify a procedural irregularity, and therefore applies to a situation in which s 1322(2) would not operate. As I understand the BT defendants, they submit that it is just and equitable that an order be made validating any invalidity, and that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be, caused to any person.</text>

 There is no doubt that the passing of a special resolution of a shareholders meeting is a "proceeding" under the Corporations Act for the purposes of s 1322.

I hold that the adoption of a resolution at a meeting is a proceeding for the purposes of s 1322(1) and (2). If so, and assuming that the irregularity is procedural, the BT defendants may rely upon the operation of s 1322(2) to avoid invalidity of the resolution. The fact that one is considering the validity of a proceeding does not necessarily mean that any possible cause of invalidity is procedural. In Cordiant (2005) 55 ACSR 185, after considering the authorities, Palmer J concluded at [97]: 
 A wrongful denial of a shareholder's statutory right to vote at a meeting is a denial of substantive right and is not a "procedural irregularity" within the scope of s 1322(2) at all.

There is much to be said for the proposition that denial of a right to vote is more than a procedural irregularity. The plaintiffs submit that the taking of only one vote deprived them of their entitlement to vote on the question of replacement. However the form of the proposal did not, itself, have this effect. Their disenfranchisement was the consequence of the operation of s 253E. The section suggests that a responsible entity has an interest in both its removal from that position and the choice of any replacement. The final sentence of s 253E would otherwise be unnecessary. It is not difficult to identify reason for treating the outgoing responsible entity as being interested in the choice of a replacement. Firstly, the removal and replacement are closely associated. The enthusiasm of the members for removal will almost certainly depend upon the availability of a suitable replacement, unless they were willing to wind up the scheme. In that case, one might expect them to proceed pursuant to s 601NB rather than by way of application pursuant to s 601FM(1). A responsible entity who did not wish to be removed might make it known that it was hostile to any proposed replacement. If it held sufficient votes to influence the outcome, such a disclosure might dissuade other members from voting for its removal. In those circumstances, and given that both matters must be resolved at the same meeting, one would be inclined to think that the responsible entity was sufficiently interested in the replacement to be disqualified from voting on that issue. Further, if the responsible entity were removed, but no replacement was chosen, the outgoing responsible entity would be obliged to apply for the winding up of the scheme. As I have previously pointed out, it would normally be responsible for supervising that winding up. Thus it would, in effect, continue as responsible entity and would, presumably, derive a benefit from so doing. In that way, too, it would have an interest in the choice of a replacement. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that either City Pacific or Contra Proferentum would have been permitted to vote on a separate motion to choose a replacement responsible entity.

There has been no suggestion that the proposal was drawn in order to cause disenfranchisement. It must be taken at face value. Section 601FM prescribes the procedure for removing and replacing a responsible entity. In that sense it is procedural. Given the requirement that such steps be effected by extraordinary resolutions, the form in which it is cast is significantly less important than absence of a quorum, a matter expressly defined to be a procedural irregularity. Absence of a quorum will mean that a resolution may be adopted by the vote of a smaller number of persons than is contemplated by law or by the relevant constitutional document. That is not a risk in the case of an extraordinary resolution, given the requirement for a 50% vote in favour of the relevant proposal.</text>

<tocase>Wagner v International Health Promotions (1994) 15 ACSR 419</tocase>
<text>The plaintiffs submit that the decision in Wagner v International Health Promotions (1994) 15 ACSR 419 is authority for the proposition that failure to comply with a mandatory requirement such as that in s 601FM cannot be characterized as a procedural irregularity. However that was a quite different case. Section 436A(1) of the Corporations Law required that an administrator might be appointed if the board had resolved to the effect that: 
 (a) in the opinion of the directors voting for the resolution, the company is insolvent, or is likely to become insolvent at some future time; and
 (b) an administrator of the company should be appointed. 

 
The board resolved only that an administrator be appointed. There was simply no resolution as to insolvency. In the present case, the members resolved both that City Pacific be removed and that Trilogy be appointed.</text>

<tocase>Mamouney v Soliman (1992) 9 ACSR 63</tocase>
<text>I am of the view that the alleged non-compliance, that is failure to conduct two separate votes, would have been a procedural irregularity. To the extent that the purported resolution might be invalid, such invalidity would have been cured by s 1322(2). I do not understand the plaintiffs to seek a declaration of invalidity pursuant to s 1322(2). In any event, in Mamouney v Soliman (1992) 9 ACSR 63 at 71, Hodgson J (after referring to the authorities) said: 
 Furthermore, in my view, it is necessary that the possible injustice be linked to the particular irregularities themselves. It is insufficient for the plaintiff to say that the resolutions were irregularly passed, and those resolutions have caused injustice. In my view, the plaintiff must show that there may have been a different result, if the proper notice had been given.</text>

<tocase>Peters' American Delicacy Co Ltd v Heath (1938-1939) 61 CLR 457</tocase>
<text>This argument appears to owe something to perceptions which led to the assertion (now abandoned) that the explanatory memorandum was misleading or deceptive and that this was a basis for invalidating the resolution. In Peters' American Delicacy Co Ltd v Heath (1938-1939) 61 CLR 457, similar arguments were considered and discarded. At 489-491, Latham CJ said: 
 It is next objected that the statements made by the chairman and the solicitor for the company in the speeches which they made at the meeting were misleading. The objections to the speeches cover much of the same ground as objections to the circular. ... but in my opinion the answer to these objections (as also to the objections against the circular) is that the whole matter was fully discussed and debated at the meeting. The directors put their views through the chairman and the company's solicitor. A solicitor and another speaker for the objectors contested the statements of the chairman and of the company's solicitor, contended that the proposed alteration would be unfair to the partly paid shareholders ... Thus it appears to me that the whole matter was put before the shareholders. They were given quite full information. Any further information which they desired was available to them, including the opinions of counsel. No charge of fraud or of bad faith is made, or, if made, could on the evidence be supported. There is no evidence that the alteration was made with the object of oppressing a minority or to deprive a minority of its rights. ... 

 
 Even if it should be held that some of the statements made in speeches at the meeting were inaccurate, it would, in my opinion, be a dangerous thing for a court to declare that such a circumstance invalidated a resolution passed at a meeting of the shareholders of the company. Whenever a controversy arises as to what is the wisest course to pursue, and particularly when the matter in issue involves the alteration of existing rights (real or supposed), statements will probably be made on each side which the other side regards as unfair or inaccurate and which may in fact be unfair or inaccurate. There is, in my opinion, no authority to support the proposition that the fact that statements which are not true in fact were made at a shareholders' meeting has the effect of invalidating a decision reached at the meeting. If this were the law, then, as two inconsistent statements can never both be true, it would only be necessary for any dissentient shareholder to make a statement or series of statements which were plainly inconsistent with other statements made at the meeting in order to procure the invalidation of any resolution passed.

Similarly, at 514, Dixon J said: 
 But the fact that a description honestly made of the exact legal result arising from the existing articles is thought by the Court to be capable of conveying an incorrect impression is no sufficient ground for treating as void special resolutions duly notified, proposed and passed.

The plaintiffs submit that had the votes been taken separately the outcome might have been different. This is pure speculation. The evidence clearly indicates to the contrary. In particular, no member other than City Pacific and Contra Proferentum expressed any opposition to the motion being put in the form appearing in the notice of motion. There was no suggestion that any entity other than Trilogy should be considered for appointment as the replacement responsible entity. The notice of meeting was given well in advance of the meeting. Had any member wished to propose different resolutions he or she could have done so. Had members felt that they would prefer to consider the two questions separately, and to vote on them separately, they could have asked for the opportunity. Whether or not it was granted may have depended upon the views of the members. It may have been necessary that there be another meeting. These were all questions for the members to consider at the meeting. It was open to persons who had cast proxy votes prior to the meeting to withdraw their proxies by attending at the meeting and voting on the basis of the additional information provided by the BT defendants and the information provided by the plaintiffs.</text>
