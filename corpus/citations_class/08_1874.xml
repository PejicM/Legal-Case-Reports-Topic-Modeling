<tocase>Brown v The Repatriation Commission [1985] FCA 194 ; (1985) 7 FCR 302</tocase>

<text>36 Section 44 of the Tribunal Act provides that a party may appeal to the Federal Court, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal. Rather, it and it alone, is the subject matter of the appeal and the ambit of the appeal is confined to that question of law: Brown v The Repatriation Commission [1985] FCA 194 ; (1985) 7 FCR 302. The Commissioner contends that the first three of those purported questions are not questions of law and should be struck out.

37 The thrust of the Taxpayer's contentions, in effect, is that, at the time of the termination of his employment, he was physically located in Tokyo and was not a resident of Australia. He contends that, while the period of reasonable notice may properly be determined by reference to the time of his employment by Deutsche Australia, the relevant fact is that, at the time of termination, he was being remunerated by Deutsche Securities and the Redundancy Payment was made in circumstances where he had asserted, through his solicitors, an entitlement to a payment equivalent to 24 months' salary, and had asserted that any such payment would not be subject to deduction of tax because it was a payment within the definition in s 27A.

38 The grounds of appeal are not easy to comprehend. First, the Taxpayer says that the Tribunal erred in considering that legal employment by Deutsche Australia, an Australian entity, was service not in a foreign country under paragraph (iii). Rather, he says, the Tribunal should have considered the legislative context, which included s 23AG of the Assessment Act, which had the effect that salary paid while not a resident would be exempt. The Taxpayer asserts that, had he been given reasonable notice, the reasonable notice period of 14 months would have been worked out in Japan for which he would have received salary that would have been exempt. However, there was no finding to that effect by the Tribunal. Indeed, the Tribunal was not asked to make such a finding. It is certainly not self-evident that such a finding should or could have been made on the material before the Tribunal. The first ground has no substance.</text>

<tocase>McLaurin v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1961] HCA 9 ; (1961) 104 CLR 381</tocase>

<text>49 It would be wrong to allow a determination of the character of a receipt in the hands of the recipient to be affected by a consideration of the uncommunicated reasoning that led the payer to agree to make the payment. On the other hand, in a proper case, a single payment or receipt of a mixed nature may be apportioned amongst the several heads to which it relates. Thus, it may be appropriate to follow such a course where the payment or receipt is in settlement of distinct claims of which some at least are liquidated or are otherwise ascertainable by calculation. On the other hand, it will not be appropriate where the payment or receipt is in respect of a claim or claims for unliquidated damages only and is made or accepted under a compromise that treats it as a single undissected amount of damages. In such a case, the amount must be considered as a whole: McLaurin v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1961] HCA 9 ; (1961) 104 CLR 381 at 391.

50 The Commissioner accepts that, had there been a basis for apportioning part of the Redundancy Payment, such that it could be said that that part was attributable to the Taxpayer's service in Japan and related solely to the period of his employment in Japan, it may have been possible to dissect the Redundancy Payment. However, no such apportionment was made by the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia. There was a dissection made, in the correspondence that led to the payment, insofar as a distinction was drawn between redundancy and payment in lieu of notice. However, that distinction was not related to the respective periods of employment in Australia and in Japan. The 11 months' redundancy was calculated by reference to the total period of employment of the Taxpayer by Deutsche Australia from the Taxpayer's commencement in 1992 until his termination in 2002. Similarly, the payment in lieu of notice was not limited to the period of his employment in Japan. The material before the Tribunal indicated that the Taxpayer continued to be employed by Deutsche Australia. Deutsche Australia terminated his employment, albeit at a time when he was serving in Japan and was non-resident.

51 It may have been possible for the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia to agree on the manner in which the Redundancy Payment was to be apportioned as between service in Japan and service in Australia, such that that part attributable to the service in Japan would not be included in the Taxpayer's assessable income. However, they did not do that. There was no error of law on the part of the Tribunal in concluding that dissection of the Redundancy Payment was not permissible in the circumstances before it.</text>
