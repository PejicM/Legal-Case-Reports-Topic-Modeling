<tocase>Harris v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] QSC 108</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/2006/108.html</AustLII>
<text>In turn, the Commissioner seeks an order pursuant to s 588FGA(2) of the Corporations Act against a director of Seminars International, Mr Roger Jeffrey Davies (Mr Davies). Mr Davies has become the Second Defendant in the proceedings, pursuant to interlocutory process issued against him at the behest of the Commissioner. I note that such a practice was the subject of approval by Mackenzie J in Harris v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] QSC 108 at [25] .

Earlier this year I made orders providing for substituted service in respect of Mr Davies. The material read this morning on behalf of the Commissioner satisfies me that he has been served in accordance with those orders. Mr Davies has not appeared today.</text>

<tocase>Hillig v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] QSC 403 ; (2001) 2 QR 147</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//qld/QSC/2000/403.html</AustLII>
<text>The evidence before me establishes that, of the sum of $125,471.40 previously referred to, the sum of $68,544.94 was applied by the Commissioner to Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding liabilities of the company to the Commonwealth under subdivision 16B of Pt 2 - 5 in Sch 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth). The evidence further establishes that Mr Davies was a director of the company at the time when the payments were made. It is submitted, correctly, in my opinion, that the loss suffered by the Commissioner is twofold, namely: 
(a) the amount of the Court's repayment order in favour of the liquidator, insofar as that relates to PAYG withholding liabilities, in this case $68,544.94 (see Hillig v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] QSC 403 ; (2001) 2 QR 147) ; and
 
(b) any legal costs and interest that the Commissioner has required to pay to the liquidator in consequence of the voidable preference claim brought against the Commissioner (see Commissioner of Taxation v Sims [2008] NSWCA 298 at [34] ).</text>
