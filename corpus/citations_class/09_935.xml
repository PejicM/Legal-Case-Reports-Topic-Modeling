<tocase>F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295</tocase>
<text>And there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does " information " for the purposes of s 424A " encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ": SZEEU , supra , at [206]. In SZBYR , supra , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed (citations omitted): 
 [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word "information": 

 
does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.
 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.

<text>The essential purpose of s 424A is to provide " a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness " although " the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice ": VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [24] , [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 476 to 477 per Finn and Stone JJ. In Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 , 113 FCR 396 Allsop J likewise observed: 
 [104] The evident purpose of s 424A is to play its part in the provision of a procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness. I think s 424A should be looked at with a purpose in mind of ensuring that the claimant is fairly informed of information adverse to his or her case (in the manner described by the section) so that investigation may be made, and steps may be taken, somehow, if possible, to meet it. The extent of particulars of any information should be looked at in a common sense way in the context of the matter in hand and with fairness to the applicant in mind. A consideration of these matters is obviously affected by the chosen approach of the Tribunal. Particulars of information need to be provided to the applicant so that the applicant understands what is the relevant information to the review. This very much depends upon what the Tribunal takes to be relevant ...</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , 96 ALD 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>The manner in which s 424A is to be construed and applied has been discussed in many other decisions of this Court (e.g. SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 60 , 108 ALD 303 ; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 , 150 FCR 214 ; SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 , 164 FCR 578) and by the High Court (e.g. SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , 96 ALD 1).

And in SZBYR , supra , although the correctness of the decision of the Full Court in SZEEU was assumed, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ concluded (references omitted): 
 [17] ... The statutory criterion does not, for example, turn on "the reasoning process of the Tribunal", or "the Tribunal's published reasons". The reason for affirming the decision that is under review is a matter that depends upon the criteria for the making of that decision in the first place. The Tribunal does not operate in a statutory vacuum, and its role is dependent upon the making of administrative decisions upon criteria to be found elsewhere in the Act. The use of the future conditional tense ("would be") rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance &#8212; and independently &#8212; of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case. Here, the appropriate criterion was to be found in s 36(1) of the Act, being the provision under which the appellants sought their protection visa. The "reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light, it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellants' statutory declaration would itself be "information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellants' claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations. Indeed, if their contents were believed, they would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review. 

 
Reference was thereafter made, with approval, to the observations of the Full Court of this Court in VAF , supra . In SZMHD, supra , Jacobson J observed that the question as to whether s 424A(1) is engaged is to be determined in advance of and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case: [2009] FCA 712 at [46] , citing SZBYR , supra , at [17] and [22].

In SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [38] , Jacobson J referred to there being " some tension in the authorities as to what use, if any, can be made of the Tribunal's written reasons in determining whether s 424A(1)(a) was enlivened ". His Honour accepted that in light of the decision in SZBYR " the question is to be determined in advance of, and independently from, the Tribunal's reasoning ".

And there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does " information " for the purposes of s 424A " encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ": SZEEU , supra , at [206].

In SZEEU , supra , Allsop J observed that an assessment as to " whether the Tribunal has complied with s 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal, because it is the information that the Tribunal considers relevant that must be assessed in order to see whether, prior to the decision being made, it would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision ".

<tocase>SZFQY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 395</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2009/395.html</AustLII>
<text>For present purposes, the Tribunal which last considered the delegate's decision again affirmed the decision not to grant the visa sought. An application seeking review of that decision was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 5 November 2008. On 16 April 2009 that Application was rejected: SZFQY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 395.

The Appellant now appeals to this Court. The Notice of Appeal as filed on 5 May 2009 relevantly states: 
 GROUNDS OF APPEAL: 

 
 His honour committed an error of law in dismissing that the decision involved a jurisdictional error of law involving an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law to the facts of the case found by the Refugee Review Tribunal. The Tribunal decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the Migration Act or the regulations. 

 
 The Tribunal breached its obligations under S.424A (1) of the Act. The Tribunal made a number of findings to reject my claims. The Tribunal did not discuss with me the Independent Information or give me an opportunity, to provide an explanation in relation to those findings. ... Alternatively, the Tribunal's obligations under s.424A(1)(b) encompass the giving of particulars as to the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable, since those particulars inherently assist a proper understanding of the relevance of the adverse evidence to the Tribunal's review. 

 
These Grounds of Appeal were further supplemented by a written Outline of Submissions filed by the Appellant on 23 July 2009. Those written submissions state in part as follows (without alteration):
 
 The Tribunal did not explain in its decision that what kind of knowledge it was expecting from the applicant. The Tribunal also set a level for political activities for the applicant and the Tribunal did not inform the applicant which level of activities it was expecting and the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) does say any about what the Tribunal mentioned in its decision, so the applicant was not able to satisfy the Tribunal and the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in this regard 

 
The submissions also refer to specific findings as made by the Tribunal and assert that there has been a denial of an opportunity to address those findings.

The Appellant appeared before this Court on 5 August 2009 unrepresented, although he did have the benefit of an interpreter. At the outset of the hearing he appeared to read from a document and made oral submissions as to why his Appeal should be allowed. He was unable, however, to provide any assistance as to what was intended to be embraced within the oral submissions he was advancing. Clearly the document had been prepared by someone else. Such a course does little either to advance such merits as an appellant's case may have or to assist the Court.

Although there is some uncertainty in the grounds expressed in the Notice of Appeal , as supplemented by the written submissions, it is considered that the Tribunal has not committed any jurisdictional error and, more importantly, that there is no appellable error in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate.

The " applicable law " to which the Appellant refers in his Grounds of Appeal is not further identified, nor is there any further clarification of the " power " to which reference is also there made.

This contention was rejected by the Federal Magistrate: [2009] FMCA 395 at [11] .

If this is the " applicable law " and the " power " to which the Appellant intended to refer in his Notice of Appeal , the Federal Magistrate was correct to reject the contention.

The now Appellant was invited to attend a hearing to be held before the Refugee Review Tribunal on 6 June 2008. The Appellant, by his representative, indicated that he did in fact wish to attend and on 24 May 2008 his representative forwarded to the Tribunal a detailed " dossier ". An " amended statement " signed by the now Appellant was forwarded to the Tribunal on 3 June 2008 and on 4 June 2008 a " submission " was also forwarded. The hearing before the Tribunal then took place on 6 June 2008.</text>

 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.

<text>The manner in which s 424A is to be construed and applied has been discussed in many other decisions of this Court (e.g. SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2009] FCAFC 60 , 108 ALD 303 ; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 , 150 FCR 214 ; SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 , 164 FCR 578) and by the High Court (e.g. SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 , 96 ALD 1).

Nor is there considered to be any breach of s 424A by failing to give " particulars as to the derivation of adverse evidence ". It is not at all apparent whether the Appellant was intending to confine this contention to " particulars " as to the derivation of the independent country information or " particulars " as to the evidence relied upon when making the series of adverse findings set forth elsewhere in the Tribunal's reasons for decision. Either way, the contention is without substance. While the source of information is a factor that must be put to an applicant in certain circumstances ( SZLPO , supra ), the facts of this case do not give rise to such an obligation on the part of the Tribunal. The source of the country information has been identified; the adverse findings were findings as to credit and an assessment as to evidence advanced by the now Appellant.

Although not referred to in the Notice of Appeal , the Appellant's written submissions finally assert a breach of s 424AA of the 1958 Act. This was not a Ground relied upon before the Federal Magistrate and it should not now be allowed to be pursued on appeal. It is in any event a ground without apparent substance.

The fundamental difficulty confronting the Appellant is the simple fact that the Tribunal did not accept the case being advanced. The Tribunal did not accept that the Appellant had any significant political involvement in the Awami League and did not accept that he had been subjected to extortion or attack for reasons of his political opinion. Central to the rejection of his claims was the assessment by the Tribunal that his claims were " vague and unsubstantiated by relevant details ". These were all findings of fact open to the Tribunal and essentially based upon the material being advanced by the now Appellant. The Appellant has not been denied such procedural fairness as is set forth in the 1958 Act. He has been given a fair opportunity to advance his case. Fairness does not require an opportunity to further dissuade the Tribunal from making findings adverse to him. There has been no breach of s 424A.</text>

<text>Although no letter was forwarded to the now Appellant pursuant to s 424A, there has been no denial of any opportunity " to comment on or respond to " (s 424A(1)(c)) the information relied upon by the Tribunal in making its findings. " Clear particulars " of the information to be relied upon had been given to the now Appellant when attending before the Tribunal (s 424A(2A)). Section 424A(2A) relieves the Tribunal of the obligation to give particulars of information to an applicant or to invite him to comment on or respond to information " if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information ...". Sections 424A and 424AA " are intended to be complementary ": SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 at [2] , [2009] FCAFC 46 ; 174 FCR 415 at 417 per Moore J.

<tocase>SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 712</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/712.html</AustLII>
<text>As the terms of s 424A make clear, the particulars required by s 424A(1) must be given in writing: s 424A(2). But s 424A(2A) creates an exception to s 424A(1) in that the Tribunal is not obliged to give written particulars of all information if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the requisite information to the applicant at a hearing to which he has been invited under s 425. See also SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 712 at [11] to [15] per Jacobson J.

It is understood that the Appellant now seeks to contend that there has been a breach of s 424A essentially by reason of: 
(i) an alleged failure to " discuss ... Independent Information ";
 
(ii) an alleged failure to provide " an opportunity, to provide an explanation in relation to " findings made by the Tribunal; and/or
 
(iii) a failure to provide him with " particulars as to the derivation of adverse evidence which might affect a consideration of whether the information is reliable... ".
 
The " findings " to which reference is made are not further identified, nor is the " independent information ". It has been assumed, however, that the reference to " findings " is a reference to each adverse finding made by the Tribunal and that the " information " is a reference to independent country information that was available to the Tribunal.

And in SZBYR , supra , although the correctness of the decision of the Full Court in SZEEU was assumed, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ concluded (references omitted): 
 [17] ... The statutory criterion does not, for example, turn on "the reasoning process of the Tribunal", or "the Tribunal's published reasons". The reason for affirming the decision that is under review is a matter that depends upon the criteria for the making of that decision in the first place. The Tribunal does not operate in a statutory vacuum, and its role is dependent upon the making of administrative decisions upon criteria to be found elsewhere in the Act. The use of the future conditional tense ("would be") rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance &#8212; and independently &#8212; of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case. Here, the appropriate criterion was to be found in s 36(1) of the Act, being the provision under which the appellants sought their protection visa. The "reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light, it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellants' statutory declaration would itself be "information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review". Those portions of the statutory declaration did not contain in their terms a rejection, denial or undermining of the appellants' claims to be persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations. Indeed, if their contents were believed, they would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review. 

 
Reference was thereafter made, with approval, to the observations of the Full Court of this Court in VAF , supra . In SZMHD, supra , Jacobson J observed that the question as to whether s 424A(1) is engaged is to be determined in advance of and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case: [2009] FCA 712 at [46] , citing SZBYR , supra , at [17] and [22].</text>

<text>In SZMNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 596 at [38] , Jacobson J referred to there being " some tension in the authorities as to what use, if any, can be made of the Tribunal's written reasons in determining whether s 424A(1)(a) was enlivened ".

<text>Moreover, and as further correctly concluded by the Federal Magistrate, the independent country information was not in any event information which falls within the ambit of s 424A(1): s 424A(3)(a). Section 424A(3)(a) provides that s 424A does not apply to information " that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member ". Rejected has been a contention that the phrase " just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member " is another criterion of exemption: QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92 at [12] per Lander J (Dowsett and Hely JJ agreeing). The nature of the country information here in issue fell within s 424A(3)(a).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/123.html</AustLII>
<text>The essential purpose of s 424A is to provide " a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness " although " the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice ": VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [24] , [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 476 to 477 per Finn and Stone JJ. In Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 , 113 FCR 396 Allsop J likewise observed: 
 [104] The evident purpose of s 424A is to play its part in the provision of a procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness. I think s 424A should be looked at with a purpose in mind of ensuring that the claimant is fairly informed of information adverse to his or her case (in the manner described by the section) so that investigation may be made, and steps may be taken, somehow, if possible, to meet it. The extent of particulars of any information should be looked at in a common sense way in the context of the matter in hand and with fairness to the applicant in mind. A consideration of these matters is obviously affected by the chosen approach of the Tribunal. Particulars of information need to be provided to the applicant so that the applicant understands what is the relevant information to the review. This very much depends upon what the Tribunal takes to be relevant ...

And in SZBYR , supra , although the correctness of the decision of the Full Court in SZEEU was assumed, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ concluded (references omitted): 
 [17] ... The statutory criterion does not, for example, turn on "the reasoning process of the Tribunal", or "the Tribunal's published reasons". The reason for affirming the decision that is under review is a matter that depends upon the criteria for the making of that decision in the first place. The Tribunal does not operate in a statutory vacuum, and its role is dependent upon the making of administrative decisions upon criteria to be found elsewhere in the Act. The use of the future conditional tense ("would be") rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424A(1)(a) is to be determined in advance &#8212; and independently &#8212; of the Tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case. Here, the appropriate criterion was to be found in s 36(1) of the Act, being the provision under which the appellants sought their protection visa. The "reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review" was therefore that the appellants were not persons to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention. When viewed in that light, it is difficult to see why the relevant passages in the appellants' statutory declaration would itself be "information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".

Indeed, if their contents were believed, they would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review. 

 
Reference was thereafter made, with approval, to the observations of the Full Court of this Court in VAF , supra . In SZMHD, supra , Jacobson J observed that the question as to whether s 424A(1) is engaged is to be determined in advance of and independently of the Tribunal's reasoning on the facts of the particular case: [2009] FCA 712 at [46] , citing SZBYR , supra , at [17] and [22].

And there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does " information " for the purposes of s 424A " encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ": SZEEU , supra , at [206]. In SZBYR , supra , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed (citations omitted): 
 [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute "information". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word "information": 

 
does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.
 
 
 If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly "information" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant "information" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.
