<text>The proceeding in this Court is by way of appeal from the AAT. By s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act "), an appeal lies to this Court from the AAT but the appeal is restricted to a question of law. A question whether the AAT has denied procedural fairness to a party to a proceeding before it is a question of law for this purpose. See Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [3] - [8] per Gray ACJ and North J. Ordinarily, the AAT's decision would be immune from challenge in this Court, because of s 474 of the Migration Act . It would fall squarely within the definition of "privative clause decision" in s 474(2). Section 44 of the AAT Act would also not apply to it, because of s 483 of the Migration Act , which provides that s 44 of the AAT Act does not apply to a "privative clause decision". The judgment of the High Court of Australia in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 (2003) 211 CLR 476 makes clear, however, that the reference to a "decision" in the definition of "privative clause decision" is a reference to a decision that is not invalidated by reason of jurisdictional error. It follows that, if the applicant in the present case can establish jurisdictional error on the part of the AAT, he is entitled to appeal to this Court. Denial of procedural fairness on the part of the decision-maker is jurisdictional error for this purpose, as Plaintiff S157 itself demonstrates. If the applicant in the present case can establish such a denial on the part of the AAT, he will succeed in establishing both error of law by the AAT and an entitlement to have the AAT's decision set aside, despite s 474 of the Migration Act .</text>

<tocase>Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>The applicant contended that the AAT ought not to have made the findings it did about Dr Kennedy's evidence without giving notice to the applicant and his counsel that it intended to do so. In the recent judgment in the High Court of Australia in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 (2006) 81 ALJR 515, the procedural fairness obligations of another tribunal under the Migration Act , in relation to the issues arising in hearings, have been stated succinctly. At [29]-[34], the High Court referred to the dichotomy suggested by the Full Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592, between a decision-maker's obligation to identify an issue not obviously open on the known material, and his or her lack of obligation to expose in advance aspects of the mental processes by which the decision-maker arrives at a decision. The High Court pointed out that the dichotomy does not necessarily encompass all possible kinds of cases that may fall for consideration, and focussing on it may distract from the fundamental principles that are engaged. The High Court emphasised the principle, referred to in Alphaone at 590-591, that the right to be heard ordinarily requires that the party affected be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues, and that this may involve more than simply knowing what is the ultimate decision to be made. At [47]-[49], the High Court pointed out that sometimes it is necessary for the decision-maker to indicate what he or she thinks the issues are, either by the questions he or she asks during a hearing, or more explicitly. What is not required is for the decision-maker to give a running commentary on what he or she thinks about the evidence that is given. The High Court did say that, even if the issues are properly identified, there may be cases that would yield to analysis in the terms identified in Alphaone . It appears from this reasoning that the distinction between an issue not obviously open on the known material, and an aspect of the decision-maker's mental processes is a valid distinction, but that care must be taken to avoid trying to force each case into one or other of those categories.

In terms of the dichotomy raised by the Full Court in Alphaone , the issue on which the AAT's treatment of Dr Kennedy's opinion turned was one obviously open on the known material. It was an issue that emerged during the course of the evidence, with which the applicant and his counsel had to deal if they could. Instead of attempting to deal with the issue by seeking an adjournment, for the purpose of obtaining further evidence from Dr Kennedy, counsel for the applicant chose largely to ignore the issue of the applicant's offences in August 2004 in making her submissions. She certainly chose to ignore the inconsistencies between the applicant's evidence and that of Dr Kennedy. Undoubtedly, as the evidence stood, this was a legitimate forensic tactic, for the purpose of minimising the importance of the issue in the mind of the Deputy President. The tactic failed. It is not open to the applicant then to contend that the AAT denied him procedural fairness because it made a factual finding adverse to him. The finding was clearly open on the evidence as it stood. The factual issue of the value of Dr Kennedy's expressed opinion, in the light of the subsequent evidence about the applicant's treatment programs in prison and his August 2004 offences, could not be said to have been a matter of surprise to the applicant, with which he was unable to deal within the hearing.

There was no denial of procedural fairness by the AAT in the way in which it dealt with Dr Kennedy's evidence.

The applicant having failed to make out the errors of law that he sought to establish on the part of the AAT, the appeal must be dismissed. No reason was advanced, and none appears, why the usual order, that costs follow the event, should not be made. The applicant will therefore be ordered to pay the Minister's costs of the proceeding.

Section 501 of the Migration Act provides relevantly as follows: 
 
 (2) The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test. 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (6) For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (7) For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or 
 
 (d) the person has been sentenced to 2 or more terms of imprisonment (whether on one or more occasions), where the total of those terms is 2 years or more



In relation to the exercise of the discretion to cancel a visa, when a non-citizen does not pass the character test as defined in s 501(6) of the Migration Act , Direction No 21 provides relevantly as follows: 
 
 Weight of considerations 
 
 2.2 The Government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa. In making such a decision, a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations. The primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.3 - 2.16 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.17 - 2.24. Decision-makers must have due regard to the importance placed by the Government on the three primary considerations, but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations. 
 
 PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS
 
 2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations: 
 
 (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community; 
 
 (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and 
 
 (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children. 
 
 Protection of the Australian Community 
 
 ... 
 
 2.5 The factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the entry or continued stay of a non-citizen include: 
 
 (a) the seriousness and nature of the conduct; 
 
 (b) the likelihood that the conduct may be repeated (including any risk of recidivism); and 
 
 (c) whether visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct (general deterrence). 
 
 ... 
 
 2.10 It is the Government's view that the person's previous general conduct and total criminal history are highly relevant to assessing the likelihood of an offence and risk of recidivism. In particular, the following factors will be relevant to the assessment: 
 
 (a) a non-citizen commits a further offence after having been warned previously about the risk of refusal or cancellation; 
 
 (b) a non-citizen with several previous convictions in Australia should be considered as having an increased risk of recidivism in light of that past behaviour. In cases where there is a gap or gaps between convictions, the inference may be open that the non-citizen has demonstrated that a substantial period since an earlier conviction is not a reliable indicator that future offences will not be committed; and 
 
 (c) the extent of rehabilitation already achieved, the prospect of further rehabilitation and the positive contribution to the community the person may reasonably be expected to make.</text>
