<tocase>Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576</tocase>
<text>I understand that the adverse information which the appellants say the Tribunal failed to provide to them in contravention of s 424A(1) of the Act, and which was used to make the decision to reject the application, was information which the appellants provided to the Department when the decision to refuse the visas was made. However, as the first respondent submitted, this information was also provided by the appellants to the Tribunal. This was not disputed by the appellants. As pointed out by Heerey J in VWBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006) FCA 851 at pars 49 and 50: 
 
 'Likewise, if an applicant says to the Tribunal "What I said in my visa application is true" and that application contains fact X, the normal meaning conveyed would be that the applicant is giving the information constituted by fact X to the Tribunal, as well as the further fact that fact X had been asserted by the applicant when he made the visa application. 
 Such a reading of s 424A(1) and (3)(b) would be consistent with common law concepts of natural justice which require the decision-maker to give the person affected notice of relevant information obtained from another source but not, generally speaking, to invite comment on the evaluation of material submitted by the person himself: see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 591-592 and the cases there cited.'</text>

<tocase>SZCJR &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (No 2) [2006] FMCA 640</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2006/640.html</AustLII>
<text>Raphael FM found that there was no jurisdictional error in the way in which the Tribunal formulated its decision. His Honour at par 7 ( SZCJR &amp; Ors v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor (No 2) [2006] FMCA 640) found that the Tribunal's decision in this case was simply one of failure of satisfaction due to the lack of detail in the appellants' submissions.

The appellants sought to appeal to this Court by way of unparticularised notice of appeal filed by the appellants on 18 April 2006. The notice of appeal stated that the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment had not yet been received by the appellant and that grounds would be provided once the judgment was received. The notice of appeal was accepted for filing by the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court.

On 27 July 2006 the Registry contacted the appellants and advised them that grounds of appeal had not been received for filing. The appellants filed a document on 28 July 2006 which outlined their grounds and particulars of appeal. This document was also accepted by the Court. The appellants' grounds of appeal were, inter alia : &#8226; the Tribunal failed to provide the appellants with notice of the adverse information which was used to make the decision to reject the application &#8226; the Tribunal failed to provided the appellants with an opportunity to comment on the country information on India which was used to make the decision to reject the application &#8226; the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with an opportunity to comment on the inconsistencies between the information in the Department's decision and the Tribunal's decision &#8226; there was a denial of natural justice.</text>
