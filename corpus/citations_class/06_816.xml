<text>34 There is one case concerning par (ac). It is Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232. That was an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was therefore limited to questions of law. The decision appears to have been based upon a finding that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had considered irrelevant material in construing the relevant legislative provisions. In those circumstances, the decision can be of little assistance for present purposes.

35 This case depends upon the meaning of the expression "in rail transport". A considerable amount of time was spent in discussing the meaning of the word "in", in my opinion, not a particularly fruitful area of debate. To my mind, the more significant aspect is the word "transport", with any particular connotations that the word "rail" may contribute. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word "transport", used as a noun, to mean:
 
 'transfer or conveyance of property ... the carrying or conveyance of a person or thing from one place to another ... a system or means of transportation or conveyance of people, goods etc ...'

36 The question depends substantially upon whether, in the present context, the word "transport" means the carriage or conveyance of persons or things or the system of transportation or conveyance. The Commissioner advanced the former view. Queensland Rail advanced the latter. The Commissioner submitted that the word "in" connoted such a close association between the use of the diesel fuel and the rail that it could only be satisfied if the usage occurred on the rail. Thus the movement of persons or goods (including Queensland Rail's own equipment) on rail would be included, but loading or unloading a train with loading equipment, which was not on-rail, would not. Similarly, the use of diesel fuel in rail-mounted track maintenance equipment would be included, but such use in non-rail mounted equipment would not.

37 This approach may give too much significance to the word "rail" which is used adjectivally to qualify the word "transport". The preposition "in" governs the noun "transport". In other words the phrase "in rail transport" means "in transport which uses rail".

38 If Parliament had intended that only use of diesel fuel in activities on-rail was to attract the rebate, it would have been easy to say so. Language analogous to the very specific language used for the purpose of excluding the rebate in the case of vehicles used on public roads and use relating to forestry might have been appropriate. Paragraphs (ad), (b), (c) and (d) are "place-specific" and might also have been appropriate models for a requirement that the relevant activity occur "on-rail".</text>
