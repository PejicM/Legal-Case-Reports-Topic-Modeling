<tocase>Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>19 In its written submissions CSR suggested that a document is discoverable if it is "reasonable to suppose" that it "contains information that may not must either directly or indirectly enable the party seeking the affidavit to advance [its] own case or damage that of [its] adversary": Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1991) 30 FCR 1 at 23-4; and that a document will answer that description if it may fairly be expected to lead to a train of enquiry which may have either of those consequences. However, at the hearing of the motion, counsel for CSR conceded that the "train of enquiry" test, articulated in Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55, has now been superseded by O 15 of the Rules. General discovery will not routinely be ordered in every case. Practice Note 14 gives an indication at a practical level of how O 15 may operate. The Practice Note reflects a policy designed to reduce the burden of discovery. It notes that general discovery will not be ordered as a matter of course, and that orders for discovery will usually be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by O 15 r 2(3). O 15 r 2(3) provides that the documents required to be disclosed by a party making discovery are:
 
 (a) documents on which the party relies; and
 (b) documents that adversely affect the party's own case; and
 (c) documents that adversely affect another party's case; and
 (d) documents that support another party's case.</text>

<tocase>Wellcome Foundation Limited v VR Laboratories (Aust) Property Limited [1981] HCA 12 ; (1981) 148 CLR 262</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/12.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In Wellcome Foundation Limited v VR Laboratories (Aust) Proprietary Limited [1981] HCA 12 ; (1981) 148 CLR 262 at 270, Aickin J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said that where the patentability of an invention is challenged on the ground of obviousness:
 
 ... the question of obviousness involves asking the question whether the invention would have been obvious to a non-inventive worker in the field, equipped with the common general knowledge in that particular field as at the priority date, without regard to documents in existence but not part of such common general knowledge. The question is not whether it was or would have been obvious to the inventor or to some other particular worker in the field.

23 It is the common general knowledge in Australia which is material to the question of obviousness and not the common general knowledge in the country of origin: Wellcome Foundation 148 CLR at 284 285. The issue of obviousness "must be judged at the priority date": at 283. It is generally considered appropriate for the patentee to give discovery of its research, development and experimental work in connection with the alleged inventions: Lubrizol Corporation Inc v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (2000) 50 IPR 526 at [22] per Branson J; F Hoffmann-La Roche AG v Chiron Corporation (2000) 171 ALR 295 at 297 per Burchett J; Wellcome Foundation 148 CLR at 287 per Aickin J. Tamberlin J concluded in Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 235 at [7] that the appropriate formulation in relation to discovery of research material is to extend it to research or studies "in the course of which the invention was made".

30 While it accepts that documents relevant to an alleged lack of inventive step and an absence of a manner of manufacture should be confined to those created before the priority date ( Wellcome Foundation ) [1981] HCA 12 ; 148 CLR 262, CSR submitted that no such temporal limitation should be imposed in relation to documents relating to the allegation of false suggestion or misrepresentation. It said that the documents to be discovered should extend to the date of the making of the alleged representations. Those representations were made on 2 and 22 February 1999 and 2 March 1999 (in relation to Rockwool Patent #1) and 9 January 2004 (in relation to Rockwool Patent #2).</text>

<tocase>Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2000/316.html</AustLII>
<text>24 In relation to manner of manufacture, the Full Court decisions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 and Merck &amp; Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2006] FCAFC 91 ; (2006) 154 FCR 31 establish that a party challenging the validity of a patent on this ground must demonstrate such invalidity by reference to matters that are apparent on the face of the specification, in light of the common general knowledge: see also Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Limited [1958] HCA 58 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Limited [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655. Rockwool, relying upon these cases, said it should not be required to discover any documents solely on the ground that they are relevant to the manner of manufacture.

26 Philips [1995] HCA 15 ; 183 CLR 655 was considered by the Full Federal Court in Bristol-Myers [2000] FCA 316 ; 97 FCR 524, where Black CJ and Lehane J said the following in relation to the requirement that a patentable invention be a manner of new manufacture (at [19] and [30]):
 
 A "patentable invention" must be an "invention" as defined, and thus a "manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies " The primary judge held, following NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655, that the opening words of s 18(1) impose a threshold requirement of inventiveness: a requirement independent of the specific provisions of s 18(1)(b) as to novelty and an inventive step, judged by comparison with the prior art base as it existed before the priority date. His Honour held that the claimed invention... did not meet that threshold requirement. He held also that it did not involve an inventive step when compared with the prior art base. His Honour's conclusions were based upon two findings. One of them involved an application of the well known principle which denies patentability to a claimed invention which is "nothing but a claim for the use of a known material in the manufacture of known articles for the purpose of which its known properties make that material suitable": Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Ltd [1958] HCA 58 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232 at 251...
 
 The majority of the High Court in Philips explicitly say that their observations about a case where want of the threshold requirement of inventiveness is not apparent on the face of the specification are not necessary to their decision. And, in discussing the commencement point (what is "known") of the inquiry about inventiveness, their Honours refer only to the Microcell principle. In our view, in the light of the authorities to which we have referred, Philips stands for the proposition (as a matter of construction of the 1990 Act) that if, on the basis of what was known, as revealed on the face of the specification, the invention claimed was obvious or did not involve an inventive step... then the threshold requirement of inventiveness is not met. Some elaboration, however, is required in relation to what the specification reveals as "known". If a patent application, lodged in Australia, refers to information derived from a number of prior publications referred to in the specification or, generally, to matters which are known, in our view the Court or the Commissioner would ordinarily proceed upon the basis that the knowledge thus described is, in the language of s 7(2) of the 1990 Act, part of "the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area". In other words, what is disclosed in such terms may be taken as an admission to that effect. In substance, we think, that is what happened, both in Microcell and in Philips . If, however, the body of prior knowledge disclosed by the specification is insufficient to deprive what is claimed of the quality of inventiveness, then the only additional knowledge or information which will be taken into account is knowledge or information of a kind described in s 7(2) of the 1990 Act. That again, in our view, is consistent with the approach taken in Microcell.

39 It said that in light of the decisions in Bristol-Myers [2000] FCA 316 ; 97 FCR 524 and Merck [2006] FCAFC 91 ; 154 FCR 31, any documents relating to Rockwool's internal research programs, particularly on fibre types other than the HT fibres the subject of the Rockwool patents, cannot be relevant to the issue of manner of manufacture.</text>

<text>24 In relation to manner of manufacture, the Full Court decisions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v FH Faulding [2000] FCA 316 ; (2000) 97 FCR 524 and Merck &amp; Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2006] FCAFC 91 ; (2006) 154 FCR 31 establish that a party challenging the validity of a patent on this ground must demonstrate such invalidity by reference to matters that are apparent on the face of the specification, in light of the common general knowledge: see also Commissioner of Patents v Microcell Limited [1958] HCA 58 ; (1959) 102 CLR 232; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Limited [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655. Rockwool, relying upon these cases, said it should not be required to discover any documents solely on the ground that they are relevant to the manner of manufacture.

25 CSR sought to distinguish those authorities on the ground that they were not concerned with an alleged non-disclosure of relevant material; and because despite the principle established in the cases, in practice the courts can and do refer to external evidence to consider the state of the prior art. In particular, it referred to Philips 183 CLR at 666-667, where the majority of the High Court stated that
 
 Strictly speaking, it is unnecessary to answer the question whether a process which could not be a proper subject matter for a patent according to traditional principle, for the reason that it is merely a new use of a known product, can none the less be a "manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies" for the purposes of s 18(1)(a). However...it is appropriate that we indicate that we consider that the above construction of s 18(1)'s threshold requirement of "an invention" goes a long way towards answering it since it would border upon the irrational if a process which was in fact but a new use of an old substance could be a "patentable invention" under s 18 if, but only if, that fact were not disclosed by the specification.

26 Philips [1995] HCA 15 ; 183 CLR 655 was considered by the Full Federal Court in Bristol-Myers [2000] FCA 316 ; 97 FCR 524, where Black CJ and Lehane J said the following in relation to the requirement that a patentable invention be a manner of new manufacture (at [19] and [30]):

 The majority of the High Court in Philips explicitly say that their observations about a case where want of the threshold requirement of inventiveness is not apparent on the face of the specification are not necessary to their decision. And, in discussing the commencement point (what is "known") of the inquiry about inventiveness, their Honours refer only to the Microcell principle.

That again, in our view, is consistent with the approach taken in Microcell.

27 Their Honours said in their reasons at [22] of the passage in Philips [1995] HCA 15 ; 183 CLR 655 quoted above and relied upon by CSR, that that observation was unnecessary to the decision, a fact which was acknowledged by the majority of the High Court at 666.</text>

<tocase>Conor Medsystems Inc v University of British Columbia (No 3) (2006) 228 ALR 515</tocase>
<text>29 The sufficiency of a patent has been described as "a pure question of fact in respect of which there may be discovery": Conor Medsystems Inc v University of British Columbia (No 3) (2006) 228 ALR 515 at [4].

31 In Hoffman-La Roche 171 ALR at [11], Burchett J expressed the view that discovery of research documents "for a reasonable period beyond [the priority] date" may be justified where sufficiency of description is in issue, so long as the research is related to the disclosure contained in the specification. His Honour considered it unnecessary to decide whether an allegation of misrepresentation would provide a further ground for such discovery. However the Full Federal Court in Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co (2005) 225 ALR 416 held that sufficiency should be assessed having regard to the common general knowledge and prior art existing immediately before the priority date: at [328], cited in Conor 228 ALR [4]. The parties did not address this particular issue in their submissions on the present motion. In relation to the issue of false suggestion, CSR sought to rely upon certain observations made by Emmett J in ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc (1999) 45 IPR 577. That case was not concerned with issues of discovery; nevertheless CSR asserted that Emmett J's reasoning supports their application insofar as his Honour found that the relevant section of the Patents Act was concerned with statements of fact about which the applicant (for the patent) had knowledge and about which the Patent Office ordinarily would not (at [184]); and that it is not necessary to show that no grant would have been made "but for" the false suggestion or representation, so long as the representation was a "material inducing factor which led to the grant": at [170]. It is not immediately apparent how those passages assist CSR beyond the wording of s 138 itself.</text>

His Honour considered it unnecessary to decide whether an allegation of misrepresentation would provide a further ground for such discovery. However the Full Federal Court in Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly and Co (2005) 225 ALR 416 held that sufficiency should be assessed having regard to the common general knowledge and prior art existing immediately before the priority date: at [328], cited in Conor 228 ALR [4]. The parties did not address this particular issue in their submissions on the present motion. In relation to the issue of false suggestion, CSR sought to rely upon certain observations made by Emmett J in ICI Chemicals and Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc (1999) 45 IPR 577. That case was not concerned with issues of discovery; nevertheless CSR asserted that Emmett J's reasoning supports their application insofar as his Honour found that the relevant section of the Patents Act was concerned with statements of fact about which the applicant (for the patent) had knowledge and about which the Patent Office ordinarily would not (at [184]); and that it is not necessary to show that no grant would have been made "but for" the false suggestion or representation, so long as the representation was a "material inducing factor which led to the grant": at [170]. It is not immediately apparent how those passages assist CSR beyond the wording of s 138 itself.</text>

<text>55 CSR referred to several authorities indicating that the Category 9 documents are not protected from disclosure by the doctrine of legal professional privilege: see, e.g. Eli Lilly and Company v Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals [2004] FCA 850 ; (2004) 137 FCR 573. However, those authorities do not assist CSR in relation to the question of relevance. Furthermore, even if the Category 9 documents were privileged, such privilege would not relieve Rockwool of any obligation to provide discovery of them.</text>

<text>56 It is convenient to deal with Categories 1 to 4 of the claimed further discovery together, as they fall under the general rubric of Project Sleipner activities. I am not persuaded that the documents in respect of which further discovery is sought in those four categories are documents which fall within the reach of O 15 r 2(3) of the Rules. There is no material which, to my mind, reveals that Rockwool has not addressed in its discovery the prior art directly relevant to the assertion that the alleged inventions are not novel. Indeed, as I understood the submissions for CSR, the dispute arises because it claims that an incorrect assessment has been made by Rockwool about the materiality of the documents in Categories 1 to 4 rather than that their relevance has not been assessed at all by Rockwool. Of course, Rockwool's assessment of the extent to which such documents should be discovered is not conclusive. That is a matter for the Court. But, on the other hand, the existence of a document or documents which possibly touch upon an issue in question in the proceeding is not itself sufficient to order its discovery: Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 344 345. That is a matter to be decided by the Court from the pleadings and the evidence on the application.</text>

<text>57 The class of the first category of documents, in my view, is not, by its description or by such information as there is as to its likely contents, of such a nature as to satisfy the "relevance" hurdle of O 15 r 2(3). The conferences and meetings referred to, and including the presentations by an employee or employees of Rockwool in April 1994 and in September 1992, are obviously not confined to the product claims concerning MMV fibres in Rockwool Patent #1 or the method of producing MMV fibres in Rockwool Patent #2. The fact that, at such conferences and meetings, there would have been information sharing between informed persons in the general industry does not indicate or tend to indicate that the information included information about the prior art concerning or leading up to the particular claims made in the two patents. Accordingly, I do not consider that there is a prima facie case that the conferences and meetings included in the exposure of information concerning whether the claimed inventions the subject of those patents involved an inventive step compared to the prior art. It is a case of the material relied upon by CSR not taking me over that threshold test. See the discussion by Tomlin J in Astra-National Productions Ltd v Neo-Art Productions Ltd [1928] WN 218 at 219.

58 That conclusion reflects the view I have come to, notwithstanding the careful and helpful submissions of senior counsel for CSR, that discovery in this matter should be confined to documents which relate directly to the particular issues concerning the validity of the two Rockwool patents in suit, and that wider inquiry of material concerning Project Sleipner generally or relating to other fibres or processes than the particular products and process the subject of the two patents will not expose documents which fall within the coverage of O 15 r 2(3) of the Rules.

59 I have reached the same conclusion in relation to the Category 1 documents, insofar as CSR contended that they may expose that the claimed characteristics of elements of the Rockwool Patents were previously well known and recognised by manufacturers of MMV fibres, so that documents of that class may support CSR's third ground of alleged invalidity. It is necessary for a prima facie case to be made out that the category of documents sought to be discovered, including of the two particular presentations specified, may adversely affect the case of Rockwool or may support the case of CSR. I am not satisfied that they might do so.</text>
