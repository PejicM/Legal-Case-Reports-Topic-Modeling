<tocase>Edelsten v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) &amp; Ors (1989) 86 ALR 257</tocase>
<text>12 It is said that such a purpose on the part of the respondent, in giving an authority to Nicholas Eddy under s 188 of the Act, 'is foreign to the bankruptcy laws': Edelsten v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) &amp; Ors (1989) 86 ALR 257 at 261.

13 The difficulty I have with this argument is that subs 188(1) of the Act is predicated on the following basis:
 
 'A debtor who desires that his or her affairs be dealt with under this Part without his or her estate being sequestrated ...'

14 In other words, the outcome upon which the applicant relies as an abuse of process, namely, the avoidance of sequestration of the respondent's estate, is the very basis upon which an authority under subs 188(1) is predicated. If a debtor has a desire that his or her affairs be dealt with under Part X without his or her estate being sequestrated and that is his only purpose in giving an authority of the kind to which that section provides, that cannot be a purpose which is 'foreign to the bankruptcy laws'. Indeed, it is a purpose which is contemplated by such laws.</text>
