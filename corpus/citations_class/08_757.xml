<text>37 The grounds in a notice of appeal from the Tribunal "would properly assume the resolution of the question of law in favour of the applicant": Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 524 per Ryan J. Such grounds should show "the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal": Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at [18] per Branson and Stone JJ (with whom Marshall J at [61] agreed).</text>

<tocase>Brennan v Comcare (1994) 50 FCR 555</tocase>
<text>2 Under s 24 of the 1988 Act, Comcare is liable to pay compensation to an employee where they suffer an injury that results in permanent impairment. Section 124 is a transitional provision setting out the compensation payable under the 1998 Act in respect of impairment occurring prior to its commencement. Section 124(3) provides that a person is not entitled to compensation under s 24 of the 1988 Act in respect of a permanent impairment where there was no entitlement to receive lump sum compensation under the legislation in force at the time the impairment occurred. Under the previous legislation relevant to the applicant, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth) (the 1971 Act), no lump sum compensation was payable for permanent loss arising from a psychiatric condition because such a condition was not among the various forms of "loss", such as loss of hearing or loss of an arm at or above the elbow, specified in s 39. It was thus accepted that the applicant's impairment, once it had become permanent, would be compensable by way of lump sum under the 1988 Act but not the 1971 Act. The time at which the applicant's impairment became permanent and the legislation in force at the time therefore determines whether the applicant is entitled to compensation: Brennan v Comcare (1994) 50 FCR 555 at 570.

3 An impairment is permanent if it is likely to continue indefinitely: 1988 Act, s 4. That state of affairs must have been reached before the commencement date of the 1988 Act for s 124(3) to apply: Brennan v Comcare at 570. In the present case, the degree of the applicant's impairment was not in issue. It would be a matter for primary assessment by Comcare in the event of the applicant succeeding on this appeal.

4 Comcare submitted to the Tribunal that the applicant's condition had become permanent before 1 December 1988 and had not deteriorated or become worse thereafter so as to provide a basis for a claim based on a new impairment.

5 The applicant is aged 52. From the age of 19 she worked in a clerical position with the Commonwealth Public Service. In 1981 she transferred to the Social Security branch office at Glenorchy working in clerical and counter duties. Later she was promoted to a position involving regular face to face contact with benefit recipients and applicants. From time to time some of these individuals became stressed and angry and would be abusive and threatening. Sometimes such individuals recognised the applicant when she was away from the office and would insult her and behave offensively.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Levett (1995) 60 FCR 14</tocase>
<text>43 Counsel for the applicant referred to Comcare v Levett (1995) 60 FCR 14 at [18]-[19]. In that case the employee had suffered a compensable injury to his back before 1 December 1988 which resulted in impairment, but not a permanent impairment. After that date the impairment became permanent. The Full Court held that he was not excluded from receiving compensation by s 124(3).

44 Counsel for the applicant contended that, by a parity of reasoning, the same result would follow if the applicant's injury was not permanent before the relevant date, improved thereafter, but still later became worse and permanent. Counsel pointed to Dr Sale's opinion already noted that in his examination in 1990 the applicant was not incapacitated for work. Counsel said that it was "a startling non sequitur" that since the applicant was permanently impaired in 2007 she must have been permanently impaired on 1 December 1988 even though she was not impaired in 1990. This arose, counsel said, from confusion between the concepts of injury and impairment. Section 24(2)(b) of the 1988 Act requires, for the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent, regard to be had to the likelihood of an improvement. Therefore it is not possible to say with the benefit of hindsight that because the worker is now impaired she must have been always impaired.

45 However, as previously noted, the impairment must have been permanent, that is to say likely to continue indefinitely, and that state of affairs must have been reached before the commencement date of the 1988 Act, if the applicant is to be excluded from lump sum compensation under that Act.</text>

<tocase>Hope v City of Bathurst [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/16.html</AustLII>
<text>35 On its face the notice of appeal does raise a question of law as required by s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). Whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statute properly construed is usually a question of law: Hope v City of Bathurst [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7. The formal requirement for a notice of appeal specified in O 53 r 3(2)(b) of the Federal Court Rules has been satisfied.</text>

<text>36 However, as noted by Gummow J in TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178, in comparing the requirements of s 44 with the former provisions for appeals to the Taxation Board of Review:
 The existence of a question of law is now not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal, but also the subject matter of the appeal itself...</text>
