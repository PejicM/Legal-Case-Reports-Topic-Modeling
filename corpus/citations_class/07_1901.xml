<tocase>Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1999/14.html</AustLII>
<text>45 In any event, if the Tribunal wrongly assumed that the letter did not contain Rashed Khan Menon's telephone number that was not a jurisdictional error but an error made within jurisdiction. An error of fact made by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction is not a jurisdictional error. An error of that kind does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to quash the decision: Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] .

46 In my opinion, the Tribunal was entitled in this review to take the view that it would not know to whom it was speaking if it were to make the telephone calls. In those circumstances, the Tribunal would have had difficulty attaching much weight to the evidence, even if that evidence was obtained. Moreover, it was never made clear to the Tribunal what evidence it was required to obtain, if possible, from the two witnesses.

47 The appellant provided written submissions in support of the appeal and in both those submissions and orally before me, the appellant asserted that the Tribunal had erred under s 424A due to the inclusion of incorrect factual material in the s 424A letter it sent.</text>

<text>44 That said, however, the Tribunal must, when requested so to do by an applicant, give genuine consideration to the request. That requires consideration of the evidence that is sought to be led, the person by whom the evidence is to be given, the current state of the evidence before the Tribunal and the potential impact that the evidence, if accepted, might have on the applicant's claims. Otherwise, the Tribunal would not be providing the applicant with a fair hearing which would demonstrate jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304. In this case, the Tribunal was not aware that it had Rashed Khan Menon's telephone number and address. It cannot be criticised for not knowing that. The Tribunal was entitled to reason, having regard to the appellant's own evidence and the evidence of his three witnesses, that any further evidence would be of no assistance and not be capable of corroborating the unsatisfactory evidence already received: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 per McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49]; WADU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1252 at [45] .

50 In any event, this Court has no jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal or interfere with any findings of fact made by the Tribunal, even if those findings are wrong: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36 per Brennan J; Appellant S106/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 61-62 per Gleeson CJ and at 85-86 per Kirby J.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>36 It found that the information contained in the reference letters was exempt from s 424A(1) of the Act and the information provided by the appellant: s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. In any event, it was not information in the light of SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26.

37 Two grounds of appeal are raised. First, it is said that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by the Tribunal failing to obtain evidence from two named persons. Secondly, it is said, the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not providing the applicant with particulars of the information the Tribunal considered was a reasonable part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision, contrary to s 424A of the Act. The notice of appeal does not particularise the information which the Tribunal failed to provide under that section.

38 The Tribunal said in its decision:
 
 At the hearing the applicant provided the names of two of these letter writers, Showkat Hossain Hiron and Rashed Khan Menon, as witnesses who the Tribunal could contact. He provided telephone numbers, apparently in Bangladesh, for this purpose. In view of the strong concerns about the evidence provided by other witnesses at the hearing, noted below, and the obvious inability to positively identify those two persons simply by the telephone numbers provided (none of which appear on the letters written by them despite the fact that such letters are on the official party letterhead) I am not satisfied that the Tribunal should attempt to obtain further evidence directly from them.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/763.html</AustLII>
<text>43 It is clear from the Tribunal's reasons that it had regard to the appellant's request or wishes to take evidence from the two witnesses. It gave reasons why it declined to do so. I agree, with respect, with Stone J who said in SZDMC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 763 at [49] :
 
 Section 426 makes it quite clear that the Tribunal is not obliged to grant a review applicant's request that a witness be called to give evidence even where the request is made in accordance with the statutory procedure. That being so, there was no breach of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule as set out in Div 4 of Pt 7 arising from the Tribunal's failure to make arrangements to hear [a witness] at some other time.</text>
