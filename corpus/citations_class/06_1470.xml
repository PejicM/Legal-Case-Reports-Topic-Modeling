<text>15 An allegation of bias raises a serious issue and must be founded on facts sufficient to give rise to the inference: see SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749. Smith FM relied upon the decision in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte H (2001) 179 ALR 425; [2001] HCA 28 in which the High Court held that the apprehended bias must be determined by an objective standard of a fair minded lay observer. Applying such test Smith FM was unable to conclude that any bias existed as claimed. The Court considers that Smith FM was entitled to make the finding above on the evidence before him.</text>

<tocase>SAAP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>23 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed. The Court notes that consistent with the High Court's decision in SAAP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, the Refugee Review Tribunal should be joined as a second respondent.

24 The first respondent seeks an order that its costs be paid in the sum of $2400. As this quantum is in the range of costs which is realistic, the Court will make such order.
 

I certify that the preceding twenty four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Cowdroy.
