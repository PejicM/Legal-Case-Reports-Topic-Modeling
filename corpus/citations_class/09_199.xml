<tocase>Godley v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 83 ALD 411</tocase>
<text>The next ground is that the fifth sentence of the passage quoted at [11] disregards the precept that "continuing conduct must be demonstrated that shows a lack of enduring moral quality". That is a quotation from the reasons of Lee J in Godley v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 83 ALD 411 ( Godley ) at [56], approved on appeal in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Godley [2005] FCAFC 10 ; (2005) 141 FCR 552 at [34] . The whole passage is as follows: 
 Before past and present general conduct may be taken to reveal indicia that a visa applicant is not of good character continuing conduct must be demonstrated that shows a lack of enduring moral quality. Although in some circumstances isolated elements of conduct may be significant and display lack of moral worth they will be rare, and as with consideration of criminal conduct there must be due regard given to recent good conduct. 

 
The applicant contends that there is no continuing conduct of the kind of which Mr Selimi was guilty previously.

The third ground attacks the passage in the Tribunal's reasons set out at [12] above ([22] of the Tribunal's reasons). Reliance is placed on another passage from Lee J's judgment in Godley (2004) 83 ALD 411 , also approved by the Full Court. His Honour said at [77]: 
 A provision such as that contained in s 501(6)(c) is not concerned with weaknesses or blemishes in character but with ensuring that the power to refuse a visa by reference to quality of character of a visa applicant is only provided to the minister when it is demonstrable that the visa applicant is not of good character thereby giving sufficient cause for the minister to determine whether the degree of absence of good character is such that it would be clearly in the interests of the Australian community to refuse entry to that person ... 

 
This passage is preceded by an elaborate examination of matters relied upon by the Minister, which Lee J generally characterised at [77] as weaknesses or blemishes in character which in his view did not justify a conclusion that Mr Godley was a person not of good character. The matters included insignificant traffic offences, offences that were "non-informative" as to whether he was a person not of good character, a failure to disclose something influenced by his need to obtain earnings as a husband as much as by any innate defect in character, a matter of which his Honour said it was difficult to see how it could have been used by the Minister to determine bad character, and a matter that in terms of assessing a person's enduring moral quality was described as trivial. It was this catalogue of incidents that Lee J characterised as mere weaknesses or blemishes in character falling short of demonstrating that Mr Godley was not of good character. His Honour went on to hold that the Minister's reasons, which relied on the catalogue of incidents, showed that he did not apply his mind to the threshold question required to be determined under s 501(6)(c) , namely whether he could find as a fact that Mr Godley was a person not of good character.

The present case is quite different from Godley (2004) 83 ALD 411. What Lee J there described as "weaknesses or blemishes in character" were trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character. The matters the Tribunal in the present case so described were not of that nature. Paragraph [22] of the Tribunal's reasons begins: "If not already apparent, I cannot find Mr Selimi has enduring moral qualities ". This refers to the incidents recorded elsewhere in the reasons, especially in [21]. The offences of which he was convicted, his conduct in relation to the claim for a protection visa, making or allowing to be made false statements for many years intended to conceal that his marriage was a sham, and his recent false evidence at the Tribunal hearing, were not trivial or uninformative matters that Lee J described in globo as "weaknesses or blemishes in character". They were serious matters that went to the core of whether Mr Selimi was a person not of good character. The Tribunal twice referred to the offences as "serious". It also stressed "the gravity and extent" of the past criminal and general conduct. It noted that in the Direction the Minister regarded serious crimes against the Act as being "very serious". In those circumstances the Tribunal's conclusion that it could not find that Mr Selimi had enduring moral qualities would, but for the balance of the sentence at [22], be unassailable. The "enduring moral qualities" test applied by the Tribunal is endorsed by Full Courts in Irving v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1996) 68 FCR 422 at 431 and Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1277 at [8] , to which the Tribunal referred, and by Full Courts in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 and Godley [2005] FCAFC 10 ; (2005) 141 FCR 552 at [35] , to which it did not refer.

What seems to have happened at [22] is that the Tribunal has taken "enduring moral qualities" from Irving and Goldie and has assimilated those qualities with "weaknesses or blemishes in character". Irving and Goldie were of course contrasting those characteristics. However, despite this slip, it is clear from a reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole that it regarded Mr Selimi's conduct as serious, grave and extended, and concluded that he did not have enduring moral qualities. That the Tribunal used "weaknesses or blemishes in character" as a general description of that conduct does not mean that it regarded it as trivial or uninformative of true character. The expression "infractions ... that show weaknesses or blemishes" should, in the context of the whole of the Tribunal's reasons, be understood as "weaknesses or blemishes in character of a serious nature", which, taken together with the fact that Mr Selimi lied to Departmental officers and gave false evidence to the Tribunal, demonstrated an absence of enduring moral qualities and thus an absence of good character. It is important to understand that the Tribunal was not strictly wrong in calling Mr Selimi's infractions "weaknesses or blemishes in character". They did have that quality. The description only seems to understate the seriousness of the infractions because it was used in Godley (2004) 83 ALD 411 to describe trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character.

When the passage from Godley (2004) 83 ALD 411 set out at [22] above is read in the context of the facts of that case, it is seen that it provides no assistance to the applicant's third ground.

For the avoidance of doubt I should record that the document described as "Application for an order to show cause" has a fourth ground. However, it appears to be an amalgam of the first and second grounds, and is disposed of by what I have said about them.

None of the grounds having been made out, the application must be dismissed.
 I certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sundberg.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>I have referred at [13] and [14] to the Tribunal's observations about Mr Selimi's evidence at the hearing on 21 May 2008. This confirmed for the Tribunal the continuing nature of Mr Selimi's unsatisfactory moral qualities, and that his behaviour had not changed sufficiently since he engaged in his previous temporally extended criminal and generally dishonest behaviour. I do not accept the applicant's submission that reliance cannot be placed on these observations because they were made in the course of considering the discretionary issue. The Tribunal's reasons must be considered in full in order to determine whether it committed reviewable error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 291. The Tribunal did not fail to consider Mr Selimi's continuing conduct.</text>

<tocase>Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1277</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1277.html</AustLII>
<text>At [22] the Tribunal said: 
 If not already apparent, I cannot find Mr Selimi has enduring moral qualities ; he has committed infractions . . . that show weaknesses or blemishes in character and he is a person who lied to officers of the respondent thereby demonstrating an absence of good character (refer Irving v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1996] FCA 1660 ; Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1277 ; Re Lachmaiya and Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1994] AATA 27 ; (1994) 19 AAR 148).

The Tribunal then turned to the discretionary considerations in Part 2 of the Direction. After considering the three primary considerations and the "other" considerations, it concluded that the discretion should be exercised in favour of a refusal of the visa. I do not need to record the Tribunal's reasoning process in this connection, because its treatment of the discretionary matters was not attacked. It is however necessary to note some findings of fact made in the course of this part of the Tribunal's reasons. At [12] of its reasons the Tribunal recorded Mr Selimi's oral evidence about the Court proceedings referred to at [8]-[9] above. He told the Tribunal he did not know the purpose for his appearance there, but understood that it had something to do with the issue to him of a visa. He could not remember whether he had an interpreter assisting him. He did not understand the proceedings. He could not remember whether he gave evidence or whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. He said that at the conclusion of the proceedings his solicitor told him that "everything was alright". He did not discover that he had been convicted until the present application was made.

At [32] of its reasons, in the course of dealing with discretionary considerations, the Tribunal said: 
 I am satisfied and find as a fact that Mr Selimi did understand the nature of the proceedings, that he did plead not guilty, that he did give evidence and that the allegations against him were properly interpreted. His denial throughout the hearing of this application of his understanding of the proceedings at Dandenong Magistrates' Court and his memory of it does him no credit.

The present case is quite different from Godley (2004) 83 ALD 411. What Lee J there described as "weaknesses or blemishes in character" were trivial matters and matters uninformative as to whether Mr Godley was not of good character. The matters the Tribunal in the present case so described were not of that nature. Paragraph [22] of the Tribunal's reasons begins: "If not already apparent, I cannot find Mr Selimi has enduring moral qualities ".
