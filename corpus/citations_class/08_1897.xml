<tocase>Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/27.html</AustLII>
<text>20 When exercising the discretion, the Court is required to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated that his appeal may have sufficient prospects of success to make it just that he should be allowed to proceed. When considering prospects of success, at least two considerations have to be addressed, namely: what is the standard against which prospects are to be judged, and how is that assessment to be made. In SZJDS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 1093 , Reeves J helpfully reviewed the authorities and set out his conclusion as follows:
 [21] ... there are a number of decisions of this Court, including the Full Court, that require me to consider the applicant's prospects of successfully prosecuting his appeal, before exercising my discretion to grant leave to file the appeal out of time... [22] The questions which then arise are: how rigorous should that assessment be; what standard should apply to it; and how closely should the applicant's prospects of success be examined? The appropriate standard has been expressed in different ways and in different circumstances. In Jess the Full Court does not seem to have mentioned any requirement to assess the applicant's prospects of success in the appeal. This is probably explained by the view the Court expressed early in its reasons that: "there is no suggestion that the appeal is sought to be maintained mala fide or upon slight or foolish grounds" (at p 3). However, their Honours did emphasise the need for flexibility to accommodate the range of situations that may arise when they said: 
 
 ... the 'special reasons' relevant to such a power cannot but describe an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period. It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after, for example, a year; equally, it may be said, something much less significant might justify leave where a party is a few days late.
 
 

His Honour then set forth the authorities, including Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516 , and continued:
 [30] Taking all these decisions into account, particularly the High Court Decision of Jackamarra, I consider the standard that should be applied in an application of this kind to the assessment of the applicant's prospects of success in the appeal, is similar to that to be applied in an application for summary dismissal. That is, unless the appeal is shown to have no reasonable prospects in the sense that it is devoid of merits or will clearly fail, or is hopeless or unarguable, leave should be granted. [31] There remains the question: how closely should the applicant's prospects of success on the appeal be examined? The answer to that question was provided in Jackamarra. There the High Court said the consideration of an application of this kind should not go into much detail on the merits and can only assess the merits in a fairly rough and ready way: see [9] per Brennan CJ and McHugh J and [66.4] per Kirby J. 
This is the approach pursued in the present Application .</text>

<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>13 The requirement imposed by Rule 15(2) that there be " special reasons " is a requirement imposing a flexible discretionary power: Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187. Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ there observed at 195 :
 It is useful to consider the meaning and application of r 15(2) against a background of an understanding of how other courts have applied corresponding rules. But in the end, this Court must construe and apply the terms of its own rule. The question is what that rule means, and how it is to be applied to the circumstances of the case. It is clear that the rule reflects the same general structure exemplified by the various decisions we have discussed -- the provision of a time for lodgment of an appeal, but the provision also of a discretion to permit an appeal out of time where it is shown that the circumstances warrant the exercise of that discretion. As Lord Guest, speaking for the Privy Council, put it in Ratnam v Cumarasamy [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12: 
 
 "The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken, there must be some material on which the court can exercise its discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the rules which is to provide a time table for the conduct of litigation."
 
 
What is needed to justify an extension of time is indicated in r 15(2) by the words "for special reasons". It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days. In that context, the expression "special reasons" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression "for special reasons" implies something narrower than this. 
The discretion to extend time is given for the purpose of enabling the Court to do justice between the parties: WAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 399 at [7] per Lee, Nicholson and Finkelstein JJ.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/9.html</AustLII>
<text>15 It may not be an appropriate exercise of discretion to extend time, however, where a satisfactory explanation has not been provided for the whole of the delay: QAAH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZKSM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 632 at [20] . In the present Application , that for which there has been no explanation, or no satisfactory explanation, is such delay as occurred after 6 June 2008. A two-month delay after that date is largely unexplained; and following a friend to Queensland and thereby occasioning a further two-month delay falls well short of " special reason ". And during that period the present Applicant was well aware that her Application was already out of time.</text>

<text>23 Notwithstanding the absence of any real assistance from the Applicant, the Federal Magistrate proceeded to review the available grounds. There was certainly no procedural unfairness in the Federal Magistrate taking that course. And, as noted in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 , 228 CLR 152: 
 [25] ... what is required by procedural fairness is a fair hearing, not a fair outcome. ...

<text>16 Every case must individually be considered. Subject to that necessary qualification, the present case is comparable in some respects to SZGQM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 899 where an extension of time of one week was refused in circumstances where the explanation provided by the applicant was that he had " forgot about it ".

17 Compliance with the Rules of Court, including the times within which applications are to be made, is normally to be expected.

18 No reason is shown in the present proceeding to extend the time by some 4 months.</text>
