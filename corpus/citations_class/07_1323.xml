<tocase>Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson (2007) 14 ANZ Insurance Cases 90-127 </tocase>
<text>35 In general terms, Mr Samaras contended that it was unnecessary for him to identify an illness or illnesses attached to his period of employment with the ATC and that the question for the Insurer and the Trustee was whether, at the time of their respective decisions, there was any illness or illnesses that cumulatively resulted in Mr Samaras being unlikely to ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. Mr Samaras sought to support his construction of the definition by reference to the decision of Jessup J in Auspine Staff Superannuation Pty Ltd v Henderson (2007) 14 ANZ Insurance Cases 90-127 at [63] and [64].

36 For the reasons that follow, I reject Mr Samaras' construction of the definition of TPD. The definition contained two limbs. Both had to be satisfied. The first limb required that the 'disablement' occurred while the insured was a member: see definition of TPD in [24] above. To satisfy the first limb of the definition of TPD, Mr Samaras had to be less than 60 years of age, the disablement had to exist no later than 30 days after he ceased employment with ATC and result from an illness, accident or injury that resulted in him being continuously absent from his employment for at least 6 consecutive months. That limb of the definition required identification of the illness or illnesses suffered by Mr Samaras no later than 30 days after he ceased employment with ATC and which resulted in him being absent from work for at least 6 consecutive months.

37 If an illness or illnesses of the kind described could be identified, then the second limb of the test becomes relevant - consideration of medical and other evidence to determine whether it was unlikely that Mr Samaras would ever be able to engage in any regular remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. This second limb requires consideration of medical and other evidence limited to the illness or illnesses identified under the first limb but not limited in time to the period prior to the cessation of Mr Samaras' employment. The Insurer and the Trustee were required to consider the medical evidence that existed at the time of their decisions, namely June 2005 and August 2005.

38 Moreover, the decision of Jessup J in Auspine Staff Superannuation did not support Mr Samaras' construction of the definition of TPD. The first point of difference is that the definition of TPD in that case was different. Not substantially different, but different. Secondly, even taking into account the differences in language between the definitions of TPD, there is nothing in the reasons for decision of Jessup J which suggested that the insurer in that case was to ignore the requirement that the disablement was to have occurred " while he [was] in the active service of the Employer ". Such a contention ignored the express words of the definition of TPD in that case and para [63] of his Honour's reasons for decision.

39 Against that background, I turn to consider Mr Samaras' various grounds of appeal to the extent to which I have not already dealt with them in considering the proper construction of the definition of TPD.

40 This ground of appeal should be dismissed.

56 In addition, it cannot be said that the Tribunal made a determination adverse to Mr Samaras' interests without giving him a reasonable opportunity to make written submissions to the Tribunal on the approach that it was contemplating: Auspine at [57] and the authorities cited. Mr Samaras, in fact, lodged 6 written submissions comprising more than 100 pages. As the Tribunal stated:
 
 
 "[Mr Samaras] provided over 100 pages of submissions in which he broadly argued that the Trustee and the Insurer chose irrelevant medical history and issues involving the relationship with his employer as the basis of their decision to decline his TPD application. He asked that the Tribunal confine itself to his ongoing health issues." 
 
 

The substance of those submissions was then summarised by the Tribunal.

57 After receiving those written submissions from Mr Samaras, the Tribunal contacted Mr Samaras on 15 May 2006 and asked him for his response submission. Mr Samaras told an officer attached to the Tribunal that he did not wish to provide a response submission and relied upon the material he had already provided to the Tribunal. This ground of appeal is dismissed.

58 Mr Samaras contended that the Tribunal, in denying Mr Samaras an opportunity to make an oral submission, " made a determination adverse to the interests of Mr Samaras to that review without giving him a reasonable opportunity and in effect denied him procedural fairness." In general terms, Mr Samaras submitted that he did not understand how the Tribunal's processes worked and, in particular, did not understand the gravity or implications of the comments about the credit of Mr Samaras made by a number of medical practitioners whose medical reports were before the Tribunal. 
 
This ground of appeal raises similar grounds to Ground (g) and should be dismissed on the same bases. Moreover, the substance of Mr Samaras' complaints arose not from the manner in which the Tribunal dealt with the matter but the fact that he did not agree with comments made by some medical practitioners about the inconsistencies in his behaviour and that he was, in the words of one doctor, " economical with the truth ". The medical reports had been provided to Mr Samaras. He was aware of them, able to comment upon and did comment upon them in the written submissions he provided to the Tribunal. The failure to provide Mr Samaras an oral hearing did not amount to a denial of procedural fairness.</text>

<tocase>Cameron v Board of Trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme [2003] FCAFC 214 ; (2003) 130 FCR 122</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/214.html</AustLII>
<text>19 Under the SCT Act , the question for the Tribunal was whether, from the Trustee's perspective, the decisions of the Trustee and the Insurer were "fair and reasonable in the circumstances" in their operation in relation to Mr Samaras having regard to the governing rules and terms of the Deed: ss 37(5) and (6) of the SCT Act ; Cameron v Board of Trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme [2003] FCAFC 214 ; (2003) 130 FCR 122 at [38] - [43] ; National Mutual Life Association of Australia Ltd v Campbell [2000] FCA 852 ; (2000) 99 FCR 562 at [32] to [37]; Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Ltd v Crocker (2001) 48 ATR 359 at [31] and Marks v CSS Board of Trustees [2005] FCA 797.</text>

<tocase>Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280</tocase>
<text>21 The Tribunal's reasons " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. They are to be read fairly as a whole and not over zealously: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. Moreover, the reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues: cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38 at 52-53.

43 Mr Samaras also sought to challenge the TPD test applied by the Trustee. He asserted that the Tribunal misapplied the test when it affirmed the decision of the Trustee. That complaint is, in my view, to be rejected for at least two reasons. First, it ignores the fact that the Tribunal properly described and applied the test as outlined in [41] above. Secondly, Mr Samaras misunderstood the Tribunal's reasons for decision and, in particular, sought to take one sentence of the reasons out of context. The Tribunal's reasons " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Pozzolanic at 287. They are to be read fairly as a whole and not over zealously: Wu Shan Liang at 271-272. Although the Tribunal did refer to the fact that the Trustee advised Mr Samaras that his TPD claim had been declined " on the basis that the overall medical evidence [did] not indicate that [he] would be unable to return to the employment for which [he was] fitted by education, training and experience " and that there was no evidence of substantial and irrecoverable pathology, the Tribunal did so in the context of refuting an allegation that there was no evidence to support the claim that the Trustee had failed to make its own assessment about whether Mr Samaras was TPD as defined. It is neither appropriate nor possible to read the Tribunal's reasons for decision in the manner suggested by Mr Samaras.</text>

<tocase>Davis v Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 376 ; (2002) 118 FCR 170</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/376.html</AustLII>
<text>18 It was common ground for the purposes of this appeal that:
 
 (1) the Tribunal was not required or indeed permitted to determine whether the Trustee's decision was the correct or preferable one or whether Mr Samaras, in its opinion, suffered disablement that came within the Policy or the Deed; and
 (2) the relevant time for the Tribunal to consider Mr Samaras' claim for TPD benefit was the date of the decision of the Trustee: see s 37 of the SCT Act and Davis v Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 376 ; (2002) 118 FCR 170 at [15] . In the present case, that date was 9 August 2005.</text>

<tocase>Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38</tocase>
<text>21 The Tribunal's reasons " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. They are to be read fairly as a whole and not over zealously: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272. Moreover, the reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues: cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38 at 52-53.

48 In the present case, it cannot be said that the Tribunal's reasons for decision were formulaic. All of the medical reports were read by the Tribunal and the basis on which the Tribunal approached the question of medical reports in its reasons for decision was identified. The fact that the Tribunal referred to extracts from some medical reports and failed to mention other medical reports does not, of itself, constitute an error of law: cf Guo Wei Rong at 52-53. No error of law was identified.

49 In submissions, Mr Samaras placed considerable emphasis on the failure of the Tribunal's reasons for decision to refer to a medical report provided by his treating general practitioner, Dr Elean To dated 9 August 2005. That medical report stated:
 
 
 "I believe that [Mr Samaras] has a significant degree of multiple medical illnesses that warrants him unable to work, he has multiple conditions affecting his heart, lungs, mobility, back, hips, mental state, depressions, stomach etc. 
 
 I believe the ongoing disability that [Mr Samaras] suffers cannot possibly allow him to return to work. He cannot be retrained in other fields of education. 
 
 He will not make significant recovery in the future to enable him to work as the nature of most of his conditions are that they are irreversible or will worsen with time."

50 The failure of the Tribunal to mention this report is not surprising. It was dated 9 August 2005, the date of the decision of the Trustee, and on its face did not address or contain material relevant to either limb of the definition of TPD. The illnesses were described in only the most general of terms. No attempt was made to identify which illnesses existed when Mr Samaras was insured and which of those illnesses affected his capacity to work in August 2005. In any event, the mere failure to mention this specific report did not, of itself, constitute an error of law: cf Guo Wei Rong at 52-53.

51 The second aspect of Mr Samaras' complaint under this ground of appeal was that taking into account all of the medical reports, the Tribunal could not reasonably have found that the Trustee's decision was fair and reasonable. That contention is unfounded. Once the proper construction of the definition of TPD is identified, much of the medical evidence referred to by Mr Samaras was irrelevant because it concerned illnesses which were not present in Mr Samaras while he was insured. Those illnesses were identified by the Tribunal as hip pain, gastritis, osteopaenia and fibromyalgia.

52 In relation to the illnesses that were present in Mr Samaras while he was insured, the Tribunal listed each illness and then reviewed the medical evidence to determine whether the decisions of the Trustee and the Insurer to reject Mr Samaras' claim for a TPD benefit were fair and reasonable in their operation to Mr Samaras in the circumstances. Such an approach was consistent with authority: see [20] above. The Tribunal was not required or indeed permitted to determine whether the Trustee's decision was the correct or preferable one or whether Mr Samaras, in its opinion, suffered disablement that came within the Policy or the Deed. No error of law was identified.</text>
