<tocase>Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1804.html</AustLII>
<text>On 28 November 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment on liability issues in this proceeding. In that judgment the Court found that the respondent Union contravened s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the Act"). This judgment deals with the question of the penalty, if any, which should be imposed on the Union for that contravention. These reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in the substantive matter ( Duffy v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1804).

The Union engaged in unlawful industrial action under the Act by the imposition by its organisers of limited and short lived bans on the performance of work at a building site called the University Hill site. The relevant portion of the judgment in the substantive matter is set out at [16] to [25].

The following points from that part of the substantive judgment are of particular current relevance: (a) 20 October 2005
 a ban was placed on work at the site because of the lack of a female toilet whilst a female worker was present and the absence of a site contamination report; after 9.30 am no work was performed on the site, other than by two employees of the head contractor; there were only two sub-contractors working on site immediately before the imposition of the ban: 
(i) Crushtec Australia Pty Ltd &#8212; who had Ms Sally Belcher performing work on site; and
 
(ii) V&amp;G Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd who had Mr Fred Gilliland and Mr Shannon Gilliland performing work on the site.
 (b) 21 October 2005</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/517.html</AustLII>
<text>In recording that fine, I acknowledge that Union is a large body with considerable assets but it is a body which does not exist to make profit but exists for the benefit of its members; see Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union [2004] FCA 517 at [8] per Gray J.

It also should be acknowledged, in mitigation of penalty, that the relevant organisers, in imposing the bans, acted in response to what they perceived to be an unsafe workplace where as they were told by the site manager that no soil contamination report had been obtained for the site.

The parties agree that each party should bear his and its own costs of the proceeding.
 I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.

<tocase>Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1426.html</AustLII>
<text>Within about six months of the relevant events, the Union organised a seminar designed to educate its officials about the effects of the Act. This conduct indicates a desire to avoid repetition of conduct in breach of the Act; see Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 at [53] per Tracey J.

There is similar previous conduct, most relevantly in Stuart-Mahoney . The events of which occurred about a fortnight before the current events, although that case is not a prior contravention it shows that similar conduct had been undertaken in the past. I say "similar" in a rather loose sense because the imposition of the overtime ban in that matter was far more serious and had far more widespread effects than the transient bans in this matter.

Deterrence is important, both general and specific. That is why, notwithstanding the conduct of the head contractor which led to the short lived bans of little consequence, there should be some monetary penalty imposed to reflect that a statutory provision has been breached. It is not as if there was no alternative but to impose a ban. Focussed talks with the head contractor at a high level and/or a referral of the issue to the Commission and/or Worksafe inspectors were alternative available courses of action.

In Stuart-Mahoney , Tracey J imposed a penalty of $20,000 for breach of s 38 of the Act in respect of events occurring about the same time as the instant events. Even taking into account the application of the totality principle in that case, the significance and seriousness of the current breach are far less than the circumstances considered by Tracey J. Accordingly, I consider a fine of $5,500 to be appropriate in the current circumstances.</text>
