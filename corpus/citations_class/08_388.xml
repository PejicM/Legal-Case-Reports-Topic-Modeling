<tocase>Ogawa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Migration Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1694</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1694.html</AustLII>
<text>1 There is an old adage that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. These proceedings indicate that it is not only that destination that is paved with good intentions, but also the pathway to a courthouse. By that I mean, that when one reflects upon the history of this case, and in particular the observations that Cowdroy J made in his reasons for judgment in Ogawa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Migration Review Tribunal (2006) FCA 1694 , one sees there particular sources of grievance that, at a humane level, one might see Ms Ogawa having in respect of the saga of her dealing with the immigration authorities of the Commonwealth.

2 Those grievances, though, do not translate into actionable causes of action against either of the Respondents in this proceeding. In between when this proceeding was first instituted in the Federal Magistrates Court in June last year and today, there have been many "good intentions", in terms of adjournments granted for the purpose of seeking legal advice, and in terms of the advance notice of the nature of the application to be made today by the Respondents, and the detailed reasons for it. Earlier in time one sees many other instances of "good intentions" in the dealings between the Commonwealth and Ms Ogawa, even though it must be said, as Cowdroy J observed, some of those good intentions have translated into sources of grievance, which the present proceeding indicates, persist to this day.

3 The detailed background to the case is to be found in a chronology which was helpfully provided at a directions hearing last year by the Respondents, and which is attached to these reasons as Exhibit 1.

4 By reference to that chronology and other material filed, one sees that the proceeding has its origins in the request that was made by Ms Ogawa to the Immigration Department's Ministerial Intervention Unit for intervention by the Minister in respect of her migration affairs, pursuant to s 351 of the Migration Act 1958 ("Migration Act"). That request was withdrawn by, it seems, the First Respondent, without any apparent instruction from Ms Ogawa so to do. That particular event became the subject of litigation before a Federal Magistrate, and later before Cowdroy J, in the decision to which I have already made reference. One finds in Cowdroy J's Reasons for Judgment further detail concerning the earlier background of today's proceeding.

5 It might also be noted that since Cowdroy J gave his decision on 15 December 2006 the following events have occurred. On 25 June 2007, on the initiative of another agency within the Immigration Department, action was taken pursuant to s 351 of the Migration Act to grant to Ms Ogawa a sub-class 574 (post graduate research sector) visa which remained valid until 31 August 2007, and on 30 August 2007 to grant to her a sub-class 010 (bridging A) visa.

6 In the application that Ms Ogawa filed initially in the Federal Magistrates Court and which has since been transmitted to this Court by order of Federal Magistrate Burnett, the following relief is sought:
 
(a) firstly, a declaration that Ms Ogawa's request under s 351 of the Migration Act be deemed to be being considered by an officer of the Ministerial Intervention Unit of the Department of Immigration at all times since the request was made; 
 
(b) secondly, certiorari, quashing the decision of the First Respondent; 
 
(c) thirdly, mandamus, directing the First Respondent to consider and determine Ms Ogawa's request according to law;
 
(d) fourthly, an order that the Second Respondent pay damages to Ms Ogawa or, in the alternative, that the First Respondent pay damages to Ms Ogawa; 
 
(e) fifthly, an order that, pursuant to s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ("the Act "), the Second Respondent pay interest to Ms Ogawa or, in the alternative, the First Respondent pay interest to Ms Ogawa.

7 Ancillary relief and costs are also sought. The grounds of the application, in summary, are as follows: 
 
(a) firstly, that the First Respondent had no power or authority to make the decision; 
 
(b) secondly, that the First Respondent knew that:
 
(i) she had no power or authority or recklessly disregarded the means of ascertaining the extent of her power or authority to make the decision; and
 
(ii) that her conduct in withdrawing the request by Ms Ogawa had a foreseeable risk of harm to her; 
 
(c) thirdly, that the Second Respondent is vicariously liable for the First Respondent's conduct and, finally; 
 
(d) fourthly, "such and other grounds that are not currently within the knowledge of the unrepresented Applicant."

29 That observation has particular resonance in the circumstances of the present case. There is not a scintilla of evidence in any of the material which has been read before me or, for that matter, in the circumstances as detailed by Cowdroy J in his earlier decision, which in any way provides any support for the view that any Commonwealth officer has acted otherwise than honestly and without any intention at all to act in any way maliciously as against Ms Ogawa. Even assuming that there were jurisdiction in respect of the judicial review and declaratory aspects of this case, and assuming that one might regard the damages claim as an associated matter, it is utterly hopeless.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/1.html</AustLII>
<text>11 Section 31A(2) of the Act represents a deliberate step by the Parliament to modify the position which hitherto prevailed in relation to summary judgment applications and which is exemplified in terms of principle in authorities such as Day v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. Thus s 31A(2) provides that the court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if:
 
(a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; 
 
(b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 211 CLR 441</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/1.html</AustLII>
<text>23 It might also be noted that by s 351(7) , the Minister is empowered to make, by way of substitution, a more favourable decision, but that he does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise his power under subs (1) in respect of any decision, whether he was requested to do so by an applicant or another person, or in any other circumstances. That particular statutory provision and its analogues have the necessary consequence in relation to an application for a constitutional writ, in which it is sought to compel Ministerial consideration, that there is no statutory duty so to do and, hence, a constitutional writ will not go. See in that regard the High Court's decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 441-48.

24 That in itself is enough to dispose of the proceeding on the basis of an absence of a reasonable prospect of success; i.e. there is no hope of establishing jurisdiction to entertain the claim in respect of relief relating to compelling the Minister to act under s 351. It is desirable though, in the circumstances, to reflect upon other aspects of the claim, even assuming that there were jurisdiction.

25 In their written submission the Respondents, apart from the primary submission which is that the Minister is under no obligation to consider a request, also in an elaborate way chart by way of reference to directions that have been given by the Minister pursuant to his administration of the Act and in relation to s 351, highlight how it is, that a particular course was taken within the Department to proceed as was done once both a request for withdrawal had been received and once there was an awareness of a continuing migration matter litigation. It suffices to note that there is a compelling basis for the submission that the course taken was one that was within power. The detail of that is set out in the submission which is on the court file and it is not necessary to elaborate on it.</text>

<tocase>Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/65.html</AustLII>
<text>26 It is desirable though to elaborate rather more on what the Respondents, with respect, rightly apprehend to be a claim in the nature of damages for misfeasance in public office. Like the Respondents, I too would characterise the second of the grounds in the application as one for damages in respect of that asserted tort. The leading authority in respect of that tort is Northern Territory v Mengel (1995) 185 CLR 307. Damages are recoverable by an individual in respect of the tort of misfeasance in public office, where that individual has suffered loss by reason of an action taken by the holder of a public office, if, and it is a significant if, that officer has acted maliciously, or knew that the action was beyond power and likely to harm that individual.

27 In this sense misfeasance in public office is a "deliberate tort". The elements of the course of action were particularly identified by Deane J in his reasons for judgment in Mengel at page 370, in the following way:
 
 
 (a) there was an invalid or unauthorised act;
 (b) that act was done maliciously;
 (c) it was done by a public officer;
 (d) it was done in the apparent discharge of that officer's duties;
 (e) the act caused loss or damage.

28 It is also useful to recall an observation made by Brennan J in Mengel at page 357 wherein his Honour observed that the tort consisted of:
 
 "A purported exercise of some power or authority by a public officer otherwise than in an honest attempt to perform the functions of his or her office whereby the loss is caused to the plaintiff."</text>

<tocase>James v Commonwealth [1939] HCA 9 ; (1939) 62 CLR 339</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1939/9.html</AustLII>
<text>30 A further observation ought also to be made in respect of so much of that damages claim as would seek to make the Commonwealth vicariously liable in respect of the first respondent's action or inaction, as alleged. Obviously enough, the utterly hopeless quality of the damages claim against the First Respondent has a necessary consequence, even assuming that it were possible to make the Commonwealth vicariously liable. That is an assumption though which, in any event, would be wrong in law to make. The present state of authority suggests strongly that, in the ordinary course of events, it is not possible to make the relevant body politic, in this case the Commonwealth, vicariously liable for that tort of misfeasance committed by an officer, see James v Commonwealth [1939] HCA 9 ; (1939) 62 CLR 339 at 359-60 and RACZ v Home Office [1994] 2 AC 45.</text>
