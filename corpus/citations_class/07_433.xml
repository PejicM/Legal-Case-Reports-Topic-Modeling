<tocase>Booth v Phillips [2004] 1 WLR 3292</tocase>
<text>11 This approach may be recognised as wider than the operation of Art 5(3) of the Brussels Convention: see Marinari v Lloyds Bank Plc [1996] QB 217 and Mazur Media Ltd v Mazur Media GmbH [2004] 1 WLR 2966 at 2973-2974 [23]-[26]. Nevertheless, the English Civil Procedure Rule 6.20(8)(a) which provides for service out of the jurisdiction in respect of "a claim made in tort where (a) the damage was sustained within the jurisdiction" was construed by Nigel Teare QC, sitting (as his Lordship then was) as a deputy High Court judge, in Booth v Phillips [2004] 1 WLR 3292 at 3298-3300 [32]-[44] in a manner informed by, and consistently with, Flaherty v Girgis 4 NSWLR 248. There is a similar rule in the Singapore Civil Procedure Rules (Order 11 rule 1(f)(ii)). The rule appears to be interpreted in a way conformable with the Australian cases and Booth v Phillips [2004] 1 WLR 3292, see Selvam GP, Singapore Civil Procedure 2003 (Thomson) pp 98-99 at [11/1/29]. As to Hong Kong, see Hong Kong Civil Procedure Rules Order 11 rule 1(1)(f) and Chan P, Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006 pp 113-114 at [11/1/28]. These cognate approaches do not govern the interpretation of Order 8 rule 2 of this Court's Rules. They do reveal, however, that the approach in Australia in the cases to which I have referred and which I have followed are not outside well-known parameters of the exercise of power to serve foreigners outside the jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Brix-Neilsen v Oceaneering Australia Pty Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 173</tocase>
<text>10 It is clear from a number of cases in New South Wales decided in the 1980s on a cognate rule that damage in this rule does not mean the injury which completed the tort, but rather it means the disadvantage or detriment suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the tortious act or omission of the defendant. In this respect the word "damage" in this context has a wider meaning than injury: Brix-Neilsen v Oceaneering Australia Pty Ltd [1982] 2 NSWLR 173; Challenor v Douglas [1983] 2 NSWLR 405; Flaherty v Girgis (1985) 4 NSWLR 248 (the contrary proposition was not pressed in the High Court where the debate concerned constitutional questions: Flaherty v Girgis [1987] HCA 17 ; (1987) 162 CLR 574). These cases concerned personal injury where a degree of personal suffering or expenditure had been suffered or made in New South Wales, the tort having wholly occurred in another State. The same logic was applied to property cases in the cargo claim matter of Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v Spanish-Polish Shipping Co Inc (The 'Katowice II) (1990) 25 NSWLR 568 and see also Colosseum Investment Holdings Pty Ltd v Vanguard Logistic Services Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 803 at [40] - [50] .</text>

<tocase>The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324</tocase>
<text>12 On the proper construction of Order 8 rule 2, damage was suffered in Australia within the meaning of the rule and the proceeding is one under which an order can be made under Order 8 rule 2 for service in the United Kingdom. The question arises then whether the power should be exercised. The relevant clause of the conditions of contract, if binding, may well be such as to raise a time bar. However, there is no material upon which it can be presently concluded that the relevant terms and conditions governed the relationship between either the defendant and Planetwide or the defendant and the plaintiff. In correspondence, the solicitors for the defendant have raised the issue of the applicability of The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324. The question of the applicability of this case in circumstances where there is a quasi-bailment (that is when a company in the position of Planetwide does not obtain actual possession) may be debatable. I express no view on that. However, even if The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324 is potentially applicable, its application would need to be grounded evidentially in the incorporation of the relevant terms as governing the relationship between Planetwide and the defendant in circumstances that would bind the plaintiff.

13 Looking at the statement of claim there appear to be more than ample grounds to come to the view that there was a bailment and some real question as to whether there was due care in the handling of the goods. The time bar may be made out as a matter of defence, but it is not self-evident that such a plea, if or when made, would succeed.

14 The claim is a small one. The plaintiff wishes to bring the matter before the Court. The defendant has not, in the opportunity that has been given to it, provided material which would make clear the basis upon which it contracted with Planetwide. Nor has it made clear the precise basis upon which the plaintiff will be bound by these terms and conditions, beyond an assertion of the applicability of The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324.

15 Further, the governing law clause, which I have set out above, appears to be limited in its own terms to contracts. I am not clear as to whether the defendant will assert that there was a direct contract between the plaintiff and it or whether it will be said that on its proper construction the clause is wide enough to extend to non-contractual bailment counts supported by cases such as The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324. On what is before the Court, the governing law clause is not a basis to conclude that leave should not be granted .

16 In all these circumstances, in my view, the plaintiff has made out a case sufficient to warrant service out of the jurisdiction based on Order 8 rule 2 and in particular item 5 of the table in that rule.
