<text>25 Accepting that a jurisdictional error can be inferred from a conclusion reached despite factual findings, this is not a matter in which such an inference can be drawn. Before indicating why this is so it is appropriate to refer to some well accepted principles that are applied when challenging on grounds of jurisdictional error determinations that a person does not satisfy the definition of a refugee for the purposes of the Migration Act. 
 
 (i) Whether particular conduct of which a person is shown to have a well-founded fear is sufficiently serious and significant as to constitute persecution properly understood, is a question of fact and degree for the Tribunal not the Court: VDAU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 32 at [24] ; see also Raheem v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 940 at [31] . 
 (ii) Whether threats of future harm are genuine and are sufficiently serious as to be capable of amounting to persecution (if intended to be acted upon and not merely to intimidate) are likewise questions of fact and degree for the Tribunal: VBAS v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 212 ; (2005) 216 ALR 307 at [20] - [28] .
 (iii) Where the Tribunal has correctly formulated the test to be applied, a court should not take the view that the Tribunal did not apply the correct test unless this appears clearly from what it has written: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271.
 (iv) The ultimate question for the Tribunal looks to the future and requires it to consider whether the fear of persecution upon return to the country in question is well founded: M66 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 112 at [13] .
 (v) The Tribunal is not required, as an essential part of reaching its conclusion on whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution, to characterise past acts complained of as persecution: Ratnayake v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1141. What has happened in the past may explain a present subjective fear and be a matter to be taken into account in the predictive exercise of determining whether there is a "real chance" of persecution for a Convention reason if that person is returned: Ratnayake ; Applicant A233 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2004] FCA 666 at [20] .</text>

<tocase>Das v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229</tocase>
<text>27 These conclusions fell well within the Tribunal's proper province. It made its judgment of the significance, seriousness and, in the case of the threats, the purpose of the conduct in question. As Sundberg J said in Das v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (2004) 208 ALR 229 at [23]: "That the Court might not itself have taken the same view of the facts as the Tribunal does not establish error". No reviewable error has been disclosed.

28 Distinctly, the appellant claims that the Tribunal misunderstood the "official quality" that may be required in the course of persecution such as to constitute a person a refugee under the Convention. I already have indicated that the Tribunal's understanding of what was comprehended by the "official quality" requirement as expressly explained in its Reasons, was orthodox and unobjectionable. Before referring again to this matter towards the end of its reasons, the Tribunal found that despite his fears of harm at the hands of UNP supporters, the appellant could access and be provided with adequate State protection. It is in this context that its comments on "official quality" are to be considered when it indicated that the harm the appellant fears from UNP supporters did not have an official quality.</text>

<text>29 On a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons, it is apparent that the Tribunal was intending to signify that such violence as occurs between members or supporters of political parties (which was the essence of the appellant's claims about the UNP supporters) did not amount to persecution, first because such violence was not official, or officially tolerated or uncontrollable by the State and secondly, because it lacked the selective or discriminatory quality which is inherent in the notion of persecution. While each of these reasons was sufficient to justify a conclusion adverse to the appellant, the latter, the State protection finding, was independently dispositive of the appellant's entire claim in the circumstances: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Respondent S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487; SZBOT v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 411 ; Applicant VFAH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1018.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/23.html</AustLII>
<text>37 The respondent opposes leave primarily on the basis that the proposed grounds have no reasonable prospects of success. A subsidiary basis for opposition based on comments made in the joint judgment in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka [2001] HCA 23 ; (2001) 206 CLR 128 at [29] concerning the significance of lapse of time is to the following effect. Given the member's views were published more than a year after the decision in question, it cannot be determined what the member's views may have been at the time of decision. This latter contention is not, in my view, of particular consequence. The article was published in a law journal in a foreign country. Inevitably that process would have involved delay. It is equally clear from the structure of the article, the sources relied upon, and the nature of the debate with which it was engaging, that time was spent in its research and writing. It is improbable that its central thesis was not entertained by the Tribunal member, if only in rudimentary form, at the time when the appellant's review application was determined.

38 Given the view I take on the question of leave, it is necessary to refer in a little detail to the burden of the article itself (which runs to thirty-five pages). There are two comments I should make about it by way of preface. The first is that the article's concern is not with torture at large (i.e. the infliction of severe pain, suffering or torment as such). Rather it is with a particular sub-species of State-sanctioned or officially authorised torture (i.e. the State-sanctioned infliction of bodily pain etc for the purpose of persuading a person to provide information to avert a grave risk of loss of life). I note in passing that the definitions of "torture" in The Oxford English Dictionary , vol XVIII, 278 (2 nd ed) reflect the above differences to the extent of recognising that torture may or may not be inflicted purposively and with State authority.

39 The second comment is that the background to the article are the contemporary prevalence of State-sanctioned torture in many countries and its use by States for interrogative purposes.

43 First, reasonably apprehended bias . The test of whether the Tribunal member was disqualified from hearing the appellant's application for review on this basis is not in issue between the parties. Both are content for present purposes to rely upon that of Deane J in Webb v R [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 67-68. It is:
 
 "whether, in all the circumstances, a fair-minded lay observer with knowledge of the material objective facts 'might entertain a reasonable apprehension that [the Tribunal member] might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question' in issue." 
 

Though the subject of the reasonable apprehension need only be of a possibility of bias, that reasonable apprehension must be "firmly established": R v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; Ex parte Angliss Group [1969] HCA 10 ; (1969) 122 CLR 546, at 553. In a case such as the present involving the significance to be attributed in the circumstances to expressed views, it is insufficient to demonstrate merely "a sense of unease or a feeling that conventions of discretion and prudence have been breached": Re Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Epeabaka , at [90]. What needs to be established is a reasonable suspicion that an unprejudiced mind might not be brought to the determination of the appellant's case because of "preconceptions existing independently of the case": Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39 ; (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 372 - because of prejudgment or predisposition: Ex parte Epeabaka , at [21]. I will for convenience refer to this as "issue bias".</text>
