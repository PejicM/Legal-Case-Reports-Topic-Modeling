<tocase>Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales (1988) 22 FCR 378</tocase>
<text>In Bourke v State Bank of New South Wales (1988) 22 FCR 378 (at 394), Wilcox J held that the expression " the interests of justice " in s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth) ought to be read widely. His Honour referred to the need to consider all aspects of a matter including both substantive and adjectival matters and concluded by saying: 
 
 It is not in "the interests of justice" to adopt a course, in relation to those matters, which places unnecessary burdens and delays upon the parties to the litigation. 
 

 
These ideas, although not directly applicable, are nevertheless apt to be applied in the present case.

In summary, it seems to me, there is in reality no connection at all with New South Wales. There is nothing else which can fairly be weighed in the balance in favour of keeping the proceedings in this Registry of this Court. There are, on the other side of things, substantial reasons based upon the cost and inconvenience to individual litigants which would justify a transfer to the Queensland District Registry of this Court and I propose to make an order accordingly.

It seems to me that the applicant was entitled to resist the application in the form in which it was pressed because the primary order sought was an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The third respondent has not persuaded me that such an order should be made. On the other hand, the applicant did resist the making of any orders. In those circumstances each of the relevant parties has experienced some success and some failure. It seems to me that the appropriate order as to the costs of the motion for transfer brought by the third respondent is that those costs be costs in the proceedings.</text>

<tocase>National Mutual Holdings Pty Limited v Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>In National Mutual Holdings Pty Limited v Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155 , a Full Court of this Court held that the power conferred on the Court or a judge by s 48 was unfettered and should be exercised flexibly having regard to the circumstances of the particular case. The Court went on to say (19 FCR at 162): 
 
 Ultimately the test is: where can the case be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court. It cannot and should not, in our opinion, be defined more closely or precisely.

Other sources of the power to transfer a proceeding to another Registry of this Court are O 10 r 1(2)(f) and O 30 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules . The relevant guiding principles are the same under the Rules as under s 48 of the Act.</text>
