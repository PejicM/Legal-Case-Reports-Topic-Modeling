<text>A plea will have a tendency to cause embarrassment if it is ambiguous or irrelevant, or if it is inconsistent with another plea. The latter case is to be distinguished from a plea which is clearly put in the alternative to another plea which is permissible.

<tocase>Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1991) 105 ALR 456</tocase>
<text>As his Lordship notes, there can be an overlapping between material facts and necessary facts, and as von Doussa J observed in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1991) 105 ALR 456 at 466, the distinction between material facts and necessary particulars has tended to become more obscured as the years have gone by.

Nevertheless, necessary particulars can be, but do not have to be, in the statement of claim (O 12 r 1) and a party is not required to plead to necessary particulars, although it is not uncommon for that to be done.

In so far as the respondents' objections are based on a failure to provide necessary particulars, they must be taken to be asking for an order that particulars be provided even though a defence has not been filed. For their part, the applicants did not seek to identify paragraphs where the true basis of the objection was a failure to provide necessary particulars and then submit that the provision of particulars should be at least postponed until after a defence is filed. They sought discovery before particulars and seem to accept that if they are successful they would thereafter provide the necessary particulars even though a defence had not been filed.</text>

<tocase>Bruce v Oldhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697</tocase>
<text>In the case of a number of pleas, counsel for the respondents' objection, as shown in the table, was that the plea was insufficiently particularised. In relation to those cases where the true basis of the objection is that the necessary particulars are not provided, it must not be overlooked that the Rules provide that, in the ordinary case, particulars will not be ordered before a defence is filed (O 12 r 5(3)). The Rules proceed on the basis that there is a clear distinction between the pleading of material facts and the provision of necessary particulars. The distinction between material facts and necessary facts was identified by Scott LJ in the well-known passage from Bruce v Oldhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 (at 712-713): 
 
 "The cardinal provision in r. 4 is that the statement of claim must state the material facts. The word 'material' means necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action; and if any one "material" fact is omitted, the statement of claim is bad; it is 'demurrable' in the old phraseology, and in the new is liable to be 'struck out' under Order XXV., r. 4: see Philipps v. Philipps ; or 'a further and better statement of claim' may be ordered under Order XIX., r. 7. 
 

 
 
 The function of 'particulars' under r. 6 is quite different. They are not to be used in order to fill material gaps in a demurrable statement of claim - gaps which ought to have been filled by appropriate statements of the various material facts which together constitute the plaintiff's cause of action. The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading, imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant. Their function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff's cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial. Consequently in strictness particulars cannot cure a bad statement of claim. But in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between a 'material fact' and a 'particular' piece of information which it is reasonable to give the defendant in order to tell him the case he has to meet; hence in the nature of things there is often overlapping. And the practice of sometimes putting particulars into the statement of claim and sometimes delivering them afterwards either voluntarily, or upon request or order, without any reflection as to the true legal ground upon which they are to be given has become so common that it has tended to obscure the very real distinction between them."

<tocase>Computershare Limited v Perpetual Registrars Limited (2000) 1 VR 626</tocase>
<text>In addition to the above authorities, I refer to the discussion by Warren J (as her Honour then was) in Computershare Limited v Perpetual Registrars Limited (2000) 1 VR 626 at 635-638.

In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for an order for discovery before particulars. As I have said, there does not seem to be much doubt that the first respondent (and perhaps other respondents) acted as the applicants' agent, owed fiduciary obligations to them and, from time to time, had control of moneys belonging to the applicants. One such obligation was and is a liability to account and to provide information to the applicants. That seemed to be acknowledged by the first respondent because one of his arguments on the applicants' application was that he has already provided a proper reconciliation to the applicants. Secondly, the evidence established that the respondents are in possession of the relevant information and, in a relative sense at least, the applicants do not have the information, or at least all of the information. Thirdly, there is a prima facie case of unauthorised use in relation to a sum of $28,915.27 because it seems that this sum was used by the first respondent to discharge a liability for personal expenses.

Both counsel took me through a number of financial and other documents relating to the transactions referred to in the statement of claim. The purpose of the exercise from the respondents' point of view was to establish that all moneys had been used for the applicants' benefit, or in accordance with their instructions, and that they had been provided with all the information to which they were entitled, or, which they had requested. The difficulties in engaging in such an exercise at this early stage are obvious. There are a number of transactions and they are complex transactions. I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the respondents have established a sufficiently clear case of the type they advanced to overcome those reasons for making an order for discovery before particulars and, in my opinion, it is appropriate to make such an order.

<tocase>Edelston v Russell (1888) 57 LT 927</tocase>
<text>For reasons I will give, I think this is an appropriate case for discovery before particulars. I do not think the fact that a defence has not been filed is an impediment to such an order at this stage ( Edelston v Russell (1888) 57 LT 927). For reasons I will give, I think that some paragraphs in the statement of claim should be struck out. The defects in the statement of claim are not sufficient to warrant an order that the statement of claim be struck out. I do not think the applicants should be required to replead before discovery is made, even in relation to those paragraphs struck out on grounds other than the ground of a failure to provide necessary particulars. That would be time-consuming and wasteful.

I turn now to consider the particular objections to the statement of claim.

In some cases, the same objection is taken to a number of paragraphs. It is convenient to deal with these paragraphs as a group. I start with the groups of paragraphs and then move to the objections to individual paragraphs.</text>

<text>In Lyons v Kern Konstructions (Townsville) Pty Ltd (1983) 7 FLR 135 , Fitzgerald J discussed in detail the circumstances in which discovery before particulars may be ordered in a case involving allegations of fraud (at 148-151) and the meaning of "fishing" in this context (at 151-152). It is clear from the authorities to which Fitzgerald J referred that discovery before particulars may be ordered even in cases involving allegations of fraud, although that will only be done where there is a special relationship between the parties or something in the nature of exceptional circumstances. His Honour also made it clear that discovery will not be ordered before pleading or particulars for the purpose of "fishing".</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Limited (1995) 58 FCR 426</tocase>
<text>The meaning of "fishing" was considered by Lindgren J in Trade Practices Commission v CC (New South Wales) Pty Limited (1995) 58 FCR 426. Lindgren J said (at 438): 
 
 "What does the reference to a 'fishing expedition' mean? After all, ex hypothesi, the giving of discovery will often, if not always, reveal documents of which the other party was not previously aware (similarly, the administering of interrogatories will often, if not always, reveal information of which the other party was not previously aware). What is meant is that discovery must not be used for the purpose of ascertaining whether a case exists, as distinct from the purpose of compelling the production of documents where there is already some evidence that a case exists: see, for example, Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 575; Associated Dominions Assurance Society Pty Ltd v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty Ltd ; WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman ; Barbarian Motor Cycle Club Inc v Koithan (1984) at 486; Nestle Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1986) at 82-83; Mobex Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (unreported, Federal Court, Foster J, 18 May 1994), at p 18. In WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman at 181, Brennan J said that what is required is that 'sufficient is shown to ground a suspicion that the party applying for discovery has a good case proof of which is likely to be aided by discovery'. On the facts of particular cases, the application of the distinction between 'fishing' and 'non-fishing' may well be difficult."

<text>In WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman [1980] FCA 79 ; (1980) 41 FLR 175 , the respondent applied to strike out an allegation in a statement of claim and the applicant sought discovery and leave to interrogate on the allegation. Brennan J (as his Honour then was) said (at 181): 
 
 "Though the power to require discovery be acknowledged, how should it be exercised? It depends upon the nature of the case and the stage of the proceedings at which the discovery is sought. In the present case, discovery is sought before there is a tittle of evidence to suggest that the Chairman did not have the requisite cause to believe which par. 6 of the statement of claim would put in issue. Some assistance was sought to be derived from cases where discovery had been given to a party before he was required to give particulars of his claim: cases such as Ross v. Blakes Motors Ltd ., but in cases of that kind there is either an anterior relationship between the parties which entitles one to obtain information from the other, or sufficient is shown to ground a suspicion that the party applying for discovery has a good case proof of which is likely to be aided by discovery. This is not such a case. This is a case where a bare allegation is made by par. 6 of the statement of claim and, the paragraph being denied, the applicant seeks to interrogate the Chairman and ransack his documents in the hope of making a case. That is mere fishing."
