<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (20060 227 CLR</tocase>
<text>The principles which inform whether or not to grant interlocutory injunctive relief are not in doubt. They are as stated by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 571 at 81-82, [65]: The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd. This Court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued:
 
"The first is whether the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief ... The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted."
 
 
By using the phrase "prima facie case", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument. With reference to the first inquiry, the Court continued, in a statement of central importance for this appeal:
 
 
"How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks."
 
 
 [footnotes omitted].

The remaining Respondents do not contest, for the present purposes, that ACMA has demonstrated a prima facie case in the sense described in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 224 CLR 571 in respect of the allegations I have summarised above. They submit though that the interlocutory relief sought by ACMA goes beyond that which is reasonably necessary in the circumstances pending trial. More particularly they submit: 
(a) ACMA offers no undertaking as to damages. They acknowledge it is not required to do so insofar as it applies for injunctive relief under the Spam Act s 33. They note it has no similar protection insofar as it relies on s 80 of the Trade Practices Act . Even insofar as ACMA cannot be required to give an undertaking, they submit it is still a relevant consideration that such protection is absent;
 
(b) ACMA has substantially delayed in seeking relief. The substantial delay was before the commencement of proceedings in late 2008. It is apparent from ACMA's affidavit material that it has been investigating and has been in possession of much of the information on which it relies for some time. This suggests, they submit that things are not a drastic as it now seeks to make out;
 
(c) The interlocutory injunctive relief sought by ACMA is in essentially the same form as the final injunctive relief which it seeks. In many respects, its effect will be final. No attempt has been made to confine the relief given its interlocutory nature. As a result, they submit some of the interlocutory relief sought is not appropriate;
 
(d) The Court will be astute to ensure that orders are not made which have the potential to constrain conduct which is not the subject of complaint in the Statement of Claim. Several of the orders sought, they submit, have that potential, particularly so as to prohibit businesses which might lawful be conducted.

I turn now to a consideration of these particular submissions by the remaining Respondents.

Subsection 80(6) of the TPA is in similar terms to and perhaps provided the inspiration for s 33(2) of the Spam Act (set out above). However, those who enjoy the benefit of s 80(6) are the Minister administering the TPA and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This case illustrates that the ACCC is not the only Commonwealth public authority whose functions can embrace the seeking of interim injunctive relief under the TPA in the public interest. That omission might well be though a law reform matter by the Parliament.

Be this as it may, ACMA submits that, having regarding to its functions and the purpose of the proceedings, the Court would not regard its failure to offer the usual undertaking as to damages as fatal to so much of its claim for interlocutory injunctive relief as depends upon the TPA.

There is no doubt that in suits brought by private litigants the offering of the usual undertaking as to damages is normally expected by the Court before interlocutory injunctive relief is granted. The present form of the usual undertaking as to damages is to be found in Practice Note Number 3 issued by the Chief Justice on 14 June 1999.</text>

<tocase>Brigginshaw v Brigginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>The delay to which the remaining Respondents point is principally that which preceded the institution of proceedings late last year. I do not regard that as a material basis for refusing interlocutory injunctive relief in this case. Prima facie, Mr Weber's affidavits show a continuum of conduct. Further, it is quite apparent from his affidavits that there has necessarily been both an intensive and extensive investigation in order to bring matters to the point where they were fit for the institution of proceedings in this Court. It is to be remembered that, though a criminal standard of proof is not required in order to find contraventions which sound in civil penalties, nonetheless inexact proofs and indirect references are not sufficient: Brigginshaw v Brigginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.

I have already passed comment as to the breadth of the interlocutory injunctive relief sought by ACMA. It is a serious thing at a such stage of a proceeding to interfere with the lawful conduct of a business or with the ability lawfully to institute other businesses.

Subject to one qualification, I consider that the undertakings proffered by the remaining Respondents sufficiently meet the case for interlocutory injunctive relief that ACMA has established. That qualification relates to Winning's undertaking only that it will "use reasonable endeavours" to remove or otherwise deactivate, or cause to be removed or deactivated, any fictitious profiles on dating websites or social networking websites it has registered or otherwise placed on those websites, whether by itself, its servants or agents. Winning seems, prima facie , to have control in respect of such websites. ACMA, in my opinion, has established a case for an interlocutory order that Winning remove or deactivate the websites concerned. If it transpires, for some unforeseen reason, that Winning cannot, notwithstanding what it shows to be endeavours which the Court regards as reasonable effect removal or deactivation, it and its officers would not be found guilty of a contempt. That though is to anticipate. Further, what, prospectively, amounts to "reasonable endeavours" may be a subject upon which reasonable people might reasonably differ. It is undesirable, in my opinion, that that degree of imprecision attend either an interlocutory injunction or an undertaking which upon acceptance will have the same practical effect.</text>

<tocase>Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/21.html</AustLII>
<text>ACMA submits that, in an appropriate case, this Court's jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under s 80 of the TPA does extend to prohibiting a person from engaging altogether in a particular field of commercial activity or industry if that is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention of that Act found by the Court. A Full Court of this Court has held as much: Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135 at 149, [35] .

Foster concerned final injunctive relief granted in circumstances which were sufficiently serious to move the trial judge to impose what he regarded as a pecuniary penalty "at the high end of the scale". Accepting though, as I conceive I must, that s 80 confers such a power in respect of injunctive relief, the facts would, in my opinion, have to be very singular and serious indeed and an applicant's case overwhelming to warrant the granting of relief of such breadth.

There is a basis, apparent from the affidavits of Mr SJ Weber, ACMA's senior investigator in this matter, for believing that, either or each of Messrs Salcedo and Maughan, on behalf of Mobilegate, have provided a provisioning form for the provision of a premium short code 19724253 for use in a subscription service known as "Australian Singles On-line" and of an additional short code 19753787. ACMA, so Mr Weber deposes, has received and continues to receive complaints from mobile phone users and dating website operators in relation to the short code 19724253. Mr Weber also deposes to the current use of additional short codes allocated to Mobilegate and Winning respectively, apparently being used for the sending of messages of the kind referred to in the statement of claim.

There has been no affidavit material read on behalf of any of the remaining the Respondents as to these matters. Their solicitor has though deposed to the conduct of a business by Winning known as "Winning Bid Reverse Auction". That business is said to be independent from the activities the subject of the present proceedings. ACMA does not submit otherwise. Indeed, it seeks to exclude from the purview of any interlocutory injunctive relief anything which would prevent Winnings conducting that particular business.</text>

<tocase>Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/48.html</AustLII>
<text>Given that a question arises as to whether or not undertakings should be accepted, reference should also be made to the guidance offered by Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ in their joint judgment in Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164-165: 
 An undertaking to the court is given in lieu of an injunction and, if broken, is treated as the equivalent of an order for the purpose of enforcement; it may therefore be enforced in the same manner as an injunction Milburn v Newton Colliery Ltd; London and Birmingham Railway Co v Grand Junction Canal Co; In re National Federated Electrical Association's Agreement; Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd. 

 
 As an undertaking is given in lieu of an injunction and is enforceable in like manner, the principles which govern the grant of an injunction by a court must guide it in deciding whether it should accept an undertaking. Limitations which affect the court's jurisdiction or power to grant a final injunction must be observed in the acceptance of an undertaking when it is offered as a substitute for a final injunction. The court cannot escape such limitations by the expedient of accepting an undertaking in lieu of an injunction. The court cannot put itself in the position of enforcing conduct which it has no capacity to command or compel. No doubt the Federal Court has power to accept an undertaking at an interlocutory stage when the undertaking is reasonably related to the orderly procedure of the Court or to the subject matter of the litigation, ... even though it is not in a form which falls within s 80. But, ... this does not justify the conclusion that the Court has power to accept an undertaking by way of final disposition of the case when the Court lacks power to make a final order in that form and the effect of the undertaking is to restrain conduct which the Court has no power to restrain. 

 
 In general the court must, in deciding whether it will accept from a defendant an undertaking to which the plaintiff takes no exception, be guided by the principles which apply to the making of a consent injunction ...
