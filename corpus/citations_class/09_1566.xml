<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57</tocase>
<text>I am satisfied that, having regard to the affidavit of Ms Gardner, the applicant has made out a prima facie case of infringement of the trade mark in relation to articles which are not of the manufacture of the applicant or its parent, for the purposes of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J at [19] and Gummow and Hayne JJ at [65] to [72].

A further question arises in relation to the specific elements of section 136 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) which provides that the Customs CEO must release the seized goods to their designated owner if, within the action period, Jemella has not brought an action for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of the goods, and given to the customs CEO notice in writing of the action.

The action period relevantly expired in respect of the first notice on 20 November 2009 and in respect of the second and third notices on 23 November 2009. The action was commenced on 20 November 2009 for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of all of the goods.</text>
