<tocase>Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700</tocase>
<text>10 Perusal of the original Defence supported the respondents' claim that they conceded liability inadvertently: compare Defence, par 8. Bearing in mind the accepted principles, the respondents should have leave to file an Amended Defence, as counsel for the applicants properly conceded at the hearing: see Cropper v Smith (1884) 26 Ch D 700 at 710 per Bowen LJ; Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 152 153 per Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; and Johnston v Vintage Developments Pty Limited [2006] FCAFC 171 at [23] per Tamberlin, Jacobson and Rares JJ. If the respondents were granted the leave they sought, no injustice would be done the applicants that could not be remedied by an award of costs in their favour.</text>

<tocase>Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/1.html</AustLII>
<text>13 By enacting s 31A , Parliament intended "to lower the bar for obtaining summary judgment (including summary dismissal) below the level that had been fixed by such authorities as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91-92 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129-130": see White Industries Aust Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 at [54] per Lindgren J. Judges have differed, however, about the extent to which the provision achieves this end, but these differences probably do not much matter. The key is to address the statutory question. That is, under s 31A , in order to grant summary judgment, I must be satisfied that the respondents have no reasonable prospect of success in defending the infringement claim. As s 31A(3) makes clear, this does not mean that I must be satisfied that their defence is hopeless or bound to fail.</text>

<tocase>Begg v Cooper (1878) 40 LT 29</tocase>
<text>34 I accept that there is power to grant leave to the applicants to rely on supplementary affidavits in support of their summary judgment motion: compare Begg v Cooper (1878) 40 LT 29 and Carlton and United Breweries Ltd v Long [1958] VR 539 at 540-542 per Smith J. Subject to one matter, I consider this power should be exercised in the applicant's favour. The affidavits do not alter the essential case the respondents were to meet on this summary judgment application. On one view, the respondents were entitled to summary judgment without them. The effect of the affidavits is simply to overcome two potential minor deficiencies in the applicants' supporting material. These deficiencies were clearly capable of being met by the applicants. Had they sought leave at the hearing on 29 October 2007 to file this further material, I would have granted it. I can see no good reason to deny them leave now.</text>

<tocase>Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1490.html</AustLII>
<text>38 Finally, as noted above, the respondents have not pleaded reliance on s 123 of the 1995 Act in their Amended Defence. That is, they have not sought positively to assert that the counterfeit goods were not counterfeit because the marks in question were applied with the consent of the registered owner. Had they done so, then it would have been incumbent on them to make out their case: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1490 at [72] per Tamberlin J. As things stand, even if they had relied on s 123 , in the absence of evidence tending to support this assertion, there would be no reason to believe that they had any reasonable prospect of succeeding on a s 123 defence.

39 In these circumstances, there is nothing to be gained from adjourning this motion to permit the respondents to have a subpoena issued to Mr Duong. The respondents have not presented any evidence that would indicate that he could give relevant evidence concerning the issue of authorisation. They have not proposed in argument how he could give any such evidence. On the face of it, it seems most unlikely that he could assist the respondents at all on this question, especially when the evidence of Mr Shepherd is borne in mind.</text>

<tocase>Nokia Corporation v Truong [2005] FCA 1141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1141.html</AustLII>
<text>40 In written submissions filed with leave after the hearing, counsel for the respondents submitted that s 123 was not 'a defence' in the strict sense. Instead, s 123 reduced the ambit of s 120. It was unnecessary, so counsel said, for the respondents to plead s 123 expressly as a defence. Even if this were so, it would not affect the outcome of the applicants' summary judgment motion. Let it be assumed that the Amended Defence positively asserted that the marks on the goods in question were applied with the registered owner's consent and the goods were not counterfeit. The respondents placed no evidence before the Court that tended to support this assertion: see Nokia Corporation v Truong [2005] FCA 1141 at [36] per Crennan J. Nor did they place any evidence before the Court that they had any such evidence available to them.

41 The pleadings and the evidence lead me to conclude that the first respondent has no reasonable prospects of defending the applicants' trade mark infringement claim.

42 Accordingly, providing the applicants file and serve the duly affirmed affidavits of Mr Shepherd and Ms Limpipat today, I would order summary judgment be entered on the trade mark infringement claim against the first respondent, Rosa Dora. I propose to adjourn the matter to enable the parties to prepare draft minutes of order to give effect to these reasons.</text>
