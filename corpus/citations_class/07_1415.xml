<text>6 The Commonwealth says, however, that, even if there is an acquisition, it is not an acquisition by the Commonwealth, but by the State. The Commonwealth refers to a long-standing authority of the High Court to the effect that the Commonwealth may properly induce a State to exercise its powers by offering a money grant. The Commonwealth says that, even if the powers exercised by the State constitute an acquisition of land, it is not an acquisition by the Commonwealth but an acquisition by the State (see Pye v Renshaw [1951] HCA 8 ; 84 CLR 58 at 83).

7 Counsel for Mr Spencer contends that the authorities relied on by the Commonwealth are distinguishable from the present case. That may well be. Mr Spencer's argument is along the lines that the Commonwealth has, in some way, provided funds to the State in order to induce the State to impose restrictions that constitute an acquisition, such that the Commonwealth acquires some benefit by reason of the restrictions, the benefit being tradable emissions credits.

8 I consider that the statement of claim, in its present form, is embarrassing, in the sense that it does not disclose facts that, if established, could support the relief that is claimed. I therefore propose to strike out the statement of claim. However, I am prepared to give Mr Spencer the opportunity of filing an amended statement of claim to address the two questions that I have briefly mentioned. If there is an appropriate question of law to be thrown up, it may be possible to consider an application for preliminary determination of that question. It does appear, however, that there will be a factual issue thrown up by any amended pleading, namely, the extent to which the restrictions imposed by the State legislation are capable of constituting an acquisition. It may be that some new facts would enable the court to proceed to dispose of the whole proceeding on the basis of legal argument. That remains to be seen when the amended statement of claim is filed.

 I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett.
