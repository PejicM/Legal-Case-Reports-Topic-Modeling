<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/263.html</AustLII>
<text>38 Referring to NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1, the applicant submitted that although it is not the duty of the decision maker to make out a case for the applicant, the Tribunal is obliged to correctly apply the law to the issues raised by the evidence and consider the claims expressly made, such as the claim in relation to superior orders. The applicant submitted that the failure by the applicant to raise the issue of the defence of superior orders based on the law existing prior to the coming in to force of the convention could have in no way prejudiced the respondent. The applicant also submitted that, as in Kuswardana , the consequences of not correcting the error of the Tribunal would be exceptionally serious to the applicant.

39 The respondent submitted that this was not a matter of retrospective application of criminal laws. Criminal responsibility was not being created pursuant to the Rome Statute. The respondent submitted that non-retroactivity ratione personae (Art 24 of the Rome Statute) is properly a matter that relates to the exercise of jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The respondent submitted that the issue was the appropriate source of the definition of the crimes listed in Art 1F(a) of the Refugees Convention and noted that the Full Court had held that the Rome Statute was one of the international instruments from which crimes mentioned in Art 1F(a) could be characterised.

40 The respondent submitted that the availability or otherwise of any conceivable defence was not an "essential statutory precondition" for the application of Art 7 or Art 8 so as to invoke the Kuswardana principle. Further, the Full Court held that what was required under Art 1F(a) included the availability of a defence under the Rome Statute only if it was relied on by the person (at [127]). The respondent submitted that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to consider a defence that was not relied upon by the applicant and that this situation was a fortiori in relation to defences said to exist not under the Rome Statute. The respondent submitted, relying on NABE (No 2) that a determination that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is not to be lightly made.</text>

<tocase>R v Finta [1994] 1 SCR 701</tocase>
<text>33 The applicant relied on the Canadian decision of R v Finta [1994] 1 SCR 701 as authority for the proposition that the defence predated the Rome Statute and was available. The applicant submitted that the limited defence of superior orders which existed before the entry into force of the Rome Statute, required the consideration of the nature of the orders, whatever the crime and did not draw a distinction between orders to commit genocide, or crimes against humanity as distinct from other international crimes such as war crimes, as Art 33 of the Rome Statute does.

34 The applicant submitted that, in accordance with Art 22 and Art 24 of the Rome Statute and in order not to give Art 33 a detrimental retrospective effect, any other defence that was available prior to the coming into force of the Rome Statute must be considered. Art 24 would preserve any defence which was available prior to the coming into force of the Rome Statute which was consistent with Art 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that no one will be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed.

35 Specifically, the applicant submitted that once the Tribunal "determined to make a finding" under Art 7 rather than Art 8, it was obliged to consider whether Art 24 would preserve the defence acknowledged in R v Finta . He submitted that under the 1948 United Nations General Assembly, Art 11, no one was to be "held guilty" of any penal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a penal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed.

36 At the hearing an issue was raised about the effect of the applicant's failure to make a submission in the proceeding before the Tribunal about whether the defence of superior orders existed before the Rome Statute came into force. Specifically, the issue was whether jurisdictional error can be established when a Tribunal fails to address a matter that was not raised before it or, as a matter of discretion, whether the applicant is now precluded from raising it.

41 The respondent noted that the Art 33 of the Rome Statute departed from provisions made in previous instruments where "superior orders" were not recognised as a defence, but rather a matter to be pleaded in mitigation of punishment. The respondent submitted that the applicant had not established that prior to the entry into force of the Rome Statute, there existed a defence of superior orders to a charge of crimes against humanity. The respondent submitted that the decision in Finta concerned what may be viewed as a complementary defence of compulsion or duress. The respondent submitted the applicant did not seek to bring himself within the duress defence in Art 31(1)(d). The respondent submitted that even if Finta did stand for the proposition that the defence of superior orders was available, that decision alone would "not go so far as to crystallise customary international law on the point". The respondent submitted that it was not necessary to discern a clear rule of customary international law with regard to the defence of superior orders for the purpose of determining the application of the defence in Art 33 to crimes against humanity, pursuant to Article 1F(a) of the Refugees Convention.

42 The respondent submitted that as the existence of a defence under customary international law had not been raised before the Tribunal, it had been under no obligation to consider it. It was not a matter squarely raised on the material before the Tribunal.

43 In relation to the question of whether the Tribunal erred in failing to consider the definition in Art 7(2)(e) of the Rome Statute, there is no inconsistency between the content of Art 30(2) and the definition of torture in Art 7(2)(e) and the latter does not raise any additional consideration which should be addressed when considering whether the crime of torture had been committed. The definition refers to the "intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental". Clearly, Art 30(2)(a), which refers to the intent to engage in conduct, encompasses the conduct of "inflicting" pain or suffering and Art 30(2)(b), which refers to the intent to cause a consequence, picks up the consequences of "severe pain or suffering". It was open to the Tribunal to determine whether the applicant had intended to commit the crime defined in Art 7(2)(e) by reference to the test concerning the mental element articulated in Art 30(2)(a). It did so. Ground 1(a) is not made out.</text>

<tocase>SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 42 ; (2005) 147 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/42.html</AustLII>
<text>2 This decision of the delegate was previously the subject of an unsuccessful application for review to the Tribunal: see SRYYY and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] AATA 927. In an appeal to this Court against the Tribunal's decision, Lindgren J found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application as incompetent: see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1588. An appeal from that judgment was successful and the Full Court remitted the matter to the Tribunal for determination according to law: see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 42 ; (2005) 147 FCR 1.

3 Under s 36(2)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), a criterion for a protection visa is that the Minister is satisfied that the visa applicant is a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol. Under Art 1F of that Convention:
 
 The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: 
 
 
 (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; 
 
 (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; 
 
 (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. (emphasis added)

4 One means of ascertaining the meaning of a crime against humanity is to refer to the International Criminal Court Act 2002 (Cth). Section 3(1) of the Act provides that the principal object of the Act is to facilitate compliance with Australia's obligations under the Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on 17 July 1998 (the Rome Statute) which is Schedule 1 to that Act. The Rome Statute is an international instrument of the type referred to in Art 1F(a): see SRYYY v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 42 ; (2005) 147 FCR 1 at [66] . Relevantly, the Rome Statute provides:
 Article 7 
 Crimes against humanity 
 
 1. For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack: 
 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (f) Torture; 
 ... 
 
 2. For the purpose of paragraph 1: 
 
 
 
 (a) "Attack directed against any civilian population" means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack; 
 ... 
 (e) "Torture" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions; 
 ... 
 
 
 ... 
 Article 9 
 Elements of Crimes 
 
 
 1. Elements of Crimes shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of articles 6, 7 and 8. They shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States Parties. 
 
 2. Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by: 
 
 (a) Any State Party; 
 (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority; 
 (c) The Prosecutor. 
 
 Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States Parties. 
 
 
 3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute. 
 
 
 ... 
 Article 22 
 Nullum crimen sine lege 
 
 
 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes, at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court. 
 2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted. 
 3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law independently of this Statute. 
 
 
 
 ... 
 Article 24 
 Non-retroactivity ratione personae 
 
 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the Statute. 
 2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. 
 
 Article 25 
 Individual criminal responsibility 
 
 
 1. ... 
 ... 
 3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person: 
 (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible; 
 (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted; 
 ... 
 ... 
 Article 30 
 Mental element 
 
 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge. 
 
 2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where: 
 (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; 
 (b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events. 
 
 
 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. 
 
 ... 
 Article 33 
 Superior orders and prescription of law 
 
 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless: 
 (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question; 
 (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and 
 (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 
 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.

5 The Tribunal had to determine whether the applicant was subject to the exclusionary provisions in Art 1F of the Refugees Convention. That is, it had to determine whether it was satisfied that "there are serious reasons for considering" that the applicant had committed a war crime or a crime against humanity.

6 The Tribunal set out the applicant's evidence at length. It was from a number of sources (including departmental interviews and a transcript of oral evidence given at the previous tribunal hearing) and spanned the years 2000 to 2006. The applicant joined the Sri Lankan Army in May 1997 as an ordinary soldier. At that time there was a civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). After a year or so on the frontline in Trincomalee and then another year at Elephant Pass the applicant requested a transfer because he disliked witnessing innocent civilians and fellow soldiers being killed and injured. He was posted to Jaffna where he was assigned to a unit responsible for questioning suspects. This sometimes involved threatening and harming detainees.

32 The applicant submitted, in relation to ground 2, that because the Rome Statute was not in force at the time the applicant was alleged to have committed the crimes alleged, he ought not to be precluded from reliance on the defence of superior orders. He noted that the Full Court decision in SRYYY questioned whether Art 33 accurately reflected customary international law. The applicant submitted that to the extent that Art 33 excluded the defence of superior orders in relation to crimes against humanity, it ought not to be given retrospective effect.</text>
