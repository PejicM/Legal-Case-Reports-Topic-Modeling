<tocase>Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187</tocase>
<text>For these reasons, I do not consider that special circumstances have been established within the well-known principle stated in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195.

Accordingly, I see no reason to justify a departure from the ordinary rule prescribing the period within which a notice of appeal must be filed and served. Accordingly, the order I will make is that the application be dismissed.

The ordinary order to make in these circumstances is that the applicant pay the costs of this application, and that is the order I will make.
 I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.
