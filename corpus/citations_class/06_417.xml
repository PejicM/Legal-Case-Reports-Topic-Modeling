<text>34 Order 3 was plainly interlocutory. A court must remain in control of its own interlocutory orders which cannot be allowed to be used as an instrument of injustice; Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Limited v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 178.</text>

<text>37 In a rare category of cases the discovery of new facts will not be an essential requirement for the exercise of the power to set an order aside. Where, as in the present case, the enforcement of the order would work an injustice such that the Court's own order would be used to bring about a result that would be contrary to the very purpose of the order, the Court must have power under s 23 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) to set the order aside; see CSR Limited v Cigna Insurance Australia Limited [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 (" Cigna ") at 391 392; Cardile v LED Builders Pty Limited [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 393, 399-400, 405 and 421-424.</text>

<text>37 In a rare category of cases the discovery of new facts will not be an essential requirement for the exercise of the power to set an order aside. Where, as in the present case, the enforcement of the order would work an injustice such that the Court's own order would be used to bring about a result that would be contrary to the very purpose of the order, the Court must have power under s 23 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) to set the order aside; see CSR Limited v Cigna Insurance Australia Limited [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 (" Cigna ") at 391 392; Cardile v LED Builders Pty Limited [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 393, 399-400, 405 and 421-424.

45 If the respondents are correct in their contention, the injustice would consist of a further delay in the carrying out of the scheme contained in Part VAA by sending these matters to a Committee in the absence of any evidence whatsoever of jurisdictional error on the part of the Committee. What the respondents seek to do is to prevent the processes of the Court from being abused and to protect the integrity of its processes; see Cigna at 391.

46 Of course, I have no view either way as to whether there was a live issue raised by Drs Do and Ho in the Committee although it must be noted that Mr Robinson conceded before me on the hearing of these motions that these matters are not "in the main" concerned with Regulation 11(b).

47 I therefore propose to give the applicants and the respondents an opportunity to address me on the question of whether Dr Do or Dr Ho relied on Regulation 11(b) before the Committee. I recognise, as did the Full Court in Oreb , that it may not have been necessary for the applicants to have referred specifically to Regulation 11(b). However, it should appear from the transcript, the evidence and the written submissions, whether the practitioners may be taken to have relied on that Regulation.</text>

<tocase>Health Insurance Commission v Grey [2002] FCAFC 130 ; (2002) 120 FCR 470</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/130.html</AustLII>
<text>38 There is a substantial public interest in the prompt resolution of matters arising under Part VAA of the Act. As the Full Court said in Health Insurance Commission v Grey [2002] FCAFC 130 ; (2002) 120 FCR 470 at [173] the object of the scheme is to protect patients and the Commonwealth against abuse of the system.

39 It would therefore be contrary to the public interest and, as I have said, contrary to the underlying purpose of the Order, to permit it to be used so as to further delay the resolution of these matters unless there is a live issue as to the application of Regulation 11(b), with evidence that the issue was in fact before the relevant Committee at the time of the hearings in 2002.

40 Order 3 was expressed as an agreement but it took effect as a consent order.</text>

<tocase>Oreb v Willcock [2004] FCA 1520</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1520.html</AustLII>
<text>1 I have before me two Notices of Motion filed by the respondents on 13 March 2006 seeking dismissal of these proceedings pursuant to an order which I made on 3 December 2004. The order which I made provided that subject to certain exceptions which are not presently relevant, the parties accepted that the outcome of the proceedings turned solely upon the result of an appeal from my judgment in Oreb v Willcock [2004] FCA 1520. The respondents contend that the result of the appeal leads to the dismissal of the present proceedings.

2 My judgment in Dr Oreb's matter was handed down three days before the making of the order of 3 December 2004. It dealt with an application for judicial review of three decisions made at separate stages of the peer review-based Professional Services Review Scheme established by Part VAA of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ("the Act ").

3 I dismissed Dr Oreb's challenge to an investigative referral made under s 86 of the Act as well as his challenge to an adjudicative referral made under s 93. However, I made an order setting aside the finding of Professional Services Review Committee No 298 that Dr Oreb had engaged in inappropriate practice. I did so because I found that the relevant Committee had erred in its construction of the "exceptional circumstances" exception contained in s 106KA(2) of the Act and Regulation 11(b) of the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review) Regulations 1999 ("the Regulations ") and that it had taken into account an irrelevant consideration, in asking itself whether the circumstances relied upon by Dr Oreb were foreseeable.

17 Counsel for the parties then agreed to the making of orders which included the following:-
 "3. Subject to issues raised in the constitutional argument, and except for the 'racial issue' in the two Lee matters (N568/03 and N1430/03), all of the parties in the remaining proceedings (Wong, Do, Ho, Lee, Lee and Bartos) accept that the outcome of the proceedings turn solely upon the result of the appeal in Oreb (being an appeal of the judgment contained in Oreb v Willcock [2004] FCA 1520). 
 
 4. On the basis of this agreement, the hearings listed in the week of 6 December 2004 in the matters Wong, Do, Ho, Lee, Lee and Bartos, are vacated with the exception of two Lee matters (N568/03 and N1430/03) which are listed on 8 December 2004."

18 The statutory scheme under Part VAA of the Act was set out in some detail in the reasons for judgment of Lander J in Oreb . It is unnecessary to repeat the extensive terms of the relevant provisions. However, for convenience, I will set out the provisions of 
 s 106KA of the Act and Regulation 11.

19 Section 106KA provides as follows:- 
 
 
 "(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (2A), if, during a particular period (the relevant period ), the circumstances in which some or all of the referred services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services, the conduct of the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating services during that period in those circumstances is taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice. 
 
 (2) If the person under review satisfies the Committee that, on a particular day or particular days during the relevant period, exceptional circumstances existed that affected the rendering or initiating of services by the person, the person's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services on that day or those days is not taken by subsection (1) to have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice. 
 
 (2A) However, subsection (2) does not affect the operation of subsection (1) in respect of the remaining day or days during the relevant period on which the person rendered or initiated referred services even if the circumstances in which the referred services were rendered or initiated on that day or those days would not, if considered alone, have constituted a prescribed pattern of services. 
 
 (3) The regulations may prescribe, in relation to: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a particular profession; or 
 
 
 
 (b) an identified group or groups of practitioners in a particular profession; 
 
 
 
 
 
 circumstances in which services of a particular kind or description that are rendered or initiated constitute, or do not constitute, a prescribed pattern of services for the purposes of subsection (1). 
 
 (4) The circumstances that may be prescribed under subsection (3) as circumstances in which services that are rendered or initiated constitute a prescribed pattern of services include, but are not limited to, the rendering or initiation of more than a specified number of services, or more than a specified number of services of a particular kind, on each of more than a specified number of days during a period of a specified duration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (5) The circumstances that constitute exceptional circumstances for the purposes of subsection (2) include, but are not limited to, circumstances that are declared by the regulations to be exceptional circumstances. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (6) This section only applies to services rendered or initiated after the commencement of this section. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (7) This section does not preclude the Committee from making a finding under this Subdivision (other than section 106KB) in relation to conduct during a particular period in connection with rendering or initiating services without considering whether or not the circumstances in which the services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services."</text>

<tocase>Oreb v Willcock [2005] FCAFC 196</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/196.html</AustLII>
<text>5 The decision of the Full Court on the appeal was handed down on 16 September 2005; see Oreb v Willcock [2005] FCAFC 196 (" Oreb " ).

6 Dr Oreb's appeal against my findings in relation to the investigative referral and the adjudicative referral was dismissed. The cross-appeal, though stated in the order of the Federal Court to have been allowed, failed in substance. It succeeded only on the form of one of the orders which I made at first instance.

7 The respondents' contention that the application of Dr Do ("Dr Do") and/or Dr Ho ("Dr Ho") must be dismissed is put in two ways. First, it is said to follow from the dismissal of Dr Oreb's appeal. Second, it is said to follow from the reasons given by the Full Court for dismissing the cross-appeal.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Nation (1995) 57 FCR 25</tocase>
<text>29 The meaning of Order 3 is to be ascertained by the ordinary rules of construction. It is appropriate, in accordance with the accepted rules of construction to construe the order in the context in which it was made; Repatriation Commission v Nation (1995) 57 FCR 25 at 33-34.

30 The context in which the order was made appears, at least in part, from the transcript of 3 December 2004. This shows that the parties proceeded on the basis that all issues, whether of fact or law, in the remaining cases would be resolved by the result of the appeal in Oreb . Thus, the outcome of the appeal in Oreb , expressed in the orders of the Full Court, would, without more, determine the outcome of the remaining proceedings, including the matters of Dr Do and Dr Ho.

31 There is nothing surprising about this approach to the meaning of my order because, construed in this way, "result" is given its ordinary English meaning. Moreover, this is reinforced by the use of the word "solely" which shows that the intention of the parties was that there were no new issues of fact or law to be determined in the remaining proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Wong v Professional Services Review Committee No 339 [2005] FCA 1351</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1351.html</AustLII>
<text>35 In Wong v Professional Services Review Committee No 339 [2005] FCA 1351 , I refused to make an order setting aside Order 3 to permit Dr Wong to run a fresh ground of review which was said to be previously unknown to the legal advisers.

36 It is true as I said in Wong at [12] that the principle of finality of litigation applies to interlocutory orders, subject to the moving party establishing that new facts have come into existence. In the present case it cannot be said that new facts have been discovered which could not have been known on 3 December 2004. Rather, through no fault of the legal advisers of the parties, the reasoning process of the Full Court in Oreb opened up a distinction between the construction of s 106KA(2) and Regulation 11 which had not previously been drawn.</text>
