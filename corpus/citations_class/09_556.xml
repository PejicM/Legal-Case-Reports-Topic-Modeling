<text>Branson J in Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 made similar observations at [13]-[16]: The nature of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act was considered in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 38 AAR 55 by Stone J and me particularly at [10]-[18]. We expressed our approval of the observation made by Gummow J in TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 19 ATR 1067 at 1069-1070 that an appeal "on a question of law" is narrower than an appeal that merely involves a question of law. As his Honour pointed out, where an appeal lies "on a question of law" the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law. That is, the subject matter of the appeal is the question or questions of law stated as required by O 53, r 3(2)(b).
 The legislature, by creating a statutory right of appeal to a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal in the narrow terms of s 44(1), disclosed an intention to limit the capacity of the Court on an appeal under s 44(1) to review factual findings of the Tribunal. An appeal pursuant to s 44(1) is thus quite different from an appeal from a judicial body under s 24 of the Federal Court Act. An appeal under s 24 is an appeal by way of rehearing (see, Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 131 ; (2005) 220 ALR 211 at [35] - [47] ). The subject matter of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act is (shorn of the requirement to determine what, if any, entitlement to relief flows from the answer to the question or questions of law) of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law to the Court made under s 45 of the AAT Act.
 In Birdseye Stone J and I also expressed approval of the observation of Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corp v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 527 that:
 
If the question, properly analysed, is not a question of law no amount of formulary like "erred in law" or "was open as a matter of law" can make it into a question of law.
 
 A mixed question of fact and law is not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the AAT Act. Stone J and I observed in Birdseye (at [18]):
 
In our view, O 53 r 3(2) discloses an intention that a question of law to be raised on an appeal from the Tribunal should be stated with precision as a pure question of law. It is in the specification of the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought that, in our view, one should expect to find the links between the question of law, the circumstances of the particular case and the orders sought on the appeal.</text>

<text>An appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (AAT Act) to this Court is solely "on a question of law". As Gummow J pointed out in TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 , at 178: 
 The existence of a question of law is now not merely a qualifying condition to ground the appeal, but also the subject matter of the appeal itself: FCT v Brixius (1987) 87 ATC 4963 at 4967.
