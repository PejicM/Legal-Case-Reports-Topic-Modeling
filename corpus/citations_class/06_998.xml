<text>The second ground of appeal is that the appellant was denied natural justice in that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 in relation to country information, especially DFAT information. However that provision is not available to the appellant because of sub-s (3), which excludes from the ambit of sub-s (1) information 
 
 "that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member." 
 

The country information in question fits that description. See WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330 at [44] - [46] ; NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328 at [128] ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 at [64] - [71] and [126]-[128].</text>
