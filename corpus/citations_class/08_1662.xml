<text>1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 11 July 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") handed down on 2 October 2007: see SZLOC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 930. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship not to grant a protection visa to the appellant.

2 The appellant is a citizen of India, from the district of Kerala, who entered Australia on 10 April 2007. On 19 April 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 31 May 2007. On 27 June 2007 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.

3 The appellant claimed fear of persecution on the basis of his political opinion. The appellant claimed that he was involved in the Student Federation of India (SFI), the student wing of the Communist Party (Marxist) ("CP(M)") for a number of years. He claimed that the SFI comes under the Democratic Youth Federation of India which is part of the CP(M). The appellant claimed that he faced serious harassment on a number of occasions from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad which is the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The appellant provided the Tribunal with two membership "cards" for the SFI. He claimed that he erected posters, assisted with doorknocking campaigns for the SFI and stood for a student representative election while in Year 8 at high school.

4 The appellant claimed that he and/or his family had been attacked in December 1995 and in 2006. He said that in the 2006 attack his right leg was injured and showed the Tribunal a scar on his knee. He provided the Tribunal with a doctor's certificate which referred to "traumatic injuries both legs from 5.2 06 to 25.2 06."

5 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth. The Tribunal found that the appellant's claims that he was a member of the SFI were unsupported. The Tribunal said that it could not rely on the membership documents because the documents were incomplete. The appellant had presented two consecutive receipts for memberships covering one period and he gave evidence that the party membership documents were not originals but had been completed by persons assisting him with his protection visa application.</text>
