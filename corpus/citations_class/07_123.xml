<text>3 In NAGM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 395 , Sackville, Allsop and Jacobson JJ said at [6] that "an order dismissing an application for want of jurisdiction is interlocutory in character, at least where the order does not necessarily finally dispose of the rights of the parties." However in two recent cases, single judges of this Court have specifically considered the nature of summary dismissal under r 13.10 and concluded that it is final in nature: NADZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 975 at [29] per Graham J; MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [18] per Kenny J.</text>
