<text>4 On 15 April 2002 a motion was filed seeking the removal of RY (now deceased) as a named applicant. The motion was purportedly brought on behalf of the applicants. It was heard on 10 December 2002 and dismissed on 13 December 2002. That dismissal was based on the inadequacy of the authorisation process in relation to the proposed replacement applicants: Anderson v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1558.</text>

<text>6 On 4 December 2003, the Court decided a motion which sought amendments to the Ballardong application by contracting its boundaries so that the balance of the area covered by it would fall outside the area of the Single Noongar Claim. The contracted application was to be called the Nulla Nulla application. The motion also sought an order replacing the 16 named applicants (two of whom were then deceased) with four applicants who would be the authorised applicants for the reduced claim. There were then two dissenters within the ranks of the applicants. Serious inadequacies existed in the evidence going to the important question whether the replacement proposal had been authorised by the native title claim group. The motion to amend was dismissed: Anderson v Western Australia [2003] FCA 1423 ; (2003) 134 FCR 1. Because of the ongoing stalemate a springing order was made which would have dismissed the application on or before 31 March 2004 unless one of the following events occurred: 
 
 (a) a motion was filed, agreed to by all named applicants, to amend the application or to seek further programming orders in relation to it; 
 (b) an application was filed by members of the native title claim group pursuant to s 66B of the NT Act seeking replacement of the applicants. 
 
 The springing order was averted by the filing of a new motion.</text>

<text>7 On 15 June 2004, the new motion which sought to replace the 16 named applicants with four new applicants: Reg Hayden, Doug Nelson, Dorcus Pickett and Reg Young, was dismissed. The authority for that change was said to derive from resolutions passed at a meeting held in Quairading in February 2004: Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 760. There were authorisation difficulties associated with the motion and related motions which were designed to have the effect of combining all applications in the south west into one application covering the bulk of the south west area. The process by which it was sought to achieve that result was flawed and the orders sought under s 66B for replacement of applicants in the various applications could not be made. The motion was dismissed in relation to the orders sought under that section.
 
 

Amendments were also sought which would have contracted the Ballardong application so that it did not overlap with the Single Noongar claim. However because of internal difficulties among the applicants and in the absence of evidence of a truly representative meeting, I was not prepared to allow those amendments. I did however make an order for the removal of two deceased applicants: William Riley and Alex Yarran.

8 On 13 July 2007 a motion was filed seeking orders in the following terms: 
 
 
 1. That Alan Jones, Winnie McHenry, Doug Nelson, Reg Hayden, Saul Yarran, Ricky Nelson, RR (now deceased), Tim Riley, Dianne Taylor, Reg Yarran Jnr, Murray Yarran, Fay Slater and Carol Holmes on behalf of the Ballardong people ("the Proposed Applicant") do jointly replace the current Applicant on the grounds that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) RY Snr is now deceased and therefore can no longer be authorised by the claim group to make the application or deal with matters arising in relation to it; 
 
 (b) Cedric Anderson, Donald Collard, Sylvia Rachel Collard and RY [who died after the filing of the motion] are no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; and 
 
 (c) The Proposed Applicant is authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. That the applicant as re-constituted by order 1 above be granted leave (to the extent that leave may be required) to amend the application by filing a Form 19 in the form of annexure "A" to the affidavit of Simon Charles Blackshield sworn 13 July 2007. 
 
 3. Such further or other orders as to the Court seems fit.

9 The proposed amendment referred to in [2] above involved the insertion, in the application, at the end of [3] under the heading "Internal boundaries" in Attachment B of the following: 
 
 
 (j) all areas of land and water which did not fall within the external boundary of native title determination application WAD6006 of 2003 (SNC Area 1) as at 1 July 2007.
 
 

The motion was supported by a number of affidavits filed with it. It is convenient to set out in summary form the substance of these affidavits.
