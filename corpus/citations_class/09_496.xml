<tocase>Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation v Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 300</tocase>
<text>On 30 March 2009, I delivered reasons for judgment and made orders as a consequence of those reasons ( Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation v Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 300).

The orders which I made on 30 March 2009 were interlocutory. The proceedings have been listed before me today for final hearing. As was the case on 30 March 2009, there has been no appearance either by or on behalf of the respondent although the listing of the matter today was notified to the respondent at its registered office. The matter has also been called outside the Court.

In the circumstances, the applicant seeks relief in the absence of the respondent. The relief which the applicant seeks is set out in Short Minutes of Order which have been handed up to me and which I shall mark as MFI-1.</text>
