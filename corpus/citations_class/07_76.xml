<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Gruber (1998) 43 NSWLR 271</tocase>
<text>11 The word "address" bears many meanings: see, for example, those collected in Sheen v Burke [1993] 1 VR 584 at 586. The meaning to be attributed to the word as it appears in s 222AOF(1) of the Act , must be discerned from the legislative context in which it appears. Section 222AOF is a facilitative provision. When read with s 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act , it provides for various methods by which the notices contemplated by s 222AOE may be served on directors who the Commissioner of Taxation considers are liable to pay penalties when a company fails to meet its statutory obligations. One method of service is the sending of notices by prepaid post to "an address" that "appears" from returns lodged by the relevant company with the ASC to be the director's place of residence or business. Service would be deemed to be effected even if the notice is not received by the director: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Gruber (1998) 43 NSWLR 271 at 277. Evidence by a director that he or she has not received a notice served in accordance with a provision such as s 28A or s 29 of the Acts Interpretation Act does not constitute proof of non delivery: Fancourt v Mercantile Credits Ltd [1983] HCA 25 ; (1983) 154 CLR 87 at 96-97.</text>

<text>5 Notwithstanding the infelicities of language which beset the proposed amended application and the procedural problems to which it gives rise, it was clear from her written submissions that there were two grounds on which the applicant sought to rely in order to avoid liability to pay the penalties referred to in the notices. They were that the "address" appearing on the various notices and on the envelopes in which they were posted did not constitute an "address" within the meaning of the Act and that the Australian Securities Commission ("ASC") documents to which the respondent had resort for the purpose of ascertaining the applicant's "address" were not "ASC documents" within the meaning of s 222AOF of the Act . The parties were agreed that the determination of these two points would avoid unnecessary delay and expense and agreed that the Court should hear argument and resolve them on a final basis. The applicant contended and the respondent conceded that the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act . There was a justiciable controversy between the parties as to whether or not a statutory precondition to the recovery by the respondent of penalties from the applicant had been satisfied. If the precondition had not been satisfied no obligation to make payments would have arisen and the applicant would have been immune from any liability to pay the penalties: c.f. Felton v Mulligan [1971] HCA 39 ; (1971) 124 CLR 367 at 374, 408, 416; Guss v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88 at 91, 103.</text>
