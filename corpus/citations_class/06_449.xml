<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201</tocase>

<text>46 Against this, s 424B(2) and s 424B(3)(b) each provide that where no period is prescribed, the information or comments are to be given within a reasonable period. Mr Potts drew attention to the power of the RRT to extend the period to respond to an invitation contained in s 424B(4). It may well be that this power can be exercised after the initial prescribed period has expired; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201 at [51] .

47 A difficult question of construction and reconciliation of the provisions of Div 4 of Part 7 with the privative clause in s 474 of the Act would arise if the RRT were to specify in its s 424 or 424A invitation a period of 13 days to respond, and, in the absence of a response within that period, the RRT proceeded to make a decision on the review without further action, as apparently authorised by s 424C and s 425(2)(c).

48 However, I am relieved from answering that question because of the circumstances in which the apparent breach of s 424B(2) occurred in the present case. What I have to determine is whether the breach complained of gave rise to jurisdictional error. That cannot be answered by simply posing the question of breach or no breach; it is necessary to consider whether in the particular circumstances the breach had that result.

49 I do not see how, having regard to the language of s 424B(2) or the scope of Div 4, a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach. This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425.

50 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.</text>

<tocase>NACI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 154</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2002/154.html</AustLII>
<text>43 A failure to give the additional information requested under s 424 , or to give the comments pursuant to an invitation given under s 424A , before the time specified, or any extended period, authorises the RRT to make a decision on the review without taking any further action; see s 424C and s 425(2)(C) ; see also NACI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 154.

44 Moreover, a failure to give the information or the comments before the specified time relieves the RRT of its obligation to invite an applicant to give evidence and present arguments at an oral hearing; see s 425(2)(c). Indeed, failure to give the information or to provide the comments removes any entitlement of an applicant to appear before the RRT; see s 425(3).</text>

<text>45 It might be thought therefore that the time limits fixed by the Act and the Regulations must be adhered to strictly. Further support for this view is to be found in the observation of Sackville J in NAWR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1520 at [33] and [35], that no period other than the period of 14 days for the initial prescribed period or 28 days for the further prescribed period can be specified.</text>

<text>30 The question of whether a breach of s 424B(2) gives rise to jurisdictional error is to be answered by having regard to the language of the section and the scope and object of the whole statute; the question is whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid; Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1989) 194 CLR 355 at [91] , [93]; see also SAAP at [73], [205].</text>

<tocase>SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/24.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones considered at some length the effect of the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 (" SAAP "). His Honour came to the view that the purpose and legislative context of s 424B was to be contrasted with that of s 424A , such that the legislative intention was not to be that a breach of the time provision in s 424B(2) would lead to the invalidation of a decision made following a breach of the section.

29 As I have said, the Minister conceded that the RRT's s 424 letter breached s 424B(2) of the Act by specifying a date for response which was outside the prescribed period. It may seem curious that what would appear to be an indulgence extended to an applicant could nonetheless constitute a breach. However, I do not suggest that the concession was wrongly made.

30 The question of whether a breach of s 424B(2) gives rise to jurisdictional error is to be answered by having regard to the language of the section and the scope and object of the whole statute; the question is whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid; Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1989) 194 CLR 355 at [91] , [93]; see also SAAP at [73], [205].

31 In SAAP , a majority of the Court held that a breach of s 424A was jurisdictional in nature so that a decision handed down after the breach was rendered invalid by it.

32 Their Honours pointed to the mandatory language of s 424A and to the purpose of the provision which McHugh J described at [77] as "one of the centrepieces of... (the) regime of statutory procedural fairness."; see also at [165]-[166], [173] per Kirby J, and at [205]-[208] per Hayne J.

52 Relief may be refused inter alia, where there has been waiver or acquiescence in the invalidity of the decision or where an applicant has suffered no injustice; see Re Refugee Review Tribunal ; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [57] - [58] ; see also SAAP at [80].</text>

<tocase>SZDQL v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 769</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/769.html</AustLII>
<text>33 The question of whether a breach of s 424B(3)(b) of the Act resulted in jurisdictional error was raised in SZDQL v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 769 (" SZDQL") . However, Sackville J found that the provision was not breached. It was therefore unnecessary to decide whether a contravention of s 424B(3) constituted jurisdictional error. His Honour said that the issue should be left to a case in which the court had the benefit of full argument; see at [50], [53].

34 I have been much assisted by the written and oral submissions of both Counsel. I am indebted to Mr Zipser for accepting the brief for the appellant pro bono pursuant to an order I made under Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules .

35 Mr Zipser submitted that the language of s 424B(2), though not using the imperative "must" was nonetheless mandatory in nature. He also pointed to the object of the section as a part of the statutory procedural fairness regime which is codified in Div 4 of Part 7 of the Act .

38 Support for the view I have expressed as to the object of the provision may be found in Sackville J's observation in SZDQL at [50] as to the statutory purpose of s 424B(3)(b). His Honour said that its object is to ensure that the required interview takes place within a reasonably short period of the invitation.

39 Section 424B(3)(b) operates in a slightly different way from s 424B(2). The effect of s 424B(3)(b) is that the RRT may stipulate a time for the interview at any time within the prescribed period. There is an outer time limit within which the interview may take place but the RRT may appoint any date within the period, indeed, at the very hearing at which the invitation is extended; SZDQL at [50].

40 By contrast, s 424B(2) is directed to the provision of information and comments by an applicant and when read with Reg 4.35(3), it sets an opening and closing period of 14 days after receipt of the invitation. It would be open to the invitee to provide the information or comments within that 14 day period but it is not open to the RRT to specify a date before the closing of that period by which the information or comments must be provided.

41 I do not consider that this difference in the operation of the two subsections leads to a different view of their objects. It seems to me that what Sackville J said in SZDQL as to the object of s 424B(3)(b) applies equally to s 424B(2).

42 However, it seems to me that there is a further aspect of the statutory purpose of those subsections which must be borne in mind when answering the question of whether a breach is jurisdictional in nature. This appears from a consideration of the part which those subsections play in the codified regime of procedural fairness contained in Div 4 of Part 7 of the Act .</text>
