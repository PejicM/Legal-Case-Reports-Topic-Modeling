<tocase>State of Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In liq) (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1991) 30 FCR 102</tocase>
<text>A prima facie case is made out if, on the material before the court, inferences are open which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed (per French J, as his Honour then was, in State of Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd (In liq) (Receiver and Manager Appointed) (1991) 30 FCR 102 at 110).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/70.html</AustLII>
<text>The matter stipulated in respect of which the court is to be satisfied does not call for the kind of scrutiny that would occur in a submission of 'no case to answer' following the closure of an applicant's case at trial. A court may, when confronted with an application for leave, draw inferences more readily in favour of an applicant, bearing in mind, amongst other things, that the applicant will not have had the advantage of discovery, subpoenas and other procedural aids to the making out of a prima facie case at trial (per Heerey J in Merpro Montassa Limited v Conoco Speciality Products Inc [1991] FCA 70 ; (1991) 28 FCR 387 at 390).</text>

<tocase>WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1992/510.html</AustLII>
<text>In relation to satisfying the court that an applicant has a prima facie case for the relief claimed by it, such a preliminary question should not call for a substantial inquiry. The kind of evidence adduced on a preliminary inquiry of this kind should be in proportion to the nature of such an interlocutory issue. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine by way of a mini rather than a mega trial whether the applicant has a prima facie case (per Beaumont J in WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472 at 476).

Whatever is required to satisfy the court that there is a prima facie case, that satisfaction should leave open the possibility that the respondent could move to strike out the statement of claim or invoke s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('Federal Court Act'), which makes provision for orders for, amongst other things, summary dismissal or provisions of the Rules which provide for the summary disposition of proceedings. To do otherwise may be setting too high a threshold for service out of the jurisdiction.</text>

<tocase>Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365</tocase>
<text>Except in extreme cases, Order 8 rule 3(2)(c) will not require a prima facie case in respect of each cause of action pleaded or contended for. If a prima facie case for a particular form of relief is made out on one cause of action, it is immaterial that a prima facie case for the same relief on another cause of action may not be made out (per Lindgren J in Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365 ('Cell Tech') at 373; see also per Carr J in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317 ('Bray') at [47]-[55] and per Branson J at [176]-[191]).

In Cell Tech a joint venture business had failed. Cell Tech's application was accompanied by a statement of claim seeking damages. Three causes of action were relevantly pleaded, two of which were against Nokia. As against Nokia, Cell Tech pleaded that it breached implied terms and conditions as to fitness for purpose and merchantable quality in respect of goods which it sold to Cell Tech. The other cause of action pleaded against Nokia was that it breached the terms and conditions of a Licence Agreement between Cell Tech and Nokia. 
Lindgren J observed that there was a significant overlap between the facts on which the two causes of action were based. His Honour proceeded on the basis that:
 
 
 '...if a prima facie case against Nokia for damages based on either cause of action is established it becomes unnecessary ... to decide whether a prima facie case for the same relief based upon the other cause of action [was] also made out.' 
 

 
 
 (at page 373) 
 

 
Lindgren J held that Nokia's claim for relief under Order 9 rule 7(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) should be dismissed. 
 Conclusions

Contrary to Fujitsu Limited's submission, Lindgren J did not hold that a court could not be satisfied in respect of the matter covered by Order 8 rule 3(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules unless the applicant satisfied the court that it had a prima facie case for 'the relief claimed by it' in the sense of each and every element of the relief claimed.

Apart from other considerations such a construction would be absurd. How, one might task, could a prima facie case for relief which is at the discretion of the court under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act or under s 51A of the Federal Court Act or for costs, be the subject of the requisite satisfaction.</text>

<tocase>Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317</tocase>
<text>Except in extreme cases, Order 8 rule 3(2)(c) will not require a prima facie case in respect of each cause of action pleaded or contended for. If a prima facie case for a particular form of relief is made out on one cause of action, it is immaterial that a prima facie case for the same relief on another cause of action may not be made out (per Lindgren J in Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365 ('Cell Tech') at 373; see also per Carr J in Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 317 ('Bray') at [47]-[55] and per Branson J at [176]-[191]).

Ho v Akai Pty Limited (in liquidation) [2006] FCAFC 159 ; (2006) 24 ACLC 1526 ('Ho') was an appeal from a judgment of Gyles J given under Order 9 rule 7 of the Federal Court Rules . The only issue before Gyles J was whether Akai Holdings and its liquidator had established a prima facie case for the relief sought in the proceeding against Mr Ho which satisfied Order 8 rule 3(2)(c) or its predecessor. Questions arose as to whether Mr Ho had a liability as a 'shadow director' and also whether he had a liability as an 'officer' of Akai Australia. Gyles J concluded that there was no sufficient basis for raising an arguable case that Mr Ho was a shadow director, but that there was an arguable case that he was an 'officer' of Akai Australia. Because of the construction given to Order 8 rule 3(2)(c), or its predecessor in Bray , the finding that there was a prima facie case that Ho was an officer of Akai had the consequence that he could be proceeded against on both the 'officer' and 'shadow director' bases, Gyles J having held that a prima facie case had been made out 'for the relief sought'. In Ho Finn, Weinberg and Rares JJ granted leave to appeal from the judgment of Gyles J but proceeded to dismiss each appeal. At [56] their Honours observed, by way of obiter dicta, that: 
 
 '...[A]ccording to Bray , it is not the similarity in elements of the cause of action that is brought into question for O 8 r 2(2)(c) purposes. Rather it is similarity in the relief sought.'

Finn, Weinberg and Rares JJ considered that the difference between the two types of claim for relief in insolvent trading cases did not reflect in substance merely a choice as to two different measures of compensation. They observed that the two species of relief served different purposes, had different statutorily prescribed measures and were required to be specified individually in an application, including an application served out of the jurisdiction. In those circumstances their Honours opined that relief sought under s 1317H of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) was not the same as that sought under s 588J (or for that matter s 588M). In addition, they described s 1317H as a general provision but s 588J (or s 588M) as a specific provision creating a remedy in a particular situation. They observed that the ordinary principle of statutory construction was that in cases in which ss 588J or 588M provided a remedy, s 1317H , being a general provision, would not apply. In the circumstances, Finn, Weinberg and Rares JJ doubted the correctness of Gyles J's conclusion that the principle in Bray's case would save the shadow director claim against Mr Ho from being struck out.

The observations so made were qualified by their Honours saying at [58]: 
 
 'However, because of the different conclusion we have reached in that claim to that of Gyles J, the views we have expressed above on the application of Bray have no actual consequence.'

In my opinion Ho is not authority for the proposition that satisfaction under Order 8 rule 3(2) cannot be reached unless an applicant has a prima facie case for each and every item of relief claimed in the proceeding. If, at an interlocutory stage, a prima facie case is made out for trade practices relief, it matters not whether that relief is ordered under s 82 or 87 of the Trade Practices Act or s 68 or s 72 of the Fair Trading Act . They provide choices in respect of the same conduct. In relation to claims for relief under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act and/or s 72 of the Fair Trading Act no greater specificity is required than is contained in the applicant's prayer for relief numbered 2 in its Amended Application.

The present case is not one where discrete relief is applicable for a particular contravention of one provision of the relevant legislation and different relief is applicable where there is a contravention of a different provision in the same legislation.

The first respondent's further submission that the applicant's claims for relief under the Trade Practices Act and/or the Fair Trading Act (NSW) ought not to be permitted, since the entirety of the wrongful conduct on its behalf, assuming it to be wrongful, occurred outside Australia, should be rejected.

The concession made by Fujitsu Limited that the brochure published and printed in English in the United States of America was made available for distribution in Australia by it and that it was involved in the use in Australia of that promotional material, coupled with Fujitsu Limited's provision to/making available of copies of the brochure in English printed by it in Japan, to Fujitsu Australia Limited, which disclosed that Fujitsu Australia Limited was Fujitsu Limited's 'local representative', is quite inconsistent with the first respondent's submission.</text>

<tocase>Hunter Grain Pty Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd [1993] FCA 133 ; (1993) 117 ALR 507</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/133.html</AustLII>
<text>Contrary to the first respondent's submissions, Hunter Grain Pty Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd [1993] FCA 133 ; (1993) 117 ALR 507 ('Hunter Grain') does not support the first respondent's position. Hunter Grain was a decision of Sheppard J in a matter in which the Court had jurisdiction under the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). There were two defendants, the second being a company identified by the abbreviation 'Malaysian' and the first was Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd ('Hyundai').

The second defendant owned the ship known as the 'Bunga Kenanga' and the first defendant was the charterer of that ship. The ship was also the subject of a voyage charter made between the first defendant and PS International Ltd of Indiana in the United States of America.

The case concerned the shipment of 3,352 tonnes of soyabean meal in bulk from Portland, Oregon, in the United States, to Brisbane. When the soyabean meal was loaded on to the ship it became contaminated by the introduction of a substantial quantity of soda ash (sodium carbonate) into the hold. The problem arose because there was a residue of soda ash in the loading equipment used to load the ship. 
The shipper, PS International Ltd, was the vendor of the soyabean meal.
 
A clean bill of lading was signed by a person designated at 'Authorised Rep of Carrier or Master'. Under the heading 'Consignee' were typed the words 'To Shippers Order'. The plaintiff, Hunter Grain Pty Limited, was the party to be notified of the arrival of the ship. The bill of lading was endorsed to the plaintiff. Accordingly, it had transferred to it and vested in it all rights of action in respect of the goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading had been made with it.

Sheppard J held that the trade practices cause of action must fail because relevantly, the conduct of the first defendant and its agent concluded when the 'Authorised Rep of Carrier or Master' signed the bill of lading on behalf of the first defendant and sent it to the vendor, PS International Limited's forwarding agents in the United States. 
The conduct said to be misleading or deceptive of which the plaintiff complained, so far as it concerned each of the defendants, was undertaken entirely in the United States. PS International Ltd was not a defendant. Whilst it was open to the Court to impute to Hyundai knowledge that the bill of lading would be used by the shipper to obtain payment for the cargo and Hyundai's employees and agents knew that it was important that the bill contain a clean receipt, otherwise the bank would not pay under the letter of credit, Sheppard J held that the relevant wrongful act in relation to the bill of lading was committed by PS International Ltd when it proffered the bill of lading to the plaintiff and its bank, which events did occur in Australia.

The present case is not one where the entirety of Fujitsu Limited's wrongful conduct, assuming it to be wrongful, occurred in Japan or other places in the world outside Australia. It was in Australia that Fujitsu Limited made its brochures, whether printed in the United States of America or Japan, available for proliferation amongst potential purchasers of Fujitsu MPG3 hard disk drives.

The final submission of the first respondent was to the effect that conduct engaged in by Mr Rixon in providing brochures about Fujitsu MPG3 hard disk drives and the making of representations in relation to them could not be said to be conduct engaged in on behalf of Fujitsu Limited. Even if this were correct, it would not assist the first respondent given that it made the brochures about Fujitsu MPG3 hard disk drives available in Australia to Fujitsu Australia Limited for proliferation amongst potential purchasers of its MPG3 hard disk drives.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1558.html</AustLII>
<text>In any event, I would respectfully adopt the view expressed by Lindgren J in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd [2000] FCA 1558 ; (2000) 107 FCR 270 at [1244] which accorded with the view taken by Kiefel J in Lisciandro v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1995] FCA 1527 ; [1995] ATPR 41-436 at 40,903-40,904. Lindgren J's view was that an act is done 'on behalf of' a corporation for the purpose of s 84(2) of the Trade Practices Act if, relevantly, the actor engaged in the conduct intending to do so 'for' the corporation. In this case it could be said that Mr Rixon handed over brochures provided by Fujitsu Limited to the applicant 'for' Fujitsu Limited, whose brochures they were, even though he was himself an employee of Fujitsu Australia Limited. Why else, one might ask, would Fujitsu Limited have made the brochures available in Australia if not to assist in promotion of the sale of its MPG3 hard disk drives? 
It would seem to me that, on an interlocutory basis, it could be said that Mr Rixon's conduct was conduct engaged in with, at least, the implied consent of the director, servant or agent of Fujitsu Limited responsible for the promotion of the sale of Fujitsu MPG3 hard disk drives in Australia, sufficient to constitute Mr Rixon's conduct, conduct of Fujitsu Limited in accordance with s 84(2)(b) of the Trade Practices Act .</text>
