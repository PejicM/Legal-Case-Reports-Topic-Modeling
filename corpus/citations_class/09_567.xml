<text>Embarrassment in the context of O 11 r 16 includes a pleading "which is susceptible of various meanings, or contains inconsistent allegations or in which alternatives are confusingly intermixed or in which irrelevant allegations are made tending to increase expense. This list is not intended to be exhaustive": Bartlett v Swan Television &amp; Radio Broadcasters Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 1429 ; [1995] ATPR 41-434 at 40,889 per Carr J.

For reasons I will give, the plaintiffs' pleading in the ASOC in relation to the ABB Grain basis contract is embarrassing and should be struck out. Again, for reasons I will give, the pleading in the proposed SASOC does not overcome the defects, and leave to amend in terms of that document will be refused. The plaintiffs may apply for leave to replead their cause of action in relation to the ABB Grain basis contract, but I will hear from the parties if such an application is made.

In the proposed SASOC, the plaintiffs plead a cause of action against ABB Grain which is not pleaded in the ASOC. The cause of action is a breach of a duty of care allegedly owed by ABB Grain to the plaintiffs. Counsel for the third defendant put persuasive arguments in support of the proposition that such a duty could not arise as a matter of law (see [56] below), but it may assist the parties if I indicate that, on the submissions to date, I would not be disposed to conclude that the allegation was unarguable in the relevant sense.</text>

<tocase>Coulls v Bagot's Executor and Trustee Co Ltd [1967] HCA 3 ; (1967) 119 CLR 460</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1967/3.html</AustLII>
<text>If it be assumed (as is probably the case), that a failure by a seller to deliver wheat or barley under forward contracts of the type in question in this case would ordinarily lead to an award of damages rather than an order for specific performance, then, putting to one side for the present the effect of washout provisions, it would only be in a very loose sense that it could be said that the seller's obligations could be wholly settled by cash, rather than the delivery of the property. I do not think that that is what s 761D(3)(a)(ii) means. It seems to me that the important words in the paragraph are arrangement , permit and rather than . It seems to me that those words mean that the option wholly to settle an obligation by cash must be in the arrangement, it must be vested in the seller and the alternatives of paying cash or delivering the property must be of a similar nature or standing. The "option" of paying damages is not an option provided by the arrangement, nor is it of a similar nature or standing as the obligation to deliver the property. As Windeyer J said in Coulls v Bagot's Executor and Trustee Co Ltd [1967] HCA 3 ; (1967) 119 CLR 460 (at 504): 
 "The primary obligation of a party to a contract is to perform it, to keep his promise. That is what the law requires of him. If he fails to do so, he incurs a liability to pay damages. That however is the ancillary remedy for his violation of the other party's primary right to have him carry out his promise. It is, I think, a faulty analysis of legal obligations to say that the law treats a promisor as having a right to elect either to perform his promise or to pay damages."

The obligation to pay damages arises when the seller breaches his obligations, not when he settles them. The buyer's right to recover nominal damages in certain circumstances reinforces the point. There is also force in the submission of counsel for ABB Grain that it is inherently unlikely that Parliament would have intended that the application of a provision such as paragraph (ii), with all the consequences that flow therefrom, would turn on whether the discretionary remedy of specific performance was likely to be awarded.

I turn now to the plaintiffs' second submission in relation to this paragraph, namely, that the washout provisions in the forward contracts mean that they fall outside the terms of paragraph (ii) because they permit the seller's (that is, the plaintiffs') obligations to be wholly settled by cash, rather than the delivery of the property. I reject that submission because the washout provisions are of a different nature and have a different operation to a permission in the arrangement for the seller's obligations to be wholly settled by cash. First, the washout provisions in the case of the ABB Grain first forward contract only operate if the plaintiffs suffer production failure, and they only operate in the case of the ABB second forward contract and the Glencore Grain forward contract if the seller finds that he is or will be in default. Secondly, it is correct to say that, in essence, the washout provisions operate at the option of the buyer, not the seller. Thirdly, where invoked, the washout provisions result in a measure of damages similar to that specified in s 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1895 (SA) brought forward to a time at which it has become obvious to the seller that he or she will not be able to meet the obligation to deliver the goods.</text>

<tocase>Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1964</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1964.html</AustLII>
<text>The plaintiffs filed and served a Statement of Claim on 4 August 2008. That pleading was replaced by an Amended Statement of Claim ("ASOC") filed and served on 18 November 2008. On 23 December 2008, I made an order striking out the ASOC against Glencore Grain ( Keynes v Rural Directions Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1964). That led to an application by the plaintiffs for leave to file and serve a Second Amended Statement of Claim ("the proposed SASOC").

There are three notices of motion before me which, in chronological order, are a notice of motion by Glencore Grain, a notice of motion by the plaintiffs and a notice of motion by ABB Grain. Before summarising the orders sought in those notices of motion and the evidence adduced in support of the motions, it is convenient to summarise the relevant allegations in the pleadings. The plaintiffs' claim against ABB Grain

The existing Statement of Claim against ABB Grain is the ASOC. It will be necessary to consider also the proposed SASOC to determine whether it overcomes the defects I find exist in the ASOC.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/66.html</AustLII>
<text>A failure by a seller of goods to comply with an obligation to deliver the goods may give rise to an action for damages by the buyer for non-delivery (see, for example, s 50(1) of Sale of Goods Act 1895 (SA)). The measure of damages where there is an available market for the goods in question is " prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered..." (see, for example, s 50(3) of Sale of Goods Act 1895 (SA)). Where there is no difference, or where a buyer fails to adduce evidence of actual damage, he or she may nevertheless recover nominal damages for breach of contract: Luna Park (NSW) Ltd v Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd [1938] HCA 66 ; (1938) 61 CLR 286. On occasions, a Court may order specific performance of a contract for the sale and delivery of goods (see, for example, s 51 of the Sale of Goods Act 1895 (SA)). Generally speaking, a Court will not order specific performance where the goods in question are readily obtainable in the market.</text>
