<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99</tocase>
<text>33 If legal expenses are properly treated as having been incurred by a taxpayer in defending the manner of his performance of his duties, the expenses will be deductible. If a liability is incurred, or a claim is encountered, because of the very act of performing the work by which a taxpayer earns assessable income, the expense will be deductible. If a proceeding in respect of which legal expenses are incurred arises from activities by which a taxpayer earns his income or the mode of his performance of a particular task carried out in the course of earning his income, the legal expenses incurred in relation to that proceeding will be deductible. That is to say, if the cause or the purpose of a taxpayer's incurring of legal expenses is his assertion that he had faithfully performed the duties by which he had earned assessable income, the expenditure will be deductible ( Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99 at 113 (' Rowe ').

34 If incurring costs can be shown to contribute to the success of an employee in defending himself from dismissal from his employment and costs are incurred to preserve the employee's entitlement to receive, in return for his services, assessable income, the costs will be deductible ( Rowe at 115-116). If legal expenses are incurred by an employee in defending himself from dismissal, the expenditure will be incurred on revenue account and not capital account ( Rowe at 118). Whether or not legal expenses constitute an outgoing of a capital nature or an outgoing on account of revenue depends upon the cause or the purpose of incurring the expense. It is therefore necessary to consider the object in view when the legal proceedings were undertaken or the situation that impelled a taxpayer to undertake the proceedings ( Hallstroms Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 647).</text>

<tocase>Herald and Weekly Times Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1932] HCA 56 ; (1932) 48 CLR 113</tocase>

<text>32 If that which produces assessable income for a taxpayer is what exposes the taxpayer to a liability or claim that is discharged by expenditure, that expenditure will be deductible. Even if, when the expenditure is actually paid by a taxpayer, the taxpayer was actuated in paying the expenditure, not by a desire to produce income, but by the necessity of satisfying a liability or claim to which the taxpayer had become subject in deriving assessable income, the expenditure will be still deductible. The question of whether money is expended in and for the production of assessable income is not to be determined by considering only the immediate reason for making the payment, but must also be determined by having regard to the purpose for which the liability or claim that gives rise to the expenditure was incurred (see Herald and Weekly Times Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1932] HCA 56 ; (1932) 48 CLR 113 at 118).</text>

<tocase>IEL Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 267</tocase>

<text>67 The Commissioner accepts that an issue estoppel can arise out of a judgment or order given on an appeal from an objection decision in relation to a particular year of income, which can be pleaded in a subsequent appeal in relation to a different year of income. Nevertheless, the prerequisites for the existence of an issue estoppel must be satisfied. That is to say, it must be demonstrated that the issue in respect of which an estoppel is raised is the same issue as was determined or, by necessary implication, must have been determined as between the parties in order for the earlier order or judgment to have been made or given. Thus, it must be established that the issue raised in a subsequent proceeding in respect of which an estoppel is pleaded was an issue the determination of which was an essential and fundamental step in leading to the judgment or order in the earlier proceeding. The issue might be one of fact or law or of mixed fact and law but it must be the same issue (see generally IEL Finance Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 267).

68 Clearly enough, there is some connection between the advice given by Mr Jackson QC and the advice and appearances of Mr Gageler SC and Mr Roberts SC in relation to the Third Charges, in so far as they were concerned with the litigation in the Federal Court and with an application for special leave to appeal from the orders of the Full Court dismissing the appeal from Einfeld J. Notwithstanding the references to the Second Charges in the Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions that are highlighted in the extracts set out above and the references to the First Charges and the Second Charges in the affidavit of 22 September 2003, the product of the telephonic interceptions does not appear to have been raised in conjunction with the Second Charges. The material indicates that Mr Jackson's advice was sought only in relation to the application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Court, which related only to the Third Charges. Insofar as the Commissioner and Taxpayer referred to the Second Charges in the earlier proceeding, it is clear the reference was to use that may have been made by Customs of the product of the interceptions in considering the Second Charges. That may have been a misapprehension.

69 The fee of $6,000 paid by the Taxpayer to Mr Jackson QC was for an opinion on the proposed appeal to the High Court. That appeal related to a challenge to the use, in connection with the Third Charges, of the product of telephonic interceptions made by the Australian Federal Police. By making the order of 5 December 2003, albeit by consent, Finn J must be taken to have determined that those fees were allowable as a deduction from the assessable income of the Taxpayer for the year ended 30 June 2001.</text>
