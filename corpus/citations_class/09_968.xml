<tocase>SZKCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1814</tocase>

<text>In SZKCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1814 , which was also an application for leave to appeal, I stated the following at paragraphs 15 to 17: Applications for leave to appeal may be heard either by a Full Court or by a single judge: s 25(2)(a) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The principles relevant to a grant of leave are not in doubt, the root authority being D&eacute;cor Corp v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 3 FCR 397. Those principles are, firstly, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being considered by the Full Court and, secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong. Later in time and in the context of an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application for the judicial review of a decision of the Tribunal, Hely J remarked in NACA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [12] that an applicant "had to show an arguable case that the RRT's decision should be quashed on the grounds of jurisdictional error". 
 Whether a judgment is interlocutory, rather than final, and hence requires a grant of leave to appeal by virtue of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act is sometimes a question of considerable nicety. It is the legal effect of a judgment, rather than its practical effect, that is determinative of the question whether a judgment is final or interlocutory. 
 The present case nicely illustrates the point. The refusal by the Federal Magistrates Court on 12 November 2007 to set aside the order of dismissal made on 12 October 2007 and to reopen the proceeding for the judicial review of the Tribunal's decision did not have the legal effect of finally determining as between the Applicant and the Minister the merits of that proceeding. However, the practical effect of the refusal to reopen was to leave in place the order of dismissal of the challenge to the Tribunal's decision. That, in turn, had the practical effect of leaving standing the decision of the Tribunal affirming the refusal to grant the Applicant a protection visa. An appreciation of the practical effect that some, strictly interlocutory judgments may nonetheless have led Branson J in Johnston v Comcare [2002] FCAFC 251 ; (2002) 124 FCR 160 at [8] to observe that leave to appeal is more readily granted where a decision, if allowed to stand, will have "the practical effect" of determining a claim of an applicant to be entitled to an order, rather than in a case concerning practice and procedure only. I have approached the question of whether to grant leave in this case with this sentiment in mind.

In the present case, the refusal by the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the earlier order of dismissal had exactly the same practical effect, so far as the Applicant is concerned, to that which I have described in the passage quoted. I therefore take into account all of the principles set out in the passage quoted in deciding this application.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF [2005] FCAFC 73</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/73.html</AustLII>
<text>At its heart, this is a case where an applicant did not attend before the Tribunal and the Tribunal went on to determine the application on the basis of the material then to hand. It seems to me that the circumstances of the case before the Tribunal are not relevantly distinguishable from those which grounded the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF [2005] FCAFC 73 (VSAF).

In that case, at para 24, the Full Court made reference to and followed an earlier Full Court decision, NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (NAST). There, too, an Applicant had failed to attend a hearing and the Tribunal proceeded to make its decision without taking any further steps to enable him to attend. The Full Court in NAST held that this was a course that the Tribunal was entitled to adopt. That was followed by the Full Court in VSAF . Those decisions bind me, as they did the Federal Magistrate.</text>
