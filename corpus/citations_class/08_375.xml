<tocase>Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/1509.html</AustLII>
<text>7 Barrett has recently successfully sued another home builder for copyright infringement in respect of the Seattle design: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509. In that case Gilmour J has comprehensively reviewed copyright law principles as applicable to home designs: see especially at [13]-[28]. I gratefully adopt that review and incorporate it in these reasons.

8 Barrett's Seattle design is Schedule A to these reasons.

9 Carlisle's Provence design is Schedule B to these reasons.

22 In Metricon subsistence of Barrett's copyright in the Seattle was not challenged. However, Gilmour J noted at [34]:
 
 The drawing process, as evidenced in (Barrett's) affidavit material, shows a substantial evolution in the design concept and implementation, which is clearly revealed in the sequence of drawings exhibited. There are approximately 130 drawings and notes that culminate in the final Seattle 31 plan, which Barrett approved in or about September 1999 .

23 Carlisle disputed that there were 130 drawings in evidence in the present case. My calculation accords with that of Gilmour J. There may well be some duplication, with the same drawing being reproduced by sender and receiver. But I am satisfied that the general conclusion reached by Gilmour J is equally justified in the present case.

24 By September 1999 Barrett was building the first prototype of the Seattle design at 10 Brownell Road, Glen Iris, as a home for Mr Roberts. About this time it commenced marketing, building and selling houses in accordance with the Seattle plan. The product was available in 22, 26 or 31 square versions. The first display home was built and opened at a display village located at 47 Scenic Drive, Beaconsfield in January 2000.

25 The Seattle design proved to be popular and sold very well.

81 In Metricon at [29]-[42] Gilmour J applied those principles and held that the al fresco quadrant was a substantial part of the Seattle and Memphis designs. I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusion and reasoning, which I would have arrived at independently, for the following reasons.

84 In visual terms, Gilmour J at [40] described the impression presented by the al fresco as built:
 
 The layout of the Seattle 31 gave the impression of a free-flowing design, leading from the hallway to the hub of the home, with the al fresco quadrant, under one roof-line, being central to the design. The impression was reinforced by the open-plan kitchen that looked over the living and al fresco areas. The design allowed one to view into the rumpus room which enhanced the free-flowing design features of the Seattle 31 plan. These features were clearly based in a communal area of the plan, so as to optimise appreciation of the al fresco quadrant and surrounding living areas. Based on my impression, I would describe the al fresco quadrant as being substantial in a qualitative sense. 


That accords with my impression.</text>

<tocase>Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1938/34.html</AustLII>
<text>74 Further, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, while having regard to the seriousness of such a finding (see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336) , that Messrs Doulgeridis, Taylor and Morrison gave consciously untrue evidence when they said that the Rochester was mentioned at the Mallesons conference. It inevitably follows that they must have colluded in so doing.

76 Although I am not aware of any consideration in civil cases of the probative effect of lies, the probative logic remains the same (see Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) s 55(1)) , subject of course always to the application of a different standard of proof with the Briginshaw qualification.

77 In the present case, the most likely explanation for Messrs Doulgeridis, Taylor and Morrison telling lies about what was said at the Mallesons conference is that they realised that the failure to mention the Rochester would tend to show that Rochester was not the true source of their Provence design. If they invented an untrue source, the most likely explanation for that is that they knew the source alleged by Barrett was the true one.

78 The evidence points to the following conclusion, which I find. Mr Doulgeridis did copy the al fresco quadrant from Barrett's Seattle plan, which had been on the market for several years. Probably he did so without much thought and assumed, because the plan had been around for a while, that it was in the public domain, especially in Western Australia. When challenged, the Carlisle directors first raised the argument that the al fresco was commonplace and devoid of originality. The initial versions of the defence reflect this. When the directors were unable to produce any concrete examples of the design pre-dating the Streeton, they fell back on the Rochester argument. When faced with the difficulty that there was no record of mentioning the Rochester on the first opportunity to do so, they falsely claimed that they did.

79 As already mentioned, Carlisle's evidence of the alleged design history included three sketches, and in particular the sketch subsequently identified as Sketch C. The mere existence of the sketches does not rule out Mr Doulgeridis having produced them by copying the Seattle. Given the false Rochester story I am unable to be satisfied as to the truth of any positive case advanced by Carlisle as to the design history of the Provence.</text>

<tocase>Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309</tocase>
<text>90 In Tamawood their Honours did not refer to the earlier Full Court decision in Clarendon Homes (Aust) Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (1999) 46 IPR 309. This appears to have been a "substantial part" case: see at [37]. In any event, the Full Court said at [28]:
 
 Further, in a case where there has been deliberate copying, the court will not look kindly on a defendant when the plaintiff seeks to establish that what has been copied is sufficiently objectively similar to the plaintiff's work. In Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd v The Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd [1921] HCA 27 ; (1921) 29 CLR 396 Starke J said at 404:
 
 
 
 It is not for the court to make the way of the taker of copyright matter easy. It is a sound principle of copyright law that the court should not allow one man to take away the result "of another man's labour, or, in other words, his property", unless it is satisfied that the part taken is "so slight, and the effect upon the total composition was so small", "as to render the taking perfectly immaterial", or what is much the same thing, that the part taken is an unsubstantial part. (Citations omitted.) 
 
 
 
 See also S W Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems [1985] HCA 59 ; (1985) 159 CLR 466 at 484 where Wilson J referred with approval to the judgment of Street J in Ancher, Mortlock, Murray &amp; Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd [1971] 2 NSWLR 278 where his Honour acknowledged that his finding of infringement had been coloured by the unmeritorious use made by the defendant of the plaintiff's work.

91 The Full Court in Clarendon later at [39] made it clear that a finding of deliberate copying was not conclusive. Objective similarity remains to be proved. Their Honours said: 
 
 But copying can be both conscious and unconscious. When copying is deliberate then, so it seems, the Court is permitted to show greater latitude in the plaintiff's favour. We accept this approach should not be taken too far. In a given case there either is or is not sufficient objective similarity to make out infringement. It will only be when the trial judge regards the position as finely balanced that he should err in favour of the plaintiff if the conduct complained of is deliberate . 


I shall follow that approach.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/138.html</AustLII>
<text>88 A finding of subjective copying is relevant to the issue of sufficient similarity. In Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 43 IPR 1 Lindgren J, with whom Finkelstein J agreed, said at [86] that 
 
 ...where subjective copying occurs there can be expected to be found an infringement, unless it transpires that that the product is so dissimilar to the copyright work that the copyright work can no longer be seen in the work produced. 


Subsequently in Tamawood Wilcox and Lindgren JJ at [46] somewhat qualified that view. Their Honours noted that the primary judge in the case before them had "expressed surprise" at the passage from Eagle . Their Honours said:
 
 Referring to an expectation, that statement allows for exceptions. Also it must be read in context. As stated earlier in the judgment (at [72]) Eagle was better regarded as a case of reproduction of the whole of the copyright work, so it was strictly not necessary to undertake the "substantial part" inquiry. Eagle was a case of subjective copying of the shapes and arrangement of, and interrelationship between rooms, and of traffic flow, throughout the house. The statement which surprised his Honour is akin to that of Lord Bingham in Designers Guild Ltd v Russell William (Textiles) Ltd [[2001] FSR 11 , [2000] UKHL 58 at 116, 117] ( Designers Guild ) that:
 
 
 
 ...[w]hile the finding of copying did not in theory conclude the issue of substantiality, on the facts here [ Designers Guild was also a case of overall similarity] it was almost bound to do so.
 
 
 
 It was acknowledged several times elsewhere in the judgment in Eagle (at [69], [74] and [103], for example) that subjective copying alone is not enough, and that where a part is taken it must be a substantial part of the copyright work. (Peterson J's aphorism, "what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting", a statement made in University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 610 in relation to the subsistence of copyright, was in fact invoked in the context of infringement and "substantial part" in Ladbroke by Lord Reid at 279 and by Lord Pearce at 293-294, but the House of Lords may be taken to have cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild ).</text>

<text>75 In the criminal law there is extensive jurisprudence as to the evidentiary use that can be made of lies. The leading case is Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63 ; (1993) 178 CLR 193. Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, after noting that ordinarily the telling of a lie will merely affect the credit of the witness who tells it, said at 209:
 
 It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him. In other words, in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty. It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell. That is why the lie must be deliberate. Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt. And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence for which he is charged. It must be for that reason that he tells the lie. To say that the lie must spring from the realization or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing. It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that "if he tells the truth, the truth will convict him". (Citations omitted.)</text>

<tocase>Kipling v Genatosan Ltd [1917-1923] MacG Cop Cas 203</tocase>
<text>82 First, in purely quantitative terms (which is relevant, although not of course conclusive), the al fresco quadrant is about a third of the total floor area. Less may be sufficient; a defendant who took four of the 32 lines of Rudyard Kipling's If in an advertisement for a "reviver of nerve power" was held to have taken a substantial part: Kipling v Genatosan Ltd [1917-1923] MacG Cop Cas 203.

83 More importantly, the al fresco quadrant is an essential part of the house, something that Le Corbusier characterised as "a machine for living in" ( Vers une architecture , 1923). Potential buyers would recognise the al fresco quadrant as a part of the house where they and their family would spend most of their waking hours. Thus the al fresco quadrant had a commercial significance, as the evidence demonstrated.</text>

<tocase>Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378</tocase>
<text>80 The historical background and authoritative judicial interpretation of the substantial part requirement, in the context of a building design dispute, are comprehensively reviewed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 378 at [47]-[56].

85 Counsel for Carlisle submitted that the al fresco quadrant "was the product of negligible or trivial skill, labour and effort". For the reasons given in relation to the subsistence issue, I reject this submission; see Tamawood at [55]-[56].

86 Counsel also argued that by the time the Provence was designed in 2003 the al fresco quadrant had become commonplace. However, the relevant time for assessing the "substantial part" question is when the Seattle was designed, that is in 1999. If that were not so, copyright owners would lose their rights provided a sufficient number of infringements had been perpetrated.

87 I find that the al fresco quadrant was a substantial part of Barrett's designs and buildings.

88 A finding of subjective copying is relevant to the issue of sufficient similarity. In Eagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 138 ; (1999) 43 IPR 1 Lindgren J, with whom Finkelstein J agreed, said at [86] that 
 
 ...where subjective copying occurs there can be expected to be found an infringement, unless it transpires that that the product is so dissimilar to the copyright work that the copyright work can no longer be seen in the work produced. 


Subsequently in Tamawood Wilcox and Lindgren JJ at [46] somewhat qualified that view. Their Honours noted that the primary judge in the case before them had "expressed surprise" at the passage from Eagle . Their Honours said:

 It was acknowledged several times elsewhere in the judgment in Eagle (at [69], [74] and [103], for example) that subjective copying alone is not enough, and that where a part is taken it must be a substantial part of the copyright work. (Peterson J's aphorism, "what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting", a statement made in University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 610 in relation to the subsistence of copyright, was in fact invoked in the context of infringement and "substantial part" in Ladbroke by Lord Reid at 279 and by Lord Pearce at 293-294, but the House of Lords may be taken to have cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild ).

95 Counsel for Carlisle relied on the proposition that the more simple, commonplace, familiar and straight forward the subject matter of a copyright work, the closer the similarity that will be required if infringement is to be found: Tamawood at [42]. He cited the well known case of Kenrick &amp; Co v Lawrence &amp; Co (1890) 25 QBD 99 at 103-104, a case which concerned the representation of a hand making the mark of a cross on a ballot paper.

96 This proposition, while undoubtedly correct, is of little assistance in the present case. Barrett's al fresco quadrant was truly original and commercially successful. Nor is it to the point, as counsel for Carlisle argued, that there are differences elsewhere between the Provence and the Barrett designs, such as in respect of the front facades. The fact that this is a "substantial part" case necessarily means that there are other parts of Carlisle's works in respect of which there is no allegation of copying.

97 Barrett's expert witness Dr John Cooke compared the Seattle plan to the Provence plan. He said:
 
 The rear part of the [Provence] plan, containing Kitchen, Meals, Family, Alfresco, Rumpus, Bed 2, Bed 3, Bed 4, Laundry, Bath, WC, Laundry and Pantry is essentially very similar in layout (mirror reversed) to the corresponding area in the Seattle plan, with differences in the arrangement of wet areas and angled doors to Bed 3 and Bed 4 instead of the doors at right angles to the corridor in the Seattle plan. 
 
 The main difference in this part of the plans is the shape of the Kitchen and the access to the Laundry (direct from the Kitchen in the Respondent's Plan; from the bedroom corridor in the Seattle Plan). The position of the Laundry access in the Respondent's Plan has enabled the bedroom corridor to be shortened.

98 In comparing the respective houses, Dr Cooke said: 
 
 The vista from the Entry in the (Carlisle house) (Photograph No 67) is closed by a recessed and top lit wall feature, whereas the corresponding vista in the Seattle (Photograph No 4) is closed by an aperture in the wall beside the Rumpus room doorway and the doorway of the Rumpus room itself. The Rumpus room doorway is visible in this vista because the rear part of the plan of the (Carlisle house) is a mirror reversed version of the Seattle plan, with the result that the Entry access leads to the Rumpus room doorway in the Seattle whereas in the (Carlisle house) the Rumpus room is to the right of the Entry access. 
 
 However the spatial effects in both houses are similar.

99 He concluded: 
 
 Overall, in my opinion the arrangement of the Alfresco and surrounding living areas, including the indoor/outdoor connection and the Alfresco space itself is a highly significant feature of both houses [reference to photographs] as is the organization of the circulation areas to minimize waste and maximize virtual impact.</text>
