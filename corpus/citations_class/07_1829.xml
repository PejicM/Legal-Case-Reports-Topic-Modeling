<text>2 The nature of the appellant's visa application, the reasoning of the Tribunal, and the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court are set out in the judgment of the Federal Magistrate, which is available on the internet: SZKJO v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1534.

3 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who arrived in Australia on 7 September 2006. The appellant claimed to have well-founded fear of persecution as a supporter of the Falun Gong. The appellant failed to attend the Tribunal hearing. The Tribunal sent the appellant an invitation to the Tribunal hearing. The Tribunal received no response, and the letter was not returned unclaimed.

4 The Tribunal made a decision pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). On the limited evidence before it, the Tribunal found that it could not be satisfied that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner in China, or that she currently practised in Australia. The Tribunal also could not be satisfied that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, or that she would seek to practise in the future. There was, accordingly, no persuasive evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the appellant would face serious harm for a convention reason.</text>
