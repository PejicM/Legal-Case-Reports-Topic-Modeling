<tocase>Croft v Minister for Health (1983) 45 ALR 449</tocase>
<text>17 I agree with the contention that the Trustee did fail properly to apply cl 27(g) of the Trust Deed. It is clear that it had a discretion as to whether to appoint Public Trustee or some other person to be trustee for the SST benefit: see cl 27(g)(ii). It does not appear to have exercised that discretion, because it has said in its letter of 25 October 2006 that it simply applied a rule or policy without regard to the particular circumstances of the case. See Croft v Minister for Health (1983) 45 ALR 449; Mendoza v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1991) 31 FCR 405.</text>

<tocase>Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/54.html</AustLII>
<text>31 In those circumstances, even assuming that the Tribunal should have given Mr Genikas a further opportunity to comment upon that new material, there was no operative breach of the obligation to accord procedural fairness: see Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145 147; Turner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 71 FCR 418 at 420; Sommer v NM Superannuation Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 923 at [34] . That is, even if strictly speaking the Tribunal should have given Mr Genikas the opportunity to comment further on that additional material, its failure to do so in the particular circumstances did not in fact cause him any unfairness as the Tribunal (as its reasons show) did not in fact have regard to that additional material in making its decision. In all other respects, Mr Genikas was given a copy of the material which Ellen Appleby had provided to the Tribunal and the opportunity to respond to it.</text>

<tocase>Miller v Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/13.html</AustLII>
<text>42 The important consideration for the Trustee and, subject to s 37(6) of the Act, for the Tribunal is the best interests of the beneficiary or the beneficiaries and the security of the trust property: Miller v Cameron [1936] HCA 13 ; (1936) 54 CLR 572 at 580 581. In circumstances such as the present, it would be appropriate for the Trustee to be guided by the sorts of considerations to which the Court might have regard when exercising its powers under s 36 of the Trustee Act 1936 (SA). The Trustee must therefore have regard to all the particular facts; cf Re Estate of Roberts (1983) 20 NTR 13 at 17 18; Re Henderson [1940] Ch 764. In Re Grace [1955] QWN 81 the trustee was appointed showed that the putative trustee could secure a better income than the existing trustee.</text>
