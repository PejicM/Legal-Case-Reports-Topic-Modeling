<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/21.html</AustLII>
<text>24 In considering the applicant's various grounds of complaint, it is of the first importance to restate some of the well-established principles in this field. First, this is not a reconsideration of the merits of the decision. As was said by Brennan J in Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin [1990] HCA 21 ; (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36:
 
 "The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power. If, in so doing, the court avoids administrative injustice or error, so be it; but the court has no jurisdiction simply to cure administrative injustice or error. The merits of administrative action, to the extent that they can be distinguished from legality, are for the repository of the relevant power and, subject to political control, for the repository alone."

<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/33.html</AustLII>
<text>41 To establish this ground the applicant must show that there was no evidence or other material upon which the President of HREOC could reasonably be satisfied that the decision of the NDPSC was not inconsistent with or contrary to any human right: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 357-358 (per Mason J).

42 The applicant properly and candidly conceded that on the evidence and material before HREOC, it was open for different people to reach different conclusions. So much was conceded in his written submissions when he stated that " the preponderance of detailed evidence presented in this case favours the position of the applicant." Where the preponderance of evidence lies is not a question for the Court to resolve. The question for the Court is whether there was evidence or other material to justify the decision made by HREOC. There clearly was. That is reason enough to conclude that the asserted ground is not made out.</text>

<text>25 Secondly, where, as here, HREOC decided not to continue to inquire into an act or practice in respect of which a complaint was made to it, HREOC was required " forthwith [to] give notice in writing to the complainant of that decision and of the reasons for that decision" : s 20(4) of the HREOC Act. It did so. Those reasons " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. Moreover, the reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues: cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38 at 52-53.

44 In any event, as set out earlier in these reasons for decision, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to analyse the reasons for decision of HREOC in the manner contended for by the applicant. HREOC's reasons are meant to inform; they " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. The failure of HREOC to refer to any one of the matters identified by the applicant does not, of itself, identify error.

45 The contentions also fail for other reasons. First, the question to be considered and answered by HREOC was a question posed by the HREOC Act but it was also a question, when correctly posed, which was to be determined on the particular facts before it. The failure to refer to case law or a particular decision is only relevant if it records a principle of general application which was required to be applied by HREOC which it can be shown HREOC failed to apply or act in accordance with. None are identified.</text>

<tocase>Eshetu v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1997) 71 FCR 300</tocase>
<text>37 In Eshetu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 71 FCR 300 Burchett J accepted the definition of natural justice to be commensurate with the statement of principle in Butterworths Legal Dictionary (ed P Nygh and P Butt):
 
 "The right to be given a fair hearing and the opportunity to present one's case, the right to have a decision made by an unbiased or disinterested decision maker and the right to have the decision based on logically probative evidence. . . ."

38 The Applicant did not seek to submit that these circumstances (or any other feature of the matter) founded a case of actual or apprehended bias and expressly disavowed any contention to that effect.

39 Instead, the applicant sought, impermissibly, to use this ground to re-agitate the merits of the decision by reference to two headings: an invalid basis for HREOC's decision and the weight of evidence presented. The second matter, the weight of evidence presented, is addressed in Ground (3) below. In relation to the first heading, the applicant sought to identify the invalid basis for HREOC's decision by reference to what the applicant described as "main considerations" and "additional considerations". None of the considerations raised by the applicant demonstrated that the decision of HREOC was invalid. Many of the considerations raised by the applicant were, in fact, an attack on the merits of the decision of the NDPSC and were in relation to facts and matters about which the NDPSC and the applicant held different views. That is not a proper basis for review under this ground.</text>

<tocase>Gonzales v O Centro Esprita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal 546 US 2006 </tocase>
<text>43 As set out in the written and oral submissions of the applicant, his complaints under this ground were, in the end, directed at identifying what he described as 'omissions' from HREOC's decision: (i) the absence of any reference to case law, (ii) the failure of HREOC to refer to the principle of 'least interference', (iii) the failure of HREOC to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Gonzales v O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal 546 US 2006 and, finally, (iv) what he described as the "unexplained shift" in position of HREOC from the view expressed by Ms Farrer, the Investigation/Conciliation Officer in a memorandum to Ms Gonzalez, the Principal Investigation/Conciliation Officer in April 2006 to the decision of the President of HREOC. None of the matters identified by the applicant provide any basis for review under this ground. The question posed by this ground of review is whether there was evidence or other material to justify the decision made by HREOC. There clearly was.

46 Secondly, there is the absence of reference, in the decision of HREOC, to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Gonzales . As Counsel for the Commonwealth submitted, although the Supreme Court of the United States was considering a decision to schedule a sacramental tea plant from the Amazon region under the Controlled Substances Act (US) because of its hallucinogenic properties, the decision is of no assistance to the issues in the present case. The statutory provisions were different, the onus provisions were different and the nature of the proceedings was different. In general terms, the Controlled Substances Act (US) prohibited the Federal Government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion unless the government demonstrated that the application of the burden to the person represented the least restrictive means of advancing a compelling interest. The Court did not reach the least restrictive means issue. The injunction against the prohibition was granted because the government had failed to discharge its burden of proof of advancing a compelling interest.

47 Thirdly, the applicant's reference to what he described as the "unexplained shift" in position of HREOC from the view expressed by Ms Farrer, the Investigation/Conciliation Officer in a memorandum to Ms Gonzalez, the Principal Investigation/Conciliation Officer in April 2006 to the decision of the President of HREOC is misconceived on three bases: it fails to take account of the decision; it fails to take account of the record of the decision making process and it reflects a misunderstanding of that process.

48 The decision making process of the President was recorded in the following terms:
 
 
 "I have considered the reasons set out in the letter to Dr Hanes. I agree the complaint should be declined. I have signed the letter to Dr Hanes and the letter to Mr Holton. JvD 14/11/06"</text>

<tocase>Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38 </tocase>
<text>25 Secondly, where, as here, HREOC decided not to continue to inquire into an act or practice in respect of which a complaint was made to it, HREOC was required " forthwith [to] give notice in writing to the complainant of that decision and of the reasons for that decision" : s 20(4) of the HREOC Act. It did so. Those reasons " are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error" : Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287. Moreover, the reasons are not required to refer expressly to every argument and all the evidence that might be relevant to its determination of factual issues: cf Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38 at 52-53.

54 Secondly, HREOC's reasons for decision are not required to deal with every aspect of the material provided by the Department or the applicant: Guo Wei Rong v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 38 ALD 38. It follows that, even if the applicant had been able to show that the decision did not make express reference to some aspect of the material that he had advanced, this, standing alone, would not establish that HREOC had not observed the procedures required of it by law.

55 Thirdly, HREOC's decision was a decision clearly open to it on the material before it. Much of the applicant's complaints, both in respect of the complaint about failure to comply with procedures and more generally, proceeded from the position that it was enough for him to demonstrate reviewable error to show that HREOC had accepted the NDPSC's view, and thereby rejected the applicant's view, of the plant. That premise is not right. In general terms, the NDPSC considered that the plant, as a known hallucinogenic substance with potential hazards and risks both to users and the wider community, posed a serious risk to public health and safety. The applicant held a contrary view. He claimed that there was no evidence that the plant was a risk to national security, public safety, health or morals; that it had not been demonstrated that the plant was a hallucinogen; that no deaths, injuries, hospitalisation or serious complications had been linked to the plant and that there was no evidence that the plant could become a substance of abuse through its importation into Australia. The question for HREOC was not which of these views was to be preferred. The immediate question, as pointed out earlier in these reasons, was whether to continue to inquire into the complaint. That, in turn, invited attention to whether the decision of NDPSC was inconsistent with or contrary to a human right. That was the question that HREOC considered and determined.

56 Many of the matters relied upon by the applicant were cast in terms that appeared to be directed to seeking a review of the merits of the decision made by HREOC but, on further analysis, were directed to challenging the initial decision of the NDPSC to place the plant into Sch 9 of the Poisons Standard. Merits review of any decision is beyond the duty and jurisdiction of this Court in the exercise of its judicial review power. In the present case, the position is further removed - the applicant, in substance if not in form, seeks merits review of a decision that is not before the Court. That is not permitted or possible.

57 Some of the matters raised by the applicant appeared to be a complaint that HREOC took into account irrelevant considerations or that HREOC was motivated by improper purposes. These matters may raise other and different grounds of review, namely s 5(1)(e) , (2)(a) and 2 (c) of the ADJR Act . However, these matters may be put to one side. There is nothing to suggest that HREOC exercised its power to not to continue to inquire into the complaint made by the applicant under s 20(2)(a) of the HREOC Act for a purpose other than that for which it was conferred. Further, there is no evidence that HREOC was motivated by " factors other than legal factors, such as the time-consuming nature and complexity of this case, the lack of prospects for a reasonable settlement and a desire to remove the case from the Commission's ongoing commitments" or that NDPSC was motivated by improper purposes including " religio-political factors" .

58 The applicant contended that HREOC took into account an irrelevant consideration. The 'irrelevant consideration' was described by the applicant as the 'slippery slope' argument. That assertion fails at the outset.

59 HREOC addressed the 'slippery slope' argument by summarising the positions adopted by NDPSC and the applicant in relation to the matter in the following terms:
 
 
 "The Department states that in addition to being a consideration that is not currently required under the TGA Act and the Regulations in the scheduling of substances in the Poisons Standard, the result would be catastrophic if, despite the strict scheduling of substances (such as Schedule 9 substances), individuals would be allowed to use hallucinogenic substances such as LSD and cannabis for religious reasons or beliefs, despite the known health and safety risks of these substances. The Department maintains that an individual would not only risk harm, injury or death to himself, but to other members of the public as well. 
 ... 
 [The applicant denies] that if the plant were made available for religious purposes that this would contribute to a 'slippery slope' whereby 'others could seek the de-scheduling of other hallucinogenic substances.'"

60 HREOC considered the parties' respective position as part of its evaluation of the information provided to it. At its highest, the argument was a factor put to HREOC by the NDPSC to which the applicant responded. HREOC's treatment of the 'slippery slope' argument does not reveal that it took into account an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of its power.</text>

<tocase>House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>34 HREOC has not amplified what it meant by the reference, in its decision, to the level of restriction adopted by NDPSC being "proportionate to the potential risks associated with the use of the plant". However, what HREOC said in its reasons is in no way inconsistent with it applying what the applicant says is the proper construction of Art 18(3) and, in particular, giving that article the meaning described in General Comment 22 by reference to the notion of the restriction being "directly related and proportionate". It follows that, to make good his complaint of error of law, the applicant must seek to argue from the actual conclusion reached by HREOC that it must have understood the relevant legal test incorrectly. It may be accepted that there may be cases in which such reasoning is permissible. (It is reasoning of a kind that may be said to be analogous to the last category of cases described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 as warranting appellate intervention in a discretionary decision.) But it is reasoning that is available only if no answer to the relevant question is possible except the answer for which the applicant contends that total prohibition of use of the plant cannot be said to the "least restrictive" interference with the use of the plant that is consistent with the object of public health and safety. The premise was not made good.

35 Under this heading, the applicant also referred the court to a number of events which he described as evidence " raising the possibility of interference by organisations or individuals with knowledge of the plant" and which occurred on or about the same time as the plant was placed into Sch 9 of the Poisons Standard. The events identified by the applicant were the correction to the spelling of the scientific name of the plant in the applicant's medical records and the circumstances of his medical detention on 10 May 2001 the fact that the first known official reference to the plant in Australia was in a minute prepared by an officer of the TGA on 11 April 2001, the fact that the applicant was waiting for his paper entitled " Antidepressant effects of the herb salvia divinorum" to be published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology and a conversation the applicant had with a "US journalist". The coincidence of the timing of these events was said by the applicant to provide evidence that the plant was placed into Sch 9 for reasons other than health and safety. The complaint on this basis is entirely misconceived. In substance and in form, it seeks a review of the decision of the NDPSC. That is not open. Insofar as the applicant seems to suggest that HREOC took into account irrelevant considerations or was motivated by improper purposes, there is nothing to support the applicant's assertion that any of these events taken singularly or cumulatively motivated HREOC or, for that matter, the NDPSC.

36 The complaint of error of law fails.</text>

<text>32 It is unnecessary, in these circumstances, to embark upon the larger and more difficult question presented by the Commonwealth's submission that the construction of Art 18(3) of the ICCPR presents no question of law but presents only a question of fact. The corollary of the Commonwealth's submission was said to be that the proper construction of Art 18 was a matter for HREOC, was a question of fact which was at large and was therefore not a matter which was subject to judicial review under this ground of review. The correctness of that submission is not self-evident. Resolution of it would require examination and consideration of what question or questions of law are presented by the construction of s 20 of the HREOC Act when that section takes as its point of reference a human right as defined in the text of an international instrument, the ICCPR, set out in the Schedule to the Act and which, on the present state of the authorities, is not incorporated into municipal legislation: cf Minogue v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [1999] FCA 85 ; (1999) 84 FCR 438 at [34] - [38] and Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 286-287 (per Mason CJ and Deane J).</text>

 "The duty and jurisdiction of the court to review administrative action do not go beyond the declaration and enforcing of the law which determines the limits and governs the exercise of the repository's power.

<tocase>Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/28.html</AustLII>
<text>50 Section 5(1)(b) of the ADJR Act provides that a decision may be reviewed on the ground that " procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed" . This ground of review has been described as 'procedural ultra vires'. It is concerned with determining the validity of an act done in breach of a statutory provision. Any distinction between directory and mandatory requirements is not relevant: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 390-391. The acts to which this ground of review is directed are usually requirements laid down by an Act to reach a decision within a certain period of time or after a period of consultation.

51 The applicant has not identified a procedure prescribed by the HREOC Act which HREOC has not observed. Instead, under this heading, the applicant asserts that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss 11(1)(f) and 20(1) of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the evidence before it. In support of that contention, the applicant referred to what he described as 10 matters of "key evidence" that the President of HREOC had failed to consider. The matters were said by the applicant to be:
 
 
 (1) the plant was non addictive;
 (2) the plant was non toxic;
 (3) there were no health warnings in relation to the plant;
 (4) the lack of experience and expertise in the Department;
 (5) the Department breached s 52E(1)(b) of the TGA in that the Department failed to take into account " the risks and benefits associated with the use of a substance ";
 (6) the Department placed the plant into Schedule 9 for reasons other than public health and safety
 (7) possible bias in HREOC's decision making process. At the hearing, the applicant disavowed any suggestion that HREOC was biased;
 (8) the NDPSC was motivated by improper purposes including " religio-political factors" ;
 (9) evidence of "behind the scenes" discussions. Three examples were provided. First, an internal review document provided by the TGA in which a Dr P Chipman stated that " Customs might have expressed concern to the TGA by way of telephone calls and it is possible that telephone discussions between the two agencies may not have been filed" . The second example provided as evidence of possible collusion or interference in the decision making process was the " surprisingly prompt knowledge by the NDPSC ... of US Congressional Bill HR 5607 at the 15-17 October, 2002 meeting of the NDPSC, which Bill had only been introduced into Congress on the 10 th October 2002" . The third example was an assertion by the applicant that he " was advised by a US journalist that information pertaining to Australia's prohibition of [the plant] may have been leaked to the US Drug Enforcement Agency" and " [t]his may have occurred just prior to the unsuccessful US Bill HR 5607 which sought to prohibit [the plant] in that country" ;
 (10) the concern expressed in the Australian Parliament by Lindsay Tanner that the TGA was unable to identify an authorative scientific source for the plant when considering whether it should be included in Sch 9 and the fact that this was not referred to by HREOC in its decision.

52 The applicant's contention that HREOC failed to perform its functions under ss 11(1)(f) and 20(1) of the HREOC Act in that it failed to give proper consideration to the matters listed in the preceding paragraph establishes no basis for review under this heading. Neither the general allegation nor any of the specific matters identified by the applicant concerns a procedure prescribed by the HREOC Act which HREOC has not observed. That is reason enough to conclude that the asserted ground is not made out.</text>
