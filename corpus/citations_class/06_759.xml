<tocase>PS Chellaram &amp; Co Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co [1991] HCA 36 ; (1991) 102 ALR 321</tocase>

<text>9 The plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Australia within the provisions of O 28 r 3(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules and, on the evidence, I am satisfied that it has no assets in Australia. The plaintiff did not contend to the contrary; nor did it argue that there has been delay in the bringing of the application, or that an order for security for costs will in any way stifle the proceedings. Furthermore, the plaintiff accepts that, in these circumstances, there must be weighty reasons why an order for security for costs should not be made. In PS Chellaram &amp; Co Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co [1991] HCA 36 ; (1991) 102 ALR 321, McHugh J said (at 323):
 
 'However, for over two hundred years, the fact that a party, bringing proceedings, is resident out of the jurisdiction and has no assets within the jurisdiction has been seen as a circumstance of great weight in determining whether an order for security for costs should be made. Indeed, for many years the practice has been to order such a party to provide security for costs unless that party can point to other circumstances which overcome the weight of the circumstance that that person is resident out of and has no assets within the jurisdiction.'</text>

<tocase>Gartner v Ernst and Young (No 3) [2003] FCA 1437</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1437.html</AustLII>
<text>11 The plaintiff's main, and indeed only, submission is that the defendant's application for security for costs should be refused because it is very unlikely, having regard to the merits of the respective claims, that the plaintiff will be ordered to pay the defendant's costs. It is clear that I cannot determine the merits of the plaintiff's claim and the defendant's set-off and counterclaim on this application. However, the plaintiff's prospects of success are relevant on an application for security for costs: Gartner v Ernst and Young (No 3) [2003] FCA 1437. In this case, it is not the defendant who is submitting that the plaintiff's claim appears weak and that this is a factor in favour of granting security. It is a plaintiff submitting that its case is so strong that security for costs should not be ordered.

12 The plaintiff claims that it carried out repairs to the ship between 29 February 2004 and 22 March 2004. The plaintiff claims that the first instalment of the agreed price, namely, the sum of US$250,000, was paid prior to the ship leaving the shipyard. The balance of the agreed price, namely, the sum of US$233,500, was to be paid by the defendant within 60 days. It was not paid, and on the plaintiff's case the benefit of a discount was therefore lost and the sum of US$308,117 became due and payable by the defendant. Little was said about that matter in the submissions before me and I will proceed on the basis that, for the purposes of this application, the plaintiff's claim is for US$233,500.

13 It seems to be common ground that, initially at least, it was a term of the repair contract that the work would be performed within a period of 22 days.</text>
