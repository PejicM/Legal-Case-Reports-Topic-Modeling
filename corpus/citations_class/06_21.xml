<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1861.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 21 December 2001 I ordered that the application brought by the applicant ("the Commission") against the first respondent ("Safeway") and the third respondent ("Mr Jones") for contraventions of various provisions under Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") be dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) [2001] FCA 1861 ; (2001) 119 FCR 1. On 22 October 2002 I ordered that the Commission pay Safeway and Mr Jones' costs of and incidental to the application. The Commission appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court and on 30 June 2003 the Full Court delivered judgment in the appeal, allowing it in part: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd and Anor [2003] FCAFC 149 ; (2003) 129 FCR 339.

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076</tocase>
<text>12 French J identified a further six factors to be taken into account in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR 41-076 (" TPC v CSR ") at 52,152 (commonly known as the "French factors"):
 
 (1) the size of the contravening company;
 (2) the degree of power it has, as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market; 


 
 (3) the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended; 


 
 (4) whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level; 


 
 (5) whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act , as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention; and 


 
 (6) whether the company has shown a disposition to co-operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention.

18 In NW Frozen Foods the majority of the Court observed at 293:
 
 "In TNT (at 40,168), it was pointed out that some other factors which have been regarded as important actually flow from what French J called in CSR Ltd (at 52,152) '[t]he primacy of the deterrent purpose in the imposition of penalty'. One of those factors is the size of the corporation involved, since '[w]hat would deter a small company might have little effect on a very large one'. 
 ... 
 As Smithers J emphasised in Stihl Chain Saws (at 17,896), insistence upon the deterrent quality of a penalty should be balanced by insistence that it 'not be so high as to be oppressive'. Plainly, if deterrence is the object, the penalty should not be greater than is necessary to achieve this object; severity beyond that would be oppression."</text>

(2) financial position; 
(3) deterrent effect.

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296</tocase>
<text>15 It has been accepted for some considerable time that the principal object of s 76 penalties is deterrence, both specific and general: Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd (1984) 4 FCR 296 per Toohey J at 298; TPC v CSR at 52,152; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763 at 40,986; NW Frozen Foods v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 294-295 (" NW Frozen Foods "). In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (2001) ATPR 41-815 (" ACCC v ABB No 1 "), Finkelstein J said at 42,938:
 
 "If general deterrence is the principal object of imposing a penalty, the number of cases that still come before the court, and the seriousness of the conduct that is involved in some of them, suggests that past penalties are not achieving that object. For a penalty to have the desired effect, it must be imposed at a meaningful level. Most antitrust violations are profitable. Accordingly, the penalty must be at a level that a potentially-offending corporation will see as eliminating any prospect of gain." 


More recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Limited [2005] FCAFC 247 , the Full Court of the Federal Court said at [11]:
 
 
 "As the cases to which the judge was referred show, the principal, if not the sole, purpose for the imposition of penalties for a contravention of the antitrust provisions in Part IV is deterrence, both specific and general. This rule is so well entrenched that citation of authority is unnecessary. Moreover, as deterrence (especially general deterrence) is the primary purpose lying behind the penalty regime, there inevitably will be cases where the penalty that must be imposed will be higher, perhaps even considerably higher, than the penalty that would otherwise be imposed on a particular offender if one were to have regard only to the circumstances of that offender."

<tocase>Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 127 FCR 170</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>19 In Schneider Electric (Australia) Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 2 ; (2003) 127 FCR 170 ( "Schneider v ACCC" ) Sackville J said at 174-175:
 
 "Secondly, I would not place particular emphasis on the size of Schneider's Australian business, as such, as an additional factor distinguishing it from WTC and Tyree. Schneider's size and profitability doubtless explain why it did not dispute its capacity to pay any penalty that might reasonably be expected to be imposed and, to that extent, its size has already been taken into account. As I have said, from the point of view of deterrence, it is the nature of the contravening conduct that is the central determinant in determining an appropriate penalty. The size of a corporation may bear on the assessment of the seriousness of the contravening conduct, as when a large corporation has substantial market power which it uses to intimidate or cajole others to join in contravening conduct."

21 The Commission submitted that although the penalties sought for Safeway's contraventions were substantial, the penalties were appropriate having regard to the available maximum and the importance of deterring the abuse of market power that is the essence of s 46. The Commission relied on the observations of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 at [13]:
 
 "... antitrust legislation is founded on the underlying premise that free competition is essential for the welfare of the state. Conduct that affects the public, such as the anti-competitive behaviour that is outlawed by the Trade Practices Act , can never really be considered as anything other than serious." 


and Merkel J on appeal in Schneider v ACCC at 184: 
 
 "... it is appropriate to emphasise the need to ensure that penalties are not fixed in sums that do not have adequate regard to the nature and extent of the contravention, the losses caused by the contravention and the need to deter not only the offending parties but also others from engaging in similar conduct." 


I agree with these observations.

47 In the present circumstances, I consider it of little relevance to the imposition of the penalties to take into account the fact that Safeway is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a major public company. Safeway is a large company in its own right. At the relevant time it operated some 130 supermarkets in Victoria and Albury. It employed approximately 18,000 to 20,000 employees and had some 28,000 product lines and 1,500 suppliers. I adopt and apply the observation of Merkel J in Schneider v ACCC at 181:
 
 "The size of a parent may be of relevance where, for example, the parent bore some responsibility for the subsidiary's conduct or where it is relevant to the subsidiary's capacity to meet a substantial pecuniary penalty. However, I do not regard the size of Schneider's parent company, or of the group of which it forms part, to be a relevant factor in the present case for three reasons. First, it is not suggested that the parent had any involvement in Schneider's contraventions. Second, Schneider did not put in issue its capacity to pay any penalty that may be imposed. Third, it is clear that Schneider operates a substantial business in Australia in its own right. In 2000 it employed 420 employees and had an annual turnover in excess of $200 million. Since 1996, other than in 2000, it has regularly earned net annual profits before tax well in excess of $18 million. Thus, the present case is not one in which it is necessary to determine the circumstances in which the size of a parent of an offending subsidiary will be relevant to the quantum of the penalty that is appropriate."

48 The relevant fact remains Safeway is a very large corporation, with a significant presence in the commercial community.

49 The Commission submitted that the involvement of Mr Brookes, merchandise manager for Safeway, in the four s 46 incidents was an exacerbating factor that the Court ought to take into account in imposing penalties. The Commission said that Mr Brookes was directly involved in the Frankston incident as he made the decision to delete.</text>

<text>20 Two further matters need to be taken into account, the totality principle (see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 at 40,169 per Burchett J and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-562 at 43,817) and the parity principle (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (No 1) (2004) ATPR 42-022 at [84]-[85] (" ACCC v McMahon ")). In ACCC v Leahy , I said at [43]:
 
 "When dealing with several respondents whose situation and culpability are not the same, it is inevitable that different penalties will be imposed. Nevertheless it is necessary to bear in mind what is generally referred to as the parity principle. All other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties. Of course, as the Full Court said in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ... 'other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned'. It is also desirable to bear in mind the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. A dramatic departure from previous practice might be seen as representing unjustifiable disparity but may also demonstrate that a level or quantum of previous penalties may, now in the present circumstances under consideration, be regarded as inadequate."</text>

A dramatic departure from previous practice might be seen as representing unjustifiable disparity but may also demonstrate that a level or quantum of previous penalties may, now in the present circumstances under consideration, be regarded as inadequate."

69 Safeway submitted that it should not be penalised more severely than the total penalties imposed on George Weston Foods Limited ("Tip Top") in this proceeding: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 238. I reject that submission. The only penalty imposed on Tip Top that could be relevant to any penalties imposed on Safeway is the contravention of s 45 at Preston Market. Tip Top's other contraventions were for contraventions of s 48 of the Act . There were no allegations of breach of s 46 as against Tip Top. It would be plainly wrong to compare penalties in circumstances where the contraventions relate to different sections of the Act and different types of conduct.

70 Tip Top was ordered to pay $300,000 in respect of the making of the price-fixing agreement and $450,000 in respect of the implementation of it. However, Safeway's contravention was substantially more serious than Tip Top, given that it was Safeway's conduct which brought about the events which led to the contravening conduct.

71 Safeway identified nine matters which it submitted were significant when assessing the penalties against Tip Top: 
 
 &#8226; the contraventions were brought about by senior people in the Victorian division of Tip Top; 


 
 &#8226; none of the senior officers at Tip Top acted as a check or control on the others involved; 


 
 &#8226; the contraventions did not occur as result of one Tip Top officer acting on a frolic of his own; 


 
 &#8226; Tip Top operated a compliance program which made clear that the contraventions were strictly prohibited and could be the subject of severe penalties, and the program was found to be ineffective and was ignored or disregarded; 


 
 &#8226; it was because the compliance program was disregarded by senior officers that a significant deterrent element was required; 


 
 &#8226; the size of George Weston Foods Ltd (Tip Top) was significant as its commercial activity permeated the commercial and consumer life of the public; 


 
 &#8226; Tip Top's conduct in resale price maintenance was engaged in with a conscious appreciation that it was intended to ensure that the discounting of bread by retailers was discouraged or prevented, and was aimed directly towards small businesses; 


 
 &#8226; Tip Top's conduct was deliberate and systematic and engaged in for commercial reasons; Tip Top (on the agreed facts) anticipated Safeway's reaction and did not seek to resist Safeway; and 


 
 &#8226; with respect to the Preston market incident, the contravention of s 45 was (on the agreed facts) admitted and the agreement on prices was reached at senior management level. 


Although these matters were particularly relevant to the fixing of penalties against Tip Top there are many points of difference between Tip Top's contraventions and Safeway's contraventions and their respective circumstances which render comparison of little value.

83 In having regard to all of the above factors, I have nevertheless borne in mind the totality principle. That is, I have ensured that having determined an appropriate penalty for each contravention, I have, as a check considered whether the aggregate is appropriate for the various acts of contravening conduct involved: McDonald v The Queen (1994) 48 FCR 555 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-562 at 43,817.</text>

<text>20 Two further matters need to be taken into account, the totality principle (see Trade Practices Commission v TNT Australia Pty Ltd (1995) ATPR 41-375 at 40,169 per Burchett J and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-562 at 43,817) and the parity principle (see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (No 1) (2004) ATPR 42-022 at [84]-[85] (" ACCC v McMahon ")). In ACCC v Leahy , I said at [43]:
 
 "When dealing with several respondents whose situation and culpability are not the same, it is inevitable that different penalties will be imposed. Nevertheless it is necessary to bear in mind what is generally referred to as the parity principle. All other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties. Of course, as the Full Court said in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ... 'other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned'. It is also desirable to bear in mind the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. A dramatic departure from previous practice might be seen as representing unjustifiable disparity but may also demonstrate that a level or quantum of previous penalties may, now in the present circumstances under consideration, be regarded as inadequate."</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169</tocase>
<text>21 The Commission submitted that although the penalties sought for Safeway's contraventions were substantial, the penalties were appropriate having regard to the available maximum and the importance of deterring the abuse of market power that is the essence of s 46. The Commission relied on the observations of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission &amp; Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 at [13]:
 
 "... antitrust legislation is founded on the underlying premise that free competition is essential for the welfare of the state. Conduct that affects the public, such as the anti-competitive behaviour that is outlawed by the Trade Practices Act , can never really be considered as anything other than serious." 


and Merkel J on appeal in Schneider v ACCC at 184: 
 
 "... it is appropriate to emphasise the need to ensure that penalties are not fixed in sums that do not have adequate regard to the nature and extent of the contravention, the losses caused by the contravention and the need to deter not only the offending parties but also others from engaging in similar conduct." 


I agree with these observations.</text>

<text>56 As a result of the Preston Market incident consumers paid more for bread at the Preston Market stall and were denied the benefit of competition in relation to branded bread. This incident was inherently anti-competitive, although the extent of the anti-competitive consequence cannot be quantified. That does not alter the significance of the contravention. As Merkel J observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum (No 2) (2005) 215 ALR 281 at [20]:
 
 "Any determination of the actual quantum of the higher retail prices paid for petrol by reason of the understanding would necessarily be speculative and would be unlikely to serve any useful purpose. The important point is that price-fixing arrangements and understandings of the kind made and given effect to in the present case have been treated by the legislature as per se contraventions of the Act because their inherently anti-competitive nature inevitably harms consumers and has a deleterious and pernicious effect on economic efficiency."</text>

<text>57 The observations of Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 42-031 are also pertinent in this context. At [16] Selway J said:
 
 "... [T]he actual market outcome in a particular case is not necessarily an important issue in determining the appropriate penalty, except, perhaps, as a matter of aggravation. In relation to price fixing agreements, the law itself assumes that the purpose and/or the effect of the proscribed behaviour is to "substantially lessen competition": s 45A of the TPA and see Brunt Economic Essays on Australian and New Zealand Competition Law (2003) at 133. Given that assumption, it cannot be a factor in mitigation of a pecuniary penalty for engaging in price fixing that no such purpose or effect occurred in the particular case. If it is true that the uncompetitive purpose and effect did not result in a measurable or ascertainable loss to a particular individual, that is necessarily fortuitous and coincidental. It is not a matter of mitigation. Further, as already noted, the reason for the prohibition is the effect of the behaviour on the overall market, not on a particular transaction. Collusive bidding practices are unacceptable whatever their effect in a particular transaction. Those involved in them must expect significant penalties."

58 With respect to the Preston Market incident, consumers were affected in a true economic sense as the price-fixing arrangement resulted in consumers paying a higher price for bread at the Preston Market stall.

59 The Commission submitted that Safeway did not have any substantial trade practices compliance program in place, and to the extent it had any at all, it was ineffective. The Commission contended that Safeway did not call evidence or tender any contemporaneous documents that showed any substantial or systematic program of compliance at the time of the contraventions.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v SIP Australia Pty Limited (2003) ATPR 41-937</tocase>
<text>73 I also draw in aid the approach I took in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v SIP Australia Pty Limited (2003) ATPR 41-937 at [57]-[58]:
 
 "There is no basis for considering that there should be any parity with, or relationship between, the penalties imposed upon Baker Bros and its two directors and the penalties to be imposed upon SIP and Mr Ippaso. In the present circumstances there are significant differences between the position of Baker Bros and its directors on the one hand and SIP and Mr Ippaso on the other. In particular, Baker Bros admitted its contraventions at a very early stage of the proceeding, as did its directors in relation to their participation in those contraventions. Baker Bros was a much smaller company than SIP by reference to factors such as financial resources and commercial resources generally and SIP's market share between 1994 and 1998 and its turnover were significantly greater than Baker Bros' turnover. Further, Baker Bros and its two directors actively co-operated with the Commission in finalising the case against them and assisting it in prosecuting its case against SIP and Mr Ippaso. Although SIP and Mr Ippaso co-operated with the Commission when s 155 notices were served on them, they contested the proceeding. They are not to be penalised for so doing but they are not entitled to any discount in respect of co-operating with the Commission so as to obviate the necessity for a trial. Further, although Baker Bros committed the contraventions, it did so only after significant commercial pressure was placed upon Messrs Baker by Mr Ippaso. The role played by Mr Ippaso and SIP in procuring and implementing the March 1994 agreement was significantly different in that it was the initiating factor and the factor which drove the negotiations which culminated in the agreement. This difference warrants SIP and Mr Ippaso being given significantly and substantially greater penalties than Baker Bros and their directors. Mr Ippaso's culpability is significantly greater than that of the two directors of Baker Bros. 
 
 I am therefore satisfied that a more substantial penalty should be imposed upon SIP and Mr Ippaso than was imposed upon Baker Bros and Messrs Baker."

74 There are significant differences between the position of Tip Top and the position of Safeway. On one view comparing their positions is akin to comparing apples with oranges. In particular, Tip Top admitted the contraventions at an early stage and co-operated with the Commission and so became entitled to a significant discount in the penalties to be imposed. Further, the penalties imposed upon Tip Top were based on an agreed statement of facts, which were not tested by cross-examination. It is inappropriate to use those facts, which were agreed, as relevant to Safeway's position in this penalty hearing.

75 The allegations against Tip Top were contraventions of ss 45 and 48 , and not s 46. The contraventions differed in fundamental ways:
 
 &#8226; Tip Top's contraventions did not involve the exercise of substantial market power, whereas it was a fundamental element of Safeway's four s 46 incidents that it both had, and took advantage of, market power in order to deter or prevent competitive conduct; 


 
 &#8226; Tip Top's conduct was a response to the deletion of its products by Safeway. In the four incidents, Safeway's purpose was to deter or prevent supply, whereas Tip Top did not have such a purpose.</text>

<text>78 The Commission submitted that having regard to the authorities a high penalty is generally appropriate for contraventions of s 46. The Commission referred to the cases of Trade Practices Commission v Carlton United Breweries Ltd (1990) 24 FCR 532 , TPC v CSR, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-833, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd No 2 (2002) 201 ALR 618 (and on appeal: Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] FCAFC 193 ; (2003) 131 FCR 529) and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (2004) ATPR 41-983 (" ACCC v Fila ") in support.

79 Safeway submitted that if the penalties sought by the Commission are imposed, such penalties would be in stark contrast to those imposed in the ACCC v Fila decision, given that the contraventions in that case were more damaging, intentional, sustained and widespread. In ACCC v Leahy I said at [43]:
 
 "... All other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties...It is also desirable to bear in mind the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. A dramatic departure from previous practice might be seen as representing unjustifiable disparity but may also demonstrate that a level or quantum of previous penalties may, now in the present circumstances under consideration, be regarded as inadequate". 


Little attention has been paid in recent times to the level or quantum of penalty appropriate for contraventions of s 46 of the Act .

80 There are several difficulties in the application of the parity principle. The first is that all of the authorities referred to by the parties differ in some way, and in some instances many ways from the present circumstances. I do not consider that it is useful to use any one case as a determinant of the quantum of penalty for another.

81 Secondly, a number of the authorities referred to were decided when the maximum penalty for corporations for contraventions of ss 45 and 46 was $250,000. This is in contrast to the maximum penalty of $10 million that is now available. If an appropriate case were identified, the question arises as to how one compares a penalty that was imposed at a time when the maximum penalty was different. The Commission approached the issue on a percentage basis, and identified what percentage of the maximum penalty was imposed. I doubt that this is the correct approach, as the Court is not engaged in a mathematical exercise in which precise calculations are derived from specified or identified integers. Rather the Court is engaged in a weighing and balancing exercise.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/70.html</AustLII>
<text>82 The "totality" principle requires the Court, after determining an appropriate sentence or penalty for specific offences or contraventions in accordance with proper principles, to review the total of the sentences or penalties and consider "whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'": Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70 ; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63, approving of the description of the totality principle in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing , (2nd ed) (1979) pp 56-57. The totality principle finds its genesis in the criminal law but it has also been applied in the context of fixing penalties for contravention of the Act : Trade Practices Commission v Allied Mills Industries Pty Ltd (1981) 37 ALR 256 at 258; ACCC v McMahon at [90]. However, an application of the totality principle in the present circumstances must take into account, and make an allowance for the fact, that there are a number of contraventions of the Act which did not arise out of one, or a single, plan, arrangement, proposal or sequence of conduct. It should also be recognised that one of the explanations for the application of the totality principle is that:
 
 "...if the totality of the prisoner's liability to incarceration produces figures that crush any hope of reformation and any reasonable expectation of a useful life after release, the sentences must be made concurrent or partially concurrent with each other to avoid disproportion, given the finite length of human lives": R G Fox and A Freiberg, Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria, (2nd ed) (1999) pp 229-230. 


This rationale has little application in the context of the determination of the appropriate level of penalties for contraventions of Pt IV of the Act and in particular, in relation to large companies with very substantial financial resources. This is not to say that the determination of the appropriate penalties should be disproportionate to the severity and significance of the contraventions established. The total of penalties fixed for separate and discrete contraventions of Pt IV of the Act should not be disproportionate to the severity and significance of the various contraventions which have been established. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that there are separate and discrete contraventions not linked in point of time or causation.</text>

<text>87 The Commission and Mr Jones correctly point out that imposing penalties pursuant to s 76 of the Act is a matter for the Court. When a court is presented with an agreed penalty, the proper task is to determine whether the proposed penalty comes within the permissible range: NW Frozen Foods at 290-291 per Burchett and Kiefel JJ and Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993 per Branson, Sackville and Gyles JJ at 48,627.

88 I have considered whether it is appropriate to give Mr Jones any discount in penalty by virtue of his admission of the contravention at Preston market. Once the Full Court made its findings with respect to Mr Jones' role in the Preston market incident, Mr Jones had little option but to admit liability. In those circumstances, it cannot be said that Mr Jones' admission has saved any substantial amount of court time.

89 There was no evidence before me as to Mr Jones' financial position. Accordingly I am unable to take into account the ability of Mr Jones to pay any particular penalty.</text>
