<text>9 The respondent relies particularly on the reasons of Pidgeon and Owen JJ in FFE Minerals Australia Pty Ltd v Mining Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 69 ; (2000) 33 ACSR 739 to the effect that the legislative intent of s 1335 was that, in permitting the incorporation of a limited liability entity, it was necessary to ensure that persons who might have dealings, whether voluntary or involuntary, with such an entity should have a measure of protection from prejudice resulting from the limited liability character of a corporation.

10 In that case the anticipated costs of the moving party were $44,000; the plaintiff company's paid up capital was $4,001; it had no land registered in its name; from 1990 to 1995 (the last date on which it was required to file financial returns) it suffered operating losses after tax, save in 1995; and it did not file any answering affidavit. I would note, as well, that the pleadings were not before the court. Nor, it would seem, was there evidence of the relationship of the parties other than that the litigation concerned a contractual dealing.

11 Pidgeon and Owen JJ considered that the absence of land combined with the low share capital gave rise to an appearance that there was reason to believe that there were no assets to meet the costs.

14 For the reasons given by Heerey J to which I earlier referred I do not consider that the capital structure of Olivaylle provides reason suggesting it may not have either assets in excess of half a million dollars or else the capability to accommodate liabilities in such a sum. There is no credible testimony before me to suggest that it does not. It has been able to acquire a very expensive machine and it is the owner of what appears to be a significant business. I infer this both from the property holding it has and has from the size and pleaded capacity of the machine purchased from Flottweg. The character and duration of the prior business relationship of the parties and the fact that Olivaylle conducts a business on substantial land that it owns places the circumstances of this matter in a quite different field of discourse from those in FFE Minerals Australia Pty Ltd .

15 I would add, though, that while the respondent relies as a discretionary factory in support of its application upon its bringing the application promptly there is, in my view, something to be said for the proposition that it may have been excessively prompt and pre-emptory in the circumstances. I would say that its ready resort to this procedure might be said to invite some suspicion that it is at least a litigation tactic. The spectre held out of seeking indemnity costs, even if unsuccessful in the application for security, betrays either a misunderstanding of Olivaylle's obligations in this respect or else it was simply a high handed gesture.

16 There is no credible evidence establishing that there is reason to believe there is a real chance that could suggest there is reason to believe that Olivaylle will be unable to pay Flottweg's costs if successful in its defence. I simply am in a position of being asked to speculate about this matter, speculate in the absence of testimony providing any basis for suspicion that it will not, in the event of being unsuccessful, be able to pay those costs. I do not consider that the threshold requirement of s 1335(1) has been satisfied. I will dismiss the motion for security for costs with costs.

 I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn J .

<text>12 Before considering the respondent's submissions I should make the following observations about s 1335 and the proper approach to be taken under it. First, there is no onus on the applicant to adduce evidence of its ability to pay its debts (i.e. a future costs order). Nor is the issue of whether security should be ordered to be determined on the basis of whether or not that onus has been satisfied. Rather, as Goldberg J indicated in Second Lenbourne Pty Ltd v Beagle Management Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 486 at [9] , what is required is that there be credible testimony before the Court that there is reason to believe that the applicant will be unable to pay the respondent's costs if the respondent is successful. Secondly, it now seems reasonably well accepted that the paid up capital of an applicant company is not as of course relevant in proceedings of this variety because the capital structure itself will ordinarily be irrelevant to the ability to pay. As Heerey J observed of a context in which the paid up capital of a company was only $12 in Microcorp Pty Ltd v Terran Computers Pty Ltd, Peter Desmond Nunn, Philip Robert Hempel, Phillip Andrew Grasso and Vlado Joseph Dancevic (unreported Fed Court 19 December 1991 at p 3):
 
 "Today companies with very small paid up capital may be solvent and prosperous while others with balance sheets showing impressive sums in this regard may have no more than wistful memories of past glories to show to creditors."
 

Thirdly, for the purpose of determining whether the threshold requirement has been met, the convenient approach to adopt is that of von Doussa J in Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1992) 10 ACLC 525:
 
 "In my opinion the power of the Court under s 1335 arises if credible evidence establishes that there is reason to believe there is a real chance that in events which can fairly be described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant upon service of the allocatur, if judgment goes against it. This will be so even if in other events which can also be fairly described as reasonably possible the plaintiff corporation would be able to pay the costs. The degree of likelihood of the plaintiff corporation being unable to pay the costs along with all the circumstances, actual and possible, about its financial position, would be then to be taken into account in the exercise of discretion, and in framing the orders of the court if the decision is to order security."</text>
