<text>Further assistance in reaching the same conclusion may also be gleaned from the following observations of Wilcox CJ in Gibson v Bosmac Pty Ltd (1995) 130 ALR 245 at 247, when His Honour was addressing analogous provisions in the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) as follows: 
 
 It is correct, as counsel observed, that there is no reference in s 377 to the review being a hearing de novo; but the section imposes no restriction on the extent of review. The reason for this is clear; a right of full review is a constitutional precondition to the vesting of the court's powers in a non-judicial officer. 
 

 
His Honour then referred to Harris v Caladine , supra, and continued:
 
 
 The term "hearing de novo" is perhaps ambiguous. It may be understood to mean a hearing conducted as if there never had been a hearing before the judicial registrar, everything concerning that hearing being completely ignored. Alternatively, it may be understood to mean no more than a hearing at which the parties are not bound by the course they took before the judicial registrar, where they have the right to adduce such further evidence as they wish, perhaps to adopt positions and put contentions different from those adopted before, and put to, the judicial registrar; and, of course, where the judge is not bound by the judicial registrar's findings of fact. Like Moore J, I think a review hearing is a "hearing de novo" in the latter sense. A hearing conducted in that way answers the constitutional requirement described by Mason CJ and Deane J, "a hearing and a determination by a judge", without forcing on the parties, as a matter of necessity in all cases, the burden of relitigating all issues. 
 

 
 
 There may be occasions when it will be appropriate to conduct the review hearing as if there had never been an earlier hearing, perhaps because the earlier hearing so miscarried that the evidence became confused and the findings irrelevant or there is so much new evidence that it swamps the earlier. But ordinarily this will not be so. Where parties make a conscientious effort to adduce the relevant evidence at a properly conducted first hearing, by the end of that hearing they will ordinarily have found considerable common ground. It will have become apparent that some issues, on which they initially had inconsistent positions, are irrelevant or peripheral. They will have dropped out of the case. Differences of evidence on other issues will have been reconciled or explained; it may have become apparent to everyone that one particular version of events is more likely to be correct than its competitor. It would be unfortunate indeed if constitutional necessity compelled the court to ignore this narrowing of the dispute. I do not think it does. The relevant constitutional principle means no more than that, on review, the parties are entitled to have the case reviewed by the judge, without any limitation imposed by the conduct of the case before the judicial registrar or the judicial registrar's findings. The parties have the right to call such additional evidence as they wish, subject to relevance and other usual canons of admissibility. The judge must decide the relevant facts for himself or herself, and not simply adopt the findings of the judicial registrar. But the principle does not require the parties to ignore the evidence tendered to the judicial registrar; on the contrary it will ordinarily be sensible for that evidence to be tendered to the judge conducting the review. 
 

 
 
 In most cases, by the review stage, the critical factual issues will be few and well-defined. The course most conducive to the proper conduct of the review will be for the judge, in conjunction with the parties, to identify and concentrate upon those issues. Although nobody is bound by the judicial registrar's findings of fact, and it is important that everybody concerned with the case understands that, the judicial registrar's reasons for decision will usually assist to identify the issues to be determined on the review. ...

<text>Indeed, to purport to give to a Certificate such a status would be Constitutionally impermissible: cf Harris v Caladine (1991) 172 CLR 84. Section 37A(1) of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) allowed the judges of the Family Court to make rules delegating to Registrars all or any of the powers of the Court. An order had been made delegating to Registrars certain powers. A Registrar of the Family Court had there made consent orders for the settlement of property. By a majority it was held that the order was valid. Mason CJ and Deane J there held at 95: 
 
 It seems to us that, so long as two conditions are observed, the delegation of some part of the jurisdiction, powers and functions of the Family Court as a federal court to its officers is permissible and consistent with the control and supervision of the Family Court's jurisdiction by its judges. The first condition is that the delegation must not be to an extent where it can no longer properly be said that, as a practical as well as a theoretical matter, the judges constitute the court. This means that the judges must continue to bear the major responsibility for the exercise of judicial power at least in relation to the more important aspects of contested matters. The second condition is that the delegation must not be inconsistent with the obligation of a court to act judicially and that the decisions of the officers of the court in the exercise of their delegated jurisdiction, powers and functions must be subject to review or appeal by a judge or judges of the court. For present purposes it is sufficient for us to say that, if the exercise of delegated jurisdiction, powers and functions by a court officer is subject to review or appeal by a judge or judges of the court on questions of both fact and law, we consider that the delegation will be valid. Certainly, if the review is by way of hearing de novo, the delegation will be valid. The importance of insisting on the existence of review by a judge or an appeal to a judge is that this procedure guarantees that a litigant may have recourse to a hearing and a determination by a judge. In other words, a litigant can avail him or herself of the judicial independence which is the hallmark of the class of court presently under consideration. 
 

Dawson J observed at 122:
 
 
 ... a federal court must retain effective supervision and control over the exercise of its functions by its officers. 
 

 
The requirement that a federal court " retain effective supervision and control " has been said to be a " constitutional imperative ": Harrington v Lowe [1996] HCA 8 ; (1996) 190 CLR 311 at 321 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.</text>

<tocase>Jageev Pty Limited v Deane (1997) 72 FCR 398</tocase>
<text>There seemed, however, to be concurrence with the proposition that the " hearing " was a complete " re-hearing " in the sense that the parties were neither confined to the evidence adduced before the Deputy District Registrar nor the manner in which any factual or legal issues were there sought to be advanced for resolution. It was assumed to be what Davies J has referred to as a " rehearing on the merits ": Jageev Pty Limited v Deane (1997) 72 FCR 398 at 399.

For present purposes it is sufficient to note the procedural course that was in fact pursued. Directions were made for the filing of such evidence as was considered by the parties to be appropriate and for that material to be the subject of written submissions filed in advance of a hearing in Court. The materials filed included extensive extracts of the transcript of the proceedings before Branson J and copies of the submissions previously filed. Copies of the affidavits filed in support of the 2 and 5 June 2008 Notices of Motion were also included. A two volume Judge's Bundle of documents was also provided.

It was not considered appropriate at the outset to constrain Counsel on behalf of either Dr Wenkart or Mr Pantzer to the manner in which the inquiry before the Deputy District Registrar was conducted. Rather, the more appropriate course was to allow Counsel to identify those factual or legal matters which they wished to have resolved by this Court relevant to the " inquiry " which had been ordered.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/140.html</AustLII>
<text>For the purposes of undertaking that " hearing " it is fortunately unnecessary to re-state each of the previous decisions and the disputes thereby resolved. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that on 11 March 2002 Beaumont J made orders by consent, including the following two orders: 
 
 1. Warren Pantzer as Trustee of the estate of Thomas Richard Wenkart may recover his remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he is lawfully entitled or may become lawfully entitled from Thomas Richard Wenkart and Thomas Richard Wenkart agrees to pay the same within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same or at such other time as the parties may agree.
 ... 
 

 
 
 5. Thomas Richard Wenkart consents to Warren Pantzer lodging a Caveat over the property in paragraph 2 for the purpose of securing the charge in paragraph 2 and Warren Pantzer will upon payment of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses in paragraph 1 provide a Withdrawal of Caveat forthwith. 
 

 
The property identified in order 5 above is located in Union St, Paddington ("the Paddington property"). The correct construction of these orders has been considered by the Full Court: Pantzer v Wenkart [2006] FCAFC 140 , 153 FCR 466.

It is also sufficient for present purposes to further note that on 31 October 2002, Mr Pantzer filed in this Court what was later deemed to be a cross-claim whereby he sought " an order in aid of [the Court's] order made 11 March 2002 by appointing Warren Pantzer as Trustee for Sale of [the Paddington property] ".

The difficulty confronting Mr Pantzer, however, was that: the total amount he had received as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate was $769,191.66 
but that:
 the total amount of authorised payments made by Mr Pantzer to himself by way of remuneration prior to 31 October 2002 was $325,744.60. 
There had been no agreement as to the " remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which " Mr Pantzer was entitled in excess of that which had been then authorised. No occasion had thus arisen as at 31 October 2002, the date the deemed cross-claim was filed, for him to seek to exercise his rights as against the Paddington property.</text>

<tocase>Re Peruvian Railway Construction Company Ltd [1915] 2 Ch 144</tocase>
<text>A further competing submission addressed by both Counsel on behalf of Dr Wenkart and Mr Pantzer should be noted. This further submission invoked " the rule in Cherry v Boultbee ". This rule was stated by Sargant J in Re Peruvian Railway Construction Company Ltd [1915] 2 Ch 144 at 150 as follows: 
 
 ... [W]here a person entitled to participate in a fund is also bound to make a contribution in aid of that fund, he cannot be allowed so to participate unless and until he has fulfilled his duty to contribute. 
 

 
Given the constraint imposed upon the Deputy District Registrar when conducting her " inquiry ", namely that " [t]he appropriate time for the determination of questions of interest " was at a later date, this present submission need not be further considered.

A review of all of the materials to which the Court has been referred does not lead to any different conclusion being reached to that set forth in the Certificate . Assisted by &#8212; but not dictated by &#8212; the reasons provided by the Deputy District Registrar, it is considered that the same findings should now be made as were made by the Deputy District Registrar.

For the purposes of O 39 rule 10(4) of the Federal Court Rules , it is thus concluded that the " weight " to be given to the Certificate of the Deputy Registrar dated 28 May 2009 is such that a finding should be made, consistent with the terms of the order for referral, that the date on which 28 days has passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs and charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 is 10 January 2005.</text>

<tocase>Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/478.html</AustLII>
<text>As concluded by Branson J in her reasons for decision in April 2008 ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478): 
 
 [91] I conclude that as at the date that the cross-claim was filed, Mr Pantzer, in his capacity as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate, had received a larger amount by way of receipts than the determined quantum of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he was lawfully entitled. Mr Pantzer has therefore failed to demonstrate that, as at the date of the filing of his cross-claim, he was entitled to "orders in aid" of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. 
 

 
 
 [92] Nonetheless, I do not accept the submission of Dr Wenkart that it would be appropriate simply to dismiss the cross-claim with costs. Were this course adopted Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property. The regrettably long and complex history of this matter renders such an outcome even more undesirable than might ordinarily be the case. The appropriate way to deal with the premature filing of Mr Pantzer's cross-claim is, in my view, by the making of appropriate costs orders. This will require, as a first step, the identification of the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 (ie the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate). If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar (O 39 r 2 and r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ). 
 

 
Her Honour had also earlier published in October 2007 reasons for decision relevant to the remuneration and costs of the trustee: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 10) [2007] FCA 1589.

This table, it is considered, correctly sets forth as the starting point the sum of $769,191.66. Reference had been made by Branson J to an alternative figure of $797,000: [2008] FCA 478 at [6] . But this alternative figure was apparently an error attributable to submissions by Senior Counsel previously appearing for Dr Wenkart. Nothing turns on this error, it being accepted by both Counsel that the correct sum is that identified in the Certificate . The sum of $769,191.66 was the sum identified by Her Honour when making the order that an " inquiry " be undertaken.

And, other than a slight variation as to the dates upon which payments had been made in March 2000, there was also no disagreement on the part of Dr Wenkart as to the payments of $60,744.30, $80,000.00, $11,811.40 or $68,188.60 as identified in the table.

One " objection " taken on behalf of Dr Wenkart, however, focussed upon the two sums of $105,000 paid on 15 March 2002. One sum of $105,000 was identified as " trustee remuneration " and the other sum was identified as the payment of legal fees to Cutler Hughes and Harris.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1387.html</AustLII>
<text>The present proceeding arises out of an order made by Branson J in September 2008 that an inquiry be held pursuant to O 39 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules : Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 1387. An inquiry was held and a Certificate subsequently issued by a Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009. An " objection " has been taken to this Certificate and the present proceeding before the Court is a " hearing " pursuant to O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules .

Subsequent to the publication of those reasons for decision, two Notices of Motion were filed on behalf of Dr Wenkart seeking that further consideration be given by the Court to some of the conclusions then reached. One Notice of Motion was filed on 2 June and another on 5 June 2008. Her Honour dismissed both Motions in September 2008: [2008] FCA 1387. In doing so, Her Honour expressed her conclusions and made orders as follows: 
 
 CONCLUSION 
 

 
 
 [30] The parties have not reached an agreement as to the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate. On the approach that I have considered, and continue to consider, it appropriate to adopt, before final orders can be made on Mr Pantzer's cross-claim it is necessary to know when, if at all, Mr Pantzer became entitled to enforce the charge over Dr Wenkart's Paddington property reflected in order 2 of the consent orders made by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002. It will therefore be ordered that a Registrar conduct an inquiry to determine that date. When that date has been identified it will be necessary for the parties to have the opportunity of making further submissions as to orders, including orders for costs, appropriate to be made on Mr Pantzer's cross-claim. 
 

 
Her Honour's orders were as follows:
 
 
 1. The applications made pursuant to the notices of motion filed on 2 June 2008 and 5 June 2008 respectively be dismissed.
 2. A Registrar conduct an inquiry to determine the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66.
 3. The proceeding be otherwise stood over to a date to be fixed.

Consequent upon this decision of Branson J, Deputy District Registrar Hannigan conducted the inquiry which had been ordered and issued her Certificate in May 2009. That Certificate stated as follows: 
 
 Certificate pursuant to Order 39 Rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules . 
 

 
 
 I, Paddy Hannigan, a Deputy District Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia certify that the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr. Pantzer is lawfully entitled from Dr. Wenkart that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 is 10 January 2005.

Order 1 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules , it should perhaps be noted, defines " Registrar " as including " a Deputy District Registrar ". The functions and manner of appointment of Registrars are addressed in Part IIA , Div 1 and 2 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

Counsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer took a more confined view as to the task presently confronting the Court. She maintained that the Certificate should be given such weight that the Court should conclude that the date calculated by the Deputy District Registrar (namely 10 January 2005) was the date on which the 28 day period referred to in the order of Beaumont J as made on 11 March 2002 expired. Counsel on behalf of Mr Pantzer further maintained that the only task confronting the Court when conducting the " hearing " provided for in O 39 r 10 was the task of determining the " weight " to be given to the Certificate . Excluded from consideration, on this approach, was any task of revisiting the orders as made by Branson J or the constraints imposed by Her Honour upon those who were to carry out the " inquiry ". Indeed, on this approach, and given the findings as made by Branson J, the task performed by the Deputy District Registrar was a simple mathematical calculation of amounts and the correlation of expenditure with dates. The confined nature of the current " hearing ", it was contended, was not only dictated by the terms of O 39 r 10 but also by the fact that Branson J had herself been previously asked to revisit the findings she had made and declined to do so in her September 2008 judgment: [2008] FCA 1387.

The utility of ordering such an inquiry to be undertaken was queried. But the inquiry having been undertaken and the date identified, the outstanding task according to Counsel for Mr Pantzer was now for this Court to conduct a " hearing " confined to the resolution of such " objections " as were now properly sought to be raised for consideration. Dr Wenkart had sought such a " hearing ", as is his entitlement under O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules . That " hearing " and that " hearing " alone, it was contended, should now proceed. Whatever subsequent appeals may be filed or other applications made all remained matters for another day.

The fundamental divergence of approach exposed by the exchange of written submissions thus focussed upon those matters which could be canvassed and resolved in a " hearing " conducted for the purposes of O 39 r 10(3). It is considered that the more wide-ranging " hearing " envisaged by Counsel on behalf of Dr Wenkart is to be rejected.</text>

<text>As concluded by Branson J in her reasons for decision in April 2008 ( Wenkart v Pantzer [2008] FCA 478): 
 
 [91] I conclude that as at the date that the cross-claim was filed, Mr Pantzer, in his capacity as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate, had received a larger amount by way of receipts than the determined quantum of the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which he was lawfully entitled. Mr Pantzer has therefore failed to demonstrate that, as at the date of the filing of his cross-claim, he was entitled to "orders in aid" of the consent orders made on 11 March 2002. 
 

 
 
 [92] Nonetheless, I do not accept the submission of Dr Wenkart that it would be appropriate simply to dismiss the cross-claim with costs. Were this course adopted Mr Pantzer could simply institute a fresh application seeking to enforce the charge over the Paddington property. The regrettably long and complex history of this matter renders such an outcome even more undesirable than might ordinarily be the case. The appropriate way to deal with the premature filing of Mr Pantzer's cross-claim is, in my view, by the making of appropriate costs orders. This will require, as a first step, the identification of the date, if any, on which 28 days had passed from the determination of the quantum of an amount by way of remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer is lawfully entitled that resulted in the aggregate of such determinations exceeding $769,191.66 (ie the total amount received by Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate). If the parties are unable to reach agreement on this question, I propose to make an order for the making of an inquiry by a Registrar (O 39 r 2 and r 9 of the Federal Court Rules ). 
 

 
Her Honour had also earlier published in October 2007 reasons for decision relevant to the remuneration and costs of the trustee: Wenkart v Pantzer (No 10) [2007] FCA 1589.</text>
