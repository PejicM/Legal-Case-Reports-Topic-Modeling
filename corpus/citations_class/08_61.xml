<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1358.html</AustLII>
<text>10 The Court's role is to determine whether a genuine dispute exists. That issue is determined at the time the Court hears the application: Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 at [16] . The manner in which the Court approaches the task is also not in dispute. The Court does not resolve contested questions of fact. The Court does not determine where the merits lie in any contest: Kortz Ltd v Data Acquisition Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1722 ; (2006) 155 FCR 556 at [40] . The Court determines whether the supporting affidavits filed and served by Ox Operations depose to facts from which the Court is able to conclude that a genuine dispute exists. As Young J said in John Holland Construction and Engineering Pty Ltd v Kilpatrick Green Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 250 at 253, something between mere assertion and the proof of the existence of the disputed debt is required.</text>

<tocase>Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (2007) 63 ACSR 300</tocase>
<text>4 There is a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court and other Australian Courts that the Court has no power to extend the time for compliance after it has expired: Aussie Vic Plant Hire Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (2007) 63 ACSR 300 and G&amp;J Gears Australia Pty Ltd v Brobo Group Pty Ltd (2006) 229 ALR 638 at [46] to [52] and the authorities referred to therein.

5 In Aussie Vic Plant Hire , the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered that body of authority. Chernov JA considered that the policy of Pt 5.4 of the Act and the mischief which s 459F(2)(a)(i) seeks to abrogate makes it implicit that the Court is not empowered to extend the time for compliance with a statutory demand after the period has expired. His Honour considered that Pt 5.4 of the Act is a code which provides a strict and self executing regime: [84]-[97]. Maxwell P and Neave JA disagreed: [28] to [77]. Nettle and Ashley JJA, the remaining members of the Court of Appeal, concluded that as a matter of statutory construction of the Act and, in particular s 459F(2)(a)(i) of the Act , read with s 70 , an application to extend time for compliance with a statutory demand may be made under s 459F(2)(a)(i) after the time for compliance has expired: [118]-[124] and [183]-[187]. However, their Honours did not the permit the time for compliance with the statutory demand to be extended after the period had expired on the basis that the view, that the Court has no power to extend the time for compliance after it has expired, had existed for more than 10 years and one could not say "positively that it was wrong and productive of inconvenience": [123]. The High Court granted special leave to appeal. The appeal was heard on 6 February 2008 and the decision reserved.

6 Consistent with the approach adopted by Nettle and Ashley JJA, I would not permit the time for Ox Operations to comply with the statutory demand to be extended. The period has expired. On that basis, the application for review has no utility and should be dismissed.

7 However, in order to deal with all issues and to avoid unnecessary costs, in the event that the High Court considers that s 459F(2)(a)(i) of the Act (whether read alone or in conjunction with other provision of the Act ) enables a Court to extend the time for compliance with a statutory demand after it has expired, I propose to deal with the merits of Ox Operations application to set aside LMPD's statutory demand pursuant to ss 459G and 459H of the Act .</text>

<text>42 As has been said many times, a notice under O 33 r 12 has the same coercive effect as a subpoena for production. Compliance is mandatory unless the Court otherwise orders: Potts v Dennis Jones &amp; Co Pty Ltd (No. 2) (1995) 58 FCR 61 at 70. Similarly, the considerations which apply to the setting aside of a subpoena are equally applicable to a notice to produce: Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 450 and Crown Joinery Pty Ltd v Lyleho Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 214. The grounds on which a notice to produce may be set include that it is too wide, oppressive or fishing. The issues in the case and the possible relevance of the document or documents to those issues are obviously relevant in deciding whether the notice is fishing: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 11) [2006] FCA 174 at [6] .</text>

<text>27 Finally, in response to a notice to produce " [t]he documents evidencing payments to [LMPD] between 1 February 2004 to 13 September 2006 ", Ox Operations produced to LMPD an incomplete ledger for LMPD. That general ledger recorded the various payments to LMPD as loans rather than payments received as trustee or subject to some other arrangement.

<text>9 The principles to be applied by the Court in determining an application to set aside a statutory demand are not in dispute. In the present case, the Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ox Operations and LMPD about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates: s 459H(1)(a) of the Act . For a genuine dispute to exist, the dispute must "be bona fide and truly exist in fact". The grounds for alleging the existence of a dispute must be "real and not spurious, hypothetical, illusory or misconceived": Spencer Constructions Pty Ltd v G&amp;M Aldridge Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 681 ; (1997) 76 FCR 452 at 464.</text>

<tocase>Valoutin Pty Ltd v Furst (1998) 154 ALR 119</tocase>
<text>15 As the liquidator of LMPD submitted, the starting point is s 1305 of the Act . Section 1305(1) is a facilitative provision which has been given a broad interpretation: Valoutin Pty Ltd v Furst (1998) 154 ALR 119 at 128.

16 It provides that:
 
 
 
 (1) A book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of this Act is admissible in evidence in any proceeding and is prima facie evidence of any matter stated or recorded in the book. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) A document purporting to be a book kept by a body corporate is, unless the contrary is proved, taken to be a book kept as mentioned in subsection (1).

17 "Books" is defined in s 9 of the Act to include:
 
 
 (a) a register; and 
 
 (b) any other record of information; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) financial reports or financial records, however compiled, recorded or stored; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) a document; 
 
 but does not include an index or recording made under Subdivision D of Division 5 of Part 6.5.</text>

<tocase>Walsh v Salzer Constructions Pty Ltd [2000] VSCA 228</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2000/228.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Ox Operations' written submissions referred to Walsh v Salzer Constructions Pty Ltd [2000] VSCA 228 as support for the proposition that the fact that a company acts as a treasurer for other entities within the same group does not by itself give rise to a debtor creditor relationship. So much may be accepted. But that is not the only relevant fact in this application. The more significant fact is the existence of the prima facie position reflected in the general ledger of LMPD a loan to Ox Operations. The decision may be put to one side.

29 For those reasons, I do not accept that the first ground of challenge raises a genuine dispute.

30 On review, Ox Operations also sought to set aside the statutory demand on a second basis: that Ox Operations was not indebted to LMPD and that the general ledger did not and could not reflect the true position.</text>
