<text>1 On 22 August 2008, the Court published its reasons for judgment in Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1267 ("the substantive judgment"). In the substantive judgment, the Court held that Mr Fry, a delegate of the respondent Union, breached ss 298SC and 170NC of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act "). It also found the Union vicariously liable for Mr Fry's breaches. This judgment should be read together with the substantive judgment. It deals with the issue of what penalties, if any, should be imposed on Mr Fry and the Union.

2 Mr Fry was employed at the Hamilton site referred to in the substantive judgment. He was engaged on the construction side of the project. He was also a CFMEU shop steward. It was custom and practice on the construction side of the site for employees to be members of the CFMEU. The position of Mr Anton was unusual because he was a self-employed building contractor engaged to perform odd jobs around the Hamilton site. Mr Fry's role as shop steward included the enrolment of non-members on the construction side of the site into the CFMEU. He enrolled Mr Anton but 'gilded the lily' in encouraging him to do so by saying that he had an obligation to join the CFMEU. No doubt, as a CFMEU shop steward, and with everyone else on the construction side of the site almost certainly being in the CFMEU, Mr Fry considered that Mr Anton should be in the CFMEU. That does not excuse the breach of s 298SC of the WR Act committed by Mr Fry, but it does explain it and put it in context.

3 Mr Fry is fifty-nine years old. He has no history of prior contravention of any provision of the WR Act or the more onerous Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the BCII Act "), which places special obligations and requirements on building and construction workers which do not apply to other sections of the workforce. Mr Fry lives in Hamilton in rural Victoria. He is employed as a scaffolder doing work around the Western District of Victoria. He is not a wealthy man. He has given evidence that he "will not at any time in the future make a false statement to anyone regarding their obligation to be a member of the CFMEU".</text>
