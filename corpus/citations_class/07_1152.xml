<tocase>Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437</tocase>
<text>6 In addition, the Tribunal formed the view that, given the attributes of the appellant and the basis on which he claimed persecution, it would be possible for the appellant to relocate to another part of India. On this matter, I find that the decision of the Tribunal is in accordance with the principles set out by Black CJ in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437, which were referred to in the Federal Magistrates Court.

7 It is worth noting that the Tribunal also considered the evidence of the second named applicant and formed the same conclusion.

8 Accordingly, after considering the reasons for the decision of the Tribunal and the detailed treatment of the numerous grounds raised before the Federal Magistrates Court, I am not persuaded that either the Court or the Tribunal fell into appealable error. I am not satisfied that s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) has been breached. I do not think the circumstances for the application of that section arise in this case and, as pointed out in the decision of Federal Magistrates Court below, there are no transcripts, particulars or detailed submissions indicating that the material in question came before the Tribunal in a way other than what is stated in its decision.

9 For the above reasons I am satisfied in this case that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
 I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.
