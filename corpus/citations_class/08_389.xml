<text>27 Although, because of the construction that I have adopted of s 853(2) of the WR Act, it is not necessary for me finally to determine whether the judgment of the District Court pronounced on 15 October 2007 is interlocutory, I strongly incline in favour of the view that it is interlocutory. In Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at [4] - [5] McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said:
 ...the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not. If the legal effect of the judgment is final, it is a final order; otherwise, it is an interlocutory order. The order of Gleeson CJ refusing to grant leave to issue process was an interlocutory order. It did not finally determine Ms Luck's rights against the various defendants, if she has any such rights...(emphasis in original)

28 A similar view of the distinction between a final order and an interlocutory order had been taken by McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225. In that case their Honours characterised an order of a judge of the High Court dismissing an application for the removal of a cause pending in the Family Court into the High Court as an interlocutory order.</text>

<tocase>Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 </tocase>

<text>29 In Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 440 Taylor J, with whom Owen J agreed, said:
 ...an order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se, although it may, of course, conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made, is interlocutory only.

30 In the same case at 442 Windeyer J observed that "the distinction between final and interlocutory orders has in England caused much difficulty". At 443-444 his Honour said:
 In most cases the test that seems to be most satisfactory...is...to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask does it finally determine the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. It is never enough to ask simply does the order finally determine the actual application or matter out of which it arises; because, subject to the possibility of an appeal, every order does that, unless it be an order that is expressly declared to be subject to variation...The effect of such decisions as there are of this Court on the point seems to me to be that when an action has been commenced between parties then whether an order in that action is interlocutory depends on whether or not it results in a final determination of that action. I say of 'that action' because it appears that the question depends more upon the action actually brought by a writ than upon the cause of action upon which the writ was founded. 
After citing certain authorities in support of the view which he adopted, Windeyer J at 444 said:
 These cases are all illustrative of the general proposition that a final order is one which finally disposes (subject only to appeal) of an action or an existing dispute between parties.

31 The action initiated by the filing of the Statement of Claim was not disposed of by the making of an order requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason an amount by way of annual leave entitlements plus interest. The claim for a penalty to be imposed on Citigroup remained to be determined. For the same reason, the dispute between the parties, which involved both Mr Mason's annual leave entitlements and the issue of whether a penalty should be imposed on Citigroup, was not finally resolved in the making of that order.

32 No authorities touching on the proper construction of s 853(2) of the WR Act have been identified. Neither party submitted that the subsection should not be construed literally. So construed it discloses a legislative intention, in the specific case of the appeals for which s 853(1) provides, to override the general prohibition contained in s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act on the bringing of appeals from interlocutory judgments without leave to appeal being granted.

33 I conclude that s 853(2) is to be construed literally. As a consequence I conclude that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of a court of a State or Territory in a matter arising under the WR Act notwithstanding that it is necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Court in a comparable matter.</text>

<text>19 It may be that the drafter of the notice of appeal overlooked that a judgment as defined by the Federal Court Act and the WR Act is an operative judicial act so that there is no appeal from reasons for judgment alone ( Hi-Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 3) (1998) 86 FCR 374). Nor does an appeal lie from a verdict alone prior to judgment being given ( Musgrove v McDonald [1905] HCA 50 ; (1905) 3 CLR 132 at 142). I conclude that the reference to "the orders made on 15 October 2007" is to be understood as, or including, a reference to the operative order of the District Court made on that day requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason the amount found to be owing to him in respect of annual leave entitlements and interest.</text>
