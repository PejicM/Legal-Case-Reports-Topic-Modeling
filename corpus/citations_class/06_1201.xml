<tocase>Hawkins v Bank of China (1992) 26 NSWLR 562</tocase>
<text>The administrators contend that the obligations under the Supply Agreements fall within s 443A and seek a direction to that effect. There is an initial question as to whether any liability which ensues would properly be described as a 'debt'. Counsel has properly referred me to the decision of Branson J in Molit (No55) Pty Ltd v Lam Soon Australia Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) &amp; Macks (1996) 68 FCR 319 in which a strict instruction of the term 'debt' is adopted, drawing a distinction between a debt and a liability for unliquidated damages in this section. Counsel has pointed out that, in other sections, the words such as 'debt' and 'creditor' have been given a wider construction. The provision for insolvent trading is one example. Another is the construction of s 563A in Sons of Gwalia Ltd v Margaretic [2006] FCAFC 17 ; (2005) 149 FCR 227. There is also a question as to whether the liabilities are 'incurred' by reason of cl 6, at least unless and until there is a surplus to be distributed. Counsel has referred to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Hawkins v Bank of China (1992) 26 NSWLR 562 which dealt with whether a relevant debt was incurred when a company entered into a guarantee under which it was obliged to pay a liquidator an amount contingent upon demand following default.</text>

<tocase>Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1806.html</AustLII>
<text>It is not necessary for me to decide those interesting questions because, in my opinion, it is clear that any liability which ensues would not be for any of the topics enumerated in s 443A(1). The only possible argument is that the liability would be for services rendered. I cannot view what is involved in cl 6 of the Supply Agreements as incurring a liability for services rendered. In that respect, I would adopt the reasoning of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 at [45] [46]. (See also Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (2004) 51 ACSR 432; (2004) 23 ACLC 28 at [4].) I decline to give the direction sought.

The decisions of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 and of Finkelstein J in Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (above) and the orders made by Hely J in Re Henry Walker Eltin Group Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (No 4) [2005] FCA 745 provide support for making the order. Order 2 as sought will be made. 


 I certify that the preceding thirteen (13) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
