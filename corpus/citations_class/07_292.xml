<text>5 In his original application to the Federal Magistrates Court, three grounds of review were specified. They were as follows:
 
 
 "(1) The Tribunal had bias against me , the Tribunal mentioned: 'The Applicant's claims are entirely dependent upon an acceptance of him as a credible witness. The JApplicant [sic] was not generally credible and the Tribunal does not regard the inconsistencies and other matters dealt with above as explicable in terms of any difficulty he faces as an asylum seeker . ' I believe the above statement was by actual bias of the officer. 
 (2) THe [sic] Tribunal failed to consider my claims because I provided different claims at my hearing invited by the Tribunal. 
 (3) The Tribunal did not provide sufficient reasons to refuse my application." 
 
 

Those grounds were apparently abandoned when an amended application was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 24 May 2006. The grounds in the amended application were as follows:
 
 
 "(1) The Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty. 
 
 
 
 
 Particulars: 
 (a) the only information before the Tribunal was that contained in the First Respondent's file and that given to the Tribunal by the applicant. 
 (b) The Tribunal was required to provide particulars of the information that was the reason, or part of the reason for affirming the decision ... 
 (c) The above particulars had to be provided in writing ..., 
 (d) The information to be given extends to that information given by the Applicant to the First Respondent as part of his application for a visa. 
 (e) The Tribunal based its findings on the information, or lack of information, contained in the Applicant's application for a visa and was required by section 424A , to give particulars of the information, explain why the information is relevant and provide the Applicant with an opportunity to comment upon it. The Tribunal's failure so to act was jurisdictional error." 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The words that I have omitted were quotations from the reasons of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27.</text>
