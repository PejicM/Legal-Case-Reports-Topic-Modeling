<text>3 After the application was filed, a number of adjournments were occasioned by an application made by Mr Hudson in the Federal Magistrates Court ('the FMC application'). The FMC application, broadly, concerned the question of whether Mr Pascoe was validly appointed as Trustee of the Estate and whether the procedures subsequently adopted by him by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy were effective. On 10 August 2007 Wilson FM determined in Hudson v The Official Trustee &amp; Ors [2007] FMCA 1357 that the Trustee was validly appointed and that the procedure by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy was effective. Subsequently Wilson FM dismissed the remaining matters in Mr Hudson's application, those orders being made on 17 August 2007.

4 The Trustee has established service of this application, effected on 10 November 2006. On none of the occasions when this matter has been before me has Mr Hudson appeared, despite service by the Trustee of letters informing him of each date on which this matter was next to be before the Court. As outlined in an affidavit of service of Melanie Cavanough sworn 2 July 2007, Mr Hudson was notified that the matter was to be heard today. The matter was called outside the Court and there was no appearance.

5 On 28 August 2007 a fax was received in my Chambers containing a notice of appeal from the decision of Wilson FM. The fax was not accompanied by any other documentation. In particular, there was no application for any stay of these proceedings pending the hearing of that appeal. Mr Pascoe presses to have the matter determined today. Apart from the number of times that the matter has already been before the Court, Ms Nash, who appears for Mr Pascoe, points to the remuneration and costs that have been incurred by the Trustee to date, which are well in excess of the amount available for distribution. Ms Nash also points to one of the proposed payments, namely, payment to the former wife and only creditor of Mr Hudson in the sum of $5,130.00. The evidence is that those moneys are due to Mrs Hudson as part of a settlement on her divorce from Mr Hudson, by reason of a miscalculation when the amount due was translated from New Zealand dollars to Australian dollars.</text>
