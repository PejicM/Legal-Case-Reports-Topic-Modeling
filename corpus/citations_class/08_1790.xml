<text>I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried against AIF and that the allegations made in the statement of claim have a foundation (Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57).</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-801</tocase>
<text>The Commission also submits that it is important in the public interest and the administration of the Trade Practices Act that it be given leave to proceed against AIF in order for the public to be informed, if the Commission is successful, of the public's rights in relation to the provision of bundled services. I accept that, if the Commission is successful, there is utility in promoting general deterrence. As was pointed out by Carr J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-801 at [34], '[t] here is some degree of public interest in the determination and declaration that the respondent by its conduct has contravened [a provision of the Trade Practices Act ]'. However, I do not consider this to be a factor in support of the exercise of discretion to proceed against AIF. There are other finance companies already joined as respondents to the proceedings. If the Commission is successful in establishing contraventions of the Trade Practices Act , this aspect of the public interest will be served. The Commission points out that it may be successful against AIF and not against the other companies but I cannot properly weigh that likelihood at this stage of the proceedings.

The Commission submits that it is in the public interest to grant leave to proceed against AIF ' because it is important that the Trade Practices Act ... be seen to be enforced '. I do not accept that it is appropriate to grant leave to proceed against a company in liquidation simply because the Commission considers it important that the Trade Practices Act be seen to be enforced.

The Commission also relies upon the public interest in obtaining declarations that a party has contravened the Trade Practices Act ' to vindicate the rights and interests of small businesses which have entered into arrangements with [AIF] which are contrary to section 47(6) of the [Trade Practices Act]'.</text>

<tocase>Speiser v Locums Financial Management Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 478</tocase>
<text>These proceedings were commenced on 17 September 2008, prior to AIF being placed into liquidation. The Commission submits that the fact that resources have already been committed to litigation is an important consideration in granting leave to continue. However, unlike Speiser v Locums Financial Management Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 478 at 482 3, the liquidation in the present case did not occur in the midst of litigation after days had been set aside for further hearing. In this case there are a number of respondents in the proceedings and there is no indication that the formulation of the claims against AIF represents a predominant allocation of resources. Only a small amount of time has elapsed since the commencement of the proceedings. I do not consider this to be a relevant factor in support of the exercise of discretion.</text>

<tocase>Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550</tocase>
<text>The Commission's case is that this discloses that AIF knew of the relevant transaction between the Telco and the customer. The Commission submits that this is sufficient to establish a serious question to be tried as to the accessorial liability of AIF in the contravention by the Telcos of the exclusive dealing provisions of the Trade Practices Act ( Vagrand Pty Ltd (in liq) v Fielding (1993) 41 FCR 550).

As the Commission points out, these proceedings do not represent a choice as is often available in a liquidation, between an action and a proof of debt. The remedies sought by the Commission are not available in the liquidation. Although the unavailability of relief pursuant to liquidation does not automatically entitle an applicant to leave under s 471B of the Corporations Act ( Vagrand at 553), the fact that relief is not otherwise available is a significant factor in favour of the exercise of discretion to grant leave to proceed against the company in liquidation. Further, the Commission submits that it is necessary to obtain the relief sought in order to inform and protect customers who may be unaware of their potential rights under the Trade Practices Act .

The public interest in the declarations and other orders sought against AIF is relevant. As the Commission points out, consumers may be subject to claims by AIF for moneys owed as part of the bundling agreement.

In view of the large number of individual customers said to have been made subject to the bundling arrangements as pleaded, I accept that findings of fact in these proceedings as against AIF may be useful to persons who have dealt with the company in a similar manner to that pleaded in the statement of claim and who may wish to pursue their own remedies against it. If the contracts with AIF are found in these proceedings to have been "forced" in contravention of s 47(6) of the Trade Practices Act , customers against whom enforcement proceedings are brought may be able to seek relief from the contracts by virtue of any findings made in these proceedings. If AIF is not a party to these proceedings, then it will be free to argue in any such enforcement proceedings that it is not bound by any judgment, so that the question of contravention of s 47(6) of the Trade Practices Act would need to be relitigated by the individual customer, even if that customer were aware of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act .

There is no indication from the liquidator whether there are any funds available in AIF. However, the assets of the liquidator include claims against customers who have an equipment lease with AIF. Those assets come to the liquidator with their history and inherent characteristics. As the Full Court pointed out in Vagrand (at 553), '[a] lthough the liquidator takes the assets on behalf of the creditors, third parties retain any rights which enure to them as a result of that history or those characteristics '.</text>
