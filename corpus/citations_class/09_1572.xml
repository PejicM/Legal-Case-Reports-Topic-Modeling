<tocase>Strickland (on behalf of the Maduwongga People) v Native Title Registrar (1999) 168 ALR 242</tocase>
<text>As the NT registrar also points out, in Strickland (on behalf of the Maduwongga People) v Native Title Registrar (1999) 168 ALR 242 at [9] French J observed: 
 
 (R)egistration of a native title claim confers upon the registered applicants important procedural rights. It constrains the ability of the State government to proceed to do a valid future act until, in the case of those acts to which Subdiv P applies, it has negotiated an agreement with the applicants or secured an arbitral determination that the act may be done.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth of Australia v Clifton (2007) 164 FCR 355</tocase>
<text>Finally, the NT registrar refers to the following passage from Commonwealth of Australia v Clifton (2007) 164 FCR 355 at [50]: 
 
 The Attorney-General stated in the second reading speech [to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (No. 2)] that one of the outcomes the Bill was designed to achieve was 'to put in place a registration test for claims which ensures that those negotiating with developers have a credible claim'. The Attorney-General also stressed that 'an effective registration test as the gateway to the statutory benefits which the act provides is essential' and that it was 'essential to the continuing acceptance of the right to negotiate process that only those with a credible native title claim should participate'.

The requirements of s 62 inform the process to be followed by the NT registrar in performing the function prescribed by s 190A. The available material must constitute a factual basis, in general terms, for the claim that native title rights and interests exist.

We are presently concerned with s 190B and in particular subss 190B(5), (6) and (7). However subs 190B(4) is also relevant. Those subsections are as follows: 
 
 (4) The Registrar must be satisfied that the description contained in the application as required by paragraph 62(2)(d) is sufficient to allow the native title rights and interests claimed to be readily identified. 
 

 
 
 (5) The Registrar must be satisfied that the factual basis on which it asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist is sufficient to support the assertion. In particular, the factual basis must support the following assertions: 
 

 
 
 (a) that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and 
 

 
 
 (b) that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests; and 
 

 
 
 (c) that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs. 
 

 
 
 (6) The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established. 
 

 
 
 (7) The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group: 
 

 
 
 (a) currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application; or
 (b) previously had and would reasonably have been expected currently to have a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by:
 (i) the Crown in any capacity; or
 (ii) a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or
 (iii) any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease. 
 

 
Of these provisions, the most important for present purposes is s 190B(5).</text>

<tocase>Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2002) 214 CLR 422</tocase>
<text>Native title rights and interests claimed under the Act must be "possessed under" traditional laws and customs. The requirement that laws and customs be "traditional" is of considerable significance. In my earlier reasons at [26], I identified a number of propositions which emerge from the reasons of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2002) 214 CLR 422 (" Yorta Yorta "). Some of those propositions expressly address the meaning of the term "traditional" in this context. Their Honours primarily dealt with the subject under the heading "The Inextricable Link Between a Society and its Laws and Customs". As to the word "traditional", at [45]-[47] their Honours observed: ... Hitherto it has been accepted, and the contrary was not contended in this appeal, that the native title rights and interests to which the Native Title Act refers are rights and interests finding their origin in pre-sovereignty law and custom, not rights or interests which are a creature of that Act.
 That being so, the references in pars (a) and (b) of the definition of native title to "traditional" law or custom must be understood in the light of the considerations that have been mentioned. As the claimants submitted, "traditional" is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom. A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society, usually by word of mouth and common practice. But in the context of the Native Title Act , "traditional" carries with it two other elements in its meaning. First, it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions: the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown. It is only those normative rules that are "traditional" laws and customs.
 Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and customs) is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owed their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title.

At [50] their Honours continued: 
 
 To speak of rights and interested possessed under an identified body of laws and customs is, therefore, to speak of rights and interests that are the creatures of the laws and customs of a particular society that exists as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs. And if the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs, those laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality. Their content may be known but if there is no society which acknowledges and observes them, it ceases to be useful, even meaningful, to speak of them as a body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed, or productive of existing rights or interests, whether in relation to land or waters or otherwise.

At [186] Callinan J said: 
 
 It seems to me that the critical elements of traditional laws and customs and "rights and interests" in the sense and context in which the words are used in s 223 are these. The rights and interests must be definable with sufficient certainty to enable them to be enforced by the common law ... . They must, for the same reason, be held in relation to defined land. For their enjoyment a physical presence is essential. This is so, because, if physical presence were not a necessary component of the right or interest, then the right or interest could be enjoyed elsewhere: physical occupation, presence or possession of the land would not then be essential for the observance, participation in, or enjoyment of the right in question. The Act is concerned with title, that is title to land, and a bundle of rights and interests attaching to, or arising out of that title. The definition of the rights must be found in the traditional laws or customs. Tradition requires a high degree of continuity. It also involves intergenerational transmission, acknowledgement and observance. The traditional laws and customs to which the rights and interests owe their existence must be ones which were in existence on first non-indigenous settlement, in 1788, because it was at that time that the sovereign radical title was assumed, and upon which the native title became a burden. And it is those traditional laws and customs which must have continued (albeit that they may have evolved, a matter which I will discuss later) in order to give real content to the rights and interests currently asserted. It follows that in order for native title to survive (absent extinguishment), and be the subject of a determination under the Act, there must have been, in 1788, a recognisable group exercising identifiable relevant traditional laws and customs, themselves reasonably certain, on and relating to defined land, involving physical presence on it, and continuity of these, until, and at the time of the determination.

I understand these paragraphs to establish that in order to demonstrate traditional laws and customs for the purposes of the definition of the terms "native title" or "native title rights and interests", one must demonstrate:

The applicant's case necessarily involves the assertion that:

Paragraphs 38, 39 and 40 of the applicant's amended submissions are as follows: It is submitted that it is not necessary to start by looking for something that one might regard as a pre-sovereignty "society". Rather, it is permissible to look for (factual assertions of) laws and customs, for example like those apparent from the long list which were set out by the Court at first instance in paragraph [70] to [77] of the Reasons for Judgment, and consider whether they can be laws and customs having a normative content which can definite a relevant "society". Where the evidence is that such laws and customs have been handed down from generation to generation, inferences can be drawn to the effect that they form part of a normative system at the time of sovereignty. Such an approach was referred to in [ Moses v State of Western Australia (2007) 160 FCR 148) (" Moses ")] under the heading "Reasoning Backwards". 
 Further, there is no requirement that different families maintain contact with each other in order to be subject of a common body of laws and customs.
 Annexure C includes references to the material concerning the laws and customs which have been handed down from generation to generation, and which can be inferred to be "traditional" in the Yorta Yorta sense. See too Annexure E. 
 
 (Footnotes omitted.)

I understand the applicant to submit that one may look at existing laws and customs, presumably those recognized and observed by the claim group, and then draw an inference as to the existence of a pre-sovereignty "normative system". I am not sure how one would decide whether laws and customs have a "normative content which can define a relevant 'society' ". I do not understand the Act to address the appropriateness or adequacy of any system of laws and customs for that purpose. The relevant enquiry is as to laws and customs acknowledged and observed by an existing claim group, laws and customs acknowledged and observed by a pre-sovereignty society and the connection between those societies and between the laws and customs, attributable to them. As is pointed out in Yorta Yorta , a society and its laws and customs are inextricably linked.

The applicant then submits that where the evidence is that such laws and customs have been handed down from generation to generation, it may be inferred that they formed part of a normative system at the time of sovereignty. Thus, it is submitted that the application need only contain a general description of the laws and customs presently acknowledged and observed and of the process by which they have been handed down. However the adequacy of such an approach will depend upon the circumstances of the case in question. Of course, in describing the factual basis of a claim for rights and interests in land and waters, the applicant must take account of the specificity required by s 62(2)(d). The general description required by s 62(2)(e) must be, one would expect, commensurate with the detail required by the former provision.

In assessing the adequacy of a general description of the factual basis of the claim, one must be careful not to treat, as a description of that factual basis, a statement which is really only an alternative way of expressing the claim or some part thereof. In my view it would not be sufficient for an applicant to assert that the claim group's relevant laws and customs are traditional because they are derived from the laws and customs of a pre-sovereignty society, from which the claim group also claims to be descended, without any factual details concerning the pre-sovereignty society and its laws and customs relating to land and waters. Such an assertion would merely restate the claim. There must be at least an outline of the facts of the case.

In many cases the history of a claim group will not be sufficiently well known to permit such an approach. However other matters may be known which assist in demonstrating the traditional nature of the claim group's laws and customs. Sufficient may be known of circumstances before, or shortly after, first European contact (assuming that event occurred after the date of assertion of British sovereignty) to permit an inference that the claim group is a modern manifestation of a pre-sovereignty society, and that its laws and customs have been derived from that earlier society. Such an inference may be available notwithstanding the absence of any recorded history of the society and the way in which it has continued since the earlier "snapshot" of the society. Such a case will involve, at some point, a comparison of the earlier and later societies and their laws and customs. A case of that kind may have to address the fact that there is little or no evidence of continuity of the society since first European contact or of continuous acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs, a problem recognized in Yorta Yorta .

From a forensic point of view the difference between these two approaches is that in the former, the necessary link between the pre-European contact society and its laws and customs, and the claim group and its laws and customs, may be inferred primarily from continuity, without necessarily resorting to a close examination of the societies and their laws and customs. The evidence of actual events will demonstrate continuity. Even if the history commences shortly after first European contact, it may be reasonable to assume that such a stable society was unlikely to have arisen in the period between contact and the commencement of historical records. In the latter approach, the applicant will seek to demonstrate continuity of the pre-sovereignty society, and of acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs, by examination of those societies and their laws and customs at two or more points of time, inviting an inference as to continuity.

Of course there is no clear distinction between these two approaches. Many, perhaps most, cases will involve elements of both. However it must be kept in mind that it is necessary to demonstrate both a pre-sovereignty society having laws and customs, from which the laws and customs of the claim group are derived, and continuity of the pre-sovereignty society, including its laws and customs. Clear evidence of the existence of such a society and acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs shortly after first European contact, and continuity thereafter, may satisfy both requirements, the first, by available inference and the second, directly. Clear evidence of a pre-sovereignty society and its laws and customs, of genealogical links between that society and the claim group, and an apparent similarity of laws and customs may justify an inference of continuity. However when the evidence as to both aspects is weak, the combined effect may, in some respects, be further to undermine, rather than to strengthen, the claim.

Yorta Yorta establishes that a society and its laws and customs are inextricably linked. It is impossible to identify a system of laws and customs as such without identifying the society which recognizes and adheres to those laws and customs. It would mean nothing to say that A had a legal interest in Blackacre unless one identified, or at least knew, the society which recognized that right. Indeed it appears (at [28]) that in Yorta Yorta the appellants took an approach similar to that urged by the applicant. That approach was rejected by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [56] where their Honours said: 
 
 For these reasons, it would be wrong to confine an inquiry about native title to an examination of the laws and customs now observed in an indigenous society, or to divorce that inquiry from an inquiry into the society in which the laws and customs in question operate. Further, for the same reason, it would be wrong to confine the inquiry for connection between claimants and the land or waters concerned to an inquiry about the connection said to be demonstrated by the laws and customs which are shown now to be acknowledged and observed by the peoples concerned. Rather, it will be necessary to inquire about the relationship between the laws and customs now acknowledged and observed, and those that were acknowledged and observed before sovereignty, and to do so by considering whether the laws and customs can be said to be the laws and customs of the society whose laws and customs are properly described as traditional laws and customs. 
 (Original emphasis.)

Clearly enough, in order to identify the laws and customs that were acknowledged and observed before sovereignty, it is necessary to identify the persons who acknowledged and observed them, namely the relevant pre-sovereignty society.

I accept that the applicant claims that the claim group acknowledges and observes certain laws and customs pertaining to the claim area. However I again reject use of the word "traditional" simply because no pre-sovereignty society has been identified for the purpose of identifying its relevant laws and customs so as to demonstrate that the claim groups' laws and customs are traditional in the sense identified in Yorta Yorta . As to the second sentence, the reference to "early literature" is quite unclear. If Mr Hagen is referring to Palmer's writings, then it is curious that he has at no time explained why they should be applied to the Gudjala people. As to Roth's article, it does not deal with laws and customs concerning land and waters. If, in fact, Mr Hagen is referring to other "early literature", then it is curious that he has not identified it. The reference in the report to Curr, Tindall, Sutton and Tsunoda is in connection with location of the claim area, not laws and customs. Thus there is no factual basis for concluding that there were pre-sovereignty laws and customs with which to compare the claim group's laws and customs.

The third conclusion is that: 
 
 The native title claim group's ongoing observance of traditional laws and customs is consistent with the maintenance of traditional rights and interests in the land subject to the claim.

This statement begs the question, namely whether the claim group's laws and customs, which give rise to the claimed rights and interests in relation to land and waters, are "traditional".</text>

<tocase>De Rose v State of South Australia (2003) 133 FCR 325</tocase>
<text>The applicant also refers to the decision of the Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (2003) 133 FCR 325 (" De Rose ") at [273]-[283]. It submits that the decision establishes that there is no requirement that different families within a group maintain contact with each other in order to be subject to a common body of laws and customs. To the extent that the applicant relies upon the decision in De Rose for that proposition, it has misunderstood that decision. It concerned a claim by persons described as "Nguraritja" to native title pursuant to the traditional laws and customs of a larger group known as the "Western Desert Bloc". The relevant laws and customs were not those of the Nguraritja but those of the Western Desert Bloc. It is clear that the Court considered that there was such a society which had enjoyed continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty and had traditional laws and customs. The case is of no assistance for present purposes.

In any event, I accepted in my earlier reasons that it is not necessary that the apical ancestors be shown to have been members of the one pre-sovereignty society. However, if descent from three apical ancestors is the basis for membership of the claim group, then there must be some connection between them and the relevant pre-sovereignty society from which the claim group asserts that it has derived its native title rights and interests. In my earlier reasons I observed that the applicant had criticized the delegate for seeking to find a society of which the three apical ancestors were the members, asserting that it was not essential to the applicant's case that the existence of such a society be established. That criticism may not have accurately identified the delegate's reasoning. As I understand his reasoning it was that evidence that three women, who may have met or known each other, could not, without more, constitute a society, particularly given the absence of any identified men. I suspect that just as the applicant misunderstood the delegate's reasoning, the delegate may have misunderstood the applicant's claim. The latter misunderstanding may have been the result of the extreme lack of clarity with which it is expressed and the fact that, in order to identify it, it is necessary to trawl through various parts of the application and the affidavits.

My understanding of the applicant's claim as to the traditional nature of the claim group's laws and customs is primarily that they are presently acknowledged and observed, coupled with assertions that they have been passed down from generation to generation by the claim group, and that the claim area was, prior to first European contact, that of the Gudjala people, a description which the claim group also applies to itself. Some evidence from Mr Hagen generally supports these assertions. He also says something about the named apical ancestors and a little about Aboriginal laws and customs. I will return to his report at a later stage. There is a substantial amount of evidence in the affidavits and the report concerning current laws and customs which, it is asserted, are "traditional", but little of it relates to rights and interests in land and waters.</text>

 (Footnotes omitted.)

The applicant seeks support for its submission in the decision in Moses . However it misunderstands that decision. At [322]-[330] the Court considered a particular argument described as the "reasoning backwards argument". It seems that on appeal the State had asserted that the primary Judge had erred by adopting a process which involved "determining that the [claim group] presently exercises native title rights and interests in relation to land, and ... then assuming that traditional laws or customs had been acknowledged and observed since the acquisition of European sovereignty." See [323]. The impugned approach seems very similar to the applicant's submission. The Court rejected this argument, but not upon the basis that such an approach was correct. Rather, the Court held that the primary Judge had recognized the need to determine whether communities occupying the relevant area at sovereignty had maintained their connection with the land and waters by observing traditional laws and acknowledging traditional customs.</text>
