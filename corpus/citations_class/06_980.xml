<tocase>Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726</tocase>

<text>1 On 14 June 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment and ordered that there be summary judgment for the applicant against the respondents: Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 (" Nokia "). I assume familiarity with those reasons. At [61] I noted that:
 
 "At the hearing, I suggested to the parties that they might turn their minds to whether or not costs should be equally proportioned between the respondents. It seemed to me that the third and fourth respondents had not seriously contested the summary judgment motion; and that this should be reflected in any costs order. I also noted, and counsel for Nokia agreed, that the third and fourth respondents were alleged to have engaged in a lower volume of infringing conduct than the first and second respondents. I proposed to hear the parties on the matter of costs after delivering these reasons." 

I ordered that the parties file written submissions on costs. The disposition of costs now falls for determination.

12 The second respondent is a manager of the first respondent. In Nokia at [56], I found that no other person plays an active role in the first respondent's business. I accept the applicant's submission that, in these circumstances, any costs order against these respondents should bind them jointly and severally.

13 Aside from the close link between the first and second respondents, there are no other links between the respondents. The businesses of the third and fourth respondents are totally independent. Therefore, I find that costs should be apportioned amongst the respondents upon the basis the applicant has proposed.

14 As a starting point, I accept the evidence of Mr Merrick concerning the proportion of the costs attributable to each respondent. These figures were based on his review of the applicant's files. Mr Merrick's estimates are also commensurate with my sense of the scale of the case against each of the respondents. Therefore, I find it appropriate to order that the first and second respondents should bear 60% of the costs of the proceeding. Similarly, I would order that the third respondent pay 20% of the costs of the proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Gladstone Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Ross Wills (1984) 6 FCR 496</tocase>
<text>2 The applicant submitted, first, that costs should follow the event. Citing Gladstone Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Ross Wills (1984) 6 FCR 496, the applicant claimed that there were no special circumstances that warranted departing from the general rule.

3 With respect to apportionment, the applicant relied on an affidavit sworn by Luke Andrew Merrick on 23 June 2006. Mr Merrick states that he maintained three separate files in relation to this proceeding. One file related to the first and second respondents and the other files related to the third and fourth respondents respectively. Mr Merrick said that he had reviewed the time recording and disbursement records maintained in respect of each of these files and that, based on this review, he estimated that the applicant's costs are properly attributable as follows: (1) 60% in respect of the first and second respondents; (2) 20% in respect of the third respondent; and (3) 20% in respect of the fourth respondent.

4 The applicant also submitted that, as the Court has found that the second respondent is the guiding mind of the first respondent, any order for costs made against those parties should bind them jointly and severally.</text>

<tocase>Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/11.html</AustLII>
<text>8 A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs: see, e.g., Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97 per McHugh J (dissenting in result) and 120-1 per Kirby J. In this case, I have ordered summary judgment against the respondents. Thus, absent special circumstances, the respondents should pay the applicant's costs.

9 Whilst I am aware of the third respondent's position, he has not advanced any justification, which, as a matter of law, would permit a departure from the general rule as to costs.</text>

<tocase>Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333</tocase>
<text>10 As noted already, the fourth respondent argued that there should be no costs ordered against him because he admitted selling counterfeit products and because the case against him could have settled. I am also not satisfied, however, that there are sufficient grounds for departing from the general rule with respect to the fourth respondent. It is clear from the evidence that the applicant sought to place the fourth respondent on notice that proceedings might be filed. It may well be that, after further negotiations, settlement could have been reached between the applicant and the fourth respondent. The fourth respondent has not, however, alleged and shown that the applicant rejected an offer of compromise. Thus, the principles of Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 do not apply. While the fourth respondent's admissions, which were made after the institution of the proceedings, may be relevant as to what costs should be ordered against him (see [15] below) these admissions are not sufficient to avoid a costs order altogether.

11 The first and second respondents have not contended that costs should not be awarded against them according to the ordinary rule. I see no reason why they too should not pay costs. The remaining issue, therefore, is apportionment.</text>
