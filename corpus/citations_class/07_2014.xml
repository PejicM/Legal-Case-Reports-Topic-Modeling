<tocase>Borealis AB v Stargas Ltd [2001] UKHL 17 ; [2002] 2 AC 205</tocase>
<text>96 By force of ss 8 and 10 of the Sea-Carriage Documents Act , Hilditch as a lawful holder of the bill of lading for the Yubase 6 cargo was entitled to assert the rights of the shipper and was subject to its liabilities under the bill of lading. Because Art 2 of the amended Hague Rules makes the carrier subject to the responsibilities and liabilities and grants it the entitlement to the rights of immunities set out in the Rules as part of the contract of carriage of goods by sea incorporated in the bill of lading, the contractual analysis adopted by Devlin J is apposite here: cf: Borealis AB v Stargas Ltd [2001] UKHL 17 ; [2002] 2 AC 205 at 221 [26] 226-227 [31] per Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.

97 Even if Dorval had been entitled to rely on the immunity in Art 4 r 2(i), because the causes were at least concurrent, it would have remained liable to Hilditch in damages. I am of opinion, however, that the responsibility for the damage, as a matter of commonsense, was substantively greater on the part of Dorval. Its breach of Art 3 r 2 caused the contamination to occur in the first place. The crew of the vessel were in as good a position as Hilditch to see the contamination as the cargo was passing through the ship's manifold. Both the ship's crew and Hilditch's surveyors observed, by sampling at the ship's manifold, the condition of the Yubase oil in its contaminated form. Each had the opportunity to stop the discharge. Neither did. To that extent their contribution to the damage may have been of equal efficacy, but superimposed on that were the obligations of Dorval under Art 3 r 2. There was no explanation, for example, how a proper system could have allowed the cargo to be discharged in the state it did. Dorval called no evidence as to how the cargo could have been discharged by the ship in the circumstances where there was evident contamination when it was passing through the ship's manifold which indicated the source was on the ship. I accept Capt Edgerton's evidence that good tanker practice required the valves in the tanks and connecting pipes which could permit the entry of caustic soda into the conveying lines for the Yubase to be sealed when the Yubase was being discharged. It is likely that there was some failure in that sealing process which led to the damage through contamination of the Yubase prior to its discharge from the Golden Lucy I . That being so, had the ship's crew been applying due care and acting under a proper system, they would not have permitted the discharge of the Yubase 6 to commence or continue without first investigating and stopping the source of the contamination.

98 At the hearing, Dorval only pressed an argument on the exception under Art 4 r 2(i) and did not advance any assertion that it relied on any other exception in that rule referred to in the parties' filed statement of issues.</text>

<text>78 The obligation of the carrier under Art 3 r 2 of the amended Hague Rules is a compound one. It requires not only that the carrier exercise reasonable care in the discharge of the goods, but also that it have a sound system for discharging them: Albacora SrL v Westcott &amp; Laurance Line Ltd [1966] 2 Lloyd's Rep 53 at 58 per Lord Reid, 62 per Lord Pierce and 64 per Lord Pearson; Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co (A/sia) Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 163 per Mason and Wilson JJ (with whom Gibbs J and Aickin J agreed at 149, 168); C V Sheepvaartonderneming Ankergracht v Stemcor (A/sia) Pty Ltd (2007) 160 FCR 342 at 370 [88] per Ryan and Dowsett JJ, 405 [229]-[230], 413 [266], [268] per Rares J. Dorval did not lead any evidence of the system, if any, for discharge of a cargo such as Yubase 6 from the Golden Lucy I .

80 Article 3 r 2 is, of course, expressly subject to the provisions of Art 4. The interaction between the two articles was discussed recently by the Full Court in the Ankergracht 160 FCR 342. It is well established that in order for a carrier to rely on the exceptions contained in Art 4 r 2 it must not be negligent or at fault, that is to say in breach of, relevantly, Art 3 r 2: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 152, 154 per Stephen J, 164-165 per Mason and Wilson JJ; Great China Metal Industries Co Ltd v Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1998) 196 CLR 161 at 193 [85] , 195-196 [91]-[95] per McHugh J, 216-219 [143]-[146] per Kirby J, 243 [228] per Callinan J, see too at 180-181 [49]-[50] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; the Ankergracht 160 FCR at 413-414 [270] per Rares J.</text>

<tocase>Consort Express Lines Pty Ltd v J-Mac Pty Ltd (2006) 232 ALR 341</tocase>
<text>110 The usual practice of the Court when awarding interest under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is to adopt the rates of interest applied by the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the Court is sitting. I have previously considered that to be appropriate in a case like the present: Consort Express Lines Pty Ltd v J-Mac Pty Ltd (2006) 232 ALR 341 at 358 [97]. The Supreme Court of New South Wales has a similar power to order interest before judgment under s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). As with s 51A, there is no prescribed rate under s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act . However, Schedule 5 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) prescribe as the rate payable on judgment debts 9% per annum for the period between 1 March 2002 and 31 December 2006 and 10% thereafter. That compares to 10.5% which, since 1997, O 35 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules 2001 (Cth) has prescribed as the equivalent rate on judgment debts in this Court. The practice in the Supreme Court of New South Wales has been to use its prescribed rates as a 'broad standard approach' to the award of prejudgment interest: Kalls Enterprises Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Baloglow (No 3) [2007] NSWCA 298 at [22] per Giles, Ipp and Basten JJA.</text>

<tocase>Glyn Mills Currie &amp; Co v The East and West India Dock Company (1882) 7 App Cas 591</tocase>
<text>22 Under the law merchant, an endorsement in blank of a negotiable instrument made out to order converts the instrument to a bearer instrument: Sewell v Burdick (1884) 10 App Cas 74 at 83 per Earl of Selborne LC, 92-93 per Lord Blackburn. In Lickbarrow v Mason (1794) 5 TR 683 at 686 the jury found that:
 
 '... by the custom of merchants, indorsements of bills of lading in blank, that is to say, by the shipper or shippers with their names only, have been, and are, and may be, filled up by the person or persons to whom they are so delivered or transmitted. ...' 
 

That custom has been accepted commercial practice since Lickbarrow v Mason 5 TR 683. The case established that a bill of lading was a transferable document of title: Glyn Mills Currie &amp; Co v The East and West India Dock Company (1882) 7 App Cas 591 at 604 per Lord Blackburn. In Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading (18 th ed, 1974) at 181 (20 th ed, 1996) at 184 the learned authors observed that a bill of lading endorsed in blank may pass from hand to hand by mere delivery so as to affect the property in the goods: see too Keppel Tatlee Bank Ltd v Bandung Shipping Pte Ltd [2003] 1 Lloyd's Rep 619 at 622 [18]-[20] (CA Singapore).

28 That argument is contrary to long settled principles of the law merchant and the express terms of the bill. In 1882 the great commercial lawyer, Lord Blackburn, said in Glyn Mills 7 App Cas at 604:
 
 'And the very object of making the bill of lading in parts would be baffled unless the delivery of one part of the bill of lading, duly assigned, had the same effect as the delivery of all the parts would have had.'

29 His Lordship observed that he had never been able to learn why merchants and shipowners continued the practice of making out a bill of lading in parts. But, he said that so long as the practice continues it was of vast importance not to unsettle the principles which had already been settled: Glyn Mills 7 App Cas at 605. In that case, like this one, bills of lading were issued in a set of three.

30 Here, the bill of lading contained the time honoured clause recording that the master had signed three original bills of lading '... of this tenor and date, one of which being accomplished, the others will be void'. Hilditch was the holder for value of the bill of lading. It was a negotiable instrument. Hilditch was entitled to present the bill of lading to Dorval to enforce its right to delivery of its property, being the cargo referred to in that document of title. On delivery of the bill by Hilditch to Dorval, the bill of lading was, as it said, 'accomplished'. The other two originals became void. Dorval's argument has no substance.

31 I am of opinion that Hilditch became a lawful holder of the bill of lading for the purposes of the Sea-Carriage Documents Act . This is because it had come into possession of the bill, in good faith, as a result of completion, by delivery, of the bill which was endorsed in blank. The bill had become a bearer bill through it being endorsed in blank by SK. It had been transferred from SK by delivery to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, then to National Australia Bank and, ultimately, by a transfer of the bill, as a bearer bill, to Hilditch (see the Sea-Carriage Documents Act ; s 5 , definition of 'lawful holder', par (b)).</text>

<text>80 Article 3 r 2 is, of course, expressly subject to the provisions of Art 4. The interaction between the two articles was discussed recently by the Full Court in the Ankergracht 160 FCR 342. It is well established that in order for a carrier to rely on the exceptions contained in Art 4 r 2 it must not be negligent or at fault, that is to say in breach of, relevantly, Art 3 r 2: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 152, 154 per Stephen J, 164-165 per Mason and Wilson JJ; Great China Metal Industries Co Ltd v Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1998) 196 CLR 161 at 193 [85] , 195-196 [91]-[95] per McHugh J, 216-219 [143]-[146] per Kirby J, 243 [228] per Callinan J, see too at 180-181 [49]-[50] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; the Ankergracht 160 FCR at 413-414 [270] per Rares J.

85 The fundamental question which the rules require to be addressed in a case like this is why was the cargo damaged: Great China 196 CLR at 173 [26], 181 [49] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, 195-196 [91]-[95] per McHugh J, 218-219 [146] per Kirby J, 243 [226] per Callinan J. Here, the answer is clear: because the ship did not properly and carefully discharge the Yubase 6. It permitted the admixture. The exceptions in Art 4 r 2 and particularly Art 4 r 2(i) simply cannot be engaged by a carrier who seeks to assert, as Dorval did here, that the cargo interest must direct it in performing its responsibilities under Art 3 r 2.

86 Article 3 r 8 expressly prohibits a carrier contracting out of its responsibilities and liabilities under the amended Hague Rules. I am of opinion that Dorval's contention that Hilditch had a responsibility to stop Dorval discharging when it was in breach of its obligations under Art 3 r 2 should be rejected.

87 Mr Kanagasabai and Mr McCarthy both gave evidence that during the discharge operations, the ship's officers observed the taking of samples from the ship's manifold from time to time. They said, and I accept, that each of those samples was contaminated. Each said that not all of the samples which he took were retained. I accept their evidence. I find that it was evident to both the ship's officers and crew and Hilditch's surveyors that the Yubase 6 was being discharged in a damaged condition and that the damage had occurred on the ship. Hilditch could have asked for the discharge to be halted and the cause of contamination investigated. Mr Kanagasabai did make such a request, but it appears to have been put to one side by him and the ship's officers. Just as obviously, the ship's officers could have, and should have, halted the discharge operation after seeing that the cargo was discharging in a contaminated condition. There is no evidence of why the officers and crew did nothing.</text>

<text>26 Even though the bill of lading was originally made between SK, as charterer, and Dorval, as owner, incorporating the charterparty dated 1 June 2006 between them, the bill contained the clause paramount. In the present circumstances it is common ground that that had the effect of incorporating the amended Hague Rules as a clause paramount in the bill of lading when it was transferred as a negotiable instrument by SK. Once the bill had been transferred before delivery of the cargo, the terms of the bill, as amended by the clause paramount, constituted the contract of carriage for the Yubase 6 cargo. This is because the bill had been endorsed by SK in blank and subsequently delivered to Hilditch: Leduc v Ward (1888) 20 QBD 475 at 479 per Lord Esher MR; The 'A1 Battani' [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep 219 at 222 per Sheen J; Tate and Lyle Ltd v Hain Steamship Co Ltd (1936) 55 Ll L Rep 159 at 174 per Lord Atkin.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/51.html</AustLII>
<text>78 The obligation of the carrier under Art 3 r 2 of the amended Hague Rules is a compound one. It requires not only that the carrier exercise reasonable care in the discharge of the goods, but also that it have a sound system for discharging them: Albacora SrL v Westcott &amp; Laurance Line Ltd [1966] 2 Lloyd's Rep 53 at 58 per Lord Reid, 62 per Lord Pierce and 64 per Lord Pearson; Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co (A/sia) Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 163 per Mason and Wilson JJ (with whom Gibbs J and Aickin J agreed at 149, 168); C V Sheepvaartonderneming Ankergracht v Stemcor (A/sia) Pty Ltd (2007) 160 FCR 342 at 370 [88] per Ryan and Dowsett JJ, 405 [229]-[230], 413 [266], [268] per Rares J. Dorval did not lead any evidence of the system, if any, for discharge of a cargo such as Yubase 6 from the Golden Lucy I .

80 Article 3 r 2 is, of course, expressly subject to the provisions of Art 4. The interaction between the two articles was discussed recently by the Full Court in the Ankergracht 160 FCR 342. It is well established that in order for a carrier to rely on the exceptions contained in Art 4 r 2 it must not be negligent or at fault, that is to say in breach of, relevantly, Art 3 r 2: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 152, 154 per Stephen J, 164-165 per Mason and Wilson JJ; Great China Metal Industries Co Ltd v Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1998) 196 CLR 161 at 193 [85] , 195-196 [91]-[95] per McHugh J, 216-219 [143]-[146] per Kirby J, 243 [228] per Callinan J, see too at 180-181 [49]-[50] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ; the Ankergracht 160 FCR at 413-414 [270] per Rares J.

89 Article 4 r 2(i) provides an exception to the carrier's liability in matters in which the damage arises or results from something which is beyond the control of the carrier or its servants: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 164 per Mason and Wilson JJ. The damage here did not arise or result from something beyond the control of the ship or its servants. Quite the contrary, the damage arose because the ship's officers and crew could easily have stopped the discharge but did not. Nor did they explain their failure to give evidence. In Gamlen Chemical [1980] HCA 51 ; 147 CLR 142, Mason and Wilson JJ were considering the Hague Rules, but their comments are equally applicable to the amended Hague Rules. They said that the scheme of the Rules was to impose certain responsibilities and liabilities on the carrier of goods by sea from which it could not contract out, by force of Art 3 r 8, but to give it immunity in respect of loss or damage caused otherwise than by negligence for which it is responsible, save in special cases to which they referred: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 165.

90 In Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 163-164 Mason and Wilson JJ considered the question of concurrent causes of a loss under the Hague Rules. There, the carrier argued that even though in breach of Art III r 2, the goods had not been properly stowed, it was entitled to the benefit of the exception in Art IV r 2(c) because the vessel had encountered conditions which amounted to a peril of the sea. The trial judge had found that had the goods been properly stowed, the damage would not have occurred. Thus, the negligent stowage and the perils of the sea were concurrent causes of the loss. Mason and Wilson JJ said:
 
 'It seems to us that an accurate reflection of these findings requires one to treat the two concurrent causes of the loss as inseparable, and therefore joint. The loss would not have occurred but for the faulty stowage, but on the other hand, the faulty stowage did not cause the loss by itself. On this view, and treating the matter strictly as a matter of construction of the rule, it cannot be said that the damage resulted from a peril of the sea, and the appellant fails.'

91 Thus, the carrier could not escape liability by proving the existence of a circumstance excepting it under Art IV r 2 where its negligence in breach of Art III r 2 had caused damage to the cargo. Mason and Wilson JJ said that a construction which excepted the carrier from liability in that scenario would denude the obligation imposed by Art III r 2 of much of its substance. They recognised that a number of the exceptions in Art IV r 2 involved situations which were beyond the control of the carrier or its servants. They said that any reference in that context to negligence was inappropriate because the events excepted were, of their nature, ones which occurred independently of negligence on the part of the carrier.

92 Mason and Wilson JJ explained ( Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 165):
 
 'To the extent to which Art. III, r. 2, by using the word "properly" imposes on the carrier a more onerous duty than an absence of negligence then clearly to that extent the immunities described in Art. IV, r. 2 operate to qualify the liability otherwise resting on the carrier; indeed, if this is not the case then as Temperley points out in his monograph, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924 , 3rd ed, p 48, pa.r (q) is not an immunity at all, for it would do no more than shift the onus of proof on to the carrier. On the other hand, if such a line of reasoning seeks to extract a greater symmetry of purpose than the Rules viewed in their entirety will admit, then the proper observation is simply that it must not be thought that the effect of the prefatory words to Art. III, r. 2 is to compel some impact on the scope and operation of the obligation imposed by that rule from every provision in Art. IV.'

93 At the end of the day, the question of whether a carrier can rely upon an immunity under Art IV r 2 must be answered by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 165 per Mason and Wilson JJ. Where the facts disclose that a loss was caused by the concurrent effects of an excepted and non-excepted circumstance, the carrier remains liable. The carrier will only escape liability if it proves that the loss or damage was caused by an excepted circumstance alone: cannot The Torenia [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 210 at 218; see also Tetley W, Marine Cargo Claims (3 rd ed, 1988) p 328.

99 Accordingly, I am of opinion that the predominant responsibility for the damage lies with Dorval. And, even if Hilditch's and Dorval's responsibility for the continuation of the discharge while contamination was occurring on board the Golden Lucy I were equal, Gamlen Chemical [1980] HCA 51 ; 147 CLR 142 requires me to find Dorval liable for damages.

100 Relevantly Art 3 r 6 provides:
 
 
 '6. Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, or, if the loss or damage be not apparent, within three days, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the sea carriage document.'

101 Immediately following completion of the discharge, Mr Kanagasabai delivered to the master at about 9.00am on 9 July a second notice of protest. He said to the master that he was giving him a 'consolidated notice' and that he had protested previously but had included everything in the latest notice. The notice stated, relevantly:
 
 'We ... draw your attention to the following irregularities. 
 
 
 
 1. Prior to discharge No 2 pump strainer was inspected and noted to contain Molasses. 
 2. At the commencement of discharge, manifold samples were noted to be discoloured and contained substance like Molasses. 
 3. Approximately 12000 litres were slopped in to shore slop tanks due to cloudy samples. 
 4. Throughout the discharge, ship and shore manifold samples drawn were cloudy. 
 5. There were delays to discharge because of cleaning No 2 pump strainer and slopping to minimize contamination. 
 
 Details of any claim will be submitted in due course if considered necessary. 
 
 
 
 Should you or your agent wish to make contact on any matter arising out of this notice, please contact our principals or ourselves.' 
 
 The master recorded on the notice:
 
 'The substance like molasses is incorrect. The quantity counts only from Caleb Brett Surveyor.'</text>

<text>26 Even though the bill of lading was originally made between SK, as charterer, and Dorval, as owner, incorporating the charterparty dated 1 June 2006 between them, the bill contained the clause paramount. In the present circumstances it is common ground that that had the effect of incorporating the amended Hague Rules as a clause paramount in the bill of lading when it was transferred as a negotiable instrument by SK. Once the bill had been transferred before delivery of the cargo, the terms of the bill, as amended by the clause paramount, constituted the contract of carriage for the Yubase 6 cargo. This is because the bill had been endorsed by SK in blank and subsequently delivered to Hilditch: Leduc v Ward (1888) 20 QBD 475 at 479 per Lord Esher MR; The 'A1 Battani' [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep 219 at 222 per Sheen J; Tate and Lyle Ltd v Hain Steamship Co Ltd (1936) 55 Ll L Rep 159 at 174 per Lord Atkin.

<text>93 At the end of the day, the question of whether a carrier can rely upon an immunity under Art IV r 2 must be answered by reference to all the circumstances of a particular case: Gamlen Chemical 147 CLR at 165 per Mason and Wilson JJ. Where the facts disclose that a loss was caused by the concurrent effects of an excepted and non-excepted circumstance, the carrier remains liable. The carrier will only escape liability if it proves that the loss or damage was caused by an excepted circumstance alone: cannot The Torenia [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 210 at 218; see also Tetley W, Marine Cargo Claims (3 rd ed, 1988) p 328.</text>

<text>25 Hilditch was entitled to delivery of the cargo because it was the holder of the bill of lading. It presented the bill to Dorval and received delivery of the Yubase 6. At the time of presentation, on the evidence, Hilditch was also the owner of the cargo and had the property in it. (There is no evidence that its rights were subject to any security interest which National Australia Bank might have had. But, in any event, such an interest does not prevent Hilditch having property in the cargo: Sewell 10 App Cas at 84-85 per Earl of Selborne LC, 92-93 per Lord Blackburn; Westpac Banking Corporation v 'Stone Gemini' [1999] FCA 434 ; (1999) 110 FCR 47 at 58-59 [36] - [37] per Tamberlin J.)</text>
