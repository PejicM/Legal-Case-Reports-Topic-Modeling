<tocase>Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2009/1225.html</AustLII>
<text>The general nature of the conduct which is alleged by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Authority) to constitute contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act), together with pertinent principles in relation to the imposition of penalty are canvassed at some length in reasons for judgment which I delivered on 23 October 2009 in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (No 4) [2009] FCA 1225 (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)). These reasons for the judgment should also then, in respect of those two subjects, be read in conjunction with that earlier (ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4)) judgment in this matter.

Some repetition is necessary as to the general background, if only to provide a context against which the particular involvement of Jobspy and Mr Moles falls for assessment of penalty. The essence of the contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act , which are established by the default judgment, is a contravention, and a repeated contravention, by the sending of unsolicited short message service (SMS) messages to the mobile telephones of users who have been deceived, inveigled even, into providing their mobile telephone numbers to representatives of either Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong (Mobilegate), or, as the case may be, Winning Bid Pty Ltd (Winning Bid), under the belief that they were corresponding with individuals seeking to meet them and form relationships via dating websites.

It was the very essence of the businesses of Mobilegate and Winning Bid to engage in this conduct. That conduct is a form of seduction for reward of those who are vulnerable. It is a particularly vile form of conduct. Moreover, it is a form of conduct which, when the deception is appreciated by its victim, wounds in a peculiarly embarrassing and emotional way, quite aside from its financial impact. Those non-financial aspects of victim impact are such that the perpetrator of the contravention is to some extent rendered immune, or at least afforded a degree of immunity, from a likelihood of complaint, in my opinion. That is a feature, in my opinion, which is not unknown in respect of criminal activity, and I interpolate at once this is not criminal activity, but contraventions of civil penalties, which touches upon a person's sexual nature. In other words, an embarrassment attends the victim of the contravention and that embarrassment in turn provides the degree of immunity from complaint. I regard that as an aggravating aspect of the contravening conduct.</text>

<tocase>Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377</tocase>

<text>Another factor which I took into account in the ACMA v Mobilegate (No 4) judgment is that articulated by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity 1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 (Clarity1) at para 43. By reference to other authorities, his Honour observed that, while he accepted that the issue of capacity to pay is a relevant factor, it is one "of less importance when balanced against the necessity of imposing a penalty that satisfies the objective of general deterrence".

Deterrence is a factor of particular importance in this case. I have already adverted to the need for penalties to demonstrate that both in the specific and general senses. Whilst the Act does provide for large penalties, it nonetheless makes provision for a daily maximum, something of a cap in other words. Nicholson J drew attention to this feature of the legislation in Clarity 1 by reference to the explanatory memorandum to the bill which became the Spam Act . It is there stated: 
 
 A daily ceiling for penalties has been set and may be charged for all contraventions against a particular provision that have occurred in one day. This has been included to ensure that a meaningful penalty may be charged for a single contravention without causing an unrealistically large penalty payable for multiple contraventions. For example, there are reported cases of dedicated spammers sending millions of unsolicited commercial and electronic messages each day. Without a ceiling amount for daily contraventions such a spammer could potentially be liable for a million contraventions.

Jobspy and its director, Mr Moles, were involved in contravening conduct the subject of default judgment for a period in excess of 800 days. Using the maximum penalties under the Spam Act as a guide for calculation that yields, in the case of Mr Moles, a total potential penalty of over $35 million, and in the case of Jobspy over $100 million.</text>
