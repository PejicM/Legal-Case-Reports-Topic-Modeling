<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1949/26.html</AustLII>
<text>13 The essence of the Commissioner's appeal is that the exercise of discretion by the Tribunal miscarried by reason of one or more errors of law: House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505, Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360. With the exception of Question of Law (c), the common factor in the questions of law posed to the Court, and the grounds of appeal of the Commissioner, is that the Tribunal either took into account irrelevant considerations in exercising its discretion, or failed to take into account relevant considerations. Proceedings before the Tribunal miscarry due to error of law where the Tribunal fails to determine a matter before it by reference to relevant considerations: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 (especially per Fisher J at 350).</text>

<tocase>Coco v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 115 ALR 670</tocase>
<text>29 As Lockhart J observed in Coco v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1993) 115 ALR 670 at 676 however, it will usually be easier to identify matters irrelevant to the power than it will be to establish that the decision-maker has failed to take into account a relevant matter.

30 In considering the nature of the discretion conferred by s 298-20 and relevant considerations it is useful to have regard to:
 
 
 &#8226; the legislative context;
 &#8226; a number of Explanatory Memoranda where the remission discretion was discussed; and
 &#8226; relevant authorities where the remission discretion in s 298-20 has been considered.

31 The uniform administrative penalty regime introduced by the A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Act (No 2) 2000 (Cth) was enacted to apply to all taxation laws for which the Commissioner had administration. The object of Div 284 Sch 1 to the Act , which imposes administrative penalties for, inter alia , making a statement that is false or misleading, is stated in s 284- 10 as being:
 
 ...to provide a uniform administrative penalty regime for all taxation laws to enable administrative penalties to apply to entities that fail to meet their obligations under those laws in relation to:
 (a) making false or misleading statements; and
 (b) taking a position that is not reasonably arguable; and
 (c) entering into schemes; and
 (d) refusing to provide documents to the Commissioner.</text>

<tocase>Hobart Central Child Care Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/AATA/2005/1027.html</AustLII>
<text>41 Counsel for the Commissioner helpfully referred me to a number of authorities where the Tribunal has reviewed the discretion of the Commissioner under s 298- 20 :
 
 
 &#8226; In Hobart Central Child Care Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351 where the Commissioner took the view that tax shortfalls resulting from subsequently disallowed deductions were caused by the taxpayer's intentional disregard of the law, and a penalty was imposed, the Tribunal found that there were no grounds for remitting the penalties under s 298- 20 . The Tribunal said:
 "Section 298- 20 of Schedule 1 to the TA Act provides that the Commissioner may remit all or part of a penalty. It does not set out any guidelines as governing the exercise of the discretion. Given the provisions relating to the imposition of penalties, there would clearly need to be circumstances that could be regarded as mitigating the taxpayer's behaviour in some way while bearing in mind the purpose for which the income tax is imposed and paid and the role of the ITA Act and TA Act in supporting that purpose. I am satisfied that there are no circumstances that mitigate those in which HCCC finds itself." (at 2,385)
 
 &#8226; In Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219 the taxpayer had failed to lodge quarterly BASs on time for the periods ending 30 June 2001 through to 30 September 2003, and finally lodged them in early December 2003. The Tribunal stated that the remission power should only be granted where special circumstances exist (at 2221). It found that the failure to lodge the BASs by the due dates was due to factors outside the control of the taxpayer, namely the failure of the taxpayer's bookkeeper to discharge her duties and to disclose such failure, and the unavoidable absence (due to a stroke) of the manager employed by the taxpayer to supervise the bookkeeper's activities. The Tribunal was satisfied that the combination of factors was unusual and represented special circumstances. In relation to the claim of the taxpayer that the absence of a manager coupled with drought conditions, loss of stock and the cumulative cost of penalties would leave it in a very difficult financial position, the Tribunal noted that:
 "While not necessarily a special circumstance, the general financial losses caused by the mishaps to the farm manager also have some relevance to this decision."(at 2222)
 
 &#8226; In Kowadlo v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 786 the taxpayers' returns for the year ended 30 June 2002 were lodged late and a penalty was imposed. The Tribunal noted that returns for each of the three prior years were lodged late without penalty, but found:
 "As stated on behalf of (the Commissioner), the penalty regime is to penalise non-compliance with the requirements of the legislation. Loss of revenue is not the issue. While particular and unexpected problems of a tax agent may be appropriate grounds for remission of all or part of a penalty, I am of the opinion here that the consistent late lodgement of returns by the applicants without prior penalties has allowed already any appropriate remission. If the late lodgement is entirely the fault of the tax agent, and I had no clear evidence that it was, this is a matter between the tax agent and his client. I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that there is justification for any remission of the penalty."(at [10])
 
 &#8226; In Re Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1129 the Commissioner took the view that the taxpayer was not entitled to claim GST input credits in the relevant circumstances, and because the case involved intentional disregard of a taxation law, imposed a penalty of 75% under Div 284. The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Commissioner not to remit the penalty or any part thereof in circumstances where the taxpayer had intentionally understated tax or knowingly over-claimed a credit.
 &#8226; In Re William Vazquez &amp; Associates v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 301 ; (2005) 58 ATR 1357 where a director of the taxpayer said that the taxpayer did not have the funds to make payment of outstanding amounts, and that he had been of the mistaken belief as to the time payments were due to be made, the Commissioner imposed a penalty for late lodgement. In allowing partial remission of the penalty on the basis that the penalty was excessive, it is useful to note the following comments of the Tribunal:
 "[14] Although the penalty imposed is described as an 'administrative penalty' it is still a penalty and normal sentencing principles must be kept in mind when exercising the discretion as to whether to mitigate the penalty of not. In particular apart from circumstances peculiar to the individual offending taxpayer the threefold purposes of punishment must be kept in mind. Those purposes are retribution, deterrence and reformation. In particular, see the discussion of sentencing principles in R v Kane [1974] VR 759 at 764-765.
 ...
 [26] At para 98.5.3 of [the ATO receivables policy document] it is stated that in determining penalty the Commissioner will have regard to the lodgement history of the taxpayer and the effort taken by the Tax Office to obtain lodgement.
 ...
 [28] In seeking to apply those principles to the individual circumstances of this taxpayer, I do not regard them as either derogating from or adding to general principles regarding mitigation of penalty.
 [29] Notwithstanding the comments in Re Kowadlo and FCT [2004] AATA 786 , I do regard any loss or potential loss or revenue as being part of the matrix of factors affecting a decision whether to remit penalty or not.
 [30] I accept that the applicant, by its directors was under a mistaken belief that payment had to accompany lodgement. What detracts from any mitigating factor is that the applicant made no attempt to contact the ATO and explain its difficulties and seek some arrangement. Further, even when 2 reminder letters were sent the approach of the directors of the company seems to have been one of ignoring the problem in the hope that it would go away.
 [31] On the other hand, there has apparently been no prior or subsequent breach. The company is apparently viable but subject to fluctuations in its income...
 [32] Quite clearly, the applicant has learnt a salutary lesson that time constrains must be obeyed and that difficulties with returns should be negotiated with the respondent at the outset. This can be classed as reformation.
 [33] So far as retribution and general deterrence are concerned, no doubt the applicant and its accountants and directors are now aware of the late lodgement provisions and will make others aware."
 
 &#8226; In Re Kizquart Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 582 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1112, the Tribunal followed Vazquez and found that in determining whether the discretion to mitigate should be exercised, normal sentencing principles should be taken into account (at 1116). In finding that the amount of the penalty was excessive, the Tribunal found it relevant that: 
 
 
 
 
 o the taxpayer had reformed his practice and no longer lodged his statements late, and accordingly it was not necessary to punish him for his inadvertent failure in view of his difficulties during the period in question (at 1116)
 o there had not been any actual loss or realistically any potential loss of revenue which might affect a decision whether to remit penalty
 o the late lodgements were caused by a combination of the taxpayer's failure to understand the new system, pressure of work and personal difficulties, all factors amounting to a delay caused by circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer
 o the taxpayer had a good tax record and contacted the ATO once he recognised that he had not understood his obligations.

42 As the Commissioner noted in his submissions, Hobart Central Child Care [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351, Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219, Kowadlo [2004] AATA 786 and Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; 60 ATR 1129 are consistent with the Commissioner's submissions as to the factors to which a decision-maker may have regard in relation to the exercise of the remission discretion, whereas William Vazquez [2005] AATA 301 ; 58 ATR 1357 and Kizquart [2005] AATA 582 ; 60 ATR 1112 are not.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>28 Although s 298-20, which authorises the Commissioner to remit all or part of the penalty to the taxpayer, requires the Commissioner to notify the taxpayer of reasons for a decision to either not remit a penalty or remit only part of the penalty, the section does not specify the considerations the Commissioner must take into account in so doing. In these circumstances it is useful to note observations of Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-40 where his Honour said:
 
 "What factors a decision-maker is bound to consider in making the decision is determined by construction of the statute conferring the discretion. If the statute expressly states the considerations to be taken into account, it will often be necessary for the court to decide whether those enumerated factors are exhaustive or merely inclusive. If the relevant factors - and in this context I use this expression to refer to the factors which the decision-maker is bound to consider - are not expressly stated, they must be determined by implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act . In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations, this Court has held that, where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined, the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined, except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard... By analogy, where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute, the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act ."

In finding that the amount of the penalty was excessive, the Tribunal found it relevant that: 
 
 
 
 
 o the taxpayer had reformed his practice and no longer lodged his statements late, and accordingly it was not necessary to punish him for his inadvertent failure in view of his difficulties during the period in question (at 1116)
 o there had not been any actual loss or realistically any potential loss of revenue which might affect a decision whether to remit penalty
 o the late lodgements were caused by a combination of the taxpayer's failure to understand the new system, pressure of work and personal difficulties, all factors amounting to a delay caused by circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer
 o the taxpayer had a good tax record and contacted the ATO once he recognised that he had not understood his obligations.

42 As the Commissioner noted in his submissions, Hobart Central Child Care [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351, Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219, Kowadlo [2004] AATA 786 and Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; 60 ATR 1129 are consistent with the Commissioner's submissions as to the factors to which a decision-maker may have regard in relation to the exercise of the remission discretion, whereas William Vazquez [2005] AATA 301 ; 58 ATR 1357 and Kizquart [2005] AATA 582 ; 60 ATR 1112 are not.</text>

<text>41 Counsel for the Commissioner helpfully referred me to a number of authorities where the Tribunal has reviewed the discretion of the Commissioner under s 298- 20 :
 
 
 &#8226; In Hobart Central Child Care Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351 where the Commissioner took the view that tax shortfalls resulting from subsequently disallowed deductions were caused by the taxpayer's intentional disregard of the law, and a penalty was imposed, the Tribunal found that there were no grounds for remitting the penalties under s 298- 20 . The Tribunal said:
 "Section 298- 20 of Schedule 1 to the TA Act provides that the Commissioner may remit all or part of a penalty. It does not set out any guidelines as governing the exercise of the discretion. Given the provisions relating to the imposition of penalties, there would clearly need to be circumstances that could be regarded as mitigating the taxpayer's behaviour in some way while bearing in mind the purpose for which the income tax is imposed and paid and the role of the ITA Act and TA Act in supporting that purpose. I am satisfied that there are no circumstances that mitigate those in which HCCC finds itself." (at 2,385)
 
 &#8226; In Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219 the taxpayer had failed to lodge quarterly BASs on time for the periods ending 30 June 2001 through to 30 September 2003, and finally lodged them in early December 2003. The Tribunal stated that the remission power should only be granted where special circumstances exist (at 2221). It found that the failure to lodge the BASs by the due dates was due to factors outside the control of the taxpayer, namely the failure of the taxpayer's bookkeeper to discharge her duties and to disclose such failure, and the unavoidable absence (due to a stroke) of the manager employed by the taxpayer to supervise the bookkeeper's activities. The Tribunal was satisfied that the combination of factors was unusual and represented special circumstances. In relation to the claim of the taxpayer that the absence of a manager coupled with drought conditions, loss of stock and the cumulative cost of penalties would leave it in a very difficult financial position, the Tribunal noted that:
 "While not necessarily a special circumstance, the general financial losses caused by the mishaps to the farm manager also have some relevance to this decision."(at 2222)
 
 &#8226; In Kowadlo v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] AATA 786 the taxpayers' returns for the year ended 30 June 2002 were lodged late and a penalty was imposed. The Tribunal noted that returns for each of the three prior years were lodged late without penalty, but found:
 "As stated on behalf of (the Commissioner), the penalty regime is to penalise non-compliance with the requirements of the legislation. Loss of revenue is not the issue. While particular and unexpected problems of a tax agent may be appropriate grounds for remission of all or part of a penalty, I am of the opinion here that the consistent late lodgement of returns by the applicants without prior penalties has allowed already any appropriate remission. If the late lodgement is entirely the fault of the tax agent, and I had no clear evidence that it was, this is a matter between the tax agent and his client. I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that there is justification for any remission of the penalty."(at [10])
 
 &#8226; In Re Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1129 the Commissioner took the view that the taxpayer was not entitled to claim GST input credits in the relevant circumstances, and because the case involved intentional disregard of a taxation law, imposed a penalty of 75% under Div 284. The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Commissioner not to remit the penalty or any part thereof in circumstances where the taxpayer had intentionally understated tax or knowingly over-claimed a credit.
 &#8226; In Re William Vazquez &amp; Associates v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 301 ; (2005) 58 ATR 1357 where a director of the taxpayer said that the taxpayer did not have the funds to make payment of outstanding amounts, and that he had been of the mistaken belief as to the time payments were due to be made, the Commissioner imposed a penalty for late lodgement. In allowing partial remission of the penalty on the basis that the penalty was excessive, it is useful to note the following comments of the Tribunal:
 "[14] Although the penalty imposed is described as an 'administrative penalty' it is still a penalty and normal sentencing principles must be kept in mind when exercising the discretion as to whether to mitigate the penalty of not. In particular apart from circumstances peculiar to the individual offending taxpayer the threefold purposes of punishment must be kept in mind. Those purposes are retribution, deterrence and reformation. In particular, see the discussion of sentencing principles in R v Kane [1974] VR 759 at 764-765.
 ...
 [26] At para 98.5.3 of [the ATO receivables policy document] it is stated that in determining penalty the Commissioner will have regard to the lodgement history of the taxpayer and the effort taken by the Tax Office to obtain lodgement.
 ...
 [28] In seeking to apply those principles to the individual circumstances of this taxpayer, I do not regard them as either derogating from or adding to general principles regarding mitigation of penalty.
 [29] Notwithstanding the comments in Re Kowadlo and FCT [2004] AATA 786 , I do regard any loss or potential loss or revenue as being part of the matrix of factors affecting a decision whether to remit penalty or not.
 [30] I accept that the applicant, by its directors was under a mistaken belief that payment had to accompany lodgement. What detracts from any mitigating factor is that the applicant made no attempt to contact the ATO and explain its difficulties and seek some arrangement. Further, even when 2 reminder letters were sent the approach of the directors of the company seems to have been one of ignoring the problem in the hope that it would go away.
 [31] On the other hand, there has apparently been no prior or subsequent breach. The company is apparently viable but subject to fluctuations in its income...
 [32] Quite clearly, the applicant has learnt a salutary lesson that time constrains must be obeyed and that difficulties with returns should be negotiated with the respondent at the outset. This can be classed as reformation.
 [33] So far as retribution and general deterrence are concerned, no doubt the applicant and its accountants and directors are now aware of the late lodgement provisions and will make others aware."
 
 &#8226; In Re Kizquart Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 582 ; (2005) 60 ATR 1112, the Tribunal followed Vazquez and found that in determining whether the discretion to mitigate should be exercised, normal sentencing principles should be taken into account (at 1116).

 o the late lodgements were caused by a combination of the taxpayer's failure to understand the new system, pressure of work and personal difficulties, all factors amounting to a delay caused by circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer
 o the taxpayer had a good tax record and contacted the ATO once he recognised that he had not understood his obligations.

42 As the Commissioner noted in his submissions, Hobart Central Child Care [2005] AATA 1027 ; 2005 ATC 2351, Otway Pastoral Pty Ltd [2005] AATA 649 ; 2005 ATC 2219, Kowadlo [2004] AATA 786 and Taxpayer v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2005] AATA 696 ; 60 ATR 1129 are consistent with the Commissioner's submissions as to the factors to which a decision-maker may have regard in relation to the exercise of the remission discretion, whereas William Vazquez [2005] AATA 301 ; 58 ATR 1357 and Kizquart [2005] AATA 582 ; 60 ATR 1112 are not.

57 Accordingly in my view to the extent that the Tribunal's decisions in William Vazquez and Kizquart took into account the fact that in those cases there had not been any actual loss or realistically any potential loss of revenue as a relevant consideration in exercising the remission discretion, those cases were wrongly decided.</text>

<tocase>Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323</tocase>
<text>13 The essence of the Commissioner's appeal is that the exercise of discretion by the Tribunal miscarried by reason of one or more errors of law: House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505, Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360. With the exception of Question of Law (c), the common factor in the questions of law posed to the Court, and the grounds of appeal of the Commissioner, is that the Tribunal either took into account irrelevant considerations in exercising its discretion, or failed to take into account relevant considerations. Proceedings before the Tribunal miscarry due to error of law where the Tribunal fails to determine a matter before it by reference to relevant considerations: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 (especially per Fisher J at 350).</text>
