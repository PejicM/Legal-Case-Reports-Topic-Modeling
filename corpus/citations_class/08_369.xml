<tocase>British Thomson-Houston Co Limited v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited [1924] 2 Ch 160</tocase>
<text>34 Allphones also argued that what Mr Lloyd had said in his affidavit could not be read against it. In British Thomson-Houston Co Limited v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited [1924] 2 Ch 160 at 164-165 (see also at 170-171 per Atkin LJ) Pollock MR said that affidavits or documents which a party knowingly used as true in a judicial proceeding for the purpose of proving a particular fact are capable of being evidence against that party in subsequent proceedings to prove the same fact. He said that the principle applied in cases where the party adducing the document, whether an affidavit or deposition, knew of its contents beforehand and elected to put it forward in support of the party's case. He referred to what Crompton J had said in Richards v Morgan (1863) 4 B &amp; S 641 at 659, namely:
 
 'It must always be remembered that it is not the obtaining the affidavit or deposition but the making use of it as true with knowledge of the contents, which is the ground on which such evidence is supposed to be receivable.' 


 
Cockburn CJ in the same case said (4 B &amp; S at 661):
 
 'It cannot be doubted that a man's assertions are admissions, whether made in the course of a judicial proceeding or otherwise, and, in the former case, whether he was himself a party to such proceeding or not. It may be given in evidence against him in any suit or action in which the fact so asserted or admitted becomes material to the issue to be determined. And in principle, there can be no difference whether the assertion or admission be made by the party himself who is sought to be affected by it, or by someone employed, directed or invited by him to make the particular statement on his behalf. In like manner, a man who brings forward another for the purposes of asserting or proving some fact on his behalf, whether in a court of justice or elsewhere, must be taken himself to assert the fact that he thus seeks to establish.'</text>

<tocase>Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited [2003] HCA 49 ; (2003) 216 CLR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/49.html</AustLII>
<text>31 I am of opinion that the definition of 'proceeding' in the Federal Court of Australia Act does not affect the construction of 'proceeding' as that term is used in the Evidence Act . I am fortified in this view by the recognition that the Evidence Act itself is procedural in substance. It regulates how evidence is to be received and what is admissible. It does not itself create rights or liabilities. That is why the Act is careful to distinguish between various proceedings and to provide rules for the adducing of evidence in them. In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited [2003] HCA 49 ; (2003) 216 CLR 161 at 200 [122] and 205 [133] Hayne J (with whom Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreed) said that the rules governing the admissibility of evidence fall under the expression 'practice and procedure'. Gummow J, with whom Kirby J agreed on this point, said that more substantive rights were involved: Labrador 216 CLR at 173 [33]. Kirby J referred to the assignment of the burden and identification of a standard of proof as being matters which can be of critical importance to the conduct of a trial. They could thereby partake of certain features of practice and procedure, but he also recognised that each was arguably something more than that because each affected, in a way, the very character of the trial. In that case the provisions of the Excise Act 1901 dealt with how matters might be proved: Labrador 216 CLR at 185 [76].

32 Essentially, whether or not a previous representation amounts to an admission is a question of the law of evidence. That question has the character of a matter of practice or procedure. The Evidence Act regulates the way in which a proceeding is conducted. Of course, the Act applies a particular standard of proof depending on whether the proceedings are civil or criminal and in that way the application of the Act may affect substantive rights. But the substantive operation of the Act applies the practice and procedure apposite to regulate the adducing of evidence on each occasion on which it is tendered. The Act does not create any proceeding in a court. Rather, it provides a procedure to apply to or in an existing cause of action or matter for adducing evidence.

33 Proof of what occurred before Tamberlin J is capable of establishing a fact that occurred on an occasion outside this trial. The interlocutory proceeding was not this trial of the issues between the parties. For these reasons, I am of opinion that what occurred before Tamberlin J did not occur in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which it is now sought to tender Mr Lloyd's affidavit. It follows that Mr Lloyd's affidavit is capable of being a previous representation and thus capable of falling within the meaning of 'admission' as a matter of law.</text>

<tocase>Doe d. Wetherell v Bird (1835) 7 C &amp; P 6</tocase>
<text>18 It has long been the law that in civil cases a solicitor has implied authority to make admissions receivable by the Court against his or her client during the actual progress of litigation, either for the purposes of dispensing with proof at trial or in certain other respects. Thus formal admissions made by attorneys of both sides at a first trial could be relied on at the second trial after the first verdict had been set aside. Lord Denman CJ said that there was no doubt that the admissions were receivable at the second trial, albeit that they had been made before, and for the purposes of, the first trial: see Doe d. Wetherell v Bird (1835) 7 C &amp; P 6 at 7. And in Langley v Earl of Oxford (1836) 5 LJ Exch 166 at 167, Lord Abinger CB held that an admission to be used at the trial of a cause, whenever it should take place, was admissible. It did not matter that the admission had been made before the first trial. Once made, it could be used at the second trial: see also Phipson, The Law of Evidence (8 th edition, 1942) at p 234.</text>

There Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ said that it was a question of law whether a statement made by a party to an action is capable of constituting an admission on any relevant issue and that this, in general, must be determined by an examination of the words used: Smith 89 CLR at 535; see too Dovuro Pty Limited v Wilkins [2003] HCA 51 ; (2003) 215 CLR 317 at 340-341 [68] - [71] per Gummow J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1997/125.html</AustLII>
<text>17 Mansfield J briefly touched on the authority of counsel in separate proceedings to make admissions which affected that counsel's client in In the matter of Simionato Holdings Pty Limited; Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Simionato Holdings Pty Limited [1997] FCA 125. He referred to what Franki J had earlier said in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Limited (1984) 56 ALR 647 at 663, namely:
 
 'In general, the passages sought to be tendered as admissions are statements made by counsel appearing in interlocutory matters and intended to be acted upon by the judge. I can see no reason why they should not be regarded as prima facie evidence against the client on whose behalf counsel was addressing the court.' 


 
Here, of course, Mr Lloyd's statements were not statements made by counsel addressing a court. Rather, they were statements put forward by him, on behalf of his client, in an affidavit tendered as evidence of the facts.</text>

<tocase>Lloyd v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd [1986] AC 350 ; (1985) 3 NSWLR 728</tocase>
<text>36 Here, of course, Allphones, being a corporation, can only act by others. It can have no opinions because it has no mind, but it can have attributed to it a state of mind or knowledge based on what those whom it authorises to act on its behalf say or do: Lloyd v David Syme &amp; Co Ltd [1986] AC 350 at 366; (1985) 3 NSWLR 728 at 736 per Lord Keith of Kinkel. For these reasons, I am of opinion that Mr Lloyd was a person whose evidence can be treated as being an admission by Allphones.

37 Next, Allphones argued that the quality of Mr Lloyd's evidence was such that it could not be treated as being an admission of anything. It pointed to the fact that Mr Lloyd did not state his source of knowledge or belief in the affidavit. This is a complaint which does not go to the capacity of the statements to be used as evidence. It merely may go to their weight, albeit that Mr Lloyd's evidence was put forward by Allphones to prove some of the very facts it now says should not be accepted from the same information. The question is whether the representations in pars 7 and 8 are capable of showing that before giving its notice of intention to terminate, Allphones had knowledge of the failure of Hoy Mobile to account for receipts from sales of the unlocked phones. As Allphones pointed out the introductory phrase in par 7 'in or around May 2006' is somewhat vague. It also argued that pars 7 and 8 of the affidavit are vague in relation to the extent of Allphones' knowledge and the circumstances in which it was obtained.</text>

<tocase>Lustre Hosiery Limited v York [1935] HCA 71 ; (1935) 54 CLR 134</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1935/71.html</AustLII>
<text>38 I am of opinion that these criticisms do not prevent their reception into evidence of the representations as admissions. In Lustre Hosiery Limited v York [1935] HCA 71 ; (1935) 54 CLR 134 at 143 to 144 Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said:
 
 'This course of authority seems consistent with the view that words or conduct amount to an admission receivable in evidence against the party if they disclose an intention to affirm or acknowledge the existence of a fact whatever be the party's source of information or belief. 
 
 In determining whether he intends to affirm or acknowledge the state of facts the party's knowledge or source of information may be immaterial or if he states that another person has told him of it and it appears that he has additional sources of information to the like effect it may be right to understand him as implying a belief in what he repeats or again a person who fails to contradict a statement concerning matters within his own knowledge may be understood as acquiescing in the statement if the circumstances are such as to make it unlikely that he'd allow an erroneous statement to pass unchallenged 
 
 But although the meaning of his words or conduct may depend upon the state of his knowledge once that meaning appears and an intention is disclosed to assert or acknowledge the state of facts its admissibility in evidence as an admission is independent of the party's actual knowledge of the true facts. When admitted in evidence however its probative force must be determined by reference to the circumstances in which it's made and may depend all together upon the party's source of knowledge. 
 
 If it appears that he had no knowledge or that although he had some means of knowledge he had formed no certain or considered belief and indicated nothing amounting to a personal judgment or conclusion of his own the probative force of the admission may be so small that a jury ought not be allowed to act upon it alone or in preference to opposing evidence.'</text>

<tocase>Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1974/40.html</AustLII>
<text>6 Allphones gave Hoy Mobile a notice of its intention to terminate the franchise agreement in late August 2006. Before that occurred, but after Allphones became aware of the allegation of unlocking of the telephones, Hoy Mobile alleges that Allphones acted in a way which affirmed the franchise agreement. Hoy Mobile alleges that Allphones required it to do certain things in accordance with the franchise agreement. Hoy Mobile relies on this affirmation, or election, to deny that Allphones was entitled to terminate the franchise agreement. It claimed that when Allphones sought to require Hoy Mobile to comply with requirements made by it earlier in June and July 2006 that conduct was inconsistent with Allphones' subsequent attempt to exercise a right to terminate: see Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd [1974] HCA 40 ; (1974) 131 CLR 634 esp at 642 per Stephen J.

7 The issue here is whether Allphones knew in June or July 2006 both about the unlocking of the phones and the failure to account, on which it relied, to uphold its exercise of a right to terminate. It gave notice of its intention to exercise the right to terminate in late August 2006.

8 This matter has had a long history of interlocutory case management. During early 2007, a question arose as to whether some documents produced on discovery by Allphones were entitled to be withheld from production on the ground of legal professional privilege. An interlocutory hearing took place before Tamberlin J on 1 June 2007. At that hearing, Allphones read and relied upon a sworn affidavit by Mr Lloyd on 5 April 2007. He was a solicitor employed by its solicitors on the record. Mr Lloyd said that he deposed to the matters in the affidavit based on information and belief unless otherwise stated. But, relevantly, he did not identify the sources of the information and belief. Nonetheless, the affidavit was read in full before Tamberlin J.</text>
