<tocase>Bowen v Stratigraphic Explorations Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 119</tocase>
<text>15 No party to the Deed of Settlement is a party to the proceeding. More particularly it is not asserted that Sons of Gwalia Ltd acquired its interest in the mining lease and associated property other than as a 'bona fide' purchaser for value without notice. Apart from the insurmountable difficulties that would usually face a party attempting to have a Deed of Settlement set aside it is obvious that this proceeding against the defendants has no prospect of success seeking as it does an order against the defendants in respect of their rejection of the proof of debt lodged by the plaintiff. (See: Bowen v Stratigraphic Explorations Pty Ltd [1971] WAR 119, 121).</text>

<tocase>Lonrho Plc v Al-Fayed (No 2) [1992] 1WLR 5</tocase>
<text>16 It may be accepted that an application for summary dismissal of a proceeding will rarely succeed if the application is based on no more than the apparent lack of probability that the claimant will succeed or if the application to dismiss does not address whether there are latent substantive questions that may arise in the course of the proceeding. (See: Lonrho Plc v Al-Fayed (No 2) [1992] 1WLR 5; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 4) (2005) 214 ALR 686). However, this proceeding is one of those cases where it is obvious that there is no utility in allowing the matter to continue. On its face there is no question that can be competently raised by the plaintiff for resolution by the Court in respect of the conduct of the defendants as Administrators. (See: Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 per Dixon J at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 per Barwick CJ at 129).</text>
