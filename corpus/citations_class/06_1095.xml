<tocase>Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244</tocase>
<text>Nonetheless, when faced with a claim such as the present, which centres upon an allegation of long standing and insidious anti-Semitism, and which the husband contended was still prevalent in Latvia, the Tribunal was bound to consider that claim. It had to consider each incident of alleged discrimination, not merely in isolation, but also in conjunction with the others. It had to consider the "totality of the case put forward": Khan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1478 per Katz J (at [31]), cited with apparent approval by Merkel J in VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332 (" VTAO ") (at [62]). In doing so it had also to consider each of the "integers" of the claim: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 (at 259). An act that might seem capable of innocent explanation when viewed discretely can take on a different and more sinister connotation when viewed against a broader background.</text>

<text>A failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider a claim that is in fact advanced and properly supported by the material before the Tribunal is capable of giving rise to jurisdictional error. It amounts to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction: R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Bott [1933] HCA 30 ; (1933) 50 CLR 228 per Rich, Dixon and McTiernan JJ (at 242-243) and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at 81-83 per Gaudron J. See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Anthonypillai [2001] FCA 274 ; (2001) 106 FCR 426 (at [78]). This has nothing to do with merits review. It is rather a failure on the part of the Tribunal to discharge its statutory duty. Counsel for the Minister conceded as much. In my opinion, the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction in this case.</text>

<text>However, it must be remembered that the list does not constitute a definition of "serious harm". That expression plainly has a residual meaning beyond the examples given, though that meaning is informed by those examples.

<tocase>SZBOV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1407 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1407.html</AustLII>
<text>Plainly, the Tribunal in the present case did not consider whether the husband's claims, considered cumulatively , could amount to "serious harm". Whether those claims in fact rise to that level, bearing in mind that we are dealing with the future, and not the past, is a matter for the Tribunal, and not for this Court. See SZBOV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1407 per Jacobson J (at [19]). Given that the point is arguable, I consider that the matter should be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.

It follows for the reasons set out above that the appeal should be allowed. The orders of the Federal Magistrate dismissing the application for review, and ordering the appellants to pay costs, should be set aside. In lieu thereof, a writ of certiorari should issue directed to the Tribunal, quashing its decision. A writ of mandamus should also issue directing that the matter be heard and determined according to law.

The appellants should have their costs, if any, of the proceeding before the Federal Magistrates Court. They are entitled also to have their costs, if any, of the appeal to this Court. 


 I certify that the preceding eighty-seven (87) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.

<tocase>VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332</tocase>

It had to consider each incident of alleged discrimination, not merely in isolation, but also in conjunction with the others. It had to consider the "totality of the case put forward": Khan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1478 per Katz J (at [31]), cited with apparent approval by Merkel J in VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332 (" VTAO ") (at [62]). In doing so it had also to consider each of the "integers" of the claim: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 (at 259). An act that might seem capable of innocent explanation when viewed discretely can take on a different and more sinister connotation when viewed against a broader background.

It is possible that individual instances of discrimination will not of themselves amount to "serious harm", but when considered cumulatively satisfy the requirements of s 91R. See, for example, VTAO , where Merkel J took a similar approach. In that case his Honour found, just as I have done, that the Tribunal's failure to consider a series of claims cumulatively gave rise to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
