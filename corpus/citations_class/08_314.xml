<text>The task of establishing lack of novelty by material that had been published earlier, was the subject of observations by Parker J in Flour Oxidising Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 428 , who said at [457]: 
 
 [W] here the question is solely a question of prior publication, it is not, in my opinion, enough to prove that an apparatus described in an earlier specification could have been used to produce this or that result. It must also be shown that the [prior] specification contains clear and unmistakable directions so to use it.</text>

<text>French and Lindgren JJ discussed in Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Eli Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 what was required to establish lack of novelty, at [313]: 
 
 313 The law relating to novelty under the 1990 Act was considered by the Full Court in Bristol-Myers Squibb. In the joint judgment of Black CJ and Lehane J, their Honours referred to what had been said by Aickin J in Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd [1977] HCA 19 ; (1977) 137 CLR 228 at 235; [1977] HCA 19 ; 13 ALR 605 at 611; [1977] HCA 19 ; 1A IPR 181 at 186: 
 

 
 
 The basic test for anticipation or want of novelty is the same as that for infringement and generally one can properly ask oneself whether the alleged anticipation would, if the patent were valid, constitute an infringement. 
 

 
 
 In the case of a paper anticipation such as a specification or publication, there can be no direct application of the reverse infringement test. An hypothetical infringement may be posited on the assumption that somebody does or makes what the alleged anticipation suggests. Their Honours cited Lord Westbury in Hill v Evans (at [63]): 
 

 
 
 [63] ... the antecedent statement must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge of the subject would at once perceive, understand, and be able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity of making further experiments and gaining further information before the invention can be made useful. If something remains to be ascertained which is necessary for the useful application of the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid patent. 
 

 
 
 Their Honours also referred to Flour Oxidizing Co Ltd v Carr &amp; Co Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 428 ; Canadian General Electric Co at 104 and General Tire &amp; Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd (1971) 1A IPR 121; [1972] RPC 457. After reviewing those authorities, they said (at [67]): 
 

 
 
 [67] What all those authorities contemplate, in our view, is that a prior publication, if it is to destroy novelty, must give a direction or make a recommendation or suggestion which will result, if the skilled reader follows it, in the claimed invention. A direction, recommendation or suggestion may often, of course, be implicit in what is described and commonly the only question may be whether the publication describes with sufficient clarity the claimed invention or, in the case of a combination, each integer of it.

Their Honours at [317] referred to the observations of Crennan J in Imperial Chemicals Industries Pty Ltd v Cmr of Patents (2004) 213 ALR 399 ; 63 IPR 476 ; [2004] FCA 1658 , where her Honour there quoted Sachs LJ in General Tire &amp; Rubber Co at [61]:

<tocase>N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty limited [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1995/15.html</AustLII>
<text>In N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Limited [1995] HCA 15 ; (1995) 183 CLR 655 ( Philips ), the High Court (Brennan, Deane, and Toohey JJ with Dawson and McHugh JJ dissenting) held that the primary or threshold requirement of a patentable invention under s 18(1) of the Act was that it should be an alleged invention, meaning an alleged manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s 6 of the Statue of Monopolies 1623 (Imp).

In the majority judgment at 663-6: 
 
 The primary focus of inquiry should, as we have indicated, be upon the opening words ("... a patentable invention is an invention that ...") of that sub-section which impose a threshold requirement which must be satisfied before one reaches that contained in the body of par (a). 
 

 
 
 The effect of those opening words of s 18(1) is that the primary or threshold requirement of a "patentable invention" is that it be an "invention". Read in the context of s 18(1) as a whole and the definition of "invention" in the Dictionary in Sch 1, that clearly means "an alleged invention" that is to say, an "alleged" "manner of new manufacture the subject of letters patent and grant of privilege within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies... 
 [W] hat is involved in an alleged manner of new manufacture, that threshold requirement of "an alleged invention" will, notwithstanding an assertion of "newness", remain unsatisfied if it is apparent on the face of the relevant specification that the subject matter of the claim is, by reason of absence of the necessary quality of inventiveness, not a manner of new manufacture for the purposes of the Statute of Monopolies. That does not mean that the threshold requirement of "an alleged invention" corresponds with or renders otiose the more specific requirements of novelty and inventive step (when compared with the prior art base) contained in s 18(1)(b). It simply means that, if it is apparent on the face of the specification that the quality of inventiveness necessary for there to be a proper subject of letters patent under the Statute of Monopolies is absent, one need go no further. ...

The High Court in Philips dismissed an appeal from a majority of the Full Federal Court that the subject matter of the patent in suit as disclosed by the specification when read as a whole, was merely a new use of a particular known product.

The respondents' cross-claim that the applicant's Patent is invalid on the grounds that it is not a patentable invention or a manner of manufacture with the meaning of s 18(1) of the Act is framed as follows: 
 
 Not a patentable invention (section 181(1)) 
 

 The alleged invention so far as claimed in each claim of the Patent is not a patentable invention within the meaning of the Act in that, so far as claimed in each and every claim, it does not satisfy the threshold requirement of 'an invention' and is not properly the subject of letters patent. 
 
 
 Particulars 
 

 
 
 (1) The Patent does not, on the face of the specification, disclose an invention. 
 

 
 
 (2) The alleged invention amounts to no more than the incorporation of a 'guard member' to overlie a series of barrier elements for the purpose of guarding the barrier elements against collisions which the barrier elements are expected to incur in their usual operation.

Mr Yates SC, counsel for the respondents, submitted that all that was claimed as the invention is, in fact, the use of a guard rail: 
 
 All that's being provided is a guardrail to barriers for the purpose of protecting the barriers, including protecting the connection between barriers. So it is simply a guardrail for the barrier system, and that, we submit, is simply just another use of a known product for its known purpose, and for which its properties make it suitable.</text>

Crennan J agreed with French and Lindgren JJ that Claim 10 of the Patent in Suit was invalid because it was invalid because it was obvious or disclosed no inventive step, and with the other findings of their Honour. Save the finding with respect to fair basis, Crennan J was of the view that Claim 10 was fairly based on the matter described in the specification.

I turn then to consider the evidence concerning lack of novelty, in the light of the above exposition of principle. It is necessary to set out that evidence at some length.

 (3) After hearing the application, the court may, by order, revoke the patent, either wholly or so far as it relates to a claim, on one or more of the following grounds, but on no other ground: 
 

 
 
 (a) that the patentee is not entitled to the patent; 
 (b) that the invention is not a patentable invention; 
 (c) that the patentee has contravened a condition in the patent; 
 (d) that the patent was obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation; 
 (e) that an amendment of the patent request or the complete specification was made or obtained by fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation;
