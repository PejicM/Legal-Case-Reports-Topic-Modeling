<text>Mr Chappell wrote much of the wording of the brochure. He wrote letters to the investors saying that Austcorp was the developer. While he may not have done this with any intention to mislead people, he did it to publicise the fact that Austcorp was the active parent company responsible for the Austcorp group's overall development activities throughout Australia, including that of the resort. Austcorp was prepared to allow a loose and ambiguous representation, connecting Austcorp with the development, to be made in the brochure. In my opinion, this is a case where it is clear that any Austcorp company which in fact had an association with the development could be taken to have published the brochure: Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363-366 per Issacs J; see also Abigail v Lapin [1934] UKPCHCA 1 ; (1934) 51 CLR 58 at 70-71 per Lord Wright.</text>

<tocase>Allianz Australia Insurance Limited v GSF Australian Pty Limited [2005] HCA 26 ; (2005) 221 CLR 568</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/26.html</AustLII>
<text>It is important for this purpose to have regard to the statutory subject, scope and purpose of the Trade Practices Act , as Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed in Allianz Australia Insurance Limited v GSF Australian Pty Limited [2005] HCA 26 ; (2005) 221 CLR 568 at 597 [99] . Thus, s 2 of the Act states: 
 "The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provisions of consumer protection."

Their Honours explained the principles of assessment of loss under s 82 as follows ( Allianz 221 CLR at 597-598 [100]): 
 " [100] In I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 119 [26] ), Gleeson CJ said of the construction of s 82: 

 
 'When a court assesses an amount of loss or damage for the purpose of making an order under s 82 , it is not merely engaged in the factual, or historical, exercise of explaining, and calculating the financial consequences of, a sequence of events, of which the contravention forms part. It is attributing legal responsibility; blame. This is not done in a conceptual vacuum. It is done in order to give effect to a statute with a discernible purpose; and that purpose provides a guide as to the requirements of justice and equity in the case. Those requirements are not determined by a visceral response on the part of the judge assessing damages, but by the judge's concept of principle and of the statutory purpose.' 

 
 The upshot in I &amp; L Securities was the holding stated by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ ( I &amp; L Securities [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 128 [57] (footnotes omitted)). (See also at 121-122 [33], per Gleeson CJ; at 132 [69] per McHugh J.): 

 
 '[T]he question presented by s 82 of [the TP Act] is not what was the (sole) cause of the loss or damage which has allegedly been sustained. It is enough to demonstrate that contravention of a relevant provision of [that] Act was a cause of the loss or damage sustained.' (Original emphasis.)"

A large number of apartments in the resort were sold after Mustara collapsed. Some were comparable with Ms Tan-Bounkeua's apartment. The pattern that emerged after Mustara's collapse until about mid 2004 was that market prices realised for apartments in the resort were generally greater than the purchase prices. In about mid 2004 they became similar. However, considerable difficulty was experienced in achieving sales of quite a number of units, including Mr Owers'. And, the number of properties which had been listed for sale, but not sold, had increased markedly since the turn of the market in mid 2004. By mid 2005 the market had turned down and almost all the properties in the resort were sold at a price less, and sometimes up to about 25% less, than their acquisition cost.

Mr Dupont noted that the more recent sales results were in marked contrast to movements in median sale prices of apartments in Wyong Shire during the period between 2000 and 2007. He said that, although sale prices in the resort were slightly erratic, there was a general weighting indicating an increase in value of apartments in the resort of around 40%-50% from 2000 to the peak of the market in 2004. In comparison, median values of ordinary residential units (without a restriction on use similar to that affecting the resort) in Wyong Shire increased by 84% in the same period. He said that the reduction in values in recent years was partly a result of over supply in The Entrance unit market, as well as a general softening of the property market due to interest rate rises, affordability and macro economic conditions.</text>

<text>In Australian Breeders Co-operative Society Ltd v Jones (1997) 150 ALR 488 at 543-545 Wilcox and Lindgren JJ (with whom Lee J agreed on this point (at 560)) noted that the trial judge (Davies J) found that taxation benefits, which applicant investors in a horse breeding syndicate had obtained, should be taken into account in reduction of damages for their losses up to the time at which they terminated the breeding partnership. However, in that case, Davies J had refused to make an allowance for those taxation benefits in relation to the years of income after termination and awarded compensation on the basis that those damages not be taxable in the hands of the applicants. There was no issue in the appeal as to the question of taking into account taxation benefits.</text>

<tocase>Banco de Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Limited [1932] UKHL 1 ; [1932] AC 452</tocase>
<text>Austcorp argued that it was unreasonable for the applicants not to have sold because the market was apparently rising when they realised that the representations had been falsified on Mustara's collapse. I reject this argument. It seeks to have things both ways, when Austcorp itself created the difficulty for the applicants. In Banco de Portugal v Waterlow &amp; Sons Limited [1932] UKHL 1 ; [1932] AC 452 at 506 Lord Macmillan tellingly observed that it was often easy, after an emergency had passed, to criticise the steps which had been taken to meet it, but that such criticism did not come well from those who themselves had created the emergency. He said: 
 "The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken."

Although his Lordship spoke of the principle apposite to an action for damages for a breach of contract, I am of opinion that his remarks also apply to an action to recover loss or damage under s 82. That principle accords with the statutory purpose. It would be unreal to argue that every purchaser who had been misled, as the present three applicants claim, into buying an apartment in the resort should have put their property on the market in 2003 for sale. The market would have been flooded as it was from 2004 onwards.

In my opinion, Mr Owers acted reasonably in his decision to offer the property for sale when he did and the steps he took in the difficult situation in which he found himself. 7.2 Ms Tan-Bounkeua's position</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1984/195.html</AustLII>
<text>Austcorp argued that it could not be liable for Mr Walker's or PRD's conduct in distributing the brochure or leaflet or making the representations in the promotional material simply because of its involvement in their preparation or printing. It contended that Saatchi 134 FCR at 585 [32]-[39] supported this argument. Nothing that Moore and Mansfield JJ said there suggested that a promoter or principal (as opposed to an advertising agency that was an independent contractor) could not be liable in circumstances like the present. Nor does any delay between Austcorp's design of the brochure and leaflet, and their dissemination to the applicants prevent Austcorp being held to have made the representations complained of. Austcorp's conduct, when viewed as a whole, taking account of all the surrounding circumstances, brought about what it wanted; namely that the promotional material would be given to persons in the position of the applicants and that they would be induced to purchase an apartment: Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 195 ; (1984) 3 FCR 95 at 106-107 per Bowen CJ, Beaumont and Wilcox JJ. PRD and Mr Walker, as much as Austcorp's subsidiaries, were intermediaries in Austcorp's marketing plan: Barton 3 FCR at 107.</text>

<tocase>Benlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited [1990] ATPR p41-043</tocase>
<text>It is a question of fact whether a disclaimer or a contractual provision modified the antecedent or other conduct as Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ illustrated in Butcher 218 CLR at 613-614 [70]-[72] in discussing what Burchett J had said in Benlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited [1990] ATPR p41-043 at 51,590. In both those cases there were disclaimers in marketing material. Burchett J said: 
 "It has been held on many occasions that the perpetrator of misleading conduct cannot, by resorting to such a clause, evade the operation of [the Act]. Of course, if the clause actually has the effect [of] erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective , not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct . However, I should think it would only be in rare cases that a formal disclaimer would have that effect. ...
 
 In the present case, the suggestion of the suitability of the building for strata title conversion might continue to influence the mind of a prospective purchaser notwithstanding his awareness of the existence of a disclaimer clause, which did not single out the particular representation, but purported to apply generally to every detail stated in the investment report. If it were permissible to avoid the operation of [the Act] by such a clause, it would be all too easy to make representations in the confidence that they would be acted upon, and then withdraw them in the confidence (equally important for the securing of the desired business) that the withdrawal would not be acted upon ."

Austcorp argued that the applicants could and should have called the solicitors who acted for them on the transactions and that their failure to do so could be used, not only to support the proposition that the solicitors' evidence would not advance their cases but also to suggest that they had not discharged their onus of proof. It that it was within the applicants' power to call their solicitors and their evidence should be assessed as Lord Mansfield CJ described in Blatch 1 Cowp at 65:

<text>I am satisfied that when making each of the representations complained of Austcorp was engaged in conduct in trade or commerce within the meaning of s 52 of the Act. The promotion and sale of developments in which it had an interest was a fundamental business activity of Austcorp. That conduct was quintessentially of a trading and commercial character. It included promotional activities in relation to, or for the purposes of, the supply of goods or services including land: Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 604 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; see too Braverus Maritime Inc v Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd [2005] FCAFC 256 ; (2005) 148 FCR 68 at 108 [142] per Tamberlin, Mansfield and Allsop JJ.</text>

<tocase>Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333</tocase>
<text>It is important to assess whether a misrepresentation was an operative cause of the decision of a person to enter into a contract. Ordinarily, a person who has made a false representation is under a duty to correct it before the representee acts to his or her detriment in reliance upon it. This is so in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation as Lord Reid explained in Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333 at 349. Equally, in cases of unintentional contraventions of s 52 of the Act, a representee who relies on an uncorrected misleading representation (even where the representor does not know of the facts which make the representation incorrect) is entitled to relief under Pt VI of the Act: Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [103]. Whether something is a cause of something else is ultimately a question of fact although it can involve considering and applying difficult value judgments.

This representation was false too. Mustara, itself, had no qualifications in the conduct or operation of hotels or resorts and was wholly reliant on its connection with Pacific International Hotels. Mustara was a corporate shell and had never traded. It had no financial substance independent of Pacific International Hotels' limited support in cl 20.9 and what it might earn in the future from operating the resort. Moreover, Mustara was not a subsidiary of Pacific International when each of the applicants entered into the lease and, with the exception of Ms Tan-Bounkeua, when they entered into their contracts to purchase. Austcorp failed in its duty to correct this representation to Ms Tan-Bounkeua after it had become falsified on 23 December 1999 when Mustara was taken over by Mr Wong's group: cf: Briess [1954] AC at 349. Representation (d): the entity that would lease the apartments in the resort was a leading manager of resort and apartment

As I have found Mustara was not a leading manager of resorts and apartments. And, after 23 December 1999 it was not a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels. Therefore, the representation was false by the time each of Ms Tan-Bounkeua and Mr Owers acted on it by completing their contracts. Mr Wong's group were financers, not resort or hotel operators. And cl 20.9 significantly limited the financial responsibility of Pacific International Hotels in respect of Mustara. Thus, there was a real separation between the two so that Mustara could not be said to be the same entity as Pacific International Hotels. Had they known the true position created by cl 20.9, neither Mr Owers nor Ms Tan-Bounkeua would have regarded the two companies, in a lay sense, as the same entity.

As I have found, they would not have been troubled, and would have regarded Mustara and Pacific International Hotels as one entity, if there were no limitation of the latter's responsibility for Mustara's financial commitment to them as found in cl 20.9 of the lease. Of course, as a matter of law the two companies were different legal persons. Ms Tan-Bounkeua was not told of the change of Mustara's relationship to Pacific International Hotels following her entery into the contract, when the representation had been substantively accurate. In fact, at the time Mr Owers entered into his contract and at the time he and Ms Tan-Bounkeua completed, Mustara was not a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels. Thus, this representation was also false. Representation (e): the purchase of an apartment in the resort would be an outstanding investment with no hidden risks</text>

<tocase>Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/60.html</AustLII>
<text>Austcorp was the guiding hand and ultimately benefited from what its subsidiaries did. It argued that its conduct vis a vis its subsidiaries should be viewed as akin to a real estate agent who passes on the vendor's instructions. I reject that argument. Austcorp did not confine itself to communicating what its subsidiary said, did or represented, without adopting or endorsing it: cf: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at 605 [38] - [40] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ. To the contrary, the reality was that the subsidiaries were Austcorp's vehicle for realising its investment in the project. The subsidiaries acted as Austcorp caused them to act. While each of Austcorp and its subsidiaries was a separate legal person, acting through the individuals who were employees of Austcorp, all acted in dual capacities: cf: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 128 per Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ. The activities of each member of the Austcorp group involved in the development and marketing of the resort were interlocking and Austcorp controlled each of them: cf: NSW Mutual Real Estate Fund Ltd v Brookhouse [1979] FCA 7 ; (1978) 38 FLR 257 at 263 per Franki J, 264 per St John J, 266 per Deane J.

The brochure was a document prepared for distribution to the public, but in circumstances where particular members of the public would read it and, as a consequence, be interested in pursuing the "prime investment opportunity" which it promoted. In Butcher 218 CLR at 604-605 [36]-[40], Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ discussed the principles to be applied where an alleged misrepresentation is made to a particular individual, even though the individual is one of a class of other persons to whom the same representation may have been made. They held that even though a representation may have been made to a class of persons, in a case like the present it is the individuals who claim to have been mislead and the person by whom they claim they were mislead whose relationship must be examined. The applicant for relief must establish a causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss that is claimed. They said that this depended on analysing the conduct of the alleged wrongdoer in relation to the applicant alone and continued ( Butcher 218 CLR at 604-605 [37]): 
 "So here, it is necessary to consider the character of the particular conduct of the particular agent in relation to the particular purchasers, bearing in mind what matters of fact each knew about the other as a result of the nature of their dealings and the conversations between them, or which each may be taken to have known. Indeed, counsel for the purchasers conceded that the mere fact that a person had engaged in the conduct of supplying a document containing misleading information did not mean that that person had engaged in misleading conduct: it was crucial to examine the role of the person in question."

And, Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed that it was relevant to consider the circumstances of the representor: Butcher 218 CLR at 604 [42]. Here, the claim against Austcorp was not alleged simply to be that it passed on to PRD and Mr Walker or through him to the applicants information from a vendor. Rather, the applicants alleged that Austcorp itself engaged in the conduct of making the representations to them through the promotional material (including what Mr Walker told them).

In June 1999, Mr Walker had written to Mr Chappell saying that "the guaranteed return on investment is a prime consideration to prospective purchasers". And, Mr Chappell agreed with that assessment based on his then experience in selling property over nearly three decades. Mr Chappell considered a guaranteed return on an investment was obviously attractive to potential purchasers and sent a message to them that their investment was secure. He said that, based on his experience, he held the view in 1999 that marketing an investment as having a guaranteed return was a very powerful and forceful means of marketing. He acknowledged that one reason why it was attractive to investors to have a guaranteed return was because it told the investor that whatever happened in the market they would get the guaranteed return, even if there were some unforeseen circumstance. I accept that evidence.

Before the brochure's wording was settled, Austcorp had used Coudert Bros, solicitors, to discuss with ASIC the use of the word "guarantee" and "net return 7%p.a. guaranteed ten years minimum lease" in an earlier form of marketing of the resort. With Mr Hung's approval, Coudert Bros had told the Commission, in August 1999 that the word "guarantee" was often used colloquially simply to mean '"assured" "a sure thing"'. They told the Commission that, in a strict sense, the return was guaranteed. That was because the lease which was accepted from each purchaser would provide the agreed percentage return in the amount of the rent identified by the contract (being 7% of the purchase price, payable each year). The Commission was told that "the rent (as with all lessee obligations) is guaranteed by Pacific International Hotels Pty Limited", although Coudert Bros did not mention that guarantee was limited to a maximum of 12 months of the initial rent. Coudert Bros addressed a concern of the Commission about a sticker that asserted a net guaranteed return with a 10 year minimum lease saying: 
 "Further the return is guaranteed (assured) in the colloquial sense. The rent payable is a predetermined amount in no way dependant on the serviced apartment business of others. 

 
 We suggest there is no sense in which the 'sticker' can be seen as making a claim which is not backed up on sale."

In Butcher 218 CLR at 606 [43] Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ observed that it was a matter of common experience that questions of title to land could be complex, both legally and factually. Dealing with legal complexity was the role of solicitors, acting, where appropriate, on the advice of other specialists, such as surveyors. The question in that case was whether purchasers were entitled to rely upon a diagrammatic plan of the land being sold in a brochure prepared by a real estate agent. The brochure contained an express disclaimer by the agent of any belief in, or guarantee of, the accuracy of the information in it. Their Honours held that the brochure, read as a whole, in effect told the purchasers to rely upon their own enquiries and that it would then be plain to a reasonable purchaser that the agent was not the source of the information alleged to be misleading. They said that the agent there did not purport to do anything more than pass on information supplied by another or others and expressly, as well as implicitly, disclaim any belief in the truth or falsity of that information: Butcher 218 CLR at 608-609 [50]-[51].

Their Honours also observed that in a situation where a purchaser was intending to make use of statements or representations made in a brochure before entering into an important transaction, it was not inappropriate to look closely at the contents of the brochure before deciding whether a particular representation was made and by whom: Butcher 218 CLR at 616 [76]. In his dissenting judgment, McHugh J also said that in determining whether a contravention of s 52 has occurred, the task of the Court is to examine the relevant course of conduct as a whole, by reference to the alleged conduct in the light of the relevant surrounding facts and circumstances. He observed that the Court was not confined to examining a document, relied on as being the conduct or conveying a representation amounting to the conduct alleged to have contravened s 52 , in isolation, saying that the Court "... must have regard to all of the conduct of the corporation in relation to the document including the preparation and distribution of the document and any statement, action, silence or inaction in connection with the document": Butcher 218 CLR at 625 [109].

Austcorp submitted that the effect of Butcher [2004] HCA 60 ; 218 CLR 592 was that whatever had been pleaded as the cause of action by an applicant or plaintiff, the Court nonetheless had to look outside that, at all of the conduct of the respondent or defendant corporation to determine whether or not a contravention of s 52 had occurred. However, here, this issue does not arise because Austcorp had pleaded expressly the need to do so. It pleaded, in its defence, that the consideration of what was represented or not disclosed to the applicants by the brochure needed to be considered in the context of the applicants' actual knowledge and the knowledge of those acting on their behalf as to the nature and character and investments proposed, including in the particular apartment in the resort, the nature and character of the brochure and the entire course of dealings between the applicants, and their advisors in relation to the nature and characteristics of an investment in an apartment in the resort including the contract of sale and, where relevant, a disclosure statement.

Austcorp asserted that when viewed as a whole, assuming that it had been involved in the making of the representations alleged, its conduct could not be described as misleading or deceptive. This was because the applicants could be expected to have a solicitor act for them and advise them as to the terms of the contract for sale, including the lease and the disclosure statement, thus disabusing them of any misconception which may have been generated by reading the brochure by itself.

I am of opinion that on the evidence here the mere fact that the contract may have set out the full terms and conditions of the relationship which was to exist between the purchaser and the various parties with whom it was proposed the purchaser would enter into a relationship (the vendor (Landillo), the lessee (Mustara) and guarantor (Pacific International Hotels)) cannot, of itself, be enough to break a chain of causation from representations or impressions made by the brochure. Obviously, context is critical. But where the method for inducing persons to enter into consideration of a business proposition is to make assertions and valuations of the proposition in the form in which the brochure was expressed, a person who promotes the sale through the brochure cannot complain if a purchaser takes the promoter at his word. The whole point of having the brochure was to make people interested in the commercial proposition of the purchase of an apartment in the resort. What was the commercial proposition if not a promise or assurance that that the investment would return 7%p.a. net for 10 years to the purchaser? And, lest the intending purchaser might think otherwise, he or she was assured by the statement that "its hard to imagine a real estate investment offering so much. From day one your return will be a guaranteed 7%p.a.".

It is a question of fact whether a disclaimer or a contractual provision modified the antecedent or other conduct as Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ illustrated in Butcher 218 CLR at 613-614 [70]-[72] in discussing what Burchett J had said in Benlist Pty Ltd v Olivetti Australia Pty Limited [1990] ATPR p41-043 at 51,590. In both those cases there were disclaimers in marketing material. Burchett J said: 
 "It has been held on many occasions that the perpetrator of misleading conduct cannot, by resorting to such a clause, evade the operation of [the Act]. Of course, if the clause actually has the effect [of] erasing whatever is misleading in the conduct, the clause will be effective , not by any independent force of its own, but by actually modifying the conduct . However, I should think it would only be in rare cases that a formal disclaimer would have that effect. ...
 
 In the present case, the suggestion of the suitability of the building for strata title conversion might continue to influence the mind of a prospective purchaser notwithstanding his awareness of the existence of a disclaimer clause, which did not single out the particular representation, but purported to apply generally to every detail stated in the investment report.

(emphasis in bold added)

As explained above, it is necessary to consider whether Austcorp's conduct in making each representation to each of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua was misleading or deceptive: Butcher 218 CLR at 604-605 [36]-[37]; Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [103]. It is not necessary to consider the position of Mr and Mrs Di Giulio and Mr Luciani because I have not accepted their evidence that they relied on any of the representations. 5.

<text>After all, a fundamental purpose of the Parliament prescribing the norm of conduct enacted in s 52 of the Act is to ensure the protection of the public, particularly consumers. I reject Austcorp's argument that it did not engage in the conduct of providing to the applicants the brochure, leaflet and their repetitions by Mr Walker. Austcorp was the hands and brains of its subsidiaries' conduct and Austcorp cannot evade responsibility for any contravention of s 52 by seeking to draw down between itself and them a corporate veil for the contraventions it perpetrated: cf: Hamilton 166 CLR at 128; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 88 [108] .

It is important to assess whether a misrepresentation was an operative cause of the decision of a person to enter into a contract. Ordinarily, a person who has made a false representation is under a duty to correct it before the representee acts to his or her detriment in reliance upon it. This is so in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation as Lord Reid explained in Briess v Woolley [1954] AC 333 at 349.

Whether something is a cause of something else is ultimately a question of fact although it can involve considering and applying difficult value judgments.

As Gibbs CJ said in Puxu 149 CLR at 199 (see also Campomar (2000) 202 CLR at 85 [102]-[103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ): 
 "The heavy burdens which [s 52] create cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will of course depend on all the circumstances."

The issue for consideration is whether any contravention of s 52 has arisen by the conduct of the promoters in putting forward the brochure and leaflet and authorising Mr Walker to speak as he did consistently with them, when the contract appears to contain different provisions, materially as to the identity of the lessee and the nature of Pacific International Hotels' financial and commercial confidence in the venture promoted. In Campomar 202 CLR at 83 [98], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ emphasised the need to enquire why any misconception had arisen in the mind of the person claiming have been misled or deceived. A sufficient nexus must exist between the conduct complained of and the misconception or deception.

Austcorp argued that the nexus was, in effect, broken because the contract was a legal document which set out with considerable precision and at length the actual relationship that would exist if a person entered into the contract and the lease. For example, it argued that it was not reasonable for a person in the position of Ms Tan-Bounkeua not to have had a solicitor advising her and that, had she done so, the solicitor would have broken the chain of causation, even if he or she negligently failed to advise the purchaser of the provisions of cl 20.9 or the existence of Mustara. I discuss this specific issue below [See 2.18]. Gibbs CJ observed in Puxu [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 199 that the Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests: see too Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [102].

As explained above, it is necessary to consider whether Austcorp's conduct in making each representation to each of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua was misleading or deceptive: Butcher 218 CLR at 604-605 [36]-[37]; Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [103]. It is not necessary to consider the position of Mr and Mrs Di Giulio and Mr Luciani because I have not accepted their evidence that they relied on any of the representations. 5.

<tocase>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256</tocase>
<text>The Courts have long employed commonsense in determining whether or not a statement is a mere puff, as Lindley LJ explained in the great case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256 at 261 in relation to the defendant's assertion that its promise to pay a &#163;100 reward to anyone who contracted influenza after having used its smoke ball was a mere puff which meant nothing. He said ( Carlill [1893] 1 QB at 261-262): 
 "Was it a mere puff? My answer to that question is No, and I base my answer upon this passage: 

 
 '1000 l . is deposited with the Alliance Bank, shewing our sincerity in the matter'. 

 
 Now, for what was that money deposited or that statement made except to negative the suggestion that this was a mere puff and meant nothing at all. The deposit is called in aid by the advertiser as proof of his sincerity in the matter that is, the sincerity of his promise to pay this 100 l . in the event he has specified. I say this for the purpose of giving point to the observation that we are not inferring a promise; there is the promise, as plain as words can make it." (emphasis added)

AL Smith LJ dismissed the suggestion that the reference to the deposit of &#163;1,000 could be construed as a mere expression of confidence in the wares which the defendant had to sell: Carlill [1893] 1 QB at 273. And, as Black CJ, von Doussa and Cooper JJ said in Fraser v NRMA Holdings Ltd (1995) 55 FCR 452 at 483E-G, the use of an expression such as "free" in connection with shares, depending on the context, can create a notion that the shares might be acquired without significant loss or outgoing, even though in other contexts in ordinary life people might understand similar usages differently. It depends on the context in which words are used as to whether or not their use is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/194.html</AustLII>
<text>The significance of this method of doing business, which had a number of practical attractions to Austcorp as Mr Tan explained, is that third parties with whom it dealt may not always have been aware of the underlying web of relationships. Austcorp was the apparent contracting and paying party. The invoices were addressed to and paid by it. But more significantly, the various individuals acting for Austcorp, were in fact its actual officers or employees and gave people with whom they dealt their personalised Austcorp business cards. Hence, Mr Walker wrote to Mr Chappell in the capacity that his business card identified, namely the managing director of Austcorp. Of course, the mere fact that Austcorp did not disclose to the third party the name of any subsidiary for which it was acting as an agent, did not mean that Austcorp necessarily became a party to the contract provided it disclosed that it was acting as an agent: Carminco Gold &amp; Resources Ltd v Findlay &amp; Co Stockbrokers (Underwriters) Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 194 ; (2007) 243 ALR 472 at 473 [1] , 479 [22]-[23] per Finn, Rares and Besanko JJ. If a person is to be found objectively to have no personal liability as a party under a contract he, she or it has made, it is because the person has disclosed at or before the time of contracting that they do so as an agent, even if the identity of the principal is not then disclosed.

The general principle in contract is that " ... if a man signs a written contract, he is considered as the contracting party, unless it clearly appears that he executes it as agent only": Cooke v Wilson [1856] EngR 883 ; (1856) 1 CB (NS) 153 at 164 per Crowder J, see too at 162 per Cresswell J; Minister for Youth and Community Services v Health and Research Employees' Association of Australia, NSW Branch (1987) 10 NSWLR 543 at 558E-F per McHugh JA; H O Brandt &amp; Co v H N Morris &amp; Co Ltd [1917] 2 KB 784 at 793-794 per Viscount Reading CJ, 796-797 per Scrutton LJ.

<text>That may be so but its consequence is that Austcorp's submission fails at its threshold. Austcorp conducted itself in trade and commerce as a promoter of the resort. It did so in clear language using its exact name. It also associated itself by the use of the logo on the promotional material. The logo was not used in a legal document by lawyers. It was used in trade or commerce by Austcorp to convey its association with the project, whatever may have been the legal formalities and structures in which subsidiaries of Austcorp may have participated. The message which Austcorp wished to pass to the public was, that it, as the ultimate owner of the brand, was responsible for the development. It cannot accept the credit and refuse to take responsibility under the Trade Practices Act for its conduct: cf: see Gardam v George Wills &amp; Co [1988] FCA 194 ; (1988) 82 ALR 415 at 427-428 per French J; Cassidy v Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 34 ; (2004) 134 FCR 585 at 593 [39] per Moore and Mansfield JJ, 599 [65] per Stone J; see too Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 199 at [40] , [48] per Keane JA (Williams JA and Atkinson J agreeing at [1], [145]). As Keane JA observed the presence of a logo and name in a brochure or similar material can mean that a reader will be entitled to conclude that the contents of the brochure state the reasons for the involvement of the person whose logo and name were used.

I am satisfied that Austcorp made the representations even if one or more of its subsidiaries did too. Two entities can contravene s 52 of the Act simultaneously: Cassidy v Saatchi &amp; Saatchi 134 FCR at 592 [31], [37] per Moore and Mansfield JJ, see too at 588 [13], 591 [28], 599 [65] per Stone J.

Austcorp argued that it could not be liable for Mr Walker's or PRD's conduct in distributing the brochure or leaflet or making the representations in the promotional material simply because of its involvement in their preparation or printing. It contended that Saatchi 134 FCR at 585 [32]-[39] supported this argument. Nothing that Moore and Mansfield JJ said there suggested that a promoter or principal (as opposed to an advertising agency that was an independent contractor) could not be liable in circumstances like the present. Nor does any delay between Austcorp's design of the brochure and leaflet, and their dissemination to the applicants prevent Austcorp being held to have made the representations complained of. Austcorp's conduct, when viewed as a whole, taking account of all the surrounding circumstances, brought about what it wanted; namely that the promotional material would be given to persons in the position of the applicants and that they would be induced to purchase an apartment: Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 195 ; (1984) 3 FCR 95 at 106-107 per Bowen CJ, Beaumont and Wilcox JJ. PRD and Mr Walker, as much as Austcorp's subsidiaries, were intermediaries in Austcorp's marketing plan: Barton 3 FCR at 107.</text>

<tocase>Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559</tocase>
<text>Genuine or honest belief in a representation is not sufficient to amount to having reasonable grounds for making it: Cummings v Lewis (1993) 41 FCR 559 at 565 per Sheppard and Neaves JJ. They said in obiter dicta ( Cummings 41 FCR at 566): 
 "Evidence of reasonable grounds may be established by evidence other than that of the persons who are alleged to have made particular representations as to a future matter. Indeed, as in so many other areas, a court may find the overall probabilities to which the circumstances of a given case give rise, the background to it and the conduct of parties prior to conversations taking place as providing better guides to whether or not they had particular states of mind or whether particular factors existed which would establish evidence of something such as reasonable grounds. It was the overall circumstances of the case which enabled his Honour to say, in relation to both Mr Leckie and Mr Lewis, that each genuinely believed the encouraging assertions which his Honour found them to have made. If one changes the exercise to an inquiry, not into genuine or honest belief, but into whether there were reasonable grounds, it is again the overall circumstances of the case which will provide more reliable guidance than would oral evidence on the part of interested parties."

I have considered the overall circumstances of what Austcorp did and the information which it had at the time of making the representations. I am satisfied that Austcorp did not have reasonable grounds for making any of the representations as to future matters. As Sheppard and Neaves JJ indicated the inquiry is still directed to the representor's state of mind or to the existence of particular factors which would establish something as to the representor's reasonable grounds: Cummings 41 FCR at 566. 7. SALES ATTEMPTS BY THE APPLICANTS 
 7.1 Mr Owers' attempts to sell his apartment

After the collapse of Mustara, Mr Owers decided to accept the recommendation of the owners corporation of the resort to lease his apartment to operators it had found including Mirvac and later the Oaks group.

In early October 2003 Mr Owers approached Mr Bignold of Raine &amp; Horne at The Entrance to assist him in selling the property. Mr Bignold advised him that he was confident of achieving a sale at over $400,000 and would be working to achieve a price of around $450,000. Mr Owers signed an agency agreement shortly afterwards in which the agent's opinion as to the apartment's current estimated selling price was given as that range. However, when the property was put to auction before Christmas in 2003, it was passed at about $400,000 in with no registered bidders and no interest shown in it.</text>

<text>In Gould v Vaggelas (1984) 157 CLR 215 at 236 Wilson J identified four principles which are frequently used as a practical guide to assess the issue of whether a person has been induced to contract based on a misrepresentation (cf: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Company Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 234 per Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ; Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd v Karmot Auto Spares Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 550 ; (1992) 38 FCR 471 at 482-483 per Beaumont, Foster and Hill JJ; Sutton v AJ Thompson Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 233 at 240 per Forster, Woodward and Wilcox JJ), namely: 
 "1. Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case. 

 If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation.
 The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the representee, before he entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on the representation.
 The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part even if only a minor part in contributing to the formation of the contract."</text>

The message which Austcorp wished to pass to the public was, that it, as the ultimate owner of the brand, was responsible for the development. It cannot accept the credit and refuse to take responsibility under the Trade Practices Act for its conduct: cf: see Gardam v George Wills &amp; Co [1988] FCA 194 ; (1988) 82 ALR 415 at 427-428 per French J; Cassidy v Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 34 ; (2004) 134 FCR 585 at 593 [39] per Moore and Mansfield JJ, 599 [65] per Stone J; see too Downey v Carlson Hotels Asia Pacific Pty Ltd [2005] QCA 199 at [40] , [48] per Keane JA (Williams JA and Atkinson J agreeing at [1], [145]). As Keane JA observed the presence of a logo and name in a brochure or similar material can mean that a reader will be entitled to conclude that the contents of the brochure state the reasons for the involvement of the person whose logo and name were used.

Yet, despite the care and deliberation with which it was prepared, Austcorp submitted that the brochure was marketing material that contained a degree of puffery in the sense that Davies and Einfeld JJ had explained in General Newspapers Pty Limited v Telstra Corporation [1993] FCA 473 ; (1993) 45 FCR 164 at 178; Gummow J agreeing at 194. They said that in the ordinary course of commercial dealings, "... a certain degree of 'puffing' or exaggeration is to be expected. Indeed, puffery is part of the ordinary stuff of commerce". A puff is something that is not meant to be taken seriously or acted on: see also Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [92] per Keane JA.

So, the confidence which the brochure exuded could not reasonably have been understood as boundless or applicable in all circumstances. The applicants relied on the analysis by Keane JA in Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [107] - [108] where he found that a representation that an established hotel operator, Radisson, considered the project was a guaranteed success would have been easily seen as of importance to an investor. The role which a representation can play in the formation of a state of mind is critical.

The brochure was designed by Austcorp, with the considerable expertise of Mr Chappell and Mr Hung with a view to attracting investors. Indeed, it was critical for Austcorp's purposes to obtain sales of the remaining 30% of the units referred to in the brochure to make their project a commercial success. The brochure was not a mere puff intended to be treated by purchasers or potential purchasers as something which could be put to one side when the contract for sale arrived. The brochure, rather, was expressed in unqualified, optimistic and prospective terms. It was intended to lead investors to make a decision to purchase based on the belief that the investment was a sound one. I agree with the observations of Keane JA in Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [92] : 
 "In the ordinary course of commercial behaviour some results are guaranteed and some are not. The concept of "guaranteeing a result" is not something that is usually associated with puffery but with the making of a firm commitment for which responsibility will be taken. The phrase 'guaranteed success' cannot be construed as a puff."

After extensively reviewing the authorities in NMFM Property Pty Ltd v Citibank Ltd [2000] FCA 1558 ; (2000) 107 FCR 270 at 550 [1244] Lindgren J concluded that an act is done "on behalf of" a corporation for the purpose of s 84(2) if either the actor engaged in the conduct intending to do so as representative of or for the corporation, or the actor did so in the course of the corporation's business, affairs or activities. He also concluded that it is not necessary to show that the actor engaged in the conduct for the benefit of the corporation: see too Walplan Pty Ltd v Wallace [1985] FCA 479 ; (1985) 8 FCR 27 at 37-38 per Lockhart J, (Sweeney and Neaves JJ agreeing); Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [56] - [60] per Keane JA.

In the context of the unqualified powerful assertions in the representations, the terms of cl 20.9 were inconspicuous and part of the "fine print" of the contract in the sense referred to by Mason J in Puxu 149 CLR at 210-211. As Jacobson and Bennett JJ said in National Exchange 61 IPR at 437 [50] (applied by Keane JA in Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [83] ): 
 "A document which, when read as a whole, is factually true and accurate may still be capable of being misleading if it contains a potentially misleading primary statement which is corrected elsewhere in the document but without the reader's attention being adequately drawn to the correction."</text>

<text>While I am satisfied that it would be unreasonable to read the brochure as offering an assurance against anything that might happen in the market, the use of an apparently reputable hotel operator's name, Pacific International Hotels, in connection with the promise of a 7% p.a. return for 10 years from the investment was calculated to induce confidence that the promoters of the venture had a foundation for the confidence expressed concerning future matters. Those who were named in the brochure as organisations, rather than particular identified corporate identities, included the hotel operator, as "Pacific International", and a developer, "Austcorp". Ordinarily, a statement which involves the state of mind of the maker will convey the meaning expressly, or by implication, that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when it was made and, commonly, that there was a basis for that state of mind: Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers Limited [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 at 172-175 per Beaumont and Spender JJ, with whom Davies J generally agreed at 165-166.</text>

<tocase>Gluckstein v Barnes [1900] AC 240</tocase>
<text>Of course here, I must consider the impression that the words of the brochure made upon each of the applicants, in light of the context, including the fact that there would be a contract sent to them or their solicitor. And, in the ordinary course it could be expected that a solicitor would act, although in Ms Tan-Bounkeua's case that did not eventuate. But a solicitor is not a commercial advisor. Having set out to assure people that the guaranteed return would be earned, it ill lies in the mouth of Austcorp to say that they should not have believed that when they entered into the contract because their solicitors should have disabused them of those impressions. I reject that submission. It is reminiscent of Lord Macnaghten's characterisation of a similar argument in Gluckstein v Barnes [1900] AC 240 at 251-252 where he said: 
 "But then," says Mr. Gluckstein, "there is something in the prospectus about 'interim investments,' and if you had only distrusted us properly and read the prospectus with the caution with which all prospectuses ought to be read, and sifted the matter to the bottom, you might have found a clue to our meaning. You might have discovered that what we call 'interim investments' was really the abatement in price effected by purchasing charges on the property at a discount." My Lords, I decline altogether to take any notice of such an argument. I think the statement in the prospectus as to the price of the property was deliberately intended to mislead the shareholders and to conceal the truth from them."

The norm of conduct provided by s 52 is intended to require corporations to adhere to an appropriate level of behaviour in trade or commerce. Austcorp was prohibited from engaging in conduct which was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead in this trade or commerce, namely the sale of apartments in the resort. The brochure was not a mere puff. The statements about the resort, the quality of the investment and the prospective earnings to be achieved from it were advanced as serious business propositions. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the brochure could have been read in any other way. If, on examination, the nature of the project or the returns promised in the brochure were overstated or not supported, the investor would not proceed. He or she would then mistrust the promoters.

I have had regard to Austcorp's arguments in assessing each applicant's evidence. Of course, each transaction was important to the individual applicants. But Austcorp was asserting that other people (solicitors) or other factors (the full contractual documentation and, where relevant, the disclosure statement when read and properly understood) would undo completely the very state of mind its marketing activities had induced by conveying the representations complained of so as to induce the applicants to proceed. It is not an attractive argument. Marketing messages are simple and powerful. While legal fine print may be contractually decisive, it is usually far less interesting to a lay person. The six lucid pages of the brochure (and the equally lucid other promotional material) had no fine print or qualifications. Austcorp was using the same forensic tactic as Mr Gluckstein did a century ago it was asking the applicants to read, in court in 2008, with distrust and cynicism what it wanted them to read, believe and act on in late 1999 and 2000. Lord Macnaghten's rejection of that approach remains entirely apposite: Gluckstein [1900] AC at 251-252.

In effect, Austcorp in its defence asserted that it should not have been taken at its word in the representations it made to sell the apartments to the applicants, including Ms Tan-Bounkeua. Austcorp's argument is no sounder than the unsuccessful promoter's in Gluckstein [1900] AC at 251-252. The argument must fail.

A person in Ms Tan-Bounkeua's position was entitled to assume, as I find she was, that those who put forward the promotional material she received knew what they were saying in it and were telling her that an investment in an apartment in the resort was a sound one with the characteristics in the representations complained of. Of course, she would realise that the contract, when she received it, was a complex legal document. But there was nothing to alert her that the contract propounded a relationship with the significant differences between the representations complained of and her legal rights if she signed.

Ordinarily a solicitor would explain the effect of the contract to his or her client. This might have led to Ms Tan-Bounkeua being informed of the true position before she entered into the contract and lease, although, on the evidence before me, some solicitors did not highlight or inform their clients of the existence or effect of cl 20.9. The question remains why that true position was not in any of the promotional material.</text>

<text>In Gould v Vaggelas (1984) 157 CLR 215 at 236 Wilson J identified four principles which are frequently used as a practical guide to assess the issue of whether a person has been induced to contract based on a misrepresentation (cf: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Company Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 234 per Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ; Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd v Karmot Auto Spares Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 550 ; (1992) 38 FCR 471 at 482-483 per Beaumont, Foster and Hill JJ; Sutton v AJ Thompson Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 233 at 240 per Forster, Woodward and Wilcox JJ), namely: 
 "1. Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case. 

 If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation.
 The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the representee, before he entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on the representation.
 The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part even if only a minor part in contributing to the formation of the contract."</text>

<text>Austcorp was the guiding hand and ultimately benefited from what its subsidiaries did. It argued that its conduct vis a vis its subsidiaries should be viewed as akin to a real estate agent who passes on the vendor's instructions. I reject that argument. Austcorp did not confine itself to communicating what its subsidiary said, did or represented, without adopting or endorsing it: cf: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at 605 [38] - [40] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ. To the contrary, the reality was that the subsidiaries were Austcorp's vehicle for realising its investment in the project. The subsidiaries acted as Austcorp caused them to act. While each of Austcorp and its subsidiaries was a separate legal person, acting through the individuals who were employees of Austcorp, all acted in dual capacities: cf: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 128 per Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ. The activities of each member of the Austcorp group involved in the development and marketing of the resort were interlocking and Austcorp controlled each of them: cf: NSW Mutual Real Estate Fund Ltd v Brookhouse [1979] FCA 7 ; (1978) 38 FLR 257 at 263 per Franki J, 264 per St John J, 266 per Deane J.

After all, a fundamental purpose of the Parliament prescribing the norm of conduct enacted in s 52 of the Act is to ensure the protection of the public, particularly consumers. I reject Austcorp's argument that it did not engage in the conduct of providing to the applicants the brochure, leaflet and their repetitions by Mr Walker. Austcorp was the hands and brains of its subsidiaries' conduct and Austcorp cannot evade responsibility for any contravention of s 52 by seeking to draw down between itself and them a corporate veil for the contraventions it perpetrated: cf: Hamilton 166 CLR at 128; Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 88 [108] .</text>

<tocase>Henderson v Amadio Pty Limited (No 1) (1995) 62 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>Mr Owers had continued to incur the expenses in order to hold the asset that he acquired "by" the misleading conduct for which Austcorp is liable. He expended money because of the position in which he had been placed by Austcorp's contravention of s 52 of the Act. Although Mr Owers has achieved a small net taxation saving over a number of years that has come at the expense of his being involved in an investment which he would not otherwise have pursued. I am of opinion that it is not appropriate to require Mr Owers to use his own money to pay the cost of financing a venture he would not have undertaken had he not been misled by Austcorp's contraventions of the Act: see also Henderson v Amadio Pty Limited (No 1) (1995) 62 FCR 1 at 200A-D per Heerey J. He has lost the opportunity of using the $48,837 paid by him for which he claimed tax deductions and received a net benefit, in other ways. He is entitled to damages in the whole sum claimed, without making allowance for taxation benefits. (b) Mr Owers $33,000 cash deposit

Mr Owers said that he would have invested in another long term income producing property had he not been induced to purchase the apartment. I accept that evidence. Instead of borrowing the whole of the purchase price, he used initially $33,000 of his cash savings to pay the deposit. Ultimately, he borrowed $31,000 from his bank and paid about $10,000 of that to pay back into his other bank account. Thus, he borrowed about $31,000 of the $330,000 price, and claimed damages for the loss of opportunity to invest the balance of either $20,000 or $30,000 in a better investment.

Originally, Mr Owers sought damages for loss of a chance to obtain a better investment outcome from a possible purchase of investment property in Lithgow for this sum. But in the applicants' written submissions in reply, Mr Owers abandoned that argument and sought compensation such as simple interest on that sum. He does not now claim any substantive damages for the loss of the opportunity to invest beyond the amount which Austcorp agreed he should be allowed as interest on the net capital sum he invested from his own savings. Austcorp conceded in final address that if he were entitled to recover damages, some sum in the nature of interest should be awarded on the $20,000 to $30,000 figure.</text>

<text>Section 82(1) of the Act permits recovery by an applicant for loss or damage notwithstanding his, her or its failure to mitigate or contributory negligence unless the applicant's own carelessness or disregard of his, her or its interests is the cause of some or all of the loss or damage: Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 58 FCR 274 at 286G-287C per Fisher, Gummow and Lee JJ applying what French J had said in Pavich v Boira Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ANZ Conv R 556 at p 23; see too Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) 88 FCR 511 at 517B-E per Heerey J, Sundberg J agreeing at 521F.

At best, from Austcorp's perspective, there may have been two concurrent causes of the imprudent decisions of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua to buy their apartments and lease them to Mustara.

<tocase>House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1936/40.html</AustLII>
<text>Here the two experts gave evidence about a range of rates. Neither explained in detail exactly how he arrived at his conclusion, yet each looked at a number of properties and had years of experience in forming such views. In that context is their evidence, though imperfect in the legally technical sense, worthless? The best expert in a field may not be able to give a textbook explanation of the basis for his or her opinion; does the Court discard it as worthless evidence? A reasoning process provides transparency as to how the conclusion has been revealed. Often a tribunal of fact will say that a witness was not satisfactory or reliable. That conveys a conclusion based on an overall assessment of the person as seen and heard. Yet a fully transparent reassessing process for the conclusion is not always possible because, in part, it may depend on the values, perceptions and prejudices of the fact finder, some known by that person, some not. Courts recognise this in the way discretionary judgments are treated on appeal: House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499.

I have been conscious that the two experts have not given enough reasoning to enable me to dissect or analyse which end of the range is more likely to be correct. On the other hand, I am satisfied that the market for apartments in the resort between 1999 and 2004 was not operating in a fully informed manner and that the prices paid then did not reflect the true value of the asset. And I am satisfied that the more recent 2006 to early 2008 sales were reflective of the, then, current true values. (There was no suggestion that conditions in the Australian or world economies were deteriorating at this time or otherwise having an impact on these values of the disportion they reveal as against movements in value in the area around the resort.) That is, I am satisfied the influences which distorted the market earlier for apartments in the resort were no longer operative at the time of the more recent sales in evidence.

Mr Tew's approach had a number of flaws which were exposed by his attempt to assess comparable properties outside the resort. He chose properties as his comparable sales in established four star holiday destinations, such as Nelson Bay, when they were not reasonably comparable. His principal choices were two resort apartments in the Landmark at Nelson Bay. However, unlike The Entrance as Mr Tew was aware, in 2000 Nelson Bay had both about four or five established 4 star resorts together with a reputation for that class of accommodation and appropriate local restaurants for such a market. He said that he gave consideration to the income streams of the two Landmark apartments (104 and 117) he used as comparators for the two larger apartments of Mr Owers and Luciani/Taldarmar. But, he said that he did not refer to their income streams in his reports because he used the direct comparison method. At the hearing, he said these two apartments "... are the two most reliable" for his comparable sales analysis. Mr Tew agreed that a sample of two was not ideal to use as basis for a comparable sales analysis.</text>

<tocase>HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 ; (2004) 217 CLR 640</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/54.html</AustLII>
<text>The applicants seek damages for their capital loss assessed as the difference between the price paid for their units and their true value at the time of the transaction. This is a common measure of damage in claims under s 82 of the Act where land has been acquired in consequence of a contravention of s 52: see HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 ; (2004) 217 CLR 640 at 656 [35] . However, the rule is not inflexible or rigid and, as Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ went on to point out, the test depends on the difference between price and the real or fair or intrinsic value of the asset, as opposed to its market value: Astonland 217 CLR at 656-657 [35]-[36].

In Astonland 217 CLR 658-659 [38]-[40] the Court indicated that subsequent events could be used to arrive at an assessment of the real value of an asset for the purposes of calculating compensation under s 82 of the Act in respect of a claim of overpayment at the time of acquisition. Events after the date of acquisition can be taken into account but when that is done care must be taken in distinguishing among possible causes of the decline in value of what had been bought. Thus, there is a fundamental distinction between causes inherent in the property acquired, and independent or extrinsic causes. To the extent that the latter causes have affected the value, then loss flowing from them would not have been caused by the inducement of the misleading or deceptive conduct. But if the value of the property acquired was always going to fall when some inherent cause began to operate (e.g. when a competing property, not adverted to by the negligent valuer in performing the valuation for the acquisition, commenced operation) that would be indicative of the true value. Such a loss in the value was, accordingly, inherent in the nature of what was purchased namely, that it would decline in value because of the operation of the competing property in close proximity: Astonland 217 CLR at 660 [43].

Their Honours said that the rental levels and, therefore the value of, Astonland's property were doomed from the start because, so long as the construction of the neighbouring shopping centre continued to completion, the plaintiff's loss would be inevitable. In such a case the court is not limited to the assessment of risk of loss at the time of purchase "... but is entitled to take account of how those risks had evolved into certainties at dates after the date on which the comparison of price and true value was being made": Astonland 217 CLR at 661 [45]-[46]. The Court continued: 
 " [46] Figures worked out by analysing what willing but not anxious buyers and willing but not anxious sellers would agree on, without taking account of subsequent events, may correspond with market value; but they do not necessarily correspond with true value because the market can operate under some material mistakes. In particular, some material factor may not be apparent to it. A mistake of this kind, it seems likely, was present here. Though the market value on 21 April 1997 was $400,000, and in July 1997 it was $375,000, one matter was not apparent then which was apparent later. The trial judge found that $130,000 was "the value of the land more or less since it became apparent that tenants were largely unavailable except at minimal rentals" (footnote omitted). That unavailability was an inevitable consequence of the Beach Road Shopping Centre once it was completed, but the perception of the likely effect of that completion was obscure in 1997, and only became clearer from the latter part of 1998 on."

Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ considered an alternative approach to the assessment of damages under s 82. That approach was to allow a plaintiff to recover the purchase price of the asset less whatever was "left in its hands": Astonland 217 CLR at 666-668 [63]-[67]. They concluded that once the plaintiff had been induced to buy the property "... at a time when it was perceived to be valuable, and was forced to retain it because it increasingly became to be perceived as being of declining utility and value": Astonland 217 CLR at 668 [67]. In such a situation the plaintiff's property was not a readily marketable asset.

Austcorp pleaded that the claims were time barred because each applicant entered into the contract more than six years before the commencement of the proceedings. Austcorp also argued that the applicants had become committed to, first, the contracts which they had entered prior to 1 August 2000 and, secondly prior to that date, to paying legal fees incurred and other costs. However, the applicants did not claim any damages in respect of transaction costs incurred before the registration of the strata plan. Austcorp argued that an applicant will be found to suffer loss immediately upon entering into a contract for the purchase of land if the true value of the land at that time is less than the contract price. Accordingly, it contended that the applicants' causes of action under s 52 of the Act accrued at that moment relying on Astonland 217 CLR at 654-655 [28] and 656 [33] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Heydon JJ.

In Astonland the plaintiff had relied on the advice of a valuer before entering into a contract to purchase an income producing shopping arcade. The valuer advised that the construction of a new shopping centre nearby was not likely to affect adversely the arcade's existing retail tenancy levels. But, there was unchallenged evidence that on the date of the contract, and the date of completion, the land was worth less than the price payable or paid under the contract. That was because the valuer on whose valuation the plaintiff had relied advised the plaintiff incorrectly: Astonland 217 CLR at 655 [28]-[29]. Their Honours distinguished that situation from the category of case where a contingency, which might or might not come to pass, was hidden by a representor's conduct. They said that the plaintiff could have found out at once that the market value of the arcade was less than it had agreed to pay. Thus, the risk of the catastrophic effect on rent levels of the plaintiff's land to which the defendant valuer had not alerted the plaintiff, in fact, had already had an impact on the value of the plaintiff's land at the time of the purchase.

Austcorp argued that on the applicants' cases, their apartments must have been worth less than the price paid for them at the dates of entry into the contracts for sale. I reject that argument. The applicants were not obliged to complete the contracts until after registration of the strata plan pursuant to cl 33 of the contract which provided the following: 
 "33.1 Completion of this contract is conditional on the consent of the Council to, and the registration of, the Strata Plan. 

 
 33.2 If the Strata Plan is not registered by the Registration Date [defined as 31 December 2000] either party may at any time after the Registration Date until registration rescind this contract by written notice to the other."</text>

Austcorp argued that the applicants could and should have called the solicitors who acted for them on the transactions and that their failure to do so could be used, not only to support the proposition that the solicitors' evidence would not advance their cases but also to suggest that they had not discharged their onus of proof. It that it was within the applicants' power to call their solicitors and their evidence should be assessed as Lord Mansfield CJ described in Blatch 1 Cowp at 65:

<tocase>Karedis Enterprises Pty Ltd v Antoniou (1995) 59 FCR 35</tocase>
<text>In Wardley 175 CLR at 527 Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ explained the distinction between detriment, in a general sense, and damage suffered on entry into an agreement induced by a misrepresentation which is, or proves to be, to an applicant's disadvantage. The applicant will sustain a detriment in a general sense because the agreement subjects him, her or it to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the benefits which it conferred on that person. But such a detriment will not necessarily amount to more than a contingency of future loss. In general, it is only when the contingency is fulfilled that an applicant will be found to have suffered loss or damage sufficient to infringe his, her or its economic interests for the purposes of an action under s 82(1): Wardley 175 CLR at 533. It is self-evident that the applicants would not have been able to sue for damages in respect of the losses they claim here before they completed or were legally bound to complete their contracts. Risk of loss is not actual loss. The mere entry into the contract did not, of itself, require each applicant to complete it since that obligation would only arise, or be able to be enforced by or against the applicant, once the strata plan was registered: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at 407-409 [46] - [54] .

<tocase>Lewis v Daily Telegraph Limited [1964] AC 234</tocase>
<text>After all, the intended market for this investment were people holidaying at The Entrance who were attracted to walk into PRD's office at the site, as each of the applicants here did. These applicants were ordinary members of the public, not professional landlords or real estate investors or developers. They were the very class of persons who were intended to be attracted by the brochure viz: namely the kind of investor who would be looking for a return in something which it was hard to imagine could be offered at that level. In another context, to do with the law of defamation, Lord Devlin once observed tellingly in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Limited [1964] AC 234 at 285 (and see also Mirror Newspapers Limited v Harrison [1982] HCA 50 ; (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 304 per Brennan J): 
 "A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also fire; but it can be done. One always gets back to the fundamental question: what is the meaning that the words convey to the ordinary man: you cannot make a rule about that ." (emphasis added)

Just as the ascertainment of whether a particular representation was made to a representee, or any other issue concerning the meaning of words, the task of evaluating whether s 51A(1) applies to a representation requires the Court to ascertain the meaning conveyed by the words in the context. There can be no prescriptive rule that any particular form of expression must be, or not be, a representation with respect to a future matter: cf: Lewis [1964] AC at 285 per Lord Devlin.

And, for the purposes of evaluating the issues arising under s 51A , in a case like the present, the understanding of each applicant is crucial. First, the representation objectively must be capable of being characterised as made with respect to a future matter. Secondly, the applicant must have understood it in that way. Thirdly, if the applicant did understand the representation to be with respect to a future matter, he, she or it will need to establish that, understood, in that way, he, she or it suffered loss of damage "by" the contravening conduct under s 82.

Section 51A recognises that representations with respect to a future matter can be objectively misleading or deceptive if the prediction turns out in due course to be wrong. If s 52 operated in that unqualified way, because of the consequence of future error it would create liability for every representation about future matters, however responsibly the representation may have been made at the time. So, s 51A ordinarily affords a representor an important protection in making such a wrong prediction if, when making it, the representor had reasonable grounds for doing so.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/8.html</AustLII>
<text>Mr Tew chose significantly larger apartments in a different market with different amenities (including the neighbouring golf course) with which to make his comparisons, even though there was no apparent justification for doing so. He made no allowance in his valuation as at 2000 for actual and pending competing development at The Entrance. I am not prepared to accept his evidence as being reliable: see Maurici v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2003] HCA 8 ; (2003) 212 CLR 111 at 121 [18] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ. I consider that it indicates that Mr Tew did not select appropriately the properties which he used to arrive at or support his valuations. His approach did not identify properties that reasonably assist in indicating values of a comparable kind to those in the resort. In addition, because the apartments in the resort were purchased for the, or a, purpose of earning investment returns, I am of opinion that Mr Dupont's approach is generally to be preferred.

Austcorp criticised Mr Dupont's methodology in his valuation according to known factors. It argued that the method produced a different value depending on when the exercise was done and that he had arbitrarily selected an unspecified date in 2007 and an unreasoned sale price for the purposes of preparing this valuation. I think there is force in these criticisms. Mr Dupont made a calculation of the 2007 net present value of cash flows from each applicant's apartment. But he said that in order to assess the apartments' values based on events that became known after their purchases, it was necessary to take into account both the actual income they guaranteed from 2001 to 2007 and the apartment's "potential value at today's date". Those potential values were, in the case of Mr Owers $300,000 (as compared to a $330,000 purchase price in 2000), Luciani/Taldarmar $310,000 (as compared to a purchase price of $340,000 in 2000) and $190,000 for Ms Tan-Bounkeua (the same as her purchase price in 2000). His valuation was made in March 2008. Mr Dupont gave no basis explaining how he arrived at those potential values for three properties on this assumed basis.

Mr Dupont's failure to set out in full his reasoning process for selecting the potential values which he put into his value according to known factors calculation undermined the alternative methodology he adopted. I am not satisfied that this was an appropriately explained or reasoned methodology and I reject it.</text>

<text>However, s 51A is a qualified and complex deeming provision: McGrath v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Limited [2008] FCAFC 2 ; (2008) 165 FCR 230. What the section does is, first, provide that where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter and it does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading: s 51A(1).

Secondly, s 51A(2) provides that for the purposes of s 51A(1) the corporation is deemed not to have had reasonable grounds for making the representation "... unless it adduces evidence to the contrary". If the alleged representor does adduce evidence to the effect that it had reasonable grounds for making the representation, the deeming provision does not operate: Australian Naturalcare 165 FCR at 242 [44] per Emmett J and 283 [191]- [192] per Allsop J. That throws back onto an applicant the ultimate onus of proof to make good a claim that there were no reasonable grounds for making the representation. The Court then decides in the ordinary way, on the balance of probabilities whether the representee has established that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation. And, the representor must have had reasonable grounds for a representation as to a future matter at the time he, her or it made the representation: Australian Naturalcare 165 FCR at 284 [198] per Allsop J.

The quality of the evidence adduced by the representor under s 51A(2) must be sufficient to be capable, if accepted, of amounting to providing the representor with reasonable grounds for making the representation at the time it was made. The Court must determine whether the evidence is "evidence to the contrary" so as to throw onto the representee the onus of proving that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making the representation: Australian Naturalcare 165 FCR at 282-283 [191]-[192] per Allsop J. In the context of a trial, the representee will not need to lead evidence in chief on the issue since he, she or it can rely on the deeming in the provision which is only displaced by the representor adducing evidence to the contrary. That evidence, if adduced, will lead to a case in reply. The Court still has to decide whether the evidence relied on as being "to the contrary" adduced by the representor is capable of amounting to reasonable grounds for making the representation. Then, if it is so capable, the Court assesses whether the representee has proved, on the whole of the evidence, that the representor did not have reasonable grounds for making it.</text>

<tocase>Milner v Delita Pty Limited (1985) 9 FCR 299</tocase>
<text>Tax savings, if any, made by an applicant should not be taken into account in reduction of a claim made under s 82 of the Act: Milner v Delita Pty Limited (1985) 9 FCR 299 at 304, per Lockhart J. Lockhart J held that money contributed by an applicant who was induced by conduct that contravened s 52 to enter into a partnership for the processing and growing of guavas had been applied for the purposes of the partnership. He said that it had been envisaged in the misleading promotional brochures that the expenditures would give rise to tax losses that could be claimed as deductions against their income by the investor tax payers. But Lockhart J held that that was an irrelevant consideration for the purposes of an assessment of damages under s 82. He found that there was no relevant nexus between the contravention of the Act by the respondent and any benefit gained by the applicant by reason of the allowability of the claimed losses. Lockhart J applied Simpson Ltd v Hubbards Pty Limited (1982) 44 ALR 695 at 702-703. There Bowen CJ, Franki and McGregor JJ held that since damages were compensatory, the question of deducting probable taxation did not arise. They said that an applicant could not be required to set off past tax losses against an award of damages so as to reduce the total sum of damages ordered by the Court. They regarded the tax losses as being, in one sense, an asset of the applicant who should not be required to dissipate that asset for the benefit of the person who contravened s 52 of the Act: Simpson 44 ALR at 703.</text>

<text>After all, the intended market for this investment were people holidaying at The Entrance who were attracted to walk into PRD's office at the site, as each of the applicants here did. These applicants were ordinary members of the public, not professional landlords or real estate investors or developers. They were the very class of persons who were intended to be attracted by the brochure viz: namely the kind of investor who would be looking for a return in something which it was hard to imagine could be offered at that level. In another context, to do with the law of defamation, Lord Devlin once observed tellingly in Lewis v Daily Telegraph Limited [1964] AC 234 at 285 (and see also Mirror Newspapers Limited v Harrison [1982] HCA 50 ; (1982) 149 CLR 293 at 304 per Brennan J): 
 "A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also fire; but it can be done.

At best, from Austcorp's perspective, there may have been two concurrent causes of the imprudent decisions of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua to buy their apartments and lease them to Mustara.

<text>While I accept that a careful solicitor ought to have picked up the significance of cl 20.9 of the lease, the evidence before me indicates that solicitors did not always do so. Indeed, Austcorp recommended that Mr Walker distribute to purchasers the memorandum prepared by Penhryn Parker, solicitors, identifying the significant features of the transaction. That memorandum in itself did not pick up the limitation in cl 20.9. Nor did Mr Owers' solicitor pick it up. While Mr Fullerton, who advised the Luciani/Taldarmar applicants did pick it up, I am satisfied that by failing to advert in the brochure itself to any limitation of confidence by those promoting the venture such as is contained in cl 20.9, should sound against Austcorp where solicitors for purchasers or the purchasers themselves did not pick this up. After all, Austcorp set the misleading representations in motion. It cannot simply rely upon the overstatements in the brochure to be corrected where they were seriously made and used as powerful marketing tools by it in preparing the brochure with the knowledge that they had that affect. And as Mason J observed in Puxu 149 CLR at 210-211 in a passage applied by Jacobson and Bennett JJ in National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] FCAFC 90 ; (2004) 61 IPR 420 at 437 [52] - [53] (a case where the communication was made in a letter of offer to individual shareholders in a company): 
 "There may be situations where to exploit the mistaken views of the public would contravene s 52 and would not be corrected by an inconspicuous accurate representation e.g. in a concealed label or the 'fine print' of a contract ." (emphasis added)

In the context of the unqualified powerful assertions in the representations, the terms of cl 20.9 were inconspicuous and part of the "fine print" of the contract in the sense referred to by Mason J in Puxu 149 CLR at 210-211. As Jacobson and Bennett JJ said in National Exchange 61 IPR at 437 [50] (applied by Keane JA in Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [83] ):

<text>Austcorp was the guiding hand and ultimately benefited from what its subsidiaries did. It argued that its conduct vis a vis its subsidiaries should be viewed as akin to a real estate agent who passes on the vendor's instructions. I reject that argument. Austcorp did not confine itself to communicating what its subsidiary said, did or represented, without adopting or endorsing it: cf: Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Limited [2004] HCA 60 ; (2004) 218 CLR 592 at 605 [38] - [40] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ. To the contrary, the reality was that the subsidiaries were Austcorp's vehicle for realising its investment in the project. The subsidiaries acted as Austcorp caused them to act. While each of Austcorp and its subsidiaries was a separate legal person, acting through the individuals who were employees of Austcorp, all acted in dual capacities: cf: Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121 at 128 per Mason CJ, Wilson and Toohey JJ. The activities of each member of the Austcorp group involved in the development and marketing of the resort were interlocking and Austcorp controlled each of them: cf: NSW Mutual Real Estate Fund Ltd v Brookhouse [1979] FCA 7 ; (1978) 38 FLR 257 at 263 per Franki J, 264 per St John J, 266 per Deane J.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1982/44.html</AustLII>
<text>It argued that the applicants' case was built on an illusion created with the benefit of hindsight and self-serving assertions. The fact that the brochure conveyed confidence in the prospects of the development, Austcorp argued, did not mean that there was a high level of assurance that the project and the resort would succeed. I reject that argument. The words of the brochure were calculated to convey assurance. The admissions by Austcorp that that was the purpose of using the words of the brochure, of a 7% net guaranteed return for 10 years, namely that it was the "sure thing" referred to in Coudert Bros' letter to the Commission in August 1999 make it clear beyond doubt that the power of this message was realised and deliberate. Of course, liability under s 52 does not depend on the intention of the corporation which engages in the conduct: Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 197.

Mr Chappell gave this evidence: 
 "And you knew at the time that the company Mustara Holdings was not offering any guarantee. Correct? --- It was through the lease they were proposing to enter into with the investor for a 10 year period. [...] Which was the whole basis of the offer. 

 
 Mr Chappell, do you own any rental property? --- Not at the moment. 

 
 You have in the past? --- I have, yes. 

 
 And you've rented it out to people? --- I have. 

 
 And if they enter into a lease that doesn't guarantee you payment of the rent, does it? --- It doesn't. There are certain obligations under the lease which they enter into, the lessee and the lessor, which you can rely on depending on the person. 

 
 That doesn't guarantee you payment of the rent under the lease, does it? --- Well, no, it's not guaranteed. 

 
 No, and the promise to pay under the lease, well, as I think you would accept, depends on the lessee's ability to pay from time to time? --- Correct. 

 
 And the lessee might fall on hard times? --- Yes, it could. 

 
 The lessee might encounter unforeseen circumstances? --- It may. 

 
 And that might affect its ability to pay? --- Correct. 

 
 And the lessee may simply walk away and choose not to pay? --- It's possible, yes. 

 
 And if it does whether or not you get your payments depends on the financial position of the lessee? --- That's true.
 .... 

 
 You're not suggesting seriously to his Honour, are you, that the mere fact of entry into a lease with a tenant involves a guarantee of payment of rent under the lease? --- No. 

 
 Thank you, and you knew therefore that Mustara as the lessee under the proposed leases wasn't guaranteeing payment of the rent under the lease? --- It wasn't guaranteeing it, no.
 ..... 

 
 Pacific International Hotels Pty Limited was not guaranteeing payment of the rent at seven per cent net return per annum for 10 years? --- No. 

 
 HIS HONOUR: When you say 'No' you are agreeing with Dr Bell? --- I'm agreeing that it didn't."

I am satisfied that the brochure achieved, objectively and in the subjective minds of each of the applicants who gave evidence before me, the purpose of instilling in them the belief that the rent would be paid as a "sure thing" [See 3. below]. However, I am also satisfied that the applicants' were worldly enough to realise that no-one would be able to give them a guarantee against the vicissitudes of the marketplace. No-one for example could have predicted the shocking events of 11 September 2001, or other economic events which might affect the Australian or international economies generally. It would be quite unreasonable for anyone to believe that a promoter of a resort hotel project in the Central Coast of New South Wales would be able to predict the outcome of the world economy over the succeeding 10 years and given assurance that nothing could happen which might so impact on the operations of the hotel that rent would not in any circumstances cease to be paid at the guaranteed rate.

As Gibbs CJ said in Puxu 149 CLR at 199 (see also Campomar (2000) 202 CLR at 85 [102]-[103] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ): 
 "The heavy burdens which [s 52] create cannot have been intended to be imposed for the benefit of persons who fail to take reasonable care of their own interests. What is reasonable will of course depend on all the circumstances."

Austcorp argued that the nexus was, in effect, broken because the contract was a legal document which set out with considerable precision and at length the actual relationship that would exist if a person entered into the contract and the lease. For example, it argued that it was not reasonable for a person in the position of Ms Tan-Bounkeua not to have had a solicitor advising her and that, had she done so, the solicitor would have broken the chain of causation, even if he or she negligently failed to advise the purchaser of the provisions of cl 20.9 or the existence of Mustara. I discuss this specific issue below [See 2.18]. Gibbs CJ observed in Puxu [1982] HCA 44 ; 149 CLR 191 at 199 that the Act did not impose burdens which operated for the benefit of persons who failed to take reasonable care of their own interests: see too Campomar 202 CLR at 85 [102].

While I accept that a careful solicitor ought to have picked up the significance of cl 20.9 of the lease, the evidence before me indicates that solicitors did not always do so. Indeed, Austcorp recommended that Mr Walker distribute to purchasers the memorandum prepared by Penhryn Parker, solicitors, identifying the significant features of the transaction. That memorandum in itself did not pick up the limitation in cl 20.9. Nor did Mr Owers' solicitor pick it up. While Mr Fullerton, who advised the Luciani/Taldarmar applicants did pick it up, I am satisfied that by failing to advert in the brochure itself to any limitation of confidence by those promoting the venture such as is contained in cl 20.9, should sound against Austcorp where solicitors for purchasers or the purchasers themselves did not pick this up. After all, Austcorp set the misleading representations in motion. It cannot simply rely upon the overstatements in the brochure to be corrected where they were seriously made and used as powerful marketing tools by it in preparing the brochure with the knowledge that they had that affect. And as Mason J observed in Puxu 149 CLR at 210-211 in a passage applied by Jacobson and Bennett JJ in National Exchange Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] FCAFC 90 ; (2004) 61 IPR 420 at 437 [52] - [53] (a case where the communication was made in a letter of offer to individual shareholders in a company): 
 "There may be situations where to exploit the mistaken views of the public would contravene s 52 and would not be corrected by an inconspicuous accurate representation e.g. in a concealed label or the 'fine print' of a contract ." (emphasis added)

Austcorp attacked the claim by Ms Tan-Bounkeau. It contended that no-one would think that advertisements, brochures or the other promotional material would contain terms or representations that could be relied on as the basis of a serious investment in real property. It argued that she had failed to take reasonable care of her own interests relying on Puxu 149 CLR at 199 per Gibbs CJ and Poulet Frais 220 ALR at 233 [107] per Branson, Nicholson and Jacobson JJ. I reject that submission. Austcorp, the author of the false descriptions of the investment, should not be able to say that its representations could not be taken at face value. It had made misleading and deceptive representations of a guaranteed 7% p.a. return relying on the perception of the investors that "Pacific International Hotels" was the lessee. Yet, Austcorp was conscious that cl 20.9 of the lease made a fundamental qualification to this assertion and that its marketing message would have been far less compelling if accurate information had been conveyed about cl 20.9. The assurance of a return would have been undermined if Austcorp had complied with s 52. Potential investors, including Ms Tan-Bounkeua, would have been less enthusiastic had the promotional material revealed that the only promoter offering any long term financial commitment to an investor, Pacific International Hotels, was not prepared to back its judgment beyond the limited extent of cl 20.9. As Mr Hung acknowledged, the consequence of cl 20.9 meant that it was not a "sure thing" that the investors would receive their promised 7% p.a. net return for 10 years.

In the context of the unqualified powerful assertions in the representations, the terms of cl 20.9 were inconspicuous and part of the "fine print" of the contract in the sense referred to by Mason J in Puxu 149 CLR at 210-211. As Jacobson and Bennett JJ said in National Exchange 61 IPR at 437 [50] (applied by Keane JA in Downey [2005] QCA 199 at [83] ):

<text>Had Austcorp wished to disclaim liability for what was said in the brochure or to have advised investors or members of the public who read it that they could not rely on it, it would have been easy to put a disclaimer on the document. But, there is not a word of caution in the brochure. It is full of optimistic predictions and assurances of a long term and significant return. And, of course, a disclaimer might undermine the message of a "sure thing". Austcorp or the other promoters did not exhort the applicants to make their own inquiries about the "guaranteed" return or the certainty of its receipt unlike in Poulet Frais Pty Ltd v The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 131 ; (2005) 220 ALR 211 at 232 [104] per Branson, Nicholson and Jacobson JJ.

Austcorp attacked the claim by Ms Tan-Bounkeau.

<text>While I am satisfied that it would be unreasonable to read the brochure as offering an assurance against anything that might happen in the market, the use of an apparently reputable hotel operator's name, Pacific International Hotels, in connection with the promise of a 7% p.a. return for 10 years from the investment was calculated to induce confidence that the promoters of the venture had a foundation for the confidence expressed concerning future matters. Those who were named in the brochure as organisations, rather than particular identified corporate identities, included the hotel operator, as "Pacific International", and a developer, "Austcorp". Ordinarily, a statement which involves the state of mind of the maker will convey the meaning expressly, or by implication, that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when it was made and, commonly, that there was a basis for that state of mind: Global Sportsman Pty Limited v Mirror Newspapers Limited [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88 per Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ; RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 at 172-175 per Beaumont and Spender JJ, with whom Davies J generally agreed at 165-166.</text>

<text>In Gould v Vaggelas (1984) 157 CLR 215 at 236 Wilson J identified four principles which are frequently used as a practical guide to assess the issue of whether a person has been induced to contract based on a misrepresentation (cf: Ricochet Pty Ltd v Equity Trustees Executors and Agency Company Ltd [1993] FCA 99 ; (1993) 41 FCR 229 at 234 per Lockhart, Gummow and French JJ; Dominelli Ford (Hurstville) Pty Ltd v Karmot Auto Spares Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 550 ; (1992) 38 FCR 471 at 482-483 per Beaumont, Foster and Hill JJ; Sutton v AJ Thompson Pty Ltd (1987) 73 ALR 233 at 240 per Forster, Woodward and Wilcox JJ), namely: 
 "1. Notwithstanding that a representation is both false and fraudulent, if the representee does not rely upon it he has no case. 

 If a material representation is made which is calculated to induce the representee to enter into a contract and that person in fact enters into the contract there arises a fair inference of fact that he was induced to do so by the representation.
 The inference may be rebutted, for example, by showing that the representee, before he entered into the contract, either was possessed of actual knowledge of the true facts and knew them to be true or alternatively made it plain that whether he knew the true facts or not he did not rely on the representation.
 The representation need not be the sole inducement. It is sufficient so long as it plays some part even if only a minor part in contributing to the formation of the contract."</text>

<tocase>S. Pearson &amp; Son, Ltd v Dublin Corp [1907] AC 351</tocase>
<text>Mr Hung's 29 November letter left no room to doubt that Austcorp was the developer of the resort. Of course, none of the present applicants received it, but it makes Austcorp's defence that it did not engage in the conduct complained of ring hollow. A similar line of defence seeking to exculpate a principal for the act of its agent was criticised by the Earl of Halsbury as being like the schoolboy's game of "I did not take it, I have not got it" in S. Pearson &amp; Son, Ltd v Dublin Corporation [1907] AC 351 at 357. After all its activity in promoting the development and the sale of apartments in the resort, it would be extraordinary if Austcorp now could hide behind its previously hidden corporate veils.

Mr Zantiotis discussed the guaranteed return and the lease with investors from time to time. In early December 1999, he obtained a letter of advice from Chris Mitchell of Corrrs Chambers Westgarth, solicitors, about the application of Ch 5C of the Corporations Law to Austcorp in relation to its involvement with the development of the resort. Mr Zantiotis was then unaware that on 26 August 1999 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) had granted Landillo an exemption for offers made to investors before 1 January 2000. Coudert Bros had acted on Mr Hung's instructions to obtain this. Mr Mitchell recommended seeking an exemption from ASIC. Mr Mitchell reviewed a number of documents including the contract, the lease and the brochure.

Corrs Chambers Westgarth's letter referred specifically to the statement in the brochure that "your return will be a guaranteed 7% per annum". Mr Mitchell advised that this "... seems inconsistent with the limitation of the guarantee under the Lease". Mr Zantiotis was not concerned by this inconsistency at the time. He took the view that when asked by potential investors about how the 7% return related to the lease and the guarantee for the 10 years that "... I was always responsible enough to refer the contract and all its contents to their solicitors". I formed the impression that Mr Zantiotis was a fairly straightforward witness and that he chose this response to investors' questions to enable him to avoid giving them the direct answer (exposed in Mr Mitchell's letter) while giving them access to the full contractual position through their own solicitors' advice. Mr Zantiotis reviewed the letter from Corrs Chambers Westgarth with Mr Hung who told him that it was not necessary to get an exemption.</text>

<text>I am of opinion that until the registration of the strata plan on 1 August 2000 it was not certain that loss would be suffered by any of the applicants, because before then they were not obliged and could not be compelled to complete the contract. Indeed they were entitled, if that registration had not occurred by 31 December 2000, to rescind their contracts. It was only when the strata plan was registered that the applicants were faced with the obligation to complete the contracts and deprived of the opportunity to rescind under cl 33.2. Thus, when each of the applicants became bound to complete or later completed their contracts, they would suffer loss or damage because only then would they pay or be liable to pay more for their apartment than it was worth: Scarcella v Lettice [2000] NSWCA 289 ; (2000) 51 NSWLR 302 at 309 [32] per Handley JA, 310 [41] per Giles JA and cf per Powell JA at 310 [37].</text>

<text>Tax savings, if any, made by an applicant should not be taken into account in reduction of a claim made under s 82 of the Act: Milner v Delita Pty Limited (1985) 9 FCR 299 at 304, per Lockhart J. Lockhart J held that money contributed by an applicant who was induced by conduct that contravened s 52 to enter into a partnership for the processing and growing of guavas had been applied for the purposes of the partnership. He said that it had been envisaged in the misleading promotional brochures that the expenditures would give rise to tax losses that could be claimed as deductions against their income by the investor tax payers. But Lockhart J held that that was an irrelevant consideration for the purposes of an assessment of damages under s 82. He found that there was no relevant nexus between the contravention of the Act by the respondent and any benefit gained by the applicant by reason of the allowability of the claimed losses. Lockhart J applied Simpson Ltd v Hubbards Pty Limited (1982) 44 ALR 695 at 702-703. There Bowen CJ, Franki and McGregor JJ held that since damages were compensatory, the question of deducting probable taxation did not arise. They said that an applicant could not be required to set off past tax losses against an award of damages so as to reduce the total sum of damages ordered by the Court. They regarded the tax losses as being, in one sense, an asset of the applicant who should not be required to dissipate that asset for the benefit of the person who contravened s 52 of the Act: Simpson 44 ALR at 703.</text>

<tocase>Sydney Harbour Casino Properties Pty Ltd v Coluzzi [2002] NSWCA 74</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/NSWCA/2002/74.html</AustLII>
<text>While her own carelessness in not engaging a solicitor was a cause of Ms Tan-Bounkeua's loss, I am not satisfied that it was the only cause. As I have found, a solicitor might, but would not necessarily, have advised her about the existence and effect of cl 20.9. Although the representations were made in order to interest investors in purchasing apartments in the development, their message would be undone only if a solicitor in fact advised his or her client of the effect of cl 20.9. And the risk to Austcorp, if that happened, was that it might lose the benefit of the sale: Sydney Harbour Casino Properties Pty Ltd v Coluzzi [2002] NSWCA 74 at [43] , [57] per Mason P (with whom Giles and Heydon JJA agreed on this point at [92] and [93]).

Moreover, had Ms Tan-Bounkeua been informed before completion that Mustara had ceased to be a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels since she had entered into the contract, she would not have proceeded because that would have exposed her to risk of loss.

The correctness of these representations depended on the nature of the "assurance" of the net rental return of 7% of the purchase price for 10 years. (Mr Owers did not receive the leaflet so only representation (a) is relevant to his position.) At the time of entering into the contracts each of the applicants understood that the way in which they would be paid the return was through their lease of their apartment to Mustara on terms that it pay the rent at the rate of 7% of the purchase price net of deductions for 10 years. The "assurance" came from this understanding and, in Mr Owers' and Ms Tan-Bounkeua's cases, the connection that Mustara was a subsidiary of Pacific International Hotels which guaranteed the performance of Mustara. In other contexts the word "guarantee" can have a range of connotations, but as Mason P observed in Coluzzi [2002] NSWCA 74 at [46] (Giles and Heydon JJA agreeing on this issue at [92]-[93]) it can certainly include a firm assurance as to a state of affairs.

Thus, since I have found that, when entering the contract and signing the lease, Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua were not aware of the nature and effect of cl 20.9 of the lease, limiting the guarantee, it was false to represent to them that payment of the rent for the entire term was "assured" in the sense that they understood the representations. That is, it made no difference to either of them that Pacific International Hotels was not the lessee if Mustara were its subsidiary and, in substance, Pacific International Hotels would stand completely behind Mustara. If that were the case then, as a matter of substance, the statements in the promotional material of the "security of a lease to Pacific International Hotels" would have been true, even though the technical legal mechanism of a lease to Mustara with a guarantee by its parent was utilised. They saw themselves dealing with, and receiving assurance from, the involvement of Pacific International Hotels for the lease of their apartments and the operation of the resort. But, that was not the true position. Mustara had ceased to be a subsidiary on 23 December 1999. And, as they understood the position, if Mustara failed they could still look to Pacific International Hotels to honour the promise for the full 10 years.

Because cl 20.9 of the lease qualified their entitlement to look to Pacific International Hotels for payment, one means by which Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua understood that the return would be assured, namely that Pacific International Hotels would be liable to pay it in full for the whole 10 year term, was falsified. Additionally, Austcorp's failure to correct the position in relation to Mustara not being a subsidiary of Pacific International also falsified the basis of the assurance. Representation (b): net rental return would be achieved through the lease of apartments to Pacific International Hotels for a term of 10 years with two 10 year options

That was a key selling point. It worked on Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua. They understood that from day one for 10 years they would receive that return. The promise of a guaranteed return was a prime consideration for them, as Austcorp understood it used this as its marketing strategy based on the experts assessment of each of Mr Walker (in his letter of 3 June 1999), Mr Chappell and Mr Hung. In Coluzzi [2002] NSWCA 74 at [57] Mason P observed of a similar representation, that it may be reasonable to make a qualified estimate or prediction but quite unreasonable to make "... an unqualified and firm prediction such as is conveyed by the word 'guaranteed' in the present context". That context was a guaranteed net 7% p.a. return on capital invested in a serviced apartment bought off the plan.

The assurance, here, was no doubt reinforced by the understanding (unrealised because of cl 20.9) that the legal structure of the lease to the entity referred to as "Pacific International Hotels" and "Pacific International" in the promotional material would reflect these representations.

Last, representation (e) was also predictive of the outcome of the investment. Its verification was dependent on what would transpire after the representation was made. The assessment of how the investment would turn out could only be made after the making of that representation.</text>

<text>Section 82(1) of the Act permits recovery by an applicant for loss or damage notwithstanding his, her or its failure to mitigate or contributory negligence unless the applicant's own carelessness or disregard of his, her or its interests is the cause of some or all of the loss or damage: Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio (1988) 58 FCR 274 at 286G-287C per Fisher, Gummow and Lee JJ applying what French J had said in Pavich v Boira Nominees Pty Ltd [1988] ANZ Conv R 556 at p 23; see too Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) 88 FCR 511 at 517B-E per Heerey J, Sundberg J agreeing at 521F. The misrepresentations were a link in the causal chain between Mr Owers' entry into the transaction and his loss: cf: Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2001) 206 CLR 459 at 469 [14] per Gleeson CJ. At best, from Austcorp's perspective, there may have been two concurrent causes of the imprudent decisions of Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeua to buy their apartments and lease them to Mustara. Austcorp's conduct was one of the causes, the other being those applicants' failure to receive legal advice exposing to them the effect of cl 20.9. 3.1 THE APPLICANTS

<text>The serious act of an investor signing and exchanging such a document knowing that it related to an interest in property, in general, will operate to bind the purchaser to the terms of the contract: Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 182 [47] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. The act of signature ordinarily conveys a representation that the person signing either has read and approved the contents of the document or is willing to take the chance of being bound by the contents whatever they may be: Toll 219 CLR at 180-181 [45]. Where the person who signs a contract to purchase an interest in property has a solicitor acting for him or her on the transaction, this representation will ordinarily be enhanced by the addition of the fact that the solicitor will have considered and advised his or her client on the legal effect of the document.

Of course, where fraud or misrepresentation has operated to affect the contracting party's decision to sign, the Court may find that he or she will not be bound by the contract or the effect of the signature: Toll 219 CLR at 181 [46]. One reason for this is that the effect of the misapprehension induced, or caused, by the fraud or misrepresentation may have caused the innocent party either not to advert to a subject matter in the contract, at all, or to understand it in a sense different to that induced by the misapprehension. In other words, the effect of the misapprehension may affect the context in which the contract or document is understood by the person who signs it. Just as the construction of a contract is affected by the objective matrix of facts known to both parties, so too, a misapprehension induced or caused by fraud or misrepresentation will affect the quality of the assent ordinarily evinced by a signature.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2008/5.html</AustLII>
<text>Market value is not a value arrived at by an ill informed market. The test was stated by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Walker Corporation Pty Ltd v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5 ; (2008) 233 CLR 259 at 276-277 [51] as: 
 "Value is determined by forming an opinion as to what a willing purchaser will pay and a not unwilling vendor will receive for the property ( Spencer v The Commonwealth (1907) 5 CLR 418). In determining that value, there must be attributed to the parties a knowledge of all matters that affect its value. Those matters will include the predicted impact of future events as well as the experience of the past and the rates of return on other investments. As Isaacs J pointed out in Spencer v The Commonwealth ((1907) 5 CLR 418 at 441): 'We must further suppose both to be perfectly acquainted with the land, and cognisant of all circumstances which might affect its value, either advantageously or prejudicially, including its situation, character, quality, proximity to conveniences or inconveniences, its surrounding features, the then present demand for land, and the likelihood, as then appearing to persons best capable of forming an opinion, of a rise or fall for what reason soever in the amount which one would otherwise be willing to fix as the value of the property. (Emphasis added.)' 

 
 The market for the property is, therefore, assumed to be an efficient market in which buyers and sellers have access to all currently available information that affects the property ." (final emphasis added)

I am of opinion that prior to recent times the market was operating in an inefficient manner. Initially, the market was created and affected, in part, by the misleading and deceptive representations. These attributed to apartments in the resort an aura of being good, solid investments with the prospect of a guaranteed return for many years. After Mustara's collapse, a substantial number of sales occurred at higher price levels which have not been sustained since 2004. Even then, as Mr Dupont's analysis showed, from 2000 to 2004 the rise in sale prices for apartments in the resort was around 40% to 50%, while the rise of 84% in Wyong Shire for that period was substantially greater. Thus there was some, but not a full, appreciation that the value of an apartment in the resort was not as good as in the general area. But the subsequent drop of prices to levels generally materially below the original purchase prices off the plan, demonstrates that the market was not operating efficiently before this later time. Mr Dupont concluded that by March 2008 the value of apartments, based on the latest sales, had fallen to around 20% below their 2000 level while median apartment prices in Wyong Shire had increased 55% in the same period. I accept that evidence.

I am satisfied that the present level of prices reflects the true value now of the apartments. The consequence is stark. The real value of the applicants' original investments in comparison to similar property in the surrounding area has decreased markedly over the eight or more years since they entered into their contracts to purchase. That decrease and its very different direction to the significant increase in value of immediately surrounding properties were not explained by any evidence. I discount the suggestion made to Mr Owers of a concern that some costly remedial work may be needed for the resort. There was no evidence of what that was or of any effect on the value of the apartments. No expert referred to it and I am not satisfied that, whatever the basis of the concern conveyed to Mr Owers was, it affords any explanation of this marked decrease in the market price of apartments in the resort.

It is because this extraordinary reduction in prices for apartments in the resort has occurred but has not been otherwise explained on the evidence, that I reject Mr Tew's direct comparison approach between other sales of properties in the resort and the applicants' apartments as an appropriate way of valuing them at an earlier time than the present. Those earlier prices, while genuine market prices, did not reflect the true value of the apartments. I find that the market was not then operating as an efficient market: cf: Walker Corporation 233 CLR at 276-277 [51]. It may be that the purchasers who paid increased prices for apartments in the resort from the time of Mustara's demise till the current trend emerged were acting under a misconception that there was a real prospect of capital growth. But, even then those prices were generally significantly less than the increase in median prices in the immediate area. This is a sure indication that the values in the resort were affected by some factor outside ordinary market forces: i.e. by factors other than those bearing on the true value of the apartments. Significant (as opposed to normal market) capital growth was not a real possibility for these particular properties. They were in a resort with substantive restrictions on their use, either as a long-term residence for their owners or when let short term to other individuals. They had to be part of a resort complex if they were to be likely to earn any shorter term significant investment return. But the actual operations of the resort have been desultory compared to what was necessary in order to support a net return paid by a lessee over 10 years of 7% of the purchase price.

I am satisfied, having considered the evidence for myself, that the true value of the apartments in the resort at the time each applicant purchased is better reflected by reference to the current and more recent sale prices. Since these are materially less than the purchase prices some seven to eight years later, I am satisfied that each of the applicants acquired on completion of their purchase an apartment which was worth less than what was paid for it.

I prefer Mr Dupont's adoption of a capitalisation approach as opposed to Mr Tew's comparable sales approach. However, the methodology each valuer used and his reasoning process do not enable me to adopt either's ultimate valuation using their respective approaches. The market in 1999 and 2000 ascribed values to apartments in the resort that were distorted by the effect of the misrepresentations, including the earlier assurances by Landillo of guaranteed returns of 8%, then 7.5% (before Austcorp's involvement) and finally 7%p.a.</text>

<text>When a person claims to recover loss or damage under s 82(1) of the Act, the question of causation is whether he, she or it has suffered that loss or damage "... by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of ..." here, relevantly, s 52. In Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 525 Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said that the word "by" as used in s 82(1) clearly expressed the notion of causation without defining or elucidating it. They held that, in general, this required using the common law practical, or common-sense, concept of causation unless the provisions of the Act operated to modify or supplement that concept. They said that where the claim under s 82(1) was to recover for loss or damage by misleading conduct consisting of misrepresentations done in contravention of s 52(1) , as at common law, "... acts done by the representee in reliance on the misrepresentation constitute a sufficient connexion to satisfy the concept of causation": see too Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 224 CLR 627 at 639 [30] per Gleeson CJ, 642-643 [44]-[49] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, 645-647 [53]-[60] per Kirby J, 653-654 [78]-[81] per Callinan J.

Until 1 August 2000 the applicants had only a contingency of suffering loss depending on whether they completed their contracts. The economic interest of the applicants that would be infringed by Austcorp's misleading conduct was their obligation to complete their purchase consequent upon the registration of the strata plan and the loss of their right to rescind: Wardley 175 CLR at 532-533 per Mason CJ, Dawson Gaudron and McHugh JJ.

Austcorp contended that this analysis overlooked the liability for legal costs before 1 August 2000 that the applicants (other than Ms Tan-Bounkeua) incurred. I reject that argument. First, Austcorp did not plead those matters as material facts. Secondly, the applicants in any event may have incurred a contingent liability for the legal costs of receiving advice on whether or not to enter into the contract. No solicitor rendered an invoice for those fees before 1 August 2000 and, thus, the applicants had no legal obligation to pay those fees before that date. Had Mr Owers been advised not to enter into the contract or of the effect of cl 20.9, he would have followed the advice. There is no evidence whether he would have been charged by Mr Joseph for the advice. The question was not in issue.

Next, Austcorp argued that Luciani/Taldarmar had incurred legal fees of $1,700 as at 7 February 2000. However, Shephard &amp; Shephard, in the course of giving their fee estimate on that date advised, them that they would charge that amount for acting on the purchase. Shephard &amp; Shephard only invoiced that sum on 15 December 2000, being the day when the contract was completed. On 7 February 2000 Shephard &amp; Shephard had asked only for a sum of $200 on account of anticipated immediate disbursements. I am not satisfied payment of this sum (if it were paid) would amount to loss or damage, since it was sought to enable the solicitors to investigate and advise upon whether the applicants should go ahead with the purchase by binding themselves to a contract. That is, the expense would have been incurred in investigating whether the applicants could rely on Austcorp's representations.

The applicants' claim was for damage caused by their entry into contracts which they became obliged to complete only on 1 August 2000. That was the first occasion of any relevant infringement of the applicants' economic interests, for they were then legally obliged to pay the price which the wrongdoer (misrepresentor) had misled them to agree to pay: Wardley 175 CLR at 533.

In Wardley 175 CLR at 527 Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ explained the distinction between detriment, in a general sense, and damage suffered on entry into an agreement induced by a misrepresentation which is, or proves to be, to an applicant's disadvantage. The applicant will sustain a detriment in a general sense because the agreement subjects him, her or it to obligations and liabilities which exceed the value or worth of the benefits which it conferred on that person. But such a detriment will not necessarily amount to more than a contingency of future loss. In general, it is only when the contingency is fulfilled that an applicant will be found to have suffered loss or damage sufficient to infringe his, her or its economic interests for the purposes of an action under s 82(1): Wardley 175 CLR at 533. It is self-evident that the applicants would not have been able to sue for damages in respect of the losses they claim here before they completed or were legally bound to complete their contracts. Risk of loss is not actual loss. The mere entry into the contract did not, of itself, require each applicant to complete it since that obligation would only arise, or be able to be enforced by or against the applicant, once the strata plan was registered: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at 407-409 [46] - [54] . In Karedis Enterprises Pty Ltd v Antoniou (1995) 59 FCR 35 at 43C-D Burchett and Hill JJ (Sackville J agreed at 45C; see too at 48E) held that where a lessee had been induced by the lessor's misrepresentations as to takings into entering into a lease, the question for limitation purposes was " ... when was it that the loss which the [applicants] ultimately suffered (or a more than negligible part of it ) was either ascertained by them or reasonably ascertainable? "

But, in any event, the relevant loss or damage that the applicants claimed under s 82 of the Act was that "by" Austcorp's contravention of s 52 they paid Landillo more for their apartments than they were worth: Wardley 175 CLR at 527, 532-533. I am of opinion that Mr Owers and Ms Tan-Bounkeau are not prevented by s 82(2) from recovering that loss

The parties agreed (by the end of final address) the quantum of damages (before interest) that would be recoverable as expenditures incurred (other than the loss of value on the purchase price which I dealt with under the heading "Valuation") if the applicants succeeded except in two respects concerning Mr Owers. These were: 
(a) whether he made a recoverable loss since, after paying $48,837 more than he earned in returns from the apartment, Mr Owers obtained taxation deductions which left him a net $2,335 better off;
 
(b) whether Mr Owers should recover damages on the $33,000 deposit that he paid from his bank account and did not borrow.
 (a) Tax benefits

In final address Austcorp accepted that up to 31 March 2008 Ms Tan-Bounkeua and Luciani/Taldarmar had incurred agreed amounts that they would not have spent or become liable to pay as a result of their financing the acquisition of their apartments. Those amounts were agreed by the parties' expert accountant witnesses in a joint report. On this basis, Ms Tan-Bounkeua had incurred a loss of $52,473 and Luciani/Taldarmar had incurred a loss of $116,868. This recognised that those applicants had incurred these losses before taking account of income tax deductions or benefits which they obtained in consequence of their expenditures included in the total sums. The parties accepted that any taxation consequences for those applicants were not relevant to the amount of damages to which they were entitled. The individual applicants will have to deal with the taxation consequences of any award in due course.</text>

<text>I reject this argument. First, Austcorp was not a party to the contract or disclosure statement even if it were the puppet master behind them. Secondly, a corporation cannot engage in a contravention of s 52 of the Act and then seek to excuse itself from liability to relief being granted against it under Part VI on the basis that it, or another person, has sought to negate the effect of the contravention by provisions like cl 39 or the disclosure statement without, at least, making full, intelligible, and frank disclosure of the true position so as to negate its earlier contravention. Thirdly, in honest trade and commerce contractual exclusions like cl 39 and documents like the disclosure statement may have some effect. The courts have recognised that they may be given effect, depending on all the circumstances, as evidentiary of the complaining party's state of mind having been disabused of any relevant misleading or deceptive conduct: cf: Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd v Alpine Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] WASCA 174 ; (2005) 224 ALR 134 at 147-148 [59] - [60] per Steytler P, 164 [133] per McLure JA and 164-165 [135]-[141] per Pullin JA.</text>

<tocase>Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315</tocase>
<text>Inevitably, each of the applicants who gave evidence and Messrs Chappell and Hung were giving an account of events that happened years before and about which they had not given much, if any, thought until recently for the purpose of this litigation. I agree with the caution expressed by McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 319 concerning evidence of this kind. He said: 
 "Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience."

Austcorp argued that, to varying degrees, the applicants' oral evidence of their continuing reliance on the representations complained of at the time they executed or completed the contracts and leases should be discounted or rejected. It claimed that the important nature of the transactions and the fact that a solicitor could be expected to explain the contractual documents accurately, so as to dispel any misapprehension or misrepresentation, weighed against a finding that the representations complained of were relied on at all by the time of execution or completion. And, Austcorp argued that the failure of the applicants, other than Ms Tan Bounkeua (who had no solicitor), to call the solicitor acting for them was a powerful factor undermining the reliability of their evidence.

Here, however, there is the objective evidence of the contents of the brochure and other promotional material (including the unchallenged, and inherently likely evidence of Mr Walker's repetition and reinforcement of its messages in his discussions with each applicant). There is no doubt that these conveyed the powerful messages of assurance and success of the investment contained in the representations. In general, these factors lend force to the applicants' claims that the representations were relied on by them at the time they entered into their contracts, completed them and executed their leases. I will, of course, consider each applicant's individual circumstances separately below. But, as a matter of ordinary human experience, powerful marketing messages tend to have a sustained effect.

Although the representator did not remove the effect of the misrepresentations, I am satisfied that Mr and Mrs Di Giulio and Mr Luciani turned their mind to these questions and considered the advice from each of Mr Dunn and Mr Fullerton carefully before taking a considered but deliberate risk to proceed with the investment based on their own confidence in the outcome. This is a particularly apposite instance of the need for the exercise of caution, expressed by McLelland CJ in Eq in Watson v Foxman 49 NSWLR at 318-319, in accepting evidence of persons claiming many years later to have been misled by representations in entering into a contract.

Mrs Di Giulio was emphatic that she was not aware that the guarantee by Pacific International Hotels was limited to 12 months worth of rent as opposed to 10 years. She said: 
 "Well, there's a big difference from 10 years to 12 months. This was suppose to be a solid future investment, not something that was suppose to be for 12 months and we weren't told that at the time . It wasn't said here in the brochures or the leaflet, it wasn't told by Warren Walker and, you know, our solicitors reassured us everything would be okay . 

 
 When you say solicitors reassured you that everything would be OK, what are you referring to? --- That it would be a solid future investment to, you know, to carry on with that ." (emphasis added)

She denied that she was aware of the 12 months limitation and said: 
 "It wouldn't be logical to go into something that' s 12 months when you're thinking of a future investment."</text>

<tocase>Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331</tocase>
<text>Mr Chappell wrote much of the wording of the brochure. He wrote letters to the investors saying that Austcorp was the developer. While he may not have done this with any intention to mislead people, he did it to publicise the fact that Austcorp was the active parent company responsible for the Austcorp group's overall development activities throughout Australia, including that of the resort. Austcorp was prepared to allow a loose and ambiguous representation, connecting Austcorp with the development, to be made in the brochure. In my opinion, this is a case where it is clear that any Austcorp company which in fact had an association with the development could be taken to have published the brochure: Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363-366 per Issacs J; see also Abigail v Lapin [1934] UKPCHCA 1 ; (1934) 51 CLR 58 at 70-71 per Lord Wright.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>Thus, it appears on the objective material here, that Austcorp was not involved in its dealings with third parties as a mere agent or conduit for a separate and disclosed, or undisclosed, principal. Its chosen method of doing business is likely to have made Austcorp a principal in many transactions it effected for the purposes of the project because it does not appear to have disclosed any intention to contract as an agent. When Mr Chappell or Mr Hung made decisions, wearing their Austcorp hats, their position was distinguishable from that of acting as an agent for an Austcorp subsidiary. In Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666 Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ said: 
 "... even though a corporation acts honestly and reasonably, it may nonetheless engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive: .... That does not, however, mean that a corporation which purports to do no more than pass on information supplied by another must nevertheless be engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct if the information turns out to be false. If the circumstances are such as to make it apparent that the corporation is not the source of the information and that it expressly or impliedly disclaims any belief in its truth or falsity, merely passing it on for what it is worth, we very much doubt that the corporation can properly be said to be itself engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive."
