<text>44 Ms Klewer has had every opportunity to present submissions, including numerous written submissions, in support of the appeal. Other than to reassert the fact that she holds the Korora property on trust for Robert Klewer which his Honour did not accept, she has not suggested any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in respect of his Honour's finding that there was no trust. Ms Klewer has not suggested that his Honour's findings of fact in relation to the alleged trust were ' glaringly improbable ' or that his Honour had in some way ' failed to use or ... palpably misused his advantage ' as the trial judge ( Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118).

45 In her oral submissions on 8 October 2008, Ms Klewer asserts the existence of a trust, express, implied or constructive. She also asserts that there is a written will, which accords with a testamentary disposition of the Korora property.

46 Ms Klewer maintains that she made a 'living will' and intended to and did transfer the Korora property to Robert Klewer, so that she held the property in trust for him. However, apart from an assertion that a written version must exist somewhere on a computer disk which she has not been able to locate, there is nothing in writing evidencing such a trust.</text>

<text>50 As the respondent has pointed out, there is an inconsistency between Ms Klewer's continued assertion that she created a testamentary trust and her statements to the effect that she intended the trust over the Korora property to take effect while she was still alive. If Ms Klewer's intention was to create a testamentary trust, then even if the will were in writing, this would not give rise to any legal or equitable right on the part of Robert Klewer while Ms Klewer remains alive. A ' beneficiary under [a] will derives, while the testator remains alive, no legal or equitable right or title from the will: all the beneficiary has is the prospect of acquiring a right or title if the testator dies in the lifetime of the prospective beneficiary without revoking or altering the will ' (R Meagher, J Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies (4 th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2002) at [6-190]). As was stated In re Parsons; Stockley v Parsons (1890) 45 Ch D 51 at 55 per Kay J (approved in Ogden Industries Pty Limited v Lucas [1968] UKPCHCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 32 at 37):
 It is indisputable law that no one can have any estate or interest, at law or in equity, contingent or other, in the property of a living person to which he hopes to succeed as heir at law or next of kin of such living person. During the life of such person no one can have more than a spes successionis, an expectation or hope of succeeding to his property.</text>

<tocase>Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FMCA 274</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/274.html</AustLII>
<text>2 The appellants appeal from a decision of Raphael FM dismissing their application for a declaration that the Korora property is non-divisible among Ms Klewer's creditors ( Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FMCA 274). Ms Klewer argued before Raphael FM that the Korora property is not divisible amongst her creditors for two reasons: that the moneys used to purchase the property constituted "protected money" within the meaning of s 116(2D) of the Act and that the Korora property was held in trust by Ms Klewer for Robert Klewer and was therefore not property divisible amongst Ms Klewer's creditors by virtue of the operation of s 116(2)(a) of the Act.

3 On 11 March 2008, the appellants filed a notice of appeal ' from part of the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court '. The ground of appeal was: ' That the evidence supports the existence of a trust '. On 18 June 2008, an amended notice of appeal was filed from the whole of the judgment of Raphael FM. The sole ground of appeal is: ' Procedural unfairness '. No particulars are provided.

4 At the hearing of this appeal, Ms Klewer says that her grounds of appeal are:
 
&#8226; Procedural unfairness, because:
 
 
 - She appeared by telephone before the Federal Magistrate;
 - She was unable to hear everything that was said during the hearing before the Federal Magistrate;
 - The Federal Magistrate did not cross-examine her other children who had filed affidavits;
 - The Federal Magistrate "assumed" what the other children had meant from their statements and drew the wrong conclusions from those statements;
 - She and her son did not have legal representation. 
 

&#8226; That the evidence established an express trust in favour of Robert Klewer, or, in the alternative, an implied or constructive trust.</text>
