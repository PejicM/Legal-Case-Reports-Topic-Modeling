<text>14 Since the decision by Driver FM was an exercise of his Honour's discretion, the principles referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 in relation to the role of the appeal court apply. In that decision, the majority of the High Court said at 504-5:
 
 'It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so.'

<text>17 There are numerous authorities of this Court in which prejudice has been considered in this context, each of which has related to prejudice which accrued during the period for which an extension is sought: see for example Wedesweiller and Ors v Cole and Ors (1983) 47 ALR 528; Hickey and Ors v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1983) 47 ALR 517; Duff and Ors v Freijah and Ors (1982) 62 FLR 280.

<text>30 I also consider that an individual employee alleged to have engaged in unlawful discrimination need not be a party to a proceeding in order that the Court make a finding in respect of the lawfulness of their conduct. The words of s 106(1) that ' this Act applies in relation to that person as if that person had also done the act ' indicate that an employer is to be severally liable for the discriminatory conduct of its employee. Such interpretation is supported by Gilroy v Angelov (2000) 181 ALR 57, in which Wilcox J made orders against an employer in circumstances where the employee was unable to be served with the application.</text>

<tocase>Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344</tocase>
<text>11 Several principles must be considered by the Court in determining an application for leave to extend time in which to institute proceedings. In Phillips McInnis FM referred to Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 in which Wilcox J (at 348-9) set out the principles to be adopted in relation to an extension of time under s 11 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act'). McInnis FM determined that those principles were applicable to the exercise of discretion under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. Accordingly his Honour (at [10]) set out the following principles:
 
 
 '1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The "prescribed period" of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 
 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a pre-condition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential pre-condition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 
 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised. (See Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287) 
 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension. (See Doyle at p 287) 
 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension. (See Lucic at p 416) 
 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. (See Lucic at p 417) 
 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of the court's discretion ( Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528).'

12 The above principles are drawn almost verbatim from those formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments. I consider that they are relevant to an application under s 46PO of the HREOC Act. The principles relevant to this appeal are numbers 4 and 6.

13 The appellant contends that Driver FM erred in his interpretation of prejudice for the purposes of an application to extend time in which to bring proceedings. The appellant also contends that Driver FM erred in assessing the merits of the appellant's case, because his Honour misconceived the basis of the vicarious liability of the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479</tocase>
<text>16 In Lovett v Le Gall (1975) 10 SASR 479 Bray CJ said (at 485):
 
 'If the defendant has suffered no prejudice, as when he was well aware within the limitation period of the plaintiff's claim, or where the excess period of time is small, or where he cannot show that he has lost anything by reason of the delay, it may well be that the court will not find it difficult to come to the conclusion that it is fair and equitable in the circumstances to grant the extension.' 

All of the examples referred to by Bray CJ are examples of prejudice caused specifically by the delay in instituting proceedings.</text>

<tocase>Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/669.html</AustLII>
<text>10 In refusing the leave application Driver FM considered the principles in Phillips v Aust Girls' Choir &amp; Anor [2001] FMCA 109 (' Phillips '), which were approved by this Court in Pham v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 669. There is no dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of those principles; rather the dispute relates to the application by Driver FM of those principles. The paragraphs of his Honour's reasons which relate to the issues in the current appeal are as follows:
 
 'The issues arising in the matter date from around 1998, although they extended through to 2004. Mr Gurran, for the respondent, put to me that the allegations made to HREOC came as a surprise to the respondent and the respondent rather thought that the issues might have been resolved at the termination of the complaint. A fourth relevant consideration is any prejudice in defending the proceedings occasioned by the delay. 
 
 This is a material factor against the grant of an extension, see Doyle at page 287. I regard the issue of prejudice in this case as a significant factor. The complaint to HREOC was against the employer only even though it was a complaint of sexual harassment by reason of the applicant's sexual preference. No complaint having been made against the alleged harassers, no proceeding can now be brought in this court against those persons. The jurisdiction of the court is limited to considering the claim against the harasser's employer and would be based on asserted vicarious liability. For its part, the respondent asserted before HREOC that the allegations of harassment came as a surprise. 
 
 ... 
 The events complained of go back up to seven years. The respondent asserts that the individuals allegedly responsible for the harassment are no longer employed by the respondent and one relevant witness is no longer in Australia. There would be real difficulty facing the respondent in dealing with the allegations in this Court. 
 
 ... The sixth consideration is that the merits of the substantive application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted. 
 
 The material put before HREOC and before the court to this point is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sexual harassment against the persons allegedly responsible for that harassment. That is not the same thing as establishing a prima facie case against the single respondent, the employer, which would depend upon proof of vicarious liability. At this stage and particularly if the only evidence available is that of the applicant I would have to say that the prospects of success of the application against the respondent are uncertain. 
 
 ... 
 ... He [the applicant] could have brought that complaint forward rather earlier than he did. He certainly could and in my view should have pursued his rights in this court more promptly than he did. 
 
 Having regard to the length of the delay in this matter which in my view is significant, the explanation for the delay which in my view is only partially convincing, the prejudice to the respondent if the proceeding continues, which in my view is real and substantial, and the interests of the administration of justice, I have come to the view that the application for an extension of time should be refused and I will so order.'</text>

<text>32 This decision, which was applied in Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd and Ors [1996] HCA 38 ; (1996) 141 ALR 1, makes it clear that at common law, a vicariously liable employer is a joint tortfeasor with the employee against whom the tortious conduct is specifically alleged. Gummow J also observed in Thompson at 22:
 
 'At common law, the liability of joint tortfeasors was said to be joint and several. The plaintiff might sue any one of the tortfeasors separately for the full amount of the loss, or all of them jointly in the same action.'

<tocase>The Koursk [1924] P 140</tocase>
<text>31 This legislative scheme is consistent with common law principles of vicarious liability of employers for tortious conduct of employees. In The Koursk [1924] P 140 Scrutton LJ said at 155:
 
 'The substantial question in the present case is: What is meant by "joint tortfeasors"? and one way of answering it is: "Is the cause of action against them the same?" Certain classes of persons seem clearly to be "joint tortfeasors": The agent who commits a tort within the scope of his employment for his principal, and the principal; the servant who commits a tort in the course of his employment, and his master; two persons who agree on common action, in the course of, and to further which, one of them commits a tort. These seem clearly joint tortfeasors; there is one tort committed by one of them on behalf of, or in concert with, another.'</text>
