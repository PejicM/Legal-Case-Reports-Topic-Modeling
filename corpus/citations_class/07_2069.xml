<text>9 Order 35A rule 3 (2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules is predicated upon an event of default of a kind prescribed in O 35A r 2(2), and contemplates that judgment may be given against a respondent for relief to which "the applicant appears entitled on the statement of claim" and which the Court is satisfied it has "power to grant". In determining the relief, O 35A permits regard to be had to the "face of the statement of claim"; no evidence need be adduced to prove the factual contentions; allegations of fact in the statement of claim are deemed admitted: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 at [42] ; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle [2005] FCA 1239 ; (2005) 146 FCR 400.

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665</tocase>
<text>17 To similar effect, Kiefel J's analysis of the effect of Order 35A, at first instance, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 at [46], appears to assume implicitly that notice of the default judgment proceedings is not necessary unless the relief ultimately being sought is different to that expressed in the statement of claim. Her Honour indicated that the touchstone ought to be fairness in the conduct of litigation, with what is required potentially differing from case to case.

18 I have found that the eighty-third and ninety-second respondents have been served with the originating process and have made no, or no proper, effort, to respond to the Court's processes. No injustice would be occasioned by entering default judgment against them.

21 Older precedent reflects a certain reluctance to grant declaratory relief in the absence of facts found on evidence. Contemporary authority in this court reflects a strong disinclination to follow those earlier decisions. In Dataline , Kiefel J, reviewed much of that earlier authority. Her Honour observed at [57]-[59]: 
 
 The question is whether declarations should be made on deemed admissions, given that there has been no adjudication by the court on the facts and the declarations may give the impression that there has. 
 
 The power to grant declarations (s 21 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)) is unconfined. Order 35A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought. Refusals to make declarations in cases of default are based upon a practice, not a rule of law. The practice is one of long standing and might be seen as derived from views about litigation which pre-date more recent concerns expressed by the courts as to the costs of unnecessary litigation, the management of cases and efficiency overall. Views expressed in older cases may not take account of the increase in the use made of declaratory orders in developing areas of law which may involve matters of public interest (emphasis added). A caution with respect to the use of older authority is made in the White Book Service 2003 to the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (40.20.2).
 
 It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration ... Cases such as this, involving the protection of consumers, are of public interest. Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct constitutes a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness (emphasis added). It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made. This could be overcome by a statement, preceding the declarations, that orders are made 'upon admissions which [the respondent in question] is taken to have made, consequent upon non-compliance with orders of the court'.</text>

<tocase>Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/815.html</AustLII>
<text>22 To similar effect is the judgment of Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 , which was, like Dataline , a case where judgment was given on the basis of deemed admissions under O 35A. Having noted the historical reluctance to base declarations on admissions, his Honour went on to approve and adopt the statements of Kiefel J in Dataline and to exercise his discretion to make declarations on the basis of those deemed admissions, at [13]-[16].

23 Accordingly I propose to make the declarations sought, predicated by a statement that they are made on the basis of deemed admissions.</text>

<tocase>British American Tobacco Australasia Limited v The Person Identified by the Australian Customs Service as "Gory Sabar" [2007] FCA 1417</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/1417.html</AustLII>
<text>15 In British American Tobacco Australasia Limited v The Person Identified by the Australian Customs Service as "Gory Sabar" [2007] FCA 1417 , an application was made for judgment under Order 35A. It appears that this application may have been made by a notice of motion, which was made returnable instanter , and Stone J made orders 'pursuant to Order 19 rule 2(2)(d) that service of this Notice of Motion be dispensed with'. These orders were made despite the fact that neither of the respondents had filed a notice of appearance, or had appeared before the Court at any stage.

16 Stone J went on to find that the respondents were in default under O 35A r 2(2)(a) and 2(2)(c), and proceeded to enter judgment against them, notwithstanding that there was no evidence that they were aware of the hearing seeking default judgment. Notice of that hearing had not been personally served, as Order 19, r 4 would have required, if not dispensed with.</text>

<tocase>Hadgkiss v Aldin [2007] FCA 2068</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2007/2068.html</AustLII>
<text>1 I have earlier delivered judgment in relation to all of the other respondents in these proceedings: Hadgkiss v Aldin [2007] FCA 2068. The reasons for judgment here should be read together with those other reasons for judgment, which provide the relevant background, both factually and legally, to the disposition of the two motions before the Court.

2 The Notices of Motion seek orders pursuant to Order 35A of the Federal Court Rules . The Notices of Motion are in respect of Robert Peter Alivojvodic, Bruce James Allsopp, Brett Harold Andrews and Alex Ian Cromb, respectively the second, third, eighty-third and ninety-second respondents ("the defaulters"). I have had the benefit of very detailed and helpful written submissions from which I have drawn, in compiling these reasons.

3 Orders of the following kind are sought against the defaulters:
 
 
 (a) a declaration that each of the four defaulters engaged in unlawful industrial action in contravention of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (BCII Act) during the period 24 February 2006 to 3 March 2006 inclusive (the Period); 
 (b) an order imposing a pecuniary penalty on each of the four defaulters pursuant to s 49(1)(a) of the BCII Act for engaging in unlawful industrial action during the Period; 
 (c) an order suspending part of the pecuniary penalty in each case pursuant to the general power under s49(1)(c) of the BCII Act; 
 (d) an order pursuant to s 49(5) of the BCII Act that the pecuniary penalties imposed be paid to the Commonwealth;
 and in respect of each of the second and third respondents:
 (e) a declaration that each of the second and third respondents breached the order made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 6 December 2005 known as the New Metro Rail City Project Leighton Kumagai Joint Venture Industrial Action Order December 2005 (s 127 Order) by engaging in industrial action during the Period
 (f) an order imposing pecuniary penalties on the second and third respondents under s 178 of the WR Act for breach of the s 127 Order during the Period;
 (g) an order pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act that the penalty imposed on the second and third respondents be paid to the Commonwealth; 
 

 and in respect of each of the four defaulters:
 
 
 (h) an order that each of the respondents pay the applicant's costs in the sum of $5,000, in respect of costs of the Notice of Motion for default judgment against each of them.

19 I have in these proceedings previously made declarations in relation to the other respondents by reference to Statements of Agreed Facts: Hadgkiss v Aldin [2007] FCA 2068.

20 The defaulters are deemed to have made admissions of the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim. Declaratory relief as against the defaulters in those circumstances is not materially different to the position of the other respondents who are signatories to the Statements of Agreed Facts.

24 I propose that, for the same reasons, the same penalties be imposed on each of the defaulters, as was imposed in relation to the main body of respondents identified in Schedule 2 to my earlier reasons: Hadgkiss v Aldin [2007] FCA 2068.

25 Accordingly I will impose the following penalties: 
 
 
 (a) in respect of each of the defaulters, for the deemed admitted contraventions of s 38 of the BCII Act, a penalty of $9,000 of which $3,000 should be payable within 45 days and the balance of $6,000 suspended for six months, to be paid only if the respondent further contravenes the BCII Act or the WR Act during the period of the suspension; and
 (b) in respect of the second and third respondents for the further deemed admitted breaches of the s 127 order, an additional penalty of $1000 of which $250 should be payable within 45 days and the balance of $750 suspended for six months, upon similar terms.

26 Costs ought follow the event. Although the WR Act is a no costs jurisdiction, there is no such provision in the BCII Act. Agreement was reached with the primary group of respondents who admitted contraventions that there would be no order as to costs. No such agreement has been reached with these respondents. The defaulters have failed to either file an appearance or a defence in the proceedings and the applicant has incurred additional legal costs as a result.</text>
