<tocase>Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle [2005] FCA 1239 ; (2005) 146 FCR 400</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2005/1239.html</AustLII>
<text>However, the Court may only give judgment under O 35A for relief that "the applicant is entitled to on the statement of claim". In Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle [2005] FCA 1239 ; (2005) 146 FCR 400 at [24] , Conti J observed that: 
 Counsel for the Bank submitted that so long as each element of the relevant civil wrong involved is properly and discretely pleaded in the statement of claim, the requirement of subr (2)(c)(i) will be satisfied in principle. In light of the evident objectives of the O 35A procedure in providing for a ready and expedient means to dispose of uncontested litigation, I consider that the Bank's submission duly reflects a correct description of the subr (2)(c)(i) requirement.

Paragraph 11 of the applicants' amended statement of claim dated 13 May 2008 identifies 21 representations made during the negotiations for the joint venture businesses which are said to be misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Act. The prefatory words to [11] read: 
 In the course of the said negotiations in each of the aforesaid cases Hughey and/or Pierce made the following representations and/or caused them to be made and/or were directly or indirectly knowingly involved in such representations being made by [EVP] Holdings and/or [EVP] Recruitment ...

It is unclear from the amended statement of claim to whom each representation in [11] of the pleading is said to have been directed; which representations are alleged to have been made by the first respondent; which misrepresentations are alleged to have been made by the second respondent; and which representations are said to have been made by EVP Holdings or EVP Recruitment for which the respondents may be liable as accessories. In relation to the alleged breaches of s 52 of the Act by the second respondent identified in [11] of the amended statement of claim, the elements of the wrongs cannot be said to have been "properly and discretely pleaded".

In relation to the second respondent, the allegations in [15] of the amended statement of claim meet the requirements of O 35A r 3(2) as discussed in Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle at [24]. Consequently, the power to give relief concerning contraventions of s 52 of the Act is within the Court's powers. Given the second respondent's failure to participate in any way in the proceeding, it is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion to order relief against the second respondent, for breaches of s 52 identified in [15] of the amended statement of claim. The first respondent

The position of the first respondent in relation to the application for default judgment pursuant to O 35A is in contrast to that of the second respondent. The first respondent filed a notice of appearance, a defence to the amended statement of claim and participated in the proceeding through his solicitors until 1 December 2008.</text>

<tocase>Lenjimar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Limited [1990] FCA 520 ; (1990) 27 FCR 388</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1990/520.html</AustLII>
<text>No prior notice of the applicants' intention to seek default judgment was given to the first respondent. No motion was filed with the Court that would have alerted the first respondent to the applicants' intentions. As Wilcox and Gummow JJ observed in Lenjimar Pty Ltd v AGC (Advances) Limited [1990] FCA 520 ; (1990) 27 FCR 388 at 400 in relation to the discretion to dismiss a proceeding for default: 
 it is important that an applicant whose proceeding is under threat of dismissal be made aware of the nature of the alleged default and that there be a finding on that matter. That did not occur in this case. As we have said, the notice of motion failed to state any ground for the proposed order. The appellants were left to divine that from the evidence.

Another relevant factor in determining whether to grant default judgment is whether, despite the default, the party "genuinely wishes the matter to go to trial" (see Lenjimar per Wilcox and Gummow JJ at 396).

On 25 February 2009, the first respondent informed the Court by email that he would not appear at the trial of the proceedings on 2 March 2009. Nevertheless, the first respondent said that: 
 The purpose of this letter is to advise that I do not have the financial resources to attend the hearing or brief counsel. 

 
 However, I maintain my defence and if the matter proceeds in my absence as I expect, I request the Plaintiffs be obliged to prove their case against me to the required burden of proof. 

These statements evince an intention on the part of the first respondent to defend the applicants' claims and for the trial to proceed.

In light of the relief sought by the applicants, the lack of notice to the first respondent of the applicants' intention to seek default judgment and the reasons given by the first respondent for the default, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to give default judgment against the first respondent. It is more appropriate to test whether the evidence supports the claims made by the applicants against the first respondent.</text>

<tocase>Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/65.html</AustLII>
<text>The High Court has noted that s 75B(1)(a) requires that a person said to be involved in a contravention of s 52 is shown to have actual knowledge of the falsity of the representations; see Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666-69 per Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ.

Their Honours went on to say (at 670) that: 
 There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention ... 

 
 a person could only properly be said to be a "party to" a contravention if his participation was in the context of knowledge of the essential facts constituting the particular contravention in question. Whilst it is not a contradiction in terms to speak of a person being "party to" something of which he is unaware, some indication is needed to convey such a meaning. There is nothing in the paragraph itself which would point to any conclusion other than that the words "party to" are sued to refer to a participant in the nature of an accessory. Moreover, the wider context of the whole section leads to the same conclusion. We have already indicated why para. (a) requires knowledge. Paragraph (b), which speaks of inducing a contravention by threats, promises or otherwise, and par. (d) which speaks of conspiring with others to effect a contravention, both clearly require intent based upon knowledge ... 

 
 In our view the proper construction of par. (c) requires a party to a contravention to be an intentional participate, the necessary intent being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention.

The Initial Representations were made in documents provided by the second respondent and others to the first applicant. There is no evidence to show the first respondent prepared or authorised these documents. The Initial Representations were also made during meetings which the first respondent did not attend. There is no evidence to suggest that the first respondent directed or knew what was said at these meetings. No liability on the part of the first respondent under s 75B of the Act arises in relation to these aspects of the Initial Representations.

The first respondent attended a meeting with the first applicant on 1 February 2004. None of the Initial Representations were made during this meeting. The first respondent also attended a meeting of "EVP managers and partners" on 3 April 2004. Initial Representation (a) was made during the April 2004 meeting. The evidence, in particular that of Trudee Maxine Mashlan, shows that EVP Holdings and EVP Recruitment at that time were in what can best be described as a precarious financial position and at worst were a short step from insolvency. The first respondent was aware of these facts which rendered the representation that the group has a successful business model and history misleading and deceptive. Accordingly, the first respondent is liable under s 75B of the Act with respect to representation (a) of the Initial Representations.

Section 82 of the Act requires the first applicant to have suffered loss caused by the first respondent's conduct in order to receive compensation for loss or damage.</text>
