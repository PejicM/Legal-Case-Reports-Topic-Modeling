<tocase>Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1960/50.html</AustLII>
<text>Albeit addressing the terms of s 52(j) of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 (Cth), in Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Windeyer JJ observed (at 350): 
 ... Section 52 (j) makes it necessary that a debtor served with a bankruptcy notice, if he does not comply with its requirements, should satisfy the Court of Bankruptcy that he has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt. The debtor clearly must satisfy the Court that there exists in him a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand. "Cross demand" is the word relied upon here. The appellant cannot satisfy the Court that a cross demand exists by showing no more than that she propounds one and states how she suggests that she can make it out. In Re Duncan; Ex parte Modlin [(1917) 17 SR (NSW) 152 ; 34 WN 49] Street J. said that the debtor need not satisfy the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he will establish his cross action, but only that he has a bona fide claim which he is fairly entitled to litigate. This perhaps is expressed too favourably to the debtor. In Re A Debtor [(1958) 1 Ch 81] Roxburgh J. said : "But not every demand will suffice. A demand made in bad faith would not be good enough. The debtor must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand... But in my opinion a demand must be more than bona fide : the Court must be satisfied that it has a reasonable probability of success" [(1958) 1 Ch 81]. Perhaps the standard may be expressed by saying that the debtor must show that he has a prima facie case, even if then and there he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case before a court trying the issues that are involved in his counter-claim, set-off or cross demand.</text>

<tocase>In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431</tocase>
<text>Presently before the Court is an Application seeking to set aside a Bankruptcy Notice dated 15 January 2007, being Bankruptcy Notice NN 104/07. The Application as filed states that the Bankruptcy Notice was served on the Applicant, Mr Robert Harding, on 17 August 2007. There may be some uncertainty as to whether or not it was served on 17 July 2007 as opposed to 17 August 2007 but, whenever it was served, the Applicant wants it set aside.

The form of Bankruptcy Notice as served attaches the " judgments or orders relied upon by the creditor ", being a judgment entered against the present Applicant by the Respondent in the District Court of New South Wales on 9 November 2006 for the principal sum of $373,772.47. A hand-written alteration to the Bankruptcy Notice records that " within 21 days after 17 August 2007 " Mr Harding was required to either pay the Deputy Commissioner the amount of the debt or make an arrangement to her satisfaction for settlement of the debt. The Application as filed in this Court was filed within 21 days, namely on 5 September 2007.

Section 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provides, in such circumstances, that the time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice is " deemed to have been extended ".

It is understood that the Applicant contends that the Bankruptcy Notice should be set aside because: 
(i) the judgment of the District Court is not a " final judgment " within the meaning of and for the purposes of s 40(1)(g) or s 41 of the Bankruptcy Act ;
 
(ii) the Applicant maintains that he has a " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt " within the meaning of s 40(1)(g) of the 1966 Act; 
 
(iii) that " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " could not have been " set up in the action or proceeding " in which the Deputy Commissioner obtained judgment, namely the District Court proceedings; and 
 
(iv) irrespective of whether there was any such " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " which could have been " set up in the action or proceeding ", there nevertheless remained a discretion in the Court to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice.

The conclusion that has been reached is that the judgment of the District Court is a " final judgment " and that no state of satisfaction can be reached within the meaning of s 41(7) of the 1966 Act that the Applicant has a " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " which has any prospects of success, let alone " a fair chance of success " or one which he is " fairly entitled to litigate ". Nor is it considered that any such " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " could not have been " set up in the action or proceeding " in which the Deputy Commissioner obtained judgment. Finally, there is not considered to be any separate discretion to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice in circumstances where, relevantly, the requirements of s 40(1)(g) have not been met.

The submission as finally advanced on behalf of Mr Harding as to why the judgment of the District Court was not a " final judgment " settled upon a conversation that occurred as between Mr Harding and a solicitor from the Australian Government Solicitor that took place outside the hearing room of the District Court immediately before judgment was entered against him.

Mr Harding maintained that he " tried to talk to the Government's Solicitor prior to going into the room " to tell " her about the Malcolm McClure problem ". Whatever was told to the solicitor was not further expanded upon. The solicitor's response was that " she basically said that it had no relevance ". In re-examination, Mr Harding agreed with the proposition that he " tried to talk to the government solicitor and tell her about the McClure problem and she said it had no relevance ".

But, whatever the meaning to be given to the term, it has to date been held that an action " must be something sounding in money ": Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1980) 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J. See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J. An application seeking declaratory relief as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property has thus been said not to be a " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand ": In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431.

<tocase>James v Abrahams (1981) 51 FLR 16</tocase>
<text>Section 41(1)(a), (2) and (7) of the 1966 Act provides as follows: 
 Bankruptcy notices 
 (1) An Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor:
 (a) a final judgment or final order that:
 (i) is of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and
 (ii) is for an amount of at least $2,000...
 ...
 (2) The notice must be in accordance with the form prescribed by the regulations.
 ...
 (7) Where, before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice, the debtor has applied to the Court for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice on the ground that the debtor has such a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand as is referred to in paragraph 40(1)(g), and the Court has not, before the expiration of that time, determined whether it is satisfied that the debtor has such a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand, that time shall be deemed to have been extended, immediately before its expiration, until and including the day on which the Court determines whether it is so satisfied. 

 
Section 41(7) operates as an " automatic extension of time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice until the court can determine whether it is satisfied by the debtor that the debtor has a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand of the type referred to in s. 40(1)(g) ": cf James v Abrahams (1981) 51 FLR 16 at 21 per Deane and Lockhart JJ.

Section 41(1) provides that a bankruptcy notice may be issued where there is a " final judgment " of the kind described in s 40(1)(g) and, if the bankruptcy notice is to be set aside, s 41(7) requires the Court to be " satisfied that the debtor has ... a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " of the kind set forth in s 40(1)(g).

Numerous decisions of this Court have addressed the requirement that a Court must be " satisfied " that a debtor has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand.

A more modern instance of that which may fall within the statutory phrase is provided by Re Zakrzewski; Zakrzewski v Rodgers [2000] FCA 1187 , 178 ALR 694. An application had there been made for relief under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), that being a provision which allowed the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to declare void or to vary a contract. His Honour Justice Madgwick there relevantly concluded: 
 Measurable in money? 
 [33] A further matter put forward by the applicant was that the debtor was unable to satisfy the Court of the existence of a counter demand or cross-claim, because the claim does not sound in money. In James v Abrahams [1981] FCA 46 ; (1981) 34 ALR 657 , at 664 Deane and Lockhart JJ endorse the view of Latham CJ in Vogwell at 85, in respect of the corresponding provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 , that: 

 
 
 The words of the section are that the debtor must satisfy the court that he has a 'counter-claim ... which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt'. In the first place it is accordingly clear that the counter-claim ... must be something sounding in money. 

 
 
 [34] The creditor argues that the claim before the Commission is not one sounding in money, but is a claim akin to the rectification of a contract. However, the debtor seeks, among other things, an order that the creditor pay to the debtor any money that may be found owing under the arrangement as varied by the Commission and his claim is that the amount Network sued for in the Local Court plus interest at something like commercial rates should be found to be owing. If successful, this would amount to a direct order for money and the Commission clearly has the power to make such an award. The other remedies sought are, in a practical sense, subsidiary to that claim. Therefore, this objection to the application must fail.</text>

<text>More recently, in Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 , 198 ALR 331 , His Honour Justice Lindgren reviewed the authorities and observed: 
 [9] There are authorities suggesting that Glew and Tresidder must satisfy me of the following interrelated and sometimes overlapping matters: 

 that they have a " prima facie case ", even if they do not adduce evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing making out that case ... that they have "a fair chance of success" or are "fairly entitled to litigate" the claim; ... and that they are advancing a "genuine" or "bona fide" claim ...
 
 It may be that the first and second formulations are intended to cover the same ground. In Brink [ Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135, 30 ALR 433] Lockhart J treated (at ALR 438 9; FLR 141) the reference to a " prima facie case " ... as a reference to "a fair chance of success".
 ...
 [11] Plainly, in order to "satisfy" the Court for the purposes of par 40(1)(g), the debtor is not required to prove, as on a final hearing, the asserted entitlement to recover from the creditor. Accordingly, evidence tendered on an application to set aside is to be tested for admissibility, not as if the proceeding were one in which the debtor's claim was being finally determined, but by reference to the question whether the Court should be satisfied that the debtor has a claim deserving to be finally determined. 

 
Reference may also be made to Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [16] [19].

But, whatever the meaning to be given to the term, it has to date been held that an action " must be something sounding in money ": Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1980) 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J. See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J. An application seeking declaratory relief as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property has thus been said not to be a " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand ": In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431. See also: Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [22] [24].

The requirement imposed by s 40(1)(g) that the " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " be one which " could not have [been] set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained " is a requirement which refers to the ability to set up the claim, set-off or demand as a matter of law. A mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): 
 The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 F.L.R. 135, at p. 139, when he said: "The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 A.B.C. 82 , at p. 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 K.B. 726 , at p. 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 A.B.C 53 , at p. 57, especially per Lukin J. where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained .... Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'" 

 
 In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p. 730 Avory J said: 

 
"I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action.
 
 
"I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."
 
 
Whether a claim " could not have [been] set up " is to be determined " by reference to legal considerations " and not " by reference to practicalities ": Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 at 132.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>The ground of review as formulated by Counsel for Mr Harding was that Mr Scott's decision to issue the amended assessments was vitiated by reason of a failure to consider relevant considerations, namely: the conversation with " Laura "; and the acknowledgment on the part of Mr Scott that, had he known of the claimed GST exemption, he would have made further inquiries. 
But neither consideration was a consideration that Mr Scott was bound to take into account or further pursue: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39 41 per Mason J, even assuming that all that Mr Harding had to establish was a ground of review falling short of jurisdictional error.

The rejection of the two suggested " cross-claims " or " cross demands " as formulated on behalf of Mr Harding makes it unnecessary to address the further submission as to whether any such " counter-claim " or " cross demand " " could ... have [been] set up in the action or proceeding " in the District Court.</text>

<tocase>Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 , 198 ALR 331</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2003/373.html</AustLII>
<text>More recently, in Re Glew; Glew v Harrowell [2003] FCA 373 , 198 ALR 331 , His Honour Justice Lindgren reviewed the authorities and observed: 
 [9] There are authorities suggesting that Glew and Tresidder must satisfy me of the following interrelated and sometimes overlapping matters: 

 that they have a " prima facie case ", even if they do not adduce evidence which would be admissible on a final hearing making out that case ... that they have "a fair chance of success" or are "fairly entitled to litigate" the claim; ... and that they are advancing a "genuine" or "bona fide" claim ...
 
 It may be that the first and second formulations are intended to cover the same ground. In Brink [ Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135, 30 ALR 433] Lockhart J treated (at ALR 438 9; FLR 141) the reference to a " prima facie case " ... as a reference to "a fair chance of success".
 ...
 [11] Plainly, in order to "satisfy" the Court for the purposes of par 40(1)(g), the debtor is not required to prove, as on a final hearing, the asserted entitlement to recover from the creditor. Accordingly, evidence tendered on an application to set aside is to be tested for admissibility, not as if the proceeding were one in which the debtor's claim was being finally determined, but by reference to the question whether the Court should be satisfied that the debtor has a claim deserving to be finally determined.

<text>But, whatever the meaning to be given to the term, it has to date been held that an action " must be something sounding in money ": Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1980) 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J. See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J.

The requirement imposed by s 40(1)(g) that the " counter-claim, set-off or cross demand " be one which " could not have [been] set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained " is a requirement which refers to the ability to set up the claim, set-off or demand as a matter of law.

Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): 
 The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd.

Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'" 

 
 In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p. 730 Avory J said: 

 
"I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2000/1187.html</AustLII>
<text>A more modern instance of that which may fall within the statutory phrase is provided by Re Zakrzewski; Zakrzewski v Rodgers [2000] FCA 1187 , 178 ALR 694. An application had there been made for relief under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), that being a provision which allowed the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to declare void or to vary a contract. His Honour Justice Madgwick there relevantly concluded: 
 Measurable in money? 
 [33] A further matter put forward by the applicant was that the debtor was unable to satisfy the Court of the existence of a counter demand or cross-claim, because the claim does not sound in money. In James v Abrahams [1981] FCA 46 ; (1981) 34 ALR 657 , at 664 Deane and Lockhart JJ endorse the view of Latham CJ in Vogwell at 85, in respect of the corresponding provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 , that: 

 
 
 The words of the section are that the debtor must satisfy the court that he has a 'counter-claim ... which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt'. In the first place it is accordingly clear that the counter-claim ... must be something sounding in money. 

 
 
 [34] The creditor argues that the claim before the Commission is not one sounding in money, but is a claim akin to the rectification of a contract. However, the debtor seeks, among other things, an order that the creditor pay to the debtor any money that may be found owing under the arrangement as varied by the Commission and his claim is that the amount Network sued for in the Local Court plus interest at something like commercial rates should be found to be owing. If successful, this would amount to a direct order for money and the Commission clearly has the power to make such an award. The other remedies sought are, in a practical sense, subsidiary to that claim. Therefore, this objection to the application must fail.</text>

<tocase>SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 , 232 CLR 189</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/35.html</AustLII>
<text>The submission on behalf of Mr Harding was that this conversation brought him within SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 , 232 CLR 189.

In SZFDE the applicants had there not attended a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal. They had failed to respond to an invitation to do so on the advice of a person they had retained, a Mr Hussain. That person had wrongly represented himself to be a solicitor and a migration agent. The fraud of the agent, it was concluded, had the effect that the decision of the Tribunal was no decision at all. Although the Tribunal was unaware of the fraud of the agent, the result of his fraud was that the applicants had been denied such natural justice as was afforded by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).

The submission advanced on behalf of Mr Harding was understood to be that, just as the conduct of Mr Hussain had deprived the applicants in SZFDE of the opportunity to be heard before the Refugee Review Tribunal, the conduct of the solicitor had deprived Mr Harding of his opportunity to be heard before the District Court. The submission was that Mr Harding was " lied to or at least misled by the Respondent's legal representative about the utility of his cross claim before Kearns DCJ ".

The submission is to be rejected.

Whether or not Mr Harding should have applied to the District Court to have the judgment set aside, as was contended by the Deputy Commissioner, may be left to one side. Also left to one side is whether the approach pursued in SZFDE may be extended so as to potentially vitiate proceedings before a court as opposed to an administrative tribunal.

The submission is to be rejected upon the more fundamental basis that the conduct of the solicitor is in no way comparable to that of Mr Hussain. It is not considered that Mr Harding was " lied to or at least misled ". The extent of the detail provided by Mr Harding to the solicitor is unknown. But even if the solicitor had been told such detail as to Mr McClure's conduct as was explained in the present proceeding, the solicitor's statement that that conduct " had no relevance " was accurate if the solicitor was directing attention to the issues then before the District Court. Mr Harding certainly had not been " lied to ". On the basis of the statement of claim as filed in the District Court and upon the basis of the defence as filed, the conduct of Mr McClure was irrelevant to the issues then before that Court. Nor is it considered that Mr Harding was " misled ". It was no part of the duty of the solicitor then appearing for the Deputy Commissioner to give advice to the then defendant, Mr Harding, as to either the prospect of a claim being made against the Commonwealth or even advice confined to the prudence of Mr Harding getting independent legal advice.

The Australian Government Solicitor is established pursuant to s 55J of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). That Act further provides for the issue by the Attorney-General of Legal Services Directions : s 55ZF. Directions have in fact been issued requiring the Commonwealth and its legal representatives to act as a " model litigant ". No particular provision of the Directions was relied upon by the Applicant. But it is not considered that the standards of a " model litigant " extend to imposing any general duty to give advice to an opponent as to the prospect of resisting a claim being advanced by the Commonwealth, or even a duty to suggest that independent advice be obtained. Whether or not the duty of a " model litigant " may in some particular circumstances embrace such a duty need not be resolved. Considerable caution should be exercised before imposing any such duty upon solicitors within the Australian Government Solicitor. Confined to the circumstances of the present proceeding, there was scant evidence as to what the solicitor had in fact been told by Mr Harding. Even assuming that Mr Harding had told the solicitor the entirety of his dealings with Mr McClure and his subsequent conversations with officers of the Australian Taxation Office, it is not considered, even on that assumption, that there was any requirement upon the solicitor to proffer advice.

It is not considered that Mr Harding was deprived of any opportunity to have his case resolved by the District Court. The conduct of the solicitor can in no way be equated with the conduct of Mr Hussain in SZFDE .

The submission that Mr Harding had a " counter-claim " or " cross demand " by reason of misrepresentation is also to be rejected.

The " counter-claim " or " cross demand " relied upon by Mr Harding was said to be either: a claim for " misrepresentation ", namely a misrepresentation that Mr Harding had the benefit of a GST exemption issued by the Australian Taxation Office; or an action in the nature of judicial review to have the assessments or amended assessments upon which the District Court proceeded to enter judgment set aside and declared void. 
Each limb to the submission must be rejected.</text>

<text>It is not considered that any state of satisfaction could possibly be reached that Mr Harding has any counter-claim, set-off or cross demand which it is " just " to be resolved before allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to continue: Dekkan v Evans [2008] FCA 1004 at [54] per Jacobson J; Dekkan v Macquarie Leasing Pty Ltd (No 2 ) [2008] FCA 1431 per Buchanan J; Re Cox (1934) 7 ABC 98. The task to be undertaken was formulated in Guss v Johnstone [2000] HCA 26 , 171 ALR 598 by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ as follows: 
 [39] In Vogwell v Vogwell [(1939) 11 ABC 83] , Latham CJ said, in relation to a corresponding provision: 

 
"[T]he authorities show that the matter to which the court looks is this, &#8212; whether it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue; in other words, whether it is a claim which it is proper and reasonable to litigate."
 
 
 [40] The state of satisfaction referred to in s 40(1)(g), and s 41(7), involves weighing up considerations as to the legal and factual merit of the claim relied upon by the debtor, and the justice of allowing the bankruptcy proceedings to go ahead or requiring them to await the determination of the claim. 

 
It is, with respect, not even possible to be satisfied that Mr Harding has a " shadowy " claim that could be litigated: cf Re Rivett; Ex parte Edward Fay Ltd (1932) 5 ABC 182 at 188.

A more modern instance of that which may fall within the statutory phrase is provided by Re Zakrzewski; Zakrzewski v Rodgers [2000] FCA 1187 , 178 ALR 694. An application had there been made for relief under s 106 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW), that being a provision which allowed the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to declare void or to vary a contract. His Honour Justice Madgwick there relevantly concluded: 
 Measurable in money? 
 [33] A further matter put forward by the applicant was that the debtor was unable to satisfy the Court of the existence of a counter demand or cross-claim, because the claim does not sound in money. In James v Abrahams [1981] FCA 46 ; (1981) 34 ALR 657 , at 664 Deane and Lockhart JJ endorse the view of Latham CJ in Vogwell at 85, in respect of the corresponding provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1924 , that: 

 
 
 The words of the section are that the debtor must satisfy the court that he has a 'counter-claim ... which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt'. In the first place it is accordingly clear that the counter-claim ... must be something sounding in money. 

 
 
 [34] The creditor argues that the claim before the Commission is not one sounding in money, but is a claim akin to the rectification of a contract. However, the debtor seeks, among other things, an order that the creditor pay to the debtor any money that may be found owing under the arrangement as varied by the Commission and his claim is that the amount Network sued for in the Local Court plus interest at something like commercial rates should be found to be owing. If successful, this would amount to a direct order for money and the Commission clearly has the power to make such an award. The other remedies sought are, in a practical sense, subsidiary to that claim. Therefore, this objection to the application must fail.

Reliance was sought to be placed on the observation of Latham CJ in Vogwell v Vogwell (1939) 11 ABC 83 at 85 that a Court should consider " whether it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue ". Reliance cannot be placed upon those observations of the Chief Justice in isolation. The balance of the passage is as follows: 
 The words of the section are that the debtor must satisfy the court that he has "a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt". In the first place it is accordingly clear that the counter-claim, set-off or cross demand must be something sounding in money. It is also obvious that the section does not apply or refer to an already established right. If there were an already established set-off, for example, the judgment debt would have been reduced pro tanto and if there had been a counter-claim or cross demand which had already been applied as against the amount of the judgment the position would have been entirely different. What the section contemplates is a claim to the enforcement of a right sounding in money. It must be a real claim ; it is insufficient that the debtor believes that he has a claim, and the authorities show that the matter to which the court looks is this, &#8212; whether it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue ; in other words, whether it is a claim which it is proper and reasonable to litigate. 

 
Read in its entirety, it is clear that the Chief Justice was not propounding any proposition that a Court could set aside a bankruptcy notice simply because it considered it " just " to do so.

The Application is to be dismissed.

It should, perhaps, be further noted that at one stage a Schedule of Questions of Fact and/or of Mixed Law and Fact was filed on behalf of the Applicant. That Schedule was filed in support of the application as previously made for the present proceeding to be heard with a jury. Such facts as did require resolution in the present proceeding were within a limited compass and could readily be resolved by a judge sitting alone.</text>
