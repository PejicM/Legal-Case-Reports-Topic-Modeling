<text>The nature of a certified agreement and the means of enforcement, together with the role of this Court conferred by s 413A, has been the subject of analysis by the Full Court in ACTEW Corporation Ltd v Pangallo [2002] FCAFC 325 , 127 FCR 1. Whitlam and Gyles JJ there observed: 
 
 [34] The argument that the remedies provided by the Act are inadequate to ensure compliance with a certified agreement and that there should be means for enforcing obligations beyond those specifically provided by this statute is contrary to the history of enforcement of industrial obligations, as explained by Madgwick J in Wattyl. The Act has, for some time, reflected the policy of not specifically enforcing industrial obligations, except insofar as express remedies are provided. In any event, the point loses much of its force when consideration is given to ss 131, 170LT and 170LW. This is not the occasion to explore all of the ramifications of those provisions or to decide what role, if any, the courts have to play in enforcement of such provisions. It is sufficient to say that there is no complaint about the operation of the dispute settling mechanism in this case -- it is the result about which complaint is made. There is no need to call in aid the power of a court to make a declaration of right as to the construction of the agreement as that role is expressly dealt with by s 413A of the Act. 
 

 
 
 [35] ... [W]e accept the submission that the Act has created the concept of a certified agreement, has given it statutory force and has also regulated the means by which it may be construed and enforced in accordance with the principle in Josephson v Walker . In our opinion, the statute excludes a court of general jurisdiction of a State or Territory from the field, except insofar as it is expressly included, and is inconsistent with the ability of such a court to make a binding declaration of right as to the effect of a certified agreement. ...

<text>Clause 12 of the present Agreement is , like clauses in other industrial instruments, to be " understood in the light of its industrial context and purpose ": Amcor Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2005] HCA 10 at [2] , [2005] HCA 10 ; 222 CLR 241 at 246 per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J. Such a provision is to " be read in context " and having regard to " the text and operation of the Agreement both as a whole and by reference to other particular provisions made by it ...": [2005] HCA 10 at [30] , 222 CLR at 253 per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ.

In the context of an industrial award, Madgwick J (sitting as a judge of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia) in Kucks v CSR Ltd (1996) 66 IR 182 observed at 184: 
 
 It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced. The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon. Thus, for example, it is justifiable to read the award to give effect to its evident purposes, having regard to such context, despite mere inconsistencies or infelicities of expression which might tend to some other reading. And meanings which avoid inconvenience or injustice may reasonably be strained for. For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand. 
 

 
 
 But the task remains one of interpreting a document produced by another or others. A court is not free to give effect to some anteriorly derived notion of what would be fair or just, regardless of what has been written into the award. ...

<tocase>Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 , 156 FCR 380</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/187.html</AustLII>
<text>It was appropriate that the challenge to jurisdiction be raised by a Notice of Contention as envisaged by Order 52 r 22(3) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). That Rule provides as follows: 
 
 If the respondent proposes to contend that the judgment should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the court below, but does not seek a discharge or variation of any part of the judgment, the respondent need not file a notice of cross-appeal, but must: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) file a notice of the respondent's contention within 21 days after the service upon the respondent of the notice of appeal, or within such further time as the Court or a Judge fixes; and 
 (aa) serve a copy of the notice on the appellant; and 
 (b) give notice to the appellant of the record of evidence or documents before the court below relating to the contention, for inclusion in the appellant's draft index of appeal papers; and 
 (c) at the appointment to settle the appeal papers, request the Registrar to include the record of evidence or documents in the appeal papers. 
 
 

 
Consistent with that rule, the Respondent wished to have the decision of the Chief Industrial Magistrate " affirmed " and did not seek a " discharge or variation " of such part of the judgment under appeal as embraced the construction of clause 12 which it successfully advanced at first instance. As noted by Branson J in Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 187 , 156 FCR 380 (French J, as His Honour then was, agreeing):
 
 
 [76] As the terms of O 52 r 22(3) make clear, the purpose of a notice of contention is to place the appellant and the Court on notice that the respondent contends that the judgment below (ie the orders made below) can be supported on grounds other than those which the court below relied on when pronouncing the judgment. That is, that even if a ground of appeal is made out, it may not lead to the order the subject of the appeal being set aside or varied. The filing of a notice of contention is not a mechanism for challenging any order made below or for challenging the failure of the court below to make an order to which a party below claimed to be entitled.

The importance of resolving the Notice of Contention was considerably reduced, however, when Senior Counsel on behalf of the Respondent accepted that the Appellant could by one means or another have the question as to the proper construction of the Agreements now resolved by this Court. Whether that means was by way of an application being made under the provision identified by Senior Counsel as s 413A of the 1996 Act and returnable instanter , or by treating the present Notice of Appeal as such an application, it was properly accepted by Senior Counsel were questions which could be left to one side. However the question as to the jurisdiction of Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court was resolved, both the Appellant and the Respondent wanted the Court to go on and resolve the construction of the Agreements .

But Senior Counsel also maintained that the question as to jurisdiction of the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court remained an important question which needed to be addressed and resolved.</text>

<tocase>Master Builders' Association of Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders' Labourers' Federation [1981] FCA 49 ; (1981) 54 FLR 358</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1981/49.html</AustLII>
<text>Notwithstanding considerable reservation, it is considered that those claims could best be characterised as claims for the underpayment of wages and for penalties &#8212; rather than as applications impermissibly seeking an interpretation of a certified agreement which only this Court can give: cf Master Builders' Association of Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees' and Builders' Labourers' Federation [1981] FCA 49 ; (1981) 54 FLR 358 at 360 to 361 per Evatt and Northrop JJ.

As emphasised by Senior Counsel for the Respondent, cause for reservation may be founded upon the very manner in which the case was opened. The Chief Industrial Magistrate asked at the outset: 
 
 Are you going to open and tell me what this is about? 
 

 
After some preliminary matters were mentioned, Counsel on behalf of the now Appellant answered as follows:
 
 
 Your Honour the matter before the court is one of an interpretation of a certified agreement ... 
 

 
He concluded his brief opening with these words:
 
 
 So your Honour the matter before you is one of the interpretation for correct construction of an industrial instrument being a certified agreement ... 
 

 
There was only passing reference in the opening to any claim for wages and no reference to penalties.

Notwithstanding the manner in which the case may have been opened, however, the applications as filed were expressed in terms of claims for underpayment of wages and penalties. Neither the scarcity of the evidence in support of those claims, nor the manner in which the claims were presented, is sufficient to deny to those claims the character of proceedings which properly fell within the jurisdiction of the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court. The scarcity of the evidence presented may well have provided a sufficient basis upon which those claims could possibly have been rejected. Had a different conclusion been reached by the Industrial Magistrate as to the construction of clause 12, it may have been appropriate to extend a further opportunity to the claimant employees to remedy the deficiency in the existing evidence. So much was recognised by the Chief Industrial Magistrate in his reasons for decision. But it was the construction of clause 12 which ultimately proved fatal to the claims being advanced. A further opportunity to supplement the deficiency in the evidence became unnecessary by reason of that construction.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/51.html</AustLII>
<text>Adopting this approach, in United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2006] FCAFC 84 , 152 FCR 18 it was concluded that the term " appeal " as used in a certified agreement did not include a claim for prerogative relief. Nicholson, Jacobson and Lander JJ there reasoned that " (T)he framers could hardly have had in mind that disputes under an agreement which includes matters such as worker safety could be delayed for many years while appeal steps in the Commission are pursued and then followed up by a claim for constitutional writs in the High Court ": at [64]. Their Honours previously observed at [53] that " the language of the instrument must be construed in its context, having regard to the subject matter and the wording of the entire agreement ...". Reference was there made by the Full Court to the judgment of Burchett J in Short v F W Hercus Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 51 ; (1993) 40 FCR 511 at 518. His Honour was there considering a clause in a Metal Industry Award and observed (references omitted): 
 
 ... The context of an expression may thus be much more than the words that are its immediate neighbours. Context may extend to the entire document of which it is a part, or to other documents with which there is an association. Context may also include, in some cases, ideas that gave rise to an expression in a document from which it has been taken. When the expression was transplanted, it may have brought with it some of the soil in which it once grew, retaining a special strength and colour in its new environment. There is no inherent necessity to read it as uprooted and stripped of every trace of its former significance, standing bare in alien ground. True, sometimes it does stand as if alone. But that should not be just assumed, in the case of an expression with a known source, without looking at its creation, understanding its original meaning, and then seeing how it is now used. Very frequently, perhaps most often, the immediate context is the clearest guide, but the court should not deny itself all other guidance in those cases where it can be seen that more is needed. In literature, Milton and Joyce could not be read in ignorance of the source of their language, nor should a legal document, including an award, be so read. 
 

 
 
 That much is fairly clear. Where there is seen to be a difficulty, the court can often go to the history of the matter. ... Is the court then forbidden to look past the document itself that is before it? The respondent says the instant award is clear, and we must shut our eyes to what went before. I think there are two answers to this argument. On the one hand, I do not accept that the award is clear on its face. The fact that I have given it a meaning by a process of construction (as it happens, contrary to the respondent's contention) cannot disguise the possibility of understanding the language, as the learned judge understood it, differently. ... That is certainly sufficient to justify a reference to its source. Where the circumstances allow the court to conclude that a clause in an award is the product of a history, out of which it grew to be adopted in its present form, only a kind of wilful judicial blindness could lead the court to deny itself the light of that history, and to prefer to peer unaided at some obscurity in the language. ...</text>

<text>In the context of an industrial award, Madgwick J (sitting as a judge of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia) in Kucks v CSR Ltd (1996) 66 IR 182 observed at 184: 
 
 It is trite that narrow or pedantic approaches to the interpretation of an award are misplaced. The search is for the meaning intended by the framer(s) of the document, bearing in mind that such framer(s) were likely of a practical bent of mind: they may well have been more concerned with expressing an intention in ways likely to have been understood in the context of the relevant industry and industrial relations environment than with legal niceties or jargon. Thus, for example, it is justifiable to read the award to give effect to its evident purposes, having regard to such context, despite mere inconsistencies or infelicities of expression which might tend to some other reading. And meanings which avoid inconvenience or injustice may reasonably be strained for. For reasons such as these, expressions which have been held in the case of other instruments to have been used to mean particular things may sensibly and properly be held to mean something else in the document at hand.

<tocase>United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2006] FCAFC 84 , 152 FCR 18</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/84.html</AustLII>
<text>Adopting this approach, in United Firefighters' Union of Australia v Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board [2006] FCAFC 84 , 152 FCR 18 it was concluded that the term " appeal " as used in a certified agreement did not include a claim for prerogative relief. Nicholson, Jacobson and Lander JJ there reasoned that " (T)he framers could hardly have had in mind that disputes under an agreement which includes matters such as worker safety could be delayed for many years while appeal steps in the Commission are pursued and then followed up by a claim for constitutional writs in the High Court ": at [64]. Their Honours previously observed at [53] that " the language of the instrument must be construed in its context, having regard to the subject matter and the wording of the entire agreement ...". Reference was there made by the Full Court to the judgment of Burchett J in Short v F W Hercus Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 51 ; (1993) 40 FCR 511 at 518. His Honour was there considering a clause in a Metal Industry Award and observed (references omitted): 
 
 ... The context of an expression may thus be much more than the words that are its immediate neighbours. Context may extend to the entire document of which it is a part, or to other documents with which there is an association. Context may also include, in some cases, ideas that gave rise to an expression in a document from which it has been taken. When the expression was transplanted, it may have brought with it some of the soil in which it once grew, retaining a special strength and colour in its new environment. There is no inherent necessity to read it as uprooted and stripped of every trace of its former significance, standing bare in alien ground. True, sometimes it does stand as if alone. But that should not be just assumed, in the case of an expression with a known source, without looking at its creation, understanding its original meaning, and then seeing how it is now used. Very frequently, perhaps most often, the immediate context is the clearest guide, but the court should not deny itself all other guidance in those cases where it can be seen that more is needed. In literature, Milton and Joyce could not be read in ignorance of the source of their language, nor should a legal document, including an award, be so read. 
 

 
 
 That much is fairly clear. Where there is seen to be a difficulty, the court can often go to the history of the matter. ... Is the court then forbidden to look past the document itself that is before it? The respondent says the instant award is clear, and we must shut our eyes to what went before. I think there are two answers to this argument. On the one hand, I do not accept that the award is clear on its face. The fact that I have given it a meaning by a process of construction (as it happens, contrary to the respondent's contention) cannot disguise the possibility of understanding the language, as the learned judge understood it, differently. ... That is certainly sufficient to justify a reference to its source. Where the circumstances allow the court to conclude that a clause in an award is the product of a history, out of which it grew to be adopted in its present form, only a kind of wilful judicial blindness could lead the court to deny itself the light of that history, and to prefer to peer unaided at some obscurity in the language. ...</text>

<tocase>Western Newspapers Pty Limited v Warren (1994) 56 IR 340</tocase>
<text>In addition to the jurisdiction conferred by s 382 of the 1966 Act, s 177A of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the 1996 Act"), as in force at the relevant period, defined a " court of competent jurisdiction " as including a magistrate's court and in Western Newspapers Pty Limited v Warren (1994) 56 IR 340 at 346 it was concluded that the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court of New South Wales was a court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of s 178. Section 178 conferred jurisdiction to impose a penalty. As noted by Moore J in Warren , the source of the Commonwealth Parliament's power to confer federal jurisdiction on a state court is to be found in s 77(iii) of the Constitution : (1994) 56 IR at 345.

The present Appeal originated on 22 February 2006 when two proceedings were commenced in the Chief Industrial Magistrate's Court. In one proceeding the Applicant Union sought ( inter alia ) an order that $2,164.80 plus interest be paid to a member of the Union, Mr Colin Haidle, increasing to a claim for $4,649.37 plus interest at trial. In the second proceeding the Applicant Union sought an order that $10,170.45 plus interest be paid to another union member, Mr John Hodge, increasing to a claim for $16,915.25 plus interest at trial. In addition, in both proceedings the imposition of a penalty was sought.

The entitlement to be paid those monies depended upon the construction of a series of three agreements made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth). The first of these agreements was the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Mine Certified Agreement 1998 ; the second being the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Certified Agreement 2001 2002 ; and the current agreement being the Ulan Coal Mines Ltd Underground Certified Agreement 2003 . The provision of each agreement upon which the claimed entitlement to monies was founded, clause 12, was in relevantly identical terms. That clause provided for payment and rates of payment on weekends and holidays.</text>
