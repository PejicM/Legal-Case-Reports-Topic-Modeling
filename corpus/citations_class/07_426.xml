<text>4 The Minister's decision is a "privative clause decision" within the meaning of s 474 of the Act. This Court cannot set it aside except for jurisdictional error: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506-508 and 511 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ.

5 For the reasons I am about to state, I would dismiss this application.

6 Mr Yalniz, who is in his mid forties, is a citizen of Turkey. He arrived in Australia on 18 July 1984. He has been married three times and has nine children from two of these marriages.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lorenzo [2005] FCAFC 13</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2005/13.html</AustLII>
<text>18 It is unnecessary in this case to consider whether or not the Minister was bound to take into account the best interests of Mr Yalniz's children in deciding to cancel his visa. For present purposes, I am prepared to assume that, if the Minister failed to have regard to the interests of his children, her decision would have been affected by jurisdictional error. This assumption may rest on any one of a number of bases: see, for example, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Lorenzo [2005] FCAFC 13 at [57] per Wilcox, Sackville and Finn JJ. The difficulty faced by the applicant is in showing that the Minister failed to have regard the best interests of the children as a primary consideration in a manner the law accepts.</text>

<tocase>Le v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 84 ALD 17</tocase>
<text>19 Although not bound to apply Direction 21, being a direction under s 499(1) of the Act (see Le v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 84 ALD 17 at 28 per Jacobson and Bennett JJ), the Minister specifically stated, in her reasons for decision, that she "proceeded in accordance" with the Direction. Direction 21 relates to the application of the character test and the exercise of discretion in determining whether or not to cancel a visa. Direction 21 provides that a decision-maker should have regard to three "primary considerations", one of which is "in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children".

20 In conformity with the Direction, the Minister stated, in her reasons, that:
 
 I gave primary consideration to the best interests of any children who are less than 18 years of age and with whom Mr YALNIZ is in a parental or other close relationship. 
 
 Mr YALNIZ has four children from his second marriage and five children from his third marriage, all of whom are under the age of 18 years. 
 
 Mr YALNIZ was imprisoned in January 2002 and I noted that he has not had contact with any of his children since his incarceration. I noted Ms Sowerine's statement that Mr YALNIZ has desperately wanted to contact his children and that he was advised by his solicitor that he should wait until he is released from prison before commencing proceedings in the Family Court. There is no evidence of any current Parenting Order in force imposing parental responsibilities on Mr YALNIZ for any of his nine children. 
 
 On balance the information relevant to this consideration weighed against cancelling Mr YALNIZ's visa. I gave this consideration considerable weight.

21 In her reasons, the Minister also stated she had "carefully assessed all of the information set out in the Issues Paper". Indeed, the Minister's signature was endorsed at the conclusion of this document. In relation to the best interests of Mr Yalniz's children, the Issues Paper referred to art 3.1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to par 2.16 of Direction 21, which set out factors to be taken into account when considering a child's best interests. The Issues Paper referred to the ages of Mr Yalniz's children and to the fact that there was "no indication that the children would accompany Mr Yalniz if his visa were cancelled". The Issues Paper also referred to his incarceration, his desire to see his children and his solicitor's advice. The Issues Paper emphasized Mr Yalniz's feelings for his children and referred to the submissions made by Victoria Legal Aid and the declaration made by Mr Yalniz's uncle. Finally, on this topic, it stated:
 
 Should Mr Yalniz's children accompany him to Turkey, it is open for you to find that the standards of education and health care in Turkey are not comparable to those available in Australia. It is open for you to find that should Mr Yalniz's children leave Australia, they may be separated from their mothers and would face a period of readjustment as they become accustomed to a new school and attempt to establish new social networks. It is open for you to find that it would be in the best interests of the children to remain in Australia and not to experience the disruptions involved in relocating to Turkey. 
 
 It is reasonable to accept that Mr Yalniz's children would be affected by a decision under s. 501(2) and that it remains in each child's best interests that Mr Yalniz not be removed from Australia. In the event of his removal, the children would be deprived of a continuing relationship with their father.</text>

<text>23 There was no need in this case for the Minister to go through a list of factors that might have informed her conclusion with regard to Mr Yalniz's children. Sometimes this may be appropriate but in other cases it may be sufficient, as in this case, to adopt an approach that assumes the relevant factors point to one conclusion that it will be in the best interests of children to remain with their parents: compare Sebastian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 31 at [15] per Tamberlin, Kiefel and Emmett JJ; Kaur v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 70 at [20] - [22] per Nicholson, Jacobson and Lander JJ; and Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 221 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ and 238 per Kirby J. The fact that she did not make a list of factors (e.g., hardship and children's development) does not in this case make good the proposition that she did not direct her mind to the matters that arose on the information before her. Having regard to what I have already stated, I think it plain enough that she discharged her obligation fully in this regard.</text>

<text>24 There was in this case no obligation to make further inquiries concerning the children. There was nothing to create such an obligation: compare Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314 per Tamberlin, Sackville and Stone JJ; and Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] per Marshall, Mansfield and Siopis JJ. Although the information about the best interests of the children was limited, it made out Mr Yalniz's case, by explaining his relationship with them and the loss they would suffer if deported. Mr Yalniz might have provided more detailed information had he wished, but he did not do so. As I have said, the Minister plainly took account of the information that she had been given.</text>
