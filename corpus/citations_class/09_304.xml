<tocase>ACCC v C.G. Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 51</tocase>
<text>Mr Rose and Riva must establish that they suffered a special disability or were placed in some special situation of disadvantage, which rendered them unable to make a worthwhile judgment as to what was in their own best interests and that the Lenders knowingly took advantage of that disability or disadvantage. No special disability or special disadvantage has been established in the present instance. A person will not be in a position of special disadvantage or disability as a result of inequality of bargaining power. Many, if not most, contracts are made between parties of unequal bargaining power and good conscience does not require parties to contractual negotiations to forfeit their advantages, or neglect their own interests ( ACCC v C.G. Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 214 CLR 51 at [11]). Unconscientious exploitation of another's inability or diminished ability to conserve his or her own interests is not to be confused with taking advantage of a superior bargaining position ( ACCC v C.G. Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd at [14]).

Notwithstanding that Riva, Moruben and Quadwest were all in default, that Moruben had no contractual entitlement to the discharge of the mortgages over the Moruben Road property in the absence of tender of all monies owing under the Moruben Mezzanine Agreement and had no contractual entitlement to redemption of the Moruben Equity Mortgage because the amount of the Net Project Profit could not be calculated, Mr Rose was seeking indulgences from the Lenders that would permit him to obtain an extension of the facilities granted to Riva. He had no contractual entitlement to such an extension and therefore had to make concessions to the Lenders to obtain such a concession. One of the terms that the Lenders dictated was the provision of personal guarantees by him. While the situation may have been difficult for Mr Rose, and the Quadrant Group generally, it is not a situation that justifies a conclusion that the Lenders brought undue pressure or duress to bear on Mr Rose or Riva or that their conduct was in any way unconscionable.

As I have said, the Lenders contend that relief under the Contracts Review Act is precluded by the operation of s 6(2). Clearly enough, the Loan Agreement Variation Deeds entered into by Riva were entered into in the course of the business carried on by Riva, namely, the development of the Chevron Island Property. However, Mr Rose was not personally engaged in the development of the Moruben Road Property, the Chevron Island Property or the Adelaide Terrace Property. To the extent that those developments involved carrying on businesses, those businesses were carried on by Moruben, Riva and Quadwest respectively.</text>

<tocase>Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315</tocase>
<text>Where one party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, it is incumbent upon the first party to establish, on the balance of probabilities, precisely what the conduct was that is alleged to be misleading. In addition, the precise circumstances that rendered the conduct misleading must be established. Where the conduct is the making of oral representations, the words spoken must be proved with a degree of precision that enables the Court to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the words spoken were misleading in the circumstances established. The question of whether spoken words were misleading may, although not necessarily, depend upon what may have been relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of a particular word, phrase or grammatical construction or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase or condition (see, for example, Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319).

There is no contemporaneous documentary evidence of the representations alleged by Mr Rose to have been made by Mr Wilson. The sole evidence of the alleged representations is oral evidence given by Mr Rose. To the extent that that evidence is inconsistent with Mr Bevan's evidence, I reject it. I consider that the evidence of the conversation given by Mr Wilson indicates what happened. Accordingly, I shall recount only that version.

Mr Wilson accepted that he had a conversation with Mr Rose in March 2006 concerning the sale of the unsold units in the Chevron Island Property. Mr Rose broached the subject by saying that, in his opinion, the Gold Coast market was deteriorating and that he felt an inline sale would be beneficial to the Chevron Island Project. He said that he had a potential inline buyer that would see the " mezzanine deck " portion of the project receive a full return of principal and interest; however, the equity portion of the loan would only receive the principal plus an 8% return, which would leave a 2% shortfall, and there would be no profit share.</text>
