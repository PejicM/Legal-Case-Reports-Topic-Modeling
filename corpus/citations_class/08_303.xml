<text>1 On 21 February 2008 I delivered reasons for judgment in relation to an application, made by a Court appointed receiver, for orders:
 
&#8226; that certain funds be added to the funds comprehended by the receivership;
 
&#8226; extending the period of the receiver's appointment;
 
&#8226; extending the time within which the receiver was required to prepare and file a report;
 
&#8226; requiring the respondent to file an affidavit of documents;
 
&#8226; requiring the respondent to provide copies of documents to the receiver on request; and
 
&#8226; requiring the respondent to attend before the receiver for oral examination.
 
See Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 12) [2008] FCA 101.

2 I made the orders sought save for the order requiring attendance for oral examination. I did not make that order because I was informed that an oral examination had taken place. I reserved the right of the receiver to apply for an order requiring a further oral examination.

3 I reserved the question of costs. As directed each party has filed and served written submissions on what costs orders should be made. I have now considered those submissions.</text>
