<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 174 ALR 688</tocase>
<text>9 The provisions of s 601AH(2) have the effect, relevant to this case, that the Court must be satisfied that the ACCC is a person aggrieved by the deregistration and that it is just that the registration be reinstated. The application of those statutory requirements was considered by Austin J in similar circumstances in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 174 ALR 688. In that case the ACCC submitted that it had a public duty to improve competition and efficiency in markets and to foster a fair and competitive operating environment for businesses. One of the strategies used to achieve that objective is litigation in cases of serious breaches of the TP Act. The ACCC considered, in that case, that the conduct which it alleged was a serious example of price fixing and market sharing and that it had a duty in the public interest to reinstate and sue the perpetrator of some of that conduct. The former officers of the company then before the Court accepted that the ACCC had standing to apply as did his Honour.

10 In relation to standing, the present case is relevantly indistinguishable from that before Austin J. I find that the ACCC has the necessary interest in proceeding against the company in the discharge of its statutory functions such that it is "a person aggrieved by the deregistration" for the purposes of s 601AH(2).

11 In the case before Austin J the company whose reinstatement was sought had been placed in liquidation by a members' voluntary winding up. In the present case the company was voluntarily deregistered. A director of the company made a declaration of solvency on 7 December 2005 under s 601AA(2).</text>

<tocase>Newham v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 35 ACSR 147</tocase>
<text>12 The ACCC accepts that where a reinstatement is sought in order to enable an applicant to pursue a claim against the company reinstated, it must appear that the claim has reasonable prospects of success or raises a serious question to be tried: Newham v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2000) 35 ACSR 147; Gausten v Outokumpu Australia Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of Western Australia, Master Sanderson 20/11/1998).

13 In her affidavit in support of the application for reinstatement, Bianca Sumner, a Project Officer employed by the ACCC, exhibited the written agreement which is at the heart of the proceedings instituted by the ACCC. That agreement contained the following provisions: 
 
 
 To all English Language Institutions in Perth
 
 
 
 The Perth International Student Agencies, which are KOKOS International Pty Ltd, IAE Edu Net WA, Study Overseas Now, Nanuri Education Centre and Jobbok International, have organized an agreement along with the Council of Korean Agency. The agreement is proposed to prevent excessively discounted fees offered by the agencies mentioned above.
 
 The agencies pledges (sic) to offer fair dealings accordingly to the agreed conditions which are listed below that all International students (including Working Holiday Makers &amp; Tourists) will not be offered discounts beyond the noted amount on the school's invoice. 
 
 Unfortunately the problem has arisen to enormous proportions in Sydney and it sets a fine example. The agents there are competing with each other by offering 15-20% off their own commission to students. In result of this, students are taking this matter to their advantage and requesting for more concessions. It is believed that all persons it concern (sic) do not want this predicament to occur in this market in Perth. 
 
 Therefore, The Council of Korean Agency wishes to monitor and control unfair commissions apart from official privileges offered by Education Institutes. It is also aimed to all Institutions to cooperate within the agreement for fair dealings in the Korean Market. 
 
 Listed below are the agreed conditions: 
 
 
 
 1. The five agencies in Perth will organize a Net Work System and cooperate by working together and monitoring any illegal activities. 
 
 2. All other agencies should follow the system, which has been organized by the five agencies mentioned above, and carry it into an effect. 
 
 3. If any of the five agencies as well as others has performed unfair illegal activities will face a penalty fee ordered by the Council of Korean Agency.
 
 4. All Education Institutions in Perth to cooperate by reporting to the Council of Korean Agency if any illegal activities are performed by any agencies. 
 
 . No enrolment for school for 3 months.
 
 

On the face of it the evidence of the agreement indicates that the ACCC's claim has reasonable prospects of success.

14 There are obvious public interest considerations in favour of the litigation proceeding against all companies said to have been party to the arrangements of which the ACCC complains. Given that those proceedings are still pending it is neither necessary nor desirable to enter upon any further analysis of their merits. It is sufficient to say that on the materials before the Court it is just that the company be reinstated.</text>
