<tocase>Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473</tocase>

<text>10 The Federal Magistrate considered that this may well have been what he called a mistake of a jurisdictional fact because of a decision of Tamberlin J in NBCY v Minister for Immigration (2004) 83 ALD 518. The Federal Magistrate did not apparently consider that this was an error of the kind referred to by the High Court in Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473.

11 In any event, the learned Federal Magistrate went on to point out that the finding was an unnecessary one because the Tribunal had already come to the view that the appellant's claims should be rejected on credibility grounds. The Federal Magistrate observed that the RRT had independent grounds for believing that there was no well-founded fear of persecution if the appellant should return to Sri Lanka. Accordingly the Federal Magistrate did not consider that the RRT fell into jurisdictional error.</text>

<tocase>Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/30.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The appellant's notice of appeal raises four grounds of appeal. One of them is reliance upon the decision of the High Court in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 190 ALR 601. However, there is no substance in this ground of appeal because as a Full Court observed in NADR of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 293 ; (2002) 124 FCR 465 at [24] [28], the decision in Muin turns upon the question of whether the necessary factual basis is established. There was no such factual basis in the present case nor was there any admission of the necessary factual underpinnings that occurred in the High Court in Muin .</text>

<tocase>VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471</tocase>
<text>14 The decision of a Full Court in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [24] in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ contains a useful summary of the meaning of the term "information" in s 424A(1). It is plain that the appellant does not point to any information of the kind set out in the joint judgment. The effect of the appellant's submission is that the RRT was bound to provide him with an opportunity to comment upon its subjective thought processes before arriving at a decision. That is contrary to well established authority; see VAF at [24(iii)]. See also the decision in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576.</text>
