<tocase>Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/770.html</AustLII>
<text>The evidence of the consideration given by the ERC's Board to the constraints sought by the bidder is generally in accordance with the approach that I discussed in Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400 ( APN ) at [55]. Warranty of freedom from encumbrances

Clause 8.3(a) of the Scheme provides that the Scheme Participants are deemed to have warranted to ERC in its own right and on behalf of ECC that they have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer the Scheme Shares to ECC, and that their ERC shares are transferred fully paid and free from all mortgages, liens, charges, pledges, and other interests or restrictions on transfer of any kind. Clause 13.14 of the Scheme Booklet draws attention to this warranty.

The warranty of freedom from encumbrances is consistent with the approach taken in APN at [59]-[62], which was followed by Barrett J in Macquarie Private Capital A Limited [2008] NSWSC 323 ; (2008) 26 ACLC 366 at [13] - [14] . Verification

The $4 million break fee represents: 
(a) 1.9% of the equity value of ERC as at 14 September 2009, being the date when the bid was announced to the market. This percentage has been determined in accordance with para 7.17 of the Takeovers Panel's Guidance Note 7: Lock-up Devices , which I discussed in APN at [55]. The calculation was:
 
$4,000,000 &#247; (167,904,914 ERC shares x the closing price of ERC shares of $1.27 as at 14 September 2009) x 100
 
(b) 4.4% of the total value of the proposal determined in accordance with the principles set out in APN as follows: 
 
$4,000,000 &#247; (167,904,914 ERC shares x the total consideration offered under the proposal being $0.545 per ERC share) x 100
 
(c) 0.06% of the enterprise value of ERC as set out in the consolidated pro forma balance sheet at s 10.5(e) of the Scheme Booklet.

The "total consideration offered under the proposal" referred to in (b) above is arrived at by adding to the Cash Consideration of $0.40 per ERC share, the Capital Reduction Amount of $0.145 per ERC share.

In relation to (c) above, it is to be noted that in its Guidance Note 7: Lock up Devices , the Takeovers Panel stated (at para 7.21): 
 
 In some limited cases, the Panel accepts that it may be appropriate for the 1% guideline to apply to a company's enterprise value rather than equity value, because for instance, the target is highly geared . In such a case, as with every fee in excess of 1% of equity value, a party seeking to justify the fee must be prepared to show that the fee does not have an anti-competitive or coercive effect.
 [Emphasis added] 
 

The "enterprise value of ERC" referred to in [45](c) above was arrived at as described at [49] below.</text>

<tocase>Re Ausdoc Group Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 629</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/ATP/2002/9.html</AustLII>
<text>I note that in Re Ausdoc Group Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 629 ( Ausdoc ) the Takeovers Panel found that a break fee of $3.5 million, that was 1.86% of the equity value and 1.1% of the enterprise value of the target company, was unobjectionable in the circumstances of that case. Those circumstances included the facts that: a six-month tender process had been conducted by the target company before it entered into the scheme implementation deed, yet no other bids had emerged; the bidder had made it clear to the board of the target company that it would not bid unless, relevantly, the break fee provision was agreed to; and the bid would give a substantial premium to the target company's shareholders. 
While each case turns on its own facts and, in any event, I must make my own assessment, it is nonetheless noteworthy that there are some similarities between the circumstances of Ausdoc and those of the present case.

In this case, I concluded that the existence of the provision for payment of a break fee of nearly twice the "1% of the equity value of the target" should not, in the unusual circumstances, stand in the way of the making of an order for the convening of a meeting at which the proposed Scheme can be considered and voted upon by Scheme Participants.

It was for the above reasons that I made the orders on 9 November 2009 referred to at the outset of these reasons for judgment. 
 I certify that the preceding sixty-three (63) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.
