<text>1 On 21 October 2005 I dealt with one aspect of a motion by Aaron Stephenson for access to subpoenaed documents for the purpose of use in other proceedings and for related relief. I stood over the motion in order to give further consideration to the wider issues involved ( Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Rural &amp; General Insurance Limited (ACN 000 007 492) (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2005] FCA 1548).

2 In 2003 and 2004, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was proceeding in this Court seeking to wind up Rural &amp; General Insurance Limited (as it then was) (Rural &amp; General) pursuant to s 462(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Rural &amp; General was represented by solicitors and counsel and actively opposed the winding up. APRA had earlier appointed Peter John McCarthy of the accountancy firm of Ernst &amp; Young to make an investigation in respect of the company under s 52 of the Insurance Act 1973 . In the course of the proceeding several sets of documents were subpoenaed from McCarthy and his firm and a significant volume of documents was produced. Stephenson was the Managing Director of Rural &amp; General and was actively involved in instructing solicitors and counsel. Leave to discontinue the proceeding was granted on 17 March 2004 following the execution by Rural &amp; General of a Deed of Company Arrangement on 15 March 2004. The documents produced on subpoena on behalf of McCarthy and his firm should have been returned promptly. Due to an administrative oversight they were not.

3 Stephenson is the applicant in proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) against APRA appealing against APRA's decision to disqualify him under s 25A of the Insurance Act 1973 . On 15 June 2005 he signed a statement in connection with that proceeding to which were annexed a number of documents, being copies of communications which passed between McCarthy and officers of APRA prior to the disqualification. Stephenson wishes to rely upon those communications to contend that the decision to disqualify him was affected by extraneous considerations. APRA took exception to the use of those documents contending, amongst other things, that they had been obtained as a result of inspection of documents produced to this Court in the course of the winding up proceeding in breach of the implied undertaking as to proper use of such documents.</text>

<text>6 It is well established that the implied undertaking can, in appropriate circumstances, be released or modified by the Court. There are many cases discussing the exercise of that power in differing circumstances, a recent example being the decision of the Full Court in Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd (2005) ALR 283; [2005] FCAFC 3 at [31] [33].
