<tocase>Amadio Pty Ltd and Another v Henderson and Others (1998) 81 FCR 149</tocase>
<text>22 Given the above facts, the Court considers that it should depart from the usual rule relating to the award of costs. It is just for AIA to receive costs on an indemnity basis in respect of the issues which the Court is satisfied were raised without any factual basis and those which were pursued falsely to the knowledge of the applicants. Since these matters largely occupied hearing time from 11 September 2007, in accordance with the principles in Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd and Others (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 156-158 and Amadio Pty Ltd and Another v Henderson and Others (1998) 81 FCR 149 at 258-259, the Court will order the applicants to pay indemnity costs to AIA from that date.</text>

<tocase>Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333</tocase>
<text>7 Alternatively, AIA submits that it should be entitled to indemnity costs from 15 June 2007. By letter of this date AIA's solicitors, Ebsworth and Ebsworth, made an offer of settlement which was stated to be written in accordance with the principle referred to in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 ('the Calderbank letter'). The Calderbank letter attached copies of the receipts and copies of correspondence written by Mr Xu to AIA complaining that although he had paid cash to Mr Yang for the renewal of his policies his policies had been cancelled. The Calderbank letter proposed that each party pay their own costs and the proceedings be abandoned. Such offer was not accepted.

8 The applicants oppose the orders sought. They submit that their claim was predicated upon various representations which were alleged to have been made by AIA to Mr Yang at the time of his engagement as an agent of AIA. The applicants submit that the evidence of Ms Lin disputing the grant of authority to issue the receipts was not provided until approximately September 2007 which was at a late stage of the proceedings and that the applicants' claim was keenly fought in respect of numerous factual issues.

9 Section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') empowers the Court to make orders for costs. Subsection 43(1) of the Act empowers the Court or a Judge thereof to award costs in all proceedings before the Court except those proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded. Subsection 43(2) of the Act provides:
 
 Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>5 AIA submits that the principles referred to by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 apply in respect of proceedings which are conducted in such manner such as to warrant an order for indemnity costs. At page 233 his Honour observed that orders for indemnity costs might be made where proceedings had been conducted:
 
 ... in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (Woodward J in Fountain and French J in J-Corp (supra)); the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (Davies J in Ragata ); an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg Messiter v Hutchinson (1987) 10 NSWLR 525, Maitland Hospital v Fisher (No 2) (1992) 27 NSWLR 721 at 724 (Court of Appeal); Crisp v Keng (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, Kirby P, Priestley JA, Cripps JA, No 40744/1992, 27 September 1993)...

21 The allegations made by the applicants concerning the issue of the receipts were wholly inconsistent with the objective facts. The Court is satisfied that such allegations were groundless. Further, there was no factual basis to support the claim that AIA had manipulated the records. The applicants' claims relating to the issue of the receipts and of the computer records should never have been raised (see Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons per Sheppard J at 233).</text>

<tocase>Degmam Pty Ltd (In liq) v Wright (No 2) (1983) 2 NSWLR 354</tocase>
<text>12 It has been recognised that where a party has caused another party or parties to incur unnecessary costs, an order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis may be made. In Degmam Pty Ltd (In liq) v Wright (No 2) (1983) 2 NSWLR 354, Holland J at 358 found that a party had raised false defences which were deliberately concocted to deny the other party its rights. His Honour observed that such conduct grossly prolonged the litigation, causing 'the other parties to incur liability for solicitor and client costs far beyond what they could reasonably have expected to incur in litigation of genuine issues' .

<tocase>Donald Campbell and Company Limited v Pollak [1927] AC 732</tocase>
<text>11 In Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd and Others [1988] FCA 202 ; (1988) 81 ALR 397 Woodwood J (at 400-401) observed that the Court had an 'absolute and unfettered' discretion with regard to the award of costs. In Donald Campbell and Company Limited v Pollak [1927] AC 732 Viscount Cave L.C. said at 811-812:
 
 A successful defendant in a non-jury case has no doubt, in the absence of special circumstances, a reasonable expectation of obtaining an order for the payment of his costs by the plaintiff; but he has no right to costs unless and until the Court awards them to him, and the Court has an absolute and unfettered discretion to award or not to award them. This discretion, like any other discretion, must of course be exercised judicially, and the judge ought not to exercise it against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case.

<tocase>Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd [2008] FCA 39</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/39.html</AustLII>
<text>1 On 12 March 2008 the Court ordered that the applicants' application be dismissed and that the applicants pay the costs of the respondent ('AIA'): see Yang v American International Assurance Company (Australia) Ltd [2008] FCA 39.

2 AIA now seeks an order that the applicants pay AIA's costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis or alternatively pay the AIA's costs of the proceedings on a whole party-party basis up to and including 15 June 2007 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.

3 In the primary hearing the applicants contended that Mr Yang had not received any payment in cash from Mr Xu for the renewal of Mr Xu's insurance policies, despite Mr Yang having issued receipts to Mr Xu recording such payment. AIA submits that the applicants knew this claim was false and that the applicants knowingly maintained the litigation raising groundless contentions based upon such false claim.</text>
