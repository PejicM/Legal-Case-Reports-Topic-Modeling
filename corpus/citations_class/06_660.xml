<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/54.html</AustLII>
<text>3 The Board of the ACC is established by s 7B of the ACC Act. It comprises the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, the Secretary of the Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service, the Chairperson of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Director-General of Security under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth), the Commissioner or head of the police force of each State and of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, and the CEO of the ACC. A brief description of the governance of the ACC is given in P v Australian Crime Commission [2005] FCAFC 54 at [28] ( P v ACC ).

4 On 15 May 2003 the Board of the ACC made the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Established Criminal Networks) 2003 (the first Instrument). Clause 4 of the first Instrument expressly authorised the investigation of the specified matter until 31 May 2004 and requested a report by 31 May 2004. Clause 5 of the first Instrument expressly determined that the investigation should be a special investigation. It recorded that the Board had considered the matter required by s 7C(3) to have been considered. It also contained the information required by s 7C(4). The first Instrument on its face records that it was made at 8.02 am on 15 May 2003 and signed by the Chair of the Board on that date.

5 On 28 April 2004 the Board of the ACC made the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Established Criminal Networks) Amendment No 1 of 2004 (the second Instrument). The second Instrument comprised only three clauses: its name; its time of commencement (upon its making); and its operative clause. Clause 3 of the Second Instrument amended clause 4 of the first Instrument by substituting 31 May 2005 for 31 May 2004.</text>

<text>18 The Full Court in S v Australian Crime Commission [2006] FCAFC 5 has determined that issue adversely to the applicant. I must follow that decision. Consequently, I reject the challenge to the constitutional validity of s 4A.

19 The discrete challenge to the validity of the third Instrument (ground (a)) is that it does not comply with the requirements of s 7C(3) and (4) of the ACC Act because it does not itself express a determination in writing that the investigation is a special investigation, because it does not on its face record that the Board has considered whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective, and because it does not itself contain the information required by s 7C(4).</text>

<tocase>X v ACC [2004] FCA 1475</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1475.html</AustLII>
<text>20 The Full Court in P v ACC has decided those contentions adversely to the applicant. The third Instrument is to be read with the first Instrument and the second Instrument, and in that way it meets the requirements of s 7C(3) and (4). There is no requirement that a determination in writing must record that the Board has considered whether ordinary police methods of investigation into the matters are likely to be effective. There is no evidence to suggest, and so no reason to conclude, that the Board did overlook that issue at the time of making the second Instrument or the third Instrument, assuming that it was necessary for it to do so at those times bearing in mind that those Instruments extended the period of the authorisation under s 7C(1)(c) but may not have constituted a fresh determination under s 7C(1)(d). I must follow that decision. I note that Finn J in X v ACC [2004] FCA 1475 reached the same conclusion.

21 The challenge to the validity of the summons because it does not comply with the qualified obligation imposed by s 28(3) (ground (e)) must also fail. The obligation is to set out the general nature of the matters in relation to which the proposed questioning is to be directed, but only so far as is reasonably practicable to set out that information. The concept of reasonable practicability is part of the measure of the information required to be provided. The obligation to provide that information does not arise where the examiner who issues the summons is satisfied that setting out the required information would prejudice the effectiveness of the special ACC investigation.

22 In fact, the summons does contain some information. It identifies that the proposed evidence is to be of 'matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity, including your knowledge of the activities of [a described group] between [a specified year] and the present'. The reference to federally relevant criminal activity is, of course, necessarily rhetorical; it is a pre-condition to a valid determination and so to a valid summons. It does not usefully convey information about the topics of the proposed examination. The balance of that descriptive material does so. The use of the word 'including' might be read as suggesting that there are other matters to be the subject of questioning which have not been specified, but in context I think it merely preserves the position expressly permitted by s 28(3) that questions outside the scope of the nature of the specified matters is nevertheless permitted.</text>

<tocase>S v ACC [2005] FCA 1310 ; (2005) 225 ALR 123</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/1310.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The affidavit of the third respondent set out in [12] above attracts some comment. Paragraph 3 (after the first sentence, which relates to s 28(1A)) asserts that the summons provides the information required by s 28(3). There would then be no need for the proviso in s 28(3) to be activated, but par 4 of the affidavit does so. It may do so because of the use of the word 'including' so as to refer to those matters which notice has not been given. If it does not, in my view, those paragraphs may not accurately reflect the operation of s 28(3) because the third respondent has treated the obligation to provide information about the general nature of the matters to be the subject of questions as qualified in a quantitative way by the proviso upon that obligation. In other words, the third respondent has treated the measure of reasonable practicability as dependent upon, or qualified by, any prejudice to the effectiveness of the special investigation. It is not clear that reasonable practicability is qualified in that way. The measure of reasonable practicability is an objective one, not in its terms dependent upon the satisfaction of the examiner, unlike the applicability of the proviso itself. see S v ACC at [16]. At a practical level, however, the determination of what is required to be disclosed is nevertheless made by the examiner: See S v ACC at [38]-[39].

24 Be that as it may, in this matter, the summons in my view does disclose the general nature of the matters upon which the proposed examination is to occur. If, on the other hand, it does not adequately do so, the third respondent has formed the view that it should not do so.

25 The proviso in s 28(3), as I pointed out in S v ACC (2005) ALR 123 ( S v ACC at first instance ) at [38], puts the responsibility for deciding whether setting out the general nature of the matters in relation to which the examiner intends to question the examinee would prejudice the effectiveness of the examination upon the examiner. That is the meter by which is measured the existence of such prejudice. It is a meter which is to be used only after the examiner has been satisfied that the issue of the summons is reasonable in all the circumstances and has recorded in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons: see s 28(1A).

26 The applicant accepts that he bears the onus of proving the third respondent did not have the necessary satisfaction specified by s 28(3) and to which he has deposed. For the reasons I gave in S v ACC at first instance at [36]-[40], I am not persuaded that the third respondent did not have the level of satisfaction to which he deposed. No particular criticism of his affidavit was made in that regard. He gives a reason for his satisfaction. Although very generally expressed, it is comprehensible and rational. He was obliged to, and did (according to his affidavit), first satisfy himself that it was reasonable in all the circumstances to issue the summons. To form such a view necessarily involves a significant awareness of the nature and progress of the special ACC investigation.

27 Consequently, in my judgment, that line of attack upon the validity of the summons must also fail.

28 There remains the attack based upon the 'impermissible delegation' by the Board (grounds (b) and (c)). They can be dealt with together, as there is no claim by the respondents that the Board has delegated, or is entitled to delegate, its functions under s 7C(1)(e) of the ACC Act.

44 The ACC Act is the outcome of the substantial amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984 (Cth) effected by the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth). The Second Reading Speech for the Australian Crime Commission Establishment Bill 2002 (Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates House of Representatives, 26 September 2002, pp 7328- 7330) indicates that the ACC was intended by the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories to replace the National Crime Authority, the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence; and the ACC was intended to result in more effective national law enforcement operations in conjunction with state and territory police forces. The ACC was intended thereby to enhance law enforcement co-ordination at a national level, by setting up a co-ordinated national criminal intelligence framework, and to improve the ability to combat serious and organised crime across jurisdictional boundaries. See S v ACC at [6].

45 It is clear that the Board is constituted to reflect and have regard to those various interests. It is to be no mere cypher. Its functions under s 7C indicate that it has overall control of the ACC in the performance of its functions. It decides on national criminal intelligence priorities and it provides strategic direction to the ACC and determines priorities for the ACC: s 7C(1)(a) and (b). Its functions under s 7C(1)(c) and (d) are referred to above. The Board may determine under s 7C(1)(d) that an authorised investigation is a special investigation only if at least nine Board members (including at least two eligible Commonwealth Board members) vote for it: s 7G(4). Correlative provisions addressing the ACC's functions in s 7A reflect that. The ACC may only conduct an intelligence operation or an investigation into federally relevant criminal activity when authorised by the Board: s 7A(b) and (c). It must provide reports to the Board on the outcomes of those operations or investigations: s 7B(d). It must provide strategic criminal intelligence assessments to the Board and its advice on national criminal intelligence priorities: s 7A(e) and (f). The Board in turn may disseminate to the appropriate agencies the strategic criminal intelligence assessments made by the ACC.

46 The Board must also report to the Inter-Governmental Committee on the ACC's performance: s 7C(l)(h). The Inter-Governmental Committee constituted under s 8 comprises the designated Ministers of the Commonwealth and of each participating State. Its functions include monitoring generally the work of the ACC and of the Board, and the oversight of their strategic direction: s 9(1)(a) and (b). It is notified promptly of a determination by the Board that an intelligence operation is a special operation or that an authorised investigation is a special investigation under s 7C(2) or (3) respectively in the performance of the Board's functions, and it may then seek further information concerning the determination, and it may revoke the determination: s 9(2) and (7). Its oversight of the Board and of the ACC is thus at Ministerial level, but it is nonetheless a significant role.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>31 The respondents have not invoked s 16 of the ACC Act as a response to the claim. That is presumably because they accept (at least for the purposes of this matter) that the applicant is entitled to challenge the validity of the summons by claiming that there is no valid determination. In adopting that position, they accept (for the purposes of this matter) that s 7C(1)(e) places an inviolable restraint upon the exercise of the power to determine that an authorised investigation is a special investigation: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [76].

32 The respondents' contention is that the Board did not, by cl 6 and Sch 2 of the first Instrument, delegate its function under s 7C(1)(e) but simply performed the function required by s 7C(1)(e). They accept for the purposes of this application that the function of determining the class or classes of persons to participate in the investigation is not delegable.

33 Consequently, the only issue is whether the Board by the first Instrument properly performed that function.</text>

<tocase>King Gee Clothing Company Proprietary Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1945/23.html</AustLII>
<text>38 King Gee Clothing Company Proprietary Limited v The Commonwealth [1945] HCA 23 ; (1945) 71 CLR 184 ( King Gee )concerned the process of price control by regulation during the Second World War. The issue was whether Prices Regulation Order No 1816 was a valid exercise of power by the Commissioner of Prices under the National Security (Prices) Regulations . Regulation 23(1) relevantly empowered the Commissioner of Prices by order 'to fix and declare the maximum price at which goods may be sold'. The Prices Order prescribed the prices at which certain items of men's clothing might be sold by a formula providing for an allowance of a percentage margin on cost; 'cost' was defined to include an amount for 'indirect labour', to be calculated as a percentage of the 'direct labour'; various terms then described how those elements were to be calculated. The High Court (Rich, Starke, Dixon and Williams JJ) held that the Prices Order was not a valid exercise of the power granted by reg 23(1) because it required estimates or discretionary apportionments as a matter of judgment. The controlling price could not itself be calculated. Obviously there is no direct analogy with the present issue.

39 In my view, the significant feature of the case is the observation for present purposes of Dixon J at 196 that the validity of the Prices Order depended upon the meaning and operation of reg 23(1). His Honour concluded at 197 that, in its context, reg 23(1) required that a Prices Order prescribe standards or criteria from which a price may be calculated. The context included the heavy criminal sanctions for its contravention, as well as reg 23(1A) which described various ways in which the fixing and declaring of maximum prices might be made. It therefore, as his Honour said at 197 required a 'certain objective standard'.

40 In Cann's Proprietary Limited v The Commonwealth (1946)71 CLR 210 the High Court (Latham CJ, Starke and Williams JJ) declared invalid a different Prices Order purportedly made under reg 23(1) of the National Security (Prices) Regulations for similar reasons, although Dixon J dissented in the result. I do not consider that the reasoning further informs my judgment in this matter, beyond the assistance to be derived from King Gee .</text>

<tocase>Brudenell v Nestl&eacute; Company (Australia) Ltd [1971] VR 225</tocase>
<text>41 Counsel for the applicant also referred to Brudenell v Nestl&eacute; Company (Australia) Ltd [1971] VR 225. In that case, the defendant had been charged with selling instant coffee which was adulterated, contrary to s 238 of the Health Act 1958 (Vic). The adulteration was alleged because the instant coffee did not comply with the standard prescribed by reg 48(8)(a) of the Food and Drug Standards Regulations 1966 (Vic) that instant coffee should contain no more than a specified percentage of residue in boiling water. The prescribed standard was held to be ultra vires because it did not prescribe a standard for, or define, a food, drug or substance. The scientific evidence showed the percentage of residue varied depending upon the proportions of the coffee and boiling water used, and the regulation did not define the proportions of coffee and boiling water to be used to determine the residue. Consequently, Menhennitt J concluded at 235 in the light of the evidence that no standard had been prescribed, because it was impossible to ascertain to what extent the addition of any substance was prohibited.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1979/50.html</AustLII>
<text>42 Finally, counsel referred to Racecourse Co-operative Sugar Association Ltd v Attorney-General (Queensland) [1979] HCA 50 ; (1979) 142 CLR 460. The High Court held, inter alia, that in delegating to the Sugar Board the power to determine the value or price of certain acquired sugar by reference to discretionary matters, the Governor-in-Council had not 'determined and declared' the value or 'fixed' the price of the sugar as required by s 6 of the Sugar Acquisition Act 1915 (Qld). Gibbs J at 481 said:
 
 'A power given to one person to determine a value or fix a price will not be validly exercised by allowing another to exercise a wide and unreviewable discretion in determining that price, although the person upon whom that power is conferred may, instead of fixing a money sum himself, "lay down a method of finding it which will produce the same result whoever applies it, so long as he uses it correctly" Cann's Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [at 228]'.

43 The point which emerges from those cases relevant to determining present issue is that its resolution depends upon the proper construction of s 7C(1)(e) in its context.</text>
