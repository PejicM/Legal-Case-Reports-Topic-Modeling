<tocase>Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289</tocase>
<text>37 Considering this evidence, I am not satisfied that 'Vessel's Final Accounts' or 'Final Accounts' are used exclusively, or even customarily, as terms of art. In light of this, I find that the expert evidence provides no special guidance to constructing the documents at issue in this case: see, e.g., Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289 at 296-297 per Hill J. Accordingly, I sustain the applicant's objection to Mr Swales's evidence and will exclude all of the expert testimony concerning the meaning of 'Vessel's Final Accounts' or 'Final Accounts'.

38 The applicant contends that the exchange of 3 August 1999 gave rise to a binding contract to compromise, for an amount of USD421,380.22, being Soufflet USA's claim for losses arising out of the delay in berthing and loading of the Panamax Star. In the applicant's submission, AWB's fax of that day is an offer and Soufflet N&eacute;goce's immediate reply is an acceptance.</text>

<tocase>Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas (2004) (" Pacific Carriers ") [2004] HCA 35 ; 218 CLR 451</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/35.html</AustLII>
<text>39 The applicant contends that Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas (2004) (" Pacific Carriers ") [2004] HCA 35 ; 218 CLR 451 articulates the approach the Court should take in this case. In Pacific Carriers , letters of indemnity were provided by the seller of a cargo of lentils to facilitate the delivery of the cargo without the production of a bill of lading. The letters were executed by both the seller and its bank. The High Court held that, considering all the surrounding circumstances, a "reasonable reader in the position of [the buyer] would have understood the document as a bank endorsed absent bills of lading indemnity, and would have understood that the bank was undertaking liability as an indemnifying party to support the liability undertaken by [the seller]": Pacific Carriers at 463 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ.

40 In reaching this conclusion, the High Court emphasised that what is important is not the subjective intention of the author of a commercial document such as a letter of indemnity. Rather, "construction ... is to be determined by what a reasonable person in the position of [the buyer] would have understood them to mean": Pacific Carriers at 462 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ. This will require consideration of the surrounding circumstances of the transaction known to the parties and the purpose and object of the transaction, as well as the text of the relevant documents.

41 The applicant submitted that, when the text of AWB's fax of 3 August 1999 is considered in light of the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable reader would understand it to be an offer to compromise all the claims made by Soufflet USA. Moreover, under Pacific Carriers , the subjective intent of the author of the fax (Mr Welmillage) is irrelevant to its meaning and legal effect.

42 The applicant claims that a number of factors support its view. These allegedly include:
 
(a) In letters dated 15 and 18 March 1999, Soufflet N&eacute;goce expressly informed AWB that Soufflet USA intended to hold AWB liable for costs incurred as result of the delay in loading the vessel.
 
(b) Further notice of Soufflet USA claims was provided on 29 March 1999 when Soufflet USA deducted its delay related costs from its first payment to AWB.
 
(c) Soufflet USA then acquiesced to AWB's request that delay related claims be treated as a "separate issue".
 
(d) Thereafter, consistent with the course proposed by AWB, Soufflet USA submitted its claim for delay on 28 June 1999. The covering letter clearly referred to both the costs caused by delay and the freight balance. In particular, the applicant contended, "The evident purpose and object of the 28 June 1999 letter was to seek to finalise matters between AWB and Soufflet USA with respect to the charter of the Panamax Star ".
 
(e) AWB said nothing, before the letter of 28 June 1999 and, indeed, prior to 16 September 1999, to indicate that it would dispute Soufflet USA's entitlement to recover from AWB the losses caused by the delay. 
 
(f) As AWB's response letter of 3 August 1999 addresses itself to the "Soufflet USA claim", a reasonable reader would assume that AWB was addressing the claim for USD394,296.22 in respect of the delay, and the freight balance.
 
(g) AWB's letter then states "and [AWB] would only disagree with the load port despatch calculation", indicating that AWB disputed only the load port despatch calculation.
 
(h) AWB's letter concludes with the request to Soufflet USA to "go through and confirm your concurrance [sic] for us to proceed with the balance settlements of this Vessel account", indicating to the reasonable reader that an agreement will be reached if Soufflet USA concurs with AWB's load port despatch calculation.

43 The applicant also claimed that there are important omissions from AWB's letter of 3 August 1999. In particular, the applicant noted that the letter does not say that AWB was only responding to part of the claim made in the 28 June 1999 letter. Similarly, it did not say that AWB disputed the claim for delay related costs and did not foreshadow any future correspondence from AWB regarding that matter.</text>

<tocase>McDermott v Black [1940] HCA 4 ; (1940) 63 CLR 161</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1940/4.html</AustLII>
<text>52 As already indicated, AWB argued that the applicant's submissions suffered from a fundamental flaw. This flaw is that its fax of 3 August 1999 presents no consideration that could underlie an offer of accord and satisfaction. AWB cited McDermott v Black [1940] HCA 4 ; (1940) 63 CLR 161 at 183-185 per Dixon J, with whom Rich and McTiernan JJ agreed, for a classic statement of the law concerning accord and satisfaction:
 
" The essence of accord and satisfaction is the acceptance by the plaintiff of something in place of his cause of action. What he takes is a matter depending on his own consent or agreement. It may be a promise or contract or it may be the act or thing promised. But, whatever it is, until it is provided and accepted the cause of action remains alive and unimpaired. The accord is the agreement or consent to accept the satisfaction. Until the satisfaction is given the accord remains executory and cannot bar the claim. The distinction between an accord executory and an accord and satisfaction remains as valid and as important as ever. An accord executory neither extinguishes the old cause of action nor affords a new one. ... An executory promise or series of promises given in consideration of the abandonment of the claim may be accepted in substitution or satisfaction of the existing liability. Or, on the other hand, promises may be given by the party liable that he will satisfy the claim by doing an act, making over a thing or paying an ascertained sum of money and the other party may agree to accept, not the promise, but the act, thing or money in satisfaction of his claim. If the agreement is to accept the promise in satisfaction, the discharge of the liability is immediate; if the performance, then there is no discharge unless and until the promise is performed. "
 
Applying these principles, for there to have been an immediate accord and satisfaction, AWB must have offered a promise in place of Soufflet USA's cause of action. In AWB's submission, its fax cannot be construed as an offer of a promise because it merely discusses calculations under a pre-existing contract.

53 During argument, AWB elucidated this point with the following example. Suppose a barrister agrees to charge $100 per hour. Subsequently, the barrister sends her instructing solicitor a $1,500 account stating that she worked for 14 hours. The solicitor might reply "I calculate that 14 hours should be $1,400". At that point, suppose the barrister says "I accept your offer of $1,400". In AWB's submission, no contract would have been formed. The solicitor's communication was simply an inquiry about what was properly owed under the contract. If the solicitor were to later discover that the barrister had not worked 14 hours as claimed, but 10, he could hardly be bound by an earlier 'offer' to pay $1,400.

54 In summary, the solicitor was not offering to accept the barrister's claim in exchange for a $100 reduction in the account; rather the solicitor was trying to establish what his true obligation was under the pre-existing contract. Similarly, in AWB's submission, AWB was not offering to accept Soufflet USA's damages claim in exchange for a reduction in the freight balance. Rather, AWB was simply disagreeing with Soufflet N&eacute;goce's calculation of the freight balance. There was no offer of compromise regarding the freight balance because AWB was only offering to pay what it claimed was the correct amount. AWB submitted that these considerations undermine any claim that AWB was requesting a reduction in the freight balance as consideration for it accepting the damages claim.</text>

<tocase>Osborn v McDermott [2001] VSCA 94 ; [1998] 3 VR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2001/94.html</AustLII>
<text>58 Before analysing the key documents, it will be helpful to review the distinction between accord and satisfaction and accord executory. Phillips JA (with whom Winneke P and Charles JA agreed) provides an excellent outline of the relevant principles in Osborn v McDermott [2001] VSCA 94 ; [1998] 3 VR 1 (" Osborn "). As Phillips JA explains, the fundamental distinction between accord executory and accord and satisfaction is that "the former does not operate to discharge existing rights and duties unless and until the accord is performed, whereas the latter operates as a discharge immediately the accord (or agreement) is achieved": Osborn at 7-8. Accord and satisfaction is the compromise of an existing cause of action in return for a promise while accord executory requires that something be done before the cause of action is compromised.

59 Somewhere between accord and satisfaction and accord executory "is the accord and conditional satisfaction, which exists where the compromise amounts to an existing and enforceable agreement between the parties for performance according to its tenor but which does not operate to discharge any existing cause of action unless and until there has been performance": Osborn at 10. Accord and conditional satisfaction would be reached if a creditor agreed to forebear from suit for 30 days and to discharge the cause of action if the debtor paid a compromise amount within that time: see Bartlett v Mouncey [1998] FCA 418.</text>

<tocase>Murphy v Timms [1987] 2 Qd R 550</tocase>
<text>65 Forbearance is sometimes exchanged for security: see, e.g., Murphy v Timms [1987] 2 Qd R 550 at 551 per Kneipp J (with whom Vasta J agreed) and 556 per Connolly J (holding that forbearance to sue by a creditor at the express or implied request of a guarantor is sufficient consideration to support a guarantee). Also, forbearance might be consideration where quantum is uncertain. For example, a claimant might forbear to sue in exchange for an insurer accepting liability: see Newton v State Government Insurance Office (Qld) [1986] 1 Qd R 431 at 444-5 per McPherson J. In that situation, the insurer benefits by avoiding costly litigation while quantum is investigated and negotiated. This case is different. The applicant claims that AWB acknowledged both liability and quantum with respect to the damages claim. According to the applicant, AWB bound itself, without more, to pay the damages claim in full. If the applicant were correct, then, Soufflet USA would have exchanged its damages claim for AWB's unqualified promise to pay the exact same claim. This is inherently unlikely.</text>
