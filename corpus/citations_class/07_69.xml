<tocase>Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/8.html</AustLII>
<text>63 If there had been some evidence to the effect contended for by the applicant, then the absence of evidence from Ms Pereira might more readily lead to the inference for which the applicant contended. However, the omission to call evidence from Ms Pereira could 'not properly be treated as supplying any gap which the evidence adduced for the (plaintiff) left untouched': Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 per Kitto J at 308.

64 I am also not satisfied that the respondents were on notice that evidence should be led from Ms Pereira on that issue. The applicant's application sought evidence that she held a Transitional (Permanent) visa. She could only be entitled to a Transitional (Permanent) visa if she held at Authority to Return or a Return Endorsement as at 1 September 1994. It is not clear then, in those circumstances, why, on the application as it was framed, the respondents needed to adduce evidence from Ms Pereira.

65 There was nothing in the applicant's case to put the respondents on notice that the applicant asserted that the action taken on 12 September 1997 by Ms Pereira was taken deliberately and with knowledge that the applicant had not entered Australia between April 1991 and October 1996. It was not raised in correspondence with the respondents or DIMA. It was not referred to in the application or affidavits. It was not raised in the applicant's written submissions. The respondents were never put on notice that it was a live issue that needed to be addressed. The applicant did not, at any time prior to the hearing, take issue with the respondents' assertion in 2003 that the action of 12 September 1997 was due to administrative error. For those further reasons, it would be inappropriate to raise an inference of the kind contended by the applicant due to a failure to call Ms Pereira.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2001) 209 CLR 597</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2002/11.html</AustLII>
<text>102 The applicant argued that the cancellation was void 'ab initio'. She argued that an administrative decision involving jurisdictional error lacks legal foundation and can be regarded as no decision at all. In that regard, the applicant's counsel relied on Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2001) 209 CLR 597 (' Bhardwaj '). The effect of the High Court decision in Bhardwaj was explained by the Full Court of this Court in Jadwan Pty Ltd v Secretary, Department of Health and Aged Care [2003] FCAFC 288 ; (2003) 204 ALR 55. In that case, Gray and Downes JJ addressed the reasoning of the members of the High Court and said at [40]:
 
 'This analysis shows that the judgment in Bhardwaj rested clearly upon the proposition that the relevant legislation did not give the first decision of the IRT force and effect such as to require the IRT to treat that decision as precluding it from exercising its statutory function. All six judges who formed the majority did so on that basis. Only Gaudron and Gummow JJ, with the agreement of McHugh J, as part of their reasoning, relied on the proposition that jurisdictional error on the part of the decision-maker causes an administrative decision to be of no legal effect. Gleeson CJ, Hayne J and Callinan J do not appear to have embraced that proposition. Kirby J in his dissenting judgment clearly did not. Gaundron and Gummow JJ did not explain in detail the consequences of the proposition that a decision has no legal effect. They did not deal with issues such as the status of the first decision of the IRT if the IRT had not chosen to ignore it and make another. Indeed, their Honours did not discuss what might be the factual, as distinct from the legal, consequences attaching to an administrative decision if no challenge to its validity is ever made, or if any challenge to its validity is made out of time, or is made in proceedings to which someone bound or otherwise affected by the decision is not a party. Nor did their Honours say anything about the possible effect of an administrative decision after a court proceeding in which a party has made out a case of jurisdictional error on the part of the decision-maker, but the court has declined to grant relief in relation to the decision by reason of discretionary considerations. The facts of Bhardwaj did not call for pronouncement upon these issues. The IRT had itself chosen to ignore its previous decision. The validity of that decision was in issue in the very proceeding with which the High Court was dealing.'

104 Kenny J said at [64]:
 
 'For the reasons stated by Gray and Downes JJ, the decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597; 187 ALR 117 ( Bhardwaj ) is authority for the limited proposition that the consequences of a decision, which is affected by jurisdictional error, depend primarily on the statute pursuant to which the decision-maker purported to make the decision. I reject the appellant's submissions in so far as they are to the contrary effect.'

105 The applicant did not identify those provisions of the Act which would make the decision void ab initio. However, in view of the respondents' concession, which was rightly made, I need not further explore that matter. Whether the decision was ineffective or void ab initio, the Return Endorsement was not cancelled on 31 July 1989. So much is agreed by the parties.

106 The applicant argued that the issue of the Return Resident visa on 31 July 1989 was also invalid. I am not sure that necessarily follows but I think, in the end, nothing turns on that because the Return Resident visa would have expired, in relation to the first one issued, in 1994 and, in relation to the second, on 21 May 1998.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/6.html</AustLII>
<text>126 That concession, I think, also has been rightly made. In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at [67] that McHugh J's dissenting judgment in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh [1995] HCA 20 ; (1995) 183 CLR 273, in which he said that administrative decision makers must accord parties procedural fairness including bringing to that party's attention the issue on which the decision is likely to turn so as to allow the party to deal with it, meant that there was no need for any doctrine of legitimate expectation and should be accepted as representing the law of Australia. See also Hayne J at [121] and Callinan J at [148]. For the reasons given by Finn J in Rush v Commissioner of Police [2006] FCA 12 , the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is not presently part of Australian law. I need, therefore, say no more about the 'other way' of putting the estoppel argument.

142 In the applicant's outline, it was contended:
 
 
 
 '27. The Applicant assumed that she would be entitled to re-enter Australia as long as she did so within three years of her previous visit, and be entitled to stay indefinitely. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the Applicant held such an assumption: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at 30-32 [90] - [92] , 47 [145]. 
 
 28. This assumed state of affairs was based upon the conduct or representation of the First Respondent (or her agents) in 1997 and onwards. If the assumption is not fulfilled, the Applicant will suffer detriment.'

143 The argument needs to be considered at two snapshots in time. If the applicant assumed that she would be entitled to re-enter Australia, as long as she did so within three years of her previous visit and be entitled to stay indefinitely, as at 7 April 1994 she must have known that that entitlement would cease on that day. It follows that she must have known prior to 1 September 1994 that she was no longer entitled to a Return Endorsement as at 1 September 1994.

144 The estoppel which is sought to be erected by the applicant is an estoppel that did not arise until 12 September 1997, after she had lost an entitlement to a Return Endorsement and therefore a Transitional (Permanent) visa.</text>

<tocase>The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/39.html</AustLII>
<text>129 'Waiver' is an imprecise term: The Commonwealth of Australia v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (' Verwayen ') per Mason CJ at 406 and Dawson J at 451-452. It has been described as a vague term used in many senses: Smyth &amp; Co v Bailey &amp; Co [1940] 3 All ER 60 per Lord Wright at 70. It may be that the term is now used only to describe two legal concepts; election and estoppel, although there is support for a broader scope: see Toohey J in Verwayen at 468 and McHugh J at 491.

131 It was, however, conceded that if waiver was to apply at all it could only apply where there had been a deliberate decision by the decision maker to ignore the condition attaching to the Return Endorsement. Whatever the concept of waiver, that concession was rightly made: Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd [1920] HCA 64 ; (1920) 28 CLR 305; Verwayen at 406, 473, 485 and 498.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Polat (1995) 57 FCR 98</tocase>
<text>149 In Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Polat (1995) 57 FCR 98, Davies and Branson JJ said at 107:
 
 'Estoppel will not operate so as to contradict a statute or to extend the authority of a decision-maker beyond that given by the statute.'

153 In 1984 he was issued with an Australian passport by the Australian Embassy in Belgrade and in 1990 he was issued with a second Australian passport by the same Embassy. He entered Australia twice in 1991 and 1992 on that second passport. On each occasion his passport was stamped with an arrival stamp. When he later applied to sponsor his Thai born wife and her child for permanent resident status when he was told that he was not, and never had been, an Australian citizen. He argued that he was entitled to the issue of an Australian passport and that the Minister was estopped so as to compel the Minister to grant him Australian citizenship. Burchett J said at 308-309:
 
 'Once this conclusion is reached, I do not think it is possible to find in the circumstances of the issue of the two passports to Mr Petrovski any foothold from estoppel that would control the exercise of the statutory powers of the Minister, so as to compel him to grant Australian citizenship to the respondent. The attempt to argue such an estoppel was met by a phalanx of cases that cannot be breached: Wyong Shire Council v Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd [1972] 1 NSWLR 114 at 142 per Hope J; Southend-On-Sea Corp v Hodgson (Wickford) Ltd [1962] 1 QB 416; Rubrico v Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs (1989) 23 FCR 208 at 229; Roberts v Repatriation Commission (1992) 39 FCR 420 at 425; Minister for Immigration, Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193; Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Polat (1995) 57 FCR 98 at 105, 107; Formosa v Secretary, Department of Social Security (1988) 46 FCR 117.'

<tocase>Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193</tocase>
<text>150 In Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Kurtovic (1990) 21 FCR 193, Gummow J at 208 said:
 
 'As a starting point, I should note that the present case is not one where a party asserts that the executive or other public authority is estopped from asserting that a particular action, of which the other party seeks performance, would be ultra vires as exceeding the powers given by or pursuant to a law of the Parliament. Any doctrine of estoppel in that context would threaten to undermine the doctrine of ultra vires by enabling public authorities to extend their powers both de facto and de jure by making representations beyond power, which they would then be estopped from denying. Rather, in the present case, the respondent seeks to prevent the appellant from making a decision within the latter's power which would have the effect of altering the previous intra vires decision. The respondent is then met with the objection that to allow an estoppel in this context would hinder or prevent further exercise of the statutory discretion.'

151 He later approved what he described as a generally accepted proposition in Halsbury's Laws of England (4 th ed), Volume 44 ' Statutes ', par 949:
 
 'Estoppel cannot operate to prevent or hinder the performance of a positive statutory duty, or the exercise of a statutory discretion which is intended to be performed or exercised for the benefit of the public or a section of the public.'

153 In 1984 he was issued with an Australian passport by the Australian Embassy in Belgrade and in 1990 he was issued with a second Australian passport by the same Embassy. He entered Australia twice in 1991 and 1992 on that second passport. On each occasion his passport was stamped with an arrival stamp. When he later applied to sponsor his Thai born wife and her child for permanent resident status when he was told that he was not, and never had been, an Australian citizen. He argued that he was entitled to the issue of an Australian passport and that the Minister was estopped so as to compel the Minister to grant him Australian citizenship.
