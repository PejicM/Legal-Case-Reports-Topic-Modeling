<text>The third major difficulty only confronts the applicant's case if it be assumed that the appointment of the second respondent to the classification of Leading Firefighter was in breach of the Award or the Certified Agreement. The difficulty is that of concluding that something done in breach of the relevant clauses of the Award and the Certified Agreement is to be treated as a nullity, in consequence of the breach. As I have said, none of the relevant provisions of the Award or the Certified Agreement appears to impose on the first respondent any obligation only to appoint to classifications persons with the required experience, much less any mandatory obligation. The question whether non-compliance with a statutory provision results in a particular act being treated as void no longer depends on the classification of the provision as mandatory or directory. Since Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [91] - [94] , it has been recognised that it is necessary to gather from the statute, or statutory instrument, as a whole the intention that non-compliance should lead to invalidity, before a conclusion can be reached that a non-complying act is to be treated as void. It is certainly not the case that non-compliance with an award made under the WR Act would necessarily lead to the conclusion that an act was void. See Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd [1995] HCA 24 ; (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 426-429 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey JJ and 453-457 per McHugh and Gummow JJ, and NTEIU v University of Wollongong [2002] FCA 31 at [38] - [39] . In the application of the approach favoured by Project Blue Sky , there are some guiding principles. One such guiding principle is that, where Parliament has chosen to make an act done in contravention of a statutory provision punishable by a specified penalty, it is unlikely that Parliament also intended other consequences, such as the invalidity of the act, to follow. See Yango Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v First Chicago Australia Ltd [1978] HCA 42 ; (1978) 139 CLR 410 at 429 per Mason J, with whom Aickin J agreed. In the present context, Parliament has chosen in s 178 of the WR Act to enforce obligations in awards and certified agreements by means of the imposition of civil financial penalties. As a consequence, it is unlikely that it also intended that acts done in contravention of the provisions of awards and certified agreements should be treated as void. To the extent (if any) to which the particular terms of an award or a certified agreement might disclose an intention that contravention is to lead to invalidity, they certainly do not do so in the present case. It would be extremely difficult to argue that a failure to observe strictly the elements of a definition, in the appointment of a person to a particular classification, would result in the invalidity of that appointment. As I have said, only if the appointment of the second respondent as a Leading Firefighter were to be regarded as invalid would it follow that there were contraventions of any of the relevant clauses of the Certified Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union &amp; Anor v Davies Bros Ltd (1986) 18 IR 444</tocase>
<text>Great caution must be exercised in attempting to rely upon the conduct of parties to an award or agreement as an aid in the interpretation of that award or agreement. Plainly, conduct subsequent to the making of an award or agreement is inadmissible as an aid to interpretation. See Seamen's Union of Australia v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1976) 46 FLR 444 at 445 and Printing &amp; Kindred Industries Union &amp; Anor v Davies Bros Ltd (1986) 18 IR 444 at 452. Only if it can be shown that there is a history of the use of a particular term with a particular meaning, sufficient to demonstrate a common understanding between or among the parties to an award or agreement that the term has that meaning, is there any possibility that the conduct of the parties can be relied on. The evidence in the present case goes nowhere near establishing such a common understanding. It would be necessary to show that the word "service" had been used in the same context in a previous Award or agreement, now superseded by the Award, and for there to be clear evidence that both the applicant and the first respondent understood the word to have a particular restricted meaning in that context. There is no evidence of either of these kinds in the present case. Such evidence as there is about custom and practice in the appointment by the first respondent by employees to classifications seems to indicate that there is a recognition that it is not always possible, or advisable, to rely upon the experience levels specified in the definitions in cl 2.9 of the Award strictly. There have been cases of accelerated advancement, when there have been vacancies in positions requiring particular classifications, and shortages of employees with the length of experience designated for those classifications. There is evidence that the Union actively assisted in the promotion of one firefighter, who had emigrated from England, because of the high level of his skills as a result of his long service with a firefighting authority in England. Custom and practice provides no support for the proposition that the word "service" should be given a particular restricted meaning when it is used in cl 2.9 of the Award.</text>
