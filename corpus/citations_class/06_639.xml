<tocase>NAHQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 297 ; (2003) 134 FCR 377</tocase>

<text>6 The decision under appeal in the proceedings before me is the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court on the remitted application for an order nisi . The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application on 16 January 2006. It may be that the true character of the application has the consequence that the Federal Magistrate's decision was an interlocutory decision: see NAHQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 297 ; (2003) 134 FCR 377 at 378 [3] . However, this point was not raised and I will proceed on the footing that the Federal Magistrate made a final decision which is the subject of this appeal.</text>

<tocase>Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/1558.html</AustLII>
<text>7 An appeal to this Court is in the nature of a re-hearing, but the right of appeal exists to correct error by the Federal Magistrate. The burden lies on the appellant to demonstrate that the judgment under appeal is the consequence of some legal, factual or discretionary error: see Abeyesinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1558 at [4] .

8 The grounds raised before the Federal Magistrate were, with one exception, identical to the grounds raised in the proceedings before Sackville J. The new ground was that the Tribunal was obliged to consider, and had failed to consider, the possibility that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ('BNP') might lose power in Bangladesh and that in such an eventuality, the appellant would be at risk of persecution if he were to return to Bangladesh.

9 The Federal Magistrate held that in respect of all of the grounds agitated before Sackville J, other than the new ground, a res judicata or issue estoppel applied which prevented the appellant from re-arguing the grounds that had been rejected by Sackville J. In my opinion, this finding by the Federal Magistrate was correct.</text>

<text>10 The Federal Magistrate observed that the new ground had not been specifically raised in the earlier proceedings before Sackville J. However, the Federal Magistrate found that if the applicant wished to rely on such a ground, it should have been raised in those earlier proceedings. He added that there was no evidence of any special circumstance as to why it was not raised in those earlier proceedings or why it should now be permitted to be raised: see Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722; S635 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 65 ; and VWZG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) FCA 1018.</text>

<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/1.html</AustLII>
<text>14 This complaint goes to a purely factual issue. To paraphrase McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423 [67] , this issue was a function of the primary decision-maker par excellence. This argument cannot support the appeal and it does not indicate any error on the part of the Tribunal that is capable of supporting this appeal.

15 Secondly, the appellant's written submissions contended that the Tribunal erroneously relied upon country information that contained the following comment:
 
 'The above independent evidence shows that people in the applicant's position can rely on the courts and on the authorities in regard to any false charges laid against him.' 
 

The appellant points to extracts from a report of the US State Department discussing the extent to which violence is a feature of politics in Bangladesh. Again, this complaint does not support the appeal. It goes to a factual matter lying within the province of the Tribunal.

16 The third ground raised in the written submissions was, in substance, the new ground I have already addressed, namely that the Tribunal did not consider the eventuality that the current regime of law and order in Bangladesh might collapse and that the old regime under which he claimed persecution might be reinstated. I have already rejected this argument as a basis for the appeal.</text>
