<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-996</tocase>
<text>31 In determining whether there has been an understanding for fixing prices, or a giving effect to such understanding, the relevant price may not necessarily be just a dollar figure: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-996 at [22]. Allegations in the amended statement of claim itself indicate that this may be so in the present case. As has been mentioned, the alleged Over-arching Understanding includes a provision that the minimum price for supply by Amcor was to be $1250 and the price for Visy $1150. The particulars sub-joined to that paragraph include (sub-par (b)(ii)(B)(6)) an allegation that Mr Debney said to Mr Brown of Amcor that the price for Visy should be lower "having regard to Visy's different cost structure and different product mix". Another example is in the case of the alleged GFL &amp; Nestle Price Understanding. Paragraph 81 alleges that in relation to the prices proposed to GFL by Visy and Amcor, Visy's prices were higher than Amcor's prices "and/or GFL held the belief that Visy's prices were higher than Amcor's prices". This rather suggests that GFL engaged in some form of analysis going beyond a comparison of two dollar figures. Similar allegations are made in relation to the understandings involving other customers. Also Mr Ward speaks of calculating a price "with reasonable accuracy".

32 Accordingly, it may (I stress these are early days) become an important part of the case to assess dollar figures charged to customers in the context of the various factors of which Mr Heathcote speaks to see whether there was an understanding on a price or a giving effect to that understanding. I do not see how the Visy respondents could adequately deal with issues of this kind without input from the individual Visy respondents and other officers of the Visy companies who are familiar with these factors and how they impact on ultimate dollar figures. Counsel for Amcor suggested that an independent expert such as an accountant be interposed, but this would be a cumbersome and inadequate substitute.</text>

<tocase>Ex parte Fielder Gillespie Limited [1984] 2 Qd R 339</tocase>
<text>33 In contrast to discovery under O 15 rr 1, 5 or 8, production under O 15 r 10 does not depend on any leave being given by the Court. The reason is obvious enough. When a document is directly relied on by an opposing party, basic procedural fairness would require that a party be able to inspect the document, if only to see whether it is what it is alleged to be. It may be that the only options available to the party served with an O 15 r 10 notice are those set out in sub-rule (2), viz, production, claiming privilege, or stating that the document is not in his possession and where he believes it is. On this basis confidentiality, either of the party receiving the notice or an outsider, would not be relevant since confidentiality is not one of the recognized grounds of privilege: Ex parte Fielder Gillespie Limited [1984] 2 Qd R 339 at 341.</text>

<tocase>Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] AC 280</tocase>
<text>35 By the end of the hearing it was common ground that if disclosure was not to be limited in the way Amcor sought then no express formal undertakings were required. The parties and their legal representatives are bound by the rule in Harman v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1983] AC 280 which says that parties and their legal representative obtaining documents in the course of discovery in litigation give an implied undertaking to the court not to use the documents, or allow them to be used, for any purpose other than the proper conduct of the proceeding.

36 There will be an order that the ACCC produce to the respondents the documents referred to in the amended statement of claim. The motion is otherwise dismissed. The parties may, within seven days, file written submissions as to costs.</text>

<tocase>Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd [1996] 2 VR 34</tocase>
<text>34 It is not necessary to decide this question because, assuming the confidentiality claimed by Amcor to be relevant, it is nevertheless outweighed by the centrality of the documents in question to the case against the respondents and the case they seek to make. In this regard I note that the leading Australian case on confidentiality in relation to the production of documents in litigation, the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Mobil Oil Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd [1996] 2 VR 34, dealt with ordinary discovery and not any equivalent of O 15 r 10. Hayne JA pointed out (at 39) that the information in the documents in question, which related to calculations of the proposed financial return to the plaintiff's rival bidders for a construction contract, was not directly in issue. The material did not bear on the case which the plaintiff sought to make (at 41).</text>

<tocase>Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1981) 39 ALR 665</tocase>
<text>37 Finally, two matters should be mentioned. First, there was some mention of s 157 of the Trade Practices Act . In view of the outcome under O 15 r 10 there is no need to rely on that provision. However, I should note that I am inclined to the view that the section is not concerned with documents on which the ACCC relies. Rather, it is directed towards documents obtained by the ACCC "which tend to establish the case of the corporation or other person": subs (1)(e). The "other person" is a natural person (as distinct from a corporation) against whom a proceeding is instituted: subs (1)(c). In Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1981) 39 ALR 665 at 671 Bowen CJ thought that the section did not extend to documents which might suggest some line of inquiry which could be of assistance to the corporation in conducting its case, although a document tending to impeach the plaintiff's case did tend to establish the defendant's case within the meaning of the section. This reasoning is inconsistent with the section applying to documents which only support the ACCC's case. Anyway, if this were not the case, the section would have simply referred to all relevant documents.

38 Secondly, the Visy respondents, in an argument adopted by Mr Carroll, submitted that in disclosing the documents to the ACCC, Amcor "must have known it was inevitable that documents such as these would be used in proceedings commenced by the ACCC against Visy, and took the risk of disclosure when facilitating serious proceedings against its major trade rival".

39 This argument should be firmly rejected. In disclosing to the ACCC (and also the Australian Stock Exchange) what it believed, on legal advice, to be unlawful conduct Amcor was complying with its legal obligations. The Court could not use Amcor's lawful action as a ground for depriving it of rights it might otherwise have.
