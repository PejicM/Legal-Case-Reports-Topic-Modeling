<text>3 I have power to set aside an order made under s 25(2B)(bb): s 25(2B)(bc). That power may be exercised even if the order dismissing the appeal has been formally entered: SZISM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 61.

4 It seems to me that it would be appropriate to set aside the order made on Wednesday, 14 November if I thought the applicant had good prospects of succeeding on the appeal.

5 The applicant seeks to appeal from an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 13 August 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 2 January 2007 and handed down on 5 January 2007.</text>
