<text>In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , Rares J observed that the Court ought to be very cautious to ensure that an injustice is not done to a party by summarily dismissing a proceeding where there may be contested questions of fact to be determined at trial and the resolution of that factual controversy might go one way or the other. Rares J also observed that s 31A is engaged only to determine summarily a claim or defence which has no reasonable prospect of success. That view has been followed in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 416 per Jacobson J [39]; Hicks v Ruddoch [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 per Tamberlin J [13] and Spiteri v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 905 per Edmond J [10] to [15].</text>

<tocase>Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2008/60.html</AustLII>
<text>In Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 , Finkelstein J at [22] suggested, in these terms, that s 31A of the Act had raised the bar in resisting dismissal of a proceeding: 
 If the test under s 31A raises the hurdle for the opposing party, it may be necessary for that party at a minimum to provide an outline of the evidence that will be relied upon. The outline must be sufficient to show that there is a genuine dispute about facts that are material to the outcome of the case. That will enable the judge to make some assessment of the merits . It would not, of course, be necessary, in most cases, to require the party to do more than provide an outline, because that would turn the summary judgment application into a trial. 

 
 [emphasis added]

Justice Gordon in Jefferson Ford at [126] suggested that an assessment of whether a proceeding has no reasonable prospect of success requires an analysis of the pleadings, an assessment of the facts and, in part at least, a review of some of the evidence.

In the present proceeding, there has been no engagement by the respondents with the amended pleading. That partly arises because the respondents contend that the amended pleading fails to plead material facts which establish, if proved, a cause of action based on accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse. Therefore, there can be no relevant engagement or an assessment in terms of the methodology contemplated by either Gordon J or Finkelstein J. Moreover, there can be no proper assessment of whether there is a genuine dispute as to factual matters as the material threshold facts have not been pleaded.

The applicants say that the pleading properly asserts material facts from which, if proved, accessorial liability in Mr Sasse can be established. Nevertheless, the applicants say that the application by the respondents is premature and, in any event, the application should be treated as an application going to the adequacy of the amended pleading. If the Court is not satisfied that the amended pleading properly frames material facts establishing a cause of action in accessorial liability, the relevant paragraphs of the pleading ought to be dismissed and the applicants ought to be given leave to re-plead the claims.

The first question then is whether the amended pleading properly frames a cause of action in accessorial liability on the part of Mr Sasse. The statutory framework</text>

<text>The pleading asserts conduct on the part of Mr Sasse in his capacity as an employee of John Holland and in every relevant sense he was acting within the scope of his authority. It is not said that the conduct of Mr Sasse gave rise to a contravention by John Holland. The pleading asserts that Mr Sasse aided, abetted, counselled and procured the contravention of the sections by John Holland. In order to establish that case, the pleading must assert as material facts that Mr Sasse was sufficiently aware of all of the relevant facts going to the contravention by the company, that is, intentional participation. In this case, it must be established that Mr Sasse had knowledge that the permit holders enjoyed a right of entry and notwithstanding that knowledge, he set about engaging in the contravening conduct. To form the requisite intent he must have had "knowledge of the essential matters which go to make up the offence whether or not he knows that those matters amount to a crime" ( Yorke &amp; Anor v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at pp 666 and 667; Giorgianni v The Queen [1985] HCA 29 ; (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 481; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Giraffe World Australia Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1161 ; (1999) 95 FCR 302 at 346; Rural Press Ltd &amp; Ors v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 ; (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [154] to [162]; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 ; Hamilton v Whitehead [1988] HCA 65 ; (1988) 166 CLR 121).</text>
