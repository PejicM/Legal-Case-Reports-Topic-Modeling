<tocase>Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553</tocase>
<text>9 The reasoning of the Tribunal appears in the following two paragraphs:
 
 The [Elliotts] say they do not fit within s 1207V(2)(d) because as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust they do not have any beneficial interest in the income or corpus of the trust. They referred to a number of authorities for this proposition, including Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 and Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ; see also R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1992) 10 WAR 59 at 79 per Owen J and Australian Securities Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 at para 28 per French J. 
 
 The [Secretary] say [s] the words of the section change whatever the position might be at general law. Mr Belcher argued use of the word aggregate 'requires consideration of what the combined beneficial interest of the beneficiaries would be as if they were collected or united into one'. The only persons who can benefit under the trust are the [Elliotts] , their daughter and other persons who, upon their birth, would be relatives of the [Elliotts] . The beneficiaries at any given time are therefore associates of each other. Between them, they account for the whole of the beneficial interest in the property. I agree with this approach. While the individual respondents do not hold any beneficial interest under the general law, the use of the word aggregate in the statute requires the decision-maker to recognise a kind of group right arising when the beneficiaries between them control the whole of the beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust: cf Gartside at 606 per Lord Reid. The use of the associate concept requires the 'group' interest to be attributed to the [Elliotts] because they are related to the other group members. It follows the [Elliotts] hold in excess of 50% of the beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust assets. They therefore satisfy the control test. 

Hence, the Tribunal held that the trust was a "controlled private trust" within the meaning of s 1207V of the Social Security Act and set aside the SSAT decision to the contrary.

17 The Elliotts argued that, under the trust created by clause 5(b), until the trustees exercised their discretion to make payment out of the trust fund to them, they have merely a right to invoke the equitable jurisdiction of a court to ensure that the trust is duly administered and that the trustees exercise their discretion properly. It followed, so they said, that they could not affect the outcome of the trustees' decision-making process in order to secure the payment of trust funds to themselves. In this circumstance, so they submitted, neither they nor their daughter (or any other discretionary beneficiary) could hold a beneficial interest in the corpus or income of the trust within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d). Accordingly, so they contended, they could not satisfy par (d) of subs 1207V(2) since none of the discretionary beneficiaries held a beneficial interest capable of being aggregated. Counsel for the Elliotts supported this argument by reference to such authorities as Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ( "Gartside" ), R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 59 (" Anchorage ") and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 (" Carey ").

25 The Social Security Act does not define "beneficial interests". The expression "beneficial interest" has no precise received meaning: compare RP Meagher, JD Heydon, and MJ Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (Butterworths, LexisNexis, 4th ed, 2002) at [4-040] and R Speed, "Beneficial Ownership" (1997) 26 ATR Rev 34 at 50. Indeed, the word "interest" is itself "capable of a very wide and general meaning": see Gartside at 617 per Lord Wilberforce; Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston (1964) 112 CLR 12 (" Livingston ") at 22 per Viscount Radcliffe; and CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [2005] HCA 53 ; (2005) 224 CLR 98 at 114 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. The expression "beneficial interests" therefore falls to be interpreted principally by reference to the statutory context in which it is used, and any guidance that the general law can provide. The Court may also have regard to extrinsic materials such as the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill to confirm that the ordinary meaning of the expression is applicable or to assist in resolving any ambiguity: see Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15AB.

39 Under clause 5(b) of the will, each of the Elliotts and their daughter has a right to be considered by the trustees as a possible recipient of a payment out of the income and capital of the trust in accordance with the terms of the trust. They also have a right to have the trustees consider whether they should be permitted to reside rent free in any property forming part of the estate. Each of them has a right to have the trust administered duly and properly: compare Gartside at 617-8 per Lord Wilberforce. They also had a right to receive information about the management of the trust fund and to see trust documents: see [44] below. Furthermore, the discretionary beneficiaries have a right to trace and follow the trust assets if they are misappropriated: Livingston 23-24; also Hardingham IJ and Baxt R, Discretionary Trusts (Butterworths, 2 nd ed, 1984) at [517]. It is by no means self-evident, however, that, because of these rights, any of them has "beneficial interests in the corpus or income of the trust" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d) of the Social Security Act .

41 As noted earlier, counsel for the Elliotts placed a good deal of reliance on the decision of the House of Lords in Gartside in which a question arose as to whether a person who might benefit, in his lifetime, from the exercise of a trustee's power to make payment to him out of a fund under a discretionary trust held an "interest in possession" within the meaning of s 43 of the Finance Act 1940 so as to attract a tax on death. Gartside held that there was no "interest in possession" within the meaning of the relevant statute: see Gartside at 618 per Lord Wilberforce, with whom Lord Hodson agreed; also 607 per Lord Reid, with whom Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest and Lord Guest agreed. Whilst the answer is immaterial here, their Lordships' consideration of the nature of the right held by an object of a discretionary trust is helpful. The trust in question was similar in relevant terms to the trust created by clause 5(b) of the will, as the following observations of Lord Wilberforce (at 614-5) show:
 
 Under the trusts of income which applied during his life, no one of [the] beneficiaries had any right to receive any income. The trustees had an absolute discretion to distribute or to withhold distribution of the income of any year, and, as regards any income they decided to distribute, to give all or none of it to any one beneficiary. Any undistributed income had, during the permissible period, to be accumulated, i.e., added to capital. 
 
 ... It is also necessary to appreciate that the discretionary beneficiaries taken together had no right to receive any or, a fortiori, all of the income. ... [T] he trustees had power to accumulate so much as they did not distribute, which might be the whole, for the possible benefit of persons unborn. To describe them as 'the only people who could during the relevant period obtain any benefit from the property or have any beneficial enjoyment of it' may be misleading, unless one bears in mind that, singly or collectively, they had no right in any year to receive a penny.

42 Gartside therefore reinforces what is largely evident from clause 5(b) that, until the trustees exercise their discretion in his or her favour, none of the discretionary beneficiaries has a right to receive any payment of income or capital. At most, each has a right to require the trustees to consider whether to make such a payment in accordance with the terms of the trust: see [39] above. The question remains whether the Elliotts' entitlements as discretionary beneficiaries gives rise to "beneficial interests in the corpus or income of the trust" within par 1207V(2)(d) of the Social Security Act .

43 The second of the decisions relied on by the Elliotts was that of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Anchorage , which involved contempt proceedings for alleged breach of a Mareva injunction. The question for determination was whether certain transactions amounted to breach of the injunction. A person bound by the injunction exercised his power as the appointor under a trust deed to make his son guardian of the trust and removed himself as appointor. His son removed the other trustee, Anchorage, and appointed a company with which he was associated in its stead. The new trustee, with his consent and that of his wife, declared that they were excluded as general beneficiaries. The Bank argued that the transactions breached the injunction. On appeal, Owen J, with whom Ipp J agreed, held that a beneficiary of the trust in question did not have any proprietary interest in any particular assets of the trust fund or in the fund as a whole. Owen J said (at 79):
 
 The Trust Deed confers on the trustee a mere power. It is a power of very wide import. The trustee can determine whether an individual beneficiary is to benefit at all, and if so, in what way, from the exercise of the power in his or her favour. In this sense, the beneficiary has nothing more than an expectancy. The trustee has a duty to administer the trust bona fide having regard to the purpose for which it was established. This is a duty which the court will enforce at the behest of a beneficiary. In this way, the remedy defines the nature of the interest of an individual beneficiary. It is to require the trustee to consider the matter, to decide whether or not to exercise the power and, if the power is to be exercised, to do so correctly in accordance with the terms of the trust ... Such a right is an equitable chose in action. 

Owen J added (at 80) that, in the case of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust, '[t]he exercise of the rights implicit in the chose in action might not result in any financial benefit to the beneficiary concerned". At the level of principle, Anchorage affirms Gartside but, once again, provides limited guidance on the question at hand.

46 Furthermore, Gartside , Anchorage , Carey and Livingston (see Weinberg J's discussion in Geeves at 143) make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an "interest" or "beneficial interest", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute: compare M Stone and V Lesnie, "Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Ownership in Revenue Law" (1996) 19(1) UNSW Law Journal 181 at 183 and David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, Underhill and Hayton Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Butterworths, 17 th ed, 2006) at [1.1]. Of course, this is not to say that, in a particular statute, such rights might not be so regarded and described. The question, then, is whether or not the rights of the discretionary beneficiaries in this case amount to "beneficial interests in the corpus or income" such that they might be "aggregated" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d).</text>

Mr Belcher argued use of the word aggregate 'requires consideration of what the combined beneficial interest of the beneficiaries would be as if they were collected or united into one'. The only persons who can benefit under the trust are the [Elliotts] , their daughter and other persons who, upon their birth, would be relatives of the [Elliotts] .

Accordingly, so they contended, they could not satisfy par (d) of subs 1207V(2) since none of the discretionary beneficiaries held a beneficial interest capable of being aggregated. Counsel for the Elliotts supported this argument by reference to such authorities as Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ( "Gartside" ), R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1993) 10 WAR 59 (" Anchorage ") and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 ; (2006) 153 FCR 509 (" Carey ").

35 The nature of the rights enjoyed by the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust depends very much on the terms of the discretionary trust in question: see, e.g., the discussion in Carey at 515-6 per French J. Adopting the terminology that his Honour there uses, the trust created under clause 5(b) is a "non-exhaustive" trust because the trustees have a discretion (subject to the directions previously mentioned at [15] above) to distribute part or none of the income and capital of the trust as they see fit: see Carey at 516. The discretionary beneficiaries are an "open" class: see Carey at 516. That is, the trust is capable of benefiting not only living family members (the Elliotts and their daughter) but also persons as yet unborn. As French J commented in Carey at 516, "[t]he naming of these species of discretionary trusts, like the term 'discretionary trust' itself, is a matter of taxonomical convenience rather than expository of principle". At the same time, as French J's discussion in Carey shows, the distinction between "exhaustive" and "non-exhaustive" and "closed" and "open" trusts may have a significant bearing on the nature of the rights or interests held by the discretionary beneficiaries.

36 For example, as French J records, the Court of Appeal in Re Nelson [1928] Ch 920 at 921-2 (" Re Nelson ") held that the three beneficiaries of an exhaustive discretionary trust with a closed class were able to mortgage their share and interest under a will since they were "of age and sui juris" and concurred "in assigning by way of mortgage their interest". In that case, Swinfen Eady MR distinguished the earlier case of Re Coleman (1888) LR 39 Ch D 443 (" Re Coleman "), where the trustees had power to apply the income of the trust fund for the benefit of a class or any one of them to the exclusion of the others (as in the present case). In Re Coleman, one of the beneficiaries assigned his share and claimed that an appropriate portion should be paid to his assignee. In Re Nelson at 921, the Master of the Rolls said (in relation to the issue in Re Coleman ):
 
 The answer to that was that he did not take an equal fourth or any other share and the trustees could have applied the whole of the income to the other members of that class. That is quite a different case from the present, where all the members of the class have assigned their shares to the mortgagees. 


Having regard to these authorities, French J concluded in Carey (at 517) that "[w]here there is an exhaustive discretionary trust with a closed class of beneficiaries, then all the beneficiaries may collectively require the trustee to transfer the fund to them or deal with the property subject to discretion as if they were the absolute owners of it". This is not, however, the position with respect to a non-exhaustive trust where the class of objects is open, as in the case of the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will.

44 The third of the decisions on which the Elliotts relied was that of French J in Carey , where a receiver was appointed under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in respect of the property of a person under investigation. Holding that the provision applied to the relevant person's equitable estate or interest in property the subject of a non-discretionary or fixed trust, his Honour turned to the "less straightforward question ... when the relevant person is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust": see Carey at 515. At 518-9, his Honour stated his opinion that "in the ordinary case the beneficiary of a discretionary trust, other than perhaps the sole beneficiary of an exhaustive trust, does not have an equitable interest in the trust income or property ... amenable to control by receivers under s 1323". His Honour accepted that "there are some rights enjoyed, even by the beneficiaries of a non-exhaustive discretionary trust with an open class of beneficiaries" such as the right to inspect trust documents, the right to require the trustee to provide information about the management of the trust fund, and a right to enforce proper management of the trust by the trustee. In Carey at 520, French J rejected the submission that a beneficiary under a discretionary trust held a contingent interest, saying:
 
 The difficulty with applying the notion of contingent interests to beneficiaries of a discretionary trust lies partly in the uncertain scope of the distribution be it income or capital, which may be made in favour of any given beneficiary. I am inclined to think that a beneficiary in such a case, at arms length from the trustee, does not have a "contingent interest" but rather an expectancy or mere possibility of a distribution. 

His Honour noted that different considerations arose where a discretionary trust is controlled by a trustee "who is in truth the alter ego of a beneficiary" (at 520). This observation is pertinent in the context of subs 1207V(2) of the Social Security Act .

45 Carey is helpful at the level of principle, amongst other reasons, because it concentrates attention on the terms of the particular trust in question. It also draws attention to the fact that the degree of control, if any, that a discretionary beneficiary may enjoy under a discretionary trust depends on the terms of the trust, having regard to the circumstances of the case. Subsection 1207V(2) works on a similar assumption. It is therefore a mistake to treat all so-called discretionary trusts in the same way, as the Secretary's argument tends to do.

46 Furthermore, Gartside , Anchorage , Carey and Livingston (see Weinberg J's discussion in Geeves at 143) make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an "interest" or "beneficial interest", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute: compare M Stone and V Lesnie, "Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Ownership in Revenue Law" (1996) 19(1) UNSW Law Journal 181 at 183 and David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, Underhill and Hayton Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Butterworths, 17 th ed, 2006) at [1.1]. Of course, this is not to say that, in a particular statute, such rights might not be so regarded and described. The question, then, is whether or not the rights of the discretionary beneficiaries in this case amount to "beneficial interests in the corpus or income" such that they might be "aggregated" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d).</text>

<tocase>Sir Moses Montefiore Jewish Home v Howell and Co (No 7) Pty Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 406</tocase>
<text>18 The Elliotts had no power, so their counsel submitted, to terminate the trust, which would end only with the death of the survivor. This was not, so their counsel said, a case like Sir Moses Montefiore Jewish Home v Howell and Co (No 7) Pty Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 406 (" Montefiore "), which extended the rule in Saunders v Vautier [1841] EngR 765 ; (1841) 4 Beav 115 ; 41 ER 482 (" Saunders v Vautier ") to a discretionary trust, because the objects of the trust established under clause 5(b) of the will were not closed and extended to the unborn children of the Elliotts (if any) and the descendants of the Elliotts' children, including Susan Elliott's descendants (if any).

38 Thus, this case is different from Montefiore , where Kearney J held, by reference to the rule in Saunders v Vautier , that, where the class of objects of a discretionary trust was closed and the income was required to be paid each year to one or more of the objects, the objects acting together could terminate the discretionary trust: see Montefiore at 410-11. Whilst his Honour considered it "odd" that "all the objects should collectively enjoy a beneficial ownership entitling them to invoke the rule in Saunders v Vautier which is different in character from the aggregate of their individual interests", he held nonetheless that such an entitlement existed: see Montefiore at 411. In contrast to this, the terms of the trust under clause 5(b) do not require the trustees to pay the trust income at any particular interval or at all to one or other of the objects, but, subject to the directions already noted, would permit the trustees to accumulate income as they saw fit and, as already stated, the class of discretionary beneficiaries is not closed: compare JD Heydon and MJ Leeming, Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia (LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia, 2006) at [2315].</text>

<tocase>Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 ; (2004) 136 FCR 134 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/166.html</AustLII>
<text>22 Counsel for the Secretary submitted that "a beneficial interest" would exist for the purposes of par 1207V(2)(d) where there was "the entitlement ... to enforce the due administration of the trust, and ... the capacity to receive property or interest". On this submission, the position at general law was very largely immaterial. Relying on Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 ; (2004) 136 FCR 134 (" Geeves ") and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 368 and 381, the Secretary argued that a broad construction of par 1207V(2)(d) was consistent with the purpose of Pt 3.18, which was to capture the kind of arrangements made by the testamentary trust in question here. The Secretary maintained that par 1207V(2)(d) was specifically intended to capture discretionary trust entitlements; and that, if I were to accept the Elliotts' submissions, then par 1207V(2)(d) would not operate to capture discretionary trust beneficiaries as intended. The Secretary emphasised the Elliotts' practical capacity to have access to the income and assets of the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will and that they benefited from regular payments out of trust funds. The Secretary noted that all possible discretionary beneficiaries were necessarily "associates" and argued that their interests could be aggregated, with the result that the Elliotts should be considered to pass the control test via par 1207V(2)(d).

40 The authorities provide little direct assistance on the principal question in the case. The Secretary referred to Geeves , which gave rise to the question whether a court-ordered trust fund was to be taken into account in valuing the "assets" held by the sole beneficiary for the purpose of the assets test in s 198(1B) of the Social Security Act . Geeves is, plainly enough, a different case from the present. It did not concern a discretionary trust where the entitlement of a beneficiary is unascertained. Geeves related to a private trust with an ascertained beneficiary, who therefore held a proprietary interest in the property subject to the trust. The Full Court upheld the primary judge's decision that the trust was an "excluded trust" and therefore its assets could not be attributed for the purposes of the assets test. This finding provides no guidance here. Keifel J, with whom Weinberg J agreed, also held that the beneficiary's interest in the trust assets was not to be regarded as 'property' or 'assets' within the meaning of s 11 of the Social Security Act , because the trust assets could not be utilised by the beneficiary: see Geeves at 141. Keifel J's comments in this regard have some bearing on the present case. Her Honour said (at 141-2):
 
 The evident focus of the Act, in my view, is upon assets which are available for a person's use. It does not seem to be consistent with the purpose of the Act to require that assets which are not able to be utilised by a person are to be taken into account in assessing whether they qualify for the benefit in question. ... 
 
 Even on a wider view of property a discretionary trust would not qualify. It could in no sense be said to be the property of a person who is not yet identified as a beneficiary of it. For the purposes of the Act, however, some beneficiaries of discretionary trusts in reality, if not in law, have access to the trust assets because they are in a position to control the trust. The amendments of 2000 recognise and deal with such a situation. They and the Explanatory Memorandum tend to confirm, in my view, that it is assets which are in truth available to a person which are relevant for the purposes of the Act. 
 ... 
 I would therefore conclude that [the beneficiary's] interest in the trust assets would not be regarded as property or assets within the meaning of s 11 of the Act. The amendments of 2000 have the effect however that they would nevertheless be attributed to him. Whilst not in control in the same sense as persons who control discretionary trusts, he would pass the control test set up by s 1207V(2) because his beneficial interest in the trust fund would be 50% or more. The presumption here is that he does have a measure of control because of the extent of his interests. The Secretary's declaration exempts a court-ordered trust, such as that in question here, from the attribution rules. It puts beyond doubt that they are not to be included in the value of the care receiver's assets. 

It seems to me that, to the extent that this passage elucidates the present question, it tends against the Secretary's argument. First, it emphasises that the purpose of subs 1207V(2) is to make assets that are in reality available to a person relevant for the purposes of determining pension entitlements and, secondly, it underscores the fact that regard must be had to the question of control, having regard to the particular trust in question. This indicates that it is incorrect to view every discretionary trust in the same light; instead, attention must be paid to the particular terms of each trust, whether fixed or discretionary, and to the criteria to which subs 1207V(2) direct attention.

46 Furthermore, Gartside , Anchorage , Carey and Livingston (see Weinberg J's discussion in Geeves at 143) make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an "interest" or "beneficial interest", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute: compare M Stone and V Lesnie, "Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Ownership in Revenue Law" (1996) 19(1) UNSW Law Journal 181 at 183 and David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, Underhill and Hayton Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Butterworths, 17 th ed, 2006) at [1.1]. Of course, this is not to say that, in a particular statute, such rights might not be so regarded and described. The question, then, is whether or not the rights of the discretionary beneficiaries in this case amount to "beneficial interests in the corpus or income" such that they might be "aggregated" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d).</text>

<text>22 Counsel for the Secretary submitted that "a beneficial interest" would exist for the purposes of par 1207V(2)(d) where there was "the entitlement ... to enforce the due administration of the trust, and ... the capacity to receive property or interest". On this submission, the position at general law was very largely immaterial. Relying on Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Geeves [2004] FCAFC 166 ; (2004) 136 FCR 134 (" Geeves ") and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 29 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 368 and 381, the Secretary argued that a broad construction of par 1207V(2)(d) was consistent with the purpose of Pt 3.18, which was to capture the kind of arrangements made by the testamentary trust in question here. The Secretary maintained that par 1207V(2)(d) was specifically intended to capture discretionary trust entitlements; and that, if I were to accept the Elliotts' submissions, then par 1207V(2)(d) would not operate to capture discretionary trust beneficiaries as intended. The Secretary emphasised the Elliotts' practical capacity to have access to the income and assets of the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will and that they benefited from regular payments out of trust funds.

<tocase>Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston (1964) 112 CLR 12</tocase>
<text>25 The Social Security Act does not define "beneficial interests". The expression "beneficial interest" has no precise received meaning: compare RP Meagher, JD Heydon, and MJ Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (Butterworths, LexisNexis, 4th ed, 2002) at [4-040] and R Speed, "Beneficial Ownership" (1997) 26 ATR Rev 34 at 50. Indeed, the word "interest" is itself "capable of a very wide and general meaning": see Gartside at 617 per Lord Wilberforce; Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Qld) v Livingston (1964) 112 CLR 12 (" Livingston ") at 22 per Viscount Radcliffe; and CPT Custodian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue [2005] HCA 53 ; (2005) 224 CLR 98 at 114 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ. The expression "beneficial interests" therefore falls to be interpreted principally by reference to the statutory context in which it is used, and any guidance that the general law can provide. The Court may also have regard to extrinsic materials such as the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill to confirm that the ordinary meaning of the expression is applicable or to assist in resolving any ambiguity: see Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), s 15AB.

39 Under clause 5(b) of the will, each of the Elliotts and their daughter has a right to be considered by the trustees as a possible recipient of a payment out of the income and capital of the trust in accordance with the terms of the trust. They also have a right to have the trustees consider whether they should be permitted to reside rent free in any property forming part of the estate. Each of them has a right to have the trust administered duly and properly: compare Gartside at 617-8 per Lord Wilberforce. They also had a right to receive information about the management of the trust fund and to see trust documents: see [44] below. Furthermore, the discretionary beneficiaries have a right to trace and follow the trust assets if they are misappropriated: Livingston 23-24; also Hardingham IJ and Baxt R, Discretionary Trusts (Butterworths, 2 nd ed, 1984) at [517]. It is by no means self-evident, however, that, because of these rights, any of them has "beneficial interests in the corpus or income of the trust" within the meaning of par 1207V(2)(d) of the Social Security Act .

46 Furthermore, Gartside , Anchorage , Carey and Livingston (see Weinberg J's discussion in Geeves at 143) make it plain that, although the object of a discretionary trust holds a bundle of rights, these rights do not necessarily amount to what can be termed an "interest" or "beneficial interest", when considered from the perspective of a particular statute: compare M Stone and V Lesnie, "Some Thoughts on Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Ownership in Revenue Law" (1996) 19(1) UNSW Law Journal 181 at 183 and David Hayton, Paul Matthews &amp; Charles Mitchell, Underhill and Hayton Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees (LexisNexis Butterworths, 17 th ed, 2006) at [1.1].

<tocase>Anstis v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2002] FCA 1043</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2002/1043.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The expression "beneficial interests in the corpus or income of the trust" appears in subs 1207V(2), which is an important part of Pt 3.18 of the Social Security Act . Part 3.18 introduced a system for the attribution to individuals of the assets and income of private companies and private trusts: see Anstis v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2002] FCA 1043 at [3] - [4] . It must be borne in mind that, broadly speaking, in order to qualify for a pension under the Social Security Act , a person must satisfy an assets test and an income test. Simply put, a would-be pensioner may receive the lower of the two amounts that result from the application of the assets test and the income test. Pt 3.18 is part of this regime.

27 Subsection 1207X(2) of the Social Security Act , which is in Pt 3.18 , concerns private trusts. This subsection relevantly provides that, for the purposes of Pt 3.18 , if a trust is a "controlled private trust" in relation to an individual (and par 1207X(2)(b) is satisfied), then the individual is an "attributable stakeholder" of the trust (unless the Secretary determines otherwise). If the individual is an attributable stakeholder, then, pursuant to pars 1207X(2)(d) and (e), the individual's "asset attribution percentage" and "income attribution percentage" in relation to the trust is either 100%, or such lower percentage as the Secretary determines. Pursuant to subs 1207V(1), for the purposes of Pt 3.18 , a trust is a "controlled private trust" in relation to an individual if the trust is a "designated private trust" (as defined in subs 1207P(1)) and the individual passes the "control test" in subs 1207V(2) or the "source test" in subs 1207V(3). No issue arises in this case as to the application of subs 1207V(3).

28 Subsection 1207V(1) of the Social Security Act provides:
 
 For the purposes of this Part, a trust is a controlled private trust in relation to an individual if the trust is a designated private trust and: 
 (a ) the individual passes the control test set out in subsection (2); or 
 (b) the individual passes the source test set out in subsection(3). 

It is common ground that the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will is a "designated private trust": see subs 1207P(1).

29 Subsection 1207V(2) provides:
 
 For the purposes of this section, the individual passes the control test in relation to a trust if: 
 (a ) the individual, or an associate of the individual ... is the trustee, or any of the trustees, of the trust; or 
 (b) a group in relation to the individual was able to remove or appoint the trustee, or any of the trustees, of the trust; or 
 (c) a group in relation to the individual was able to vary the trust deed or to veto the decisions of the trustee; or 
 
 
 (d) the aggregate of: 
 
 
 ( i) the beneficial interests in the corpus or income of the trust held by the individual (whether directly or indirectly); and 
 (ii) the beneficial interests in the corpus or the income of the trust held by associates of the individual (whether directly or indirectly); 
 is 50% or more; or 
 
 
 (e) a group in relation to the individual had the power (by means of the exercise by the group of any power of appointment or revocation or otherwise) to obtain, with or without the consent of any other entity, the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or income of the trust; 
 (f) a group in relation to the individual was able in any manner whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, to control the application of the corpus or income of the trust; or 
 (g) a group in relation the individual was capable under a scheme of gaining the enjoyment or the control referred to in paragraph (e) or (f); or 
 (h) a trustee of the trust was accustomed or under an obligation (whether formally or informally) or might reasonably be expected to act in accordance with the directions, instructions or wishes of a group in relation to the individual. (Emphasis added.)

30 It is common ground that the only question in this proceeding is as to the application of par 1207V(2)(d). As noted above, the Elliotts challenged the Tribunal's finding that they passed the control test in relation to the trust established under clause 5(b) of the will on the basis that they satisfied par 1207V(2)(d) of the Social Security Act . The Tribunal confined its attention to this paragraph. It did not consider whether the Elliotts satisfied the control test by reference to any other paragraph in subs 1207V(2), the SSAT having previously determined to the contrary. The Secretary did not contend that there was any error in its approach in this regard.</text>

<tocase>Re Nelson [1928] Ch 920</tocase>
<text>36 For example, as French J records, the Court of Appeal in Re Nelson [1928] Ch 920 at 921-2 (" Re Nelson ") held that the three beneficiaries of an exhaustive discretionary trust with a closed class were able to mortgage their share and interest under a will since they were "of age and sui juris" and concurred "in assigning by way of mortgage their interest". In that case, Swinfen Eady MR distinguished the earlier case of Re Coleman (1888) LR 39 Ch D 443 (" Re Coleman "), where the trustees had power to apply the income of the trust fund for the benefit of a class or any one of them to the exclusion of the others (as in the present case). In Re Coleman, one of the beneficiaries assigned his share and claimed that an appropriate portion should be paid to his assignee. In Re Nelson at 921, the Master of the Rolls said (in relation to the issue in Re Coleman ):
 
 The answer to that was that he did not take an equal fourth or any other share and the trustees could have applied the whole of the income to the other members of that class. That is quite a different case from the present, where all the members of the class have assigned their shares to the mortgagees. 


Having regard to these authorities, French J concluded in Carey (at 517) that "[w]here there is an exhaustive discretionary trust with a closed class of beneficiaries, then all the beneficiaries may collectively require the trustee to transfer the fund to them or deal with the property subject to discretion as if they were the absolute owners of it". This is not, however, the position with respect to a non-exhaustive trust where the class of objects is open, as in the case of the trust created under clause 5(b) of the will.</text>

<tocase>Saunders v Vautier [1841] EngR 765 ; (1841) 4 Beav 115 ; 41 ER 482</tocase>
<text>18 The Elliotts had no power, so their counsel submitted, to terminate the trust, which would end only with the death of the survivor. This was not, so their counsel said, a case like Sir Moses Montefiore Jewish Home v Howell and Co (No 7) Pty Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 406 (" Montefiore "), which extended the rule in Saunders v Vautier [1841] EngR 765 ; (1841) 4 Beav 115 ; 41 ER 482 (" Saunders v Vautier ") to a discretionary trust, because the objects of the trust established under clause 5(b) of the will were not closed and extended to the unborn children of the Elliotts (if any) and the descendants of the Elliotts' children, including Susan Elliott's descendants (if any).

38 Thus, this case is different from Montefiore , where Kearney J held, by reference to the rule in Saunders v Vautier , that, where the class of objects of a discretionary trust was closed and the income was required to be paid each year to one or more of the objects, the objects acting together could terminate the discretionary trust: see Montefiore at 410-11. Whilst his Honour considered it "odd" that "all the objects should collectively enjoy a beneficial ownership entitling them to invoke the rule in Saunders v Vautier which is different in character from the aggregate of their individual interests", he held nonetheless that such an entitlement existed: see Montefiore at 411. In contrast to this, the terms of the trust under clause 5(b) do not require the trustees to pay the trust income at any particular interval or at all to one or other of the objects, but, subject to the directions already noted, would permit the trustees to accumulate income as they saw fit and, as already stated, the class of discretionary beneficiaries is not closed: compare JD Heydon and MJ Leeming, Jacobs' Law of Trusts in Australia (LexisNexis Butterworths, Australia, 2006) at [2315].</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/628.html</AustLII>
<text>9 The reasoning of the Tribunal appears in the following two paragraphs:
 
 The [Elliotts] say they do not fit within s 1207V(2)(d) because as beneficiaries under a discretionary trust they do not have any beneficial interest in the income or corpus of the trust. They referred to a number of authorities for this proposition, including Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Buckle [1998] HCA 4 ; (1998) 192 CLR 226 and Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1967] UKHL 6 ; [1968] AC 553 ; see also R &amp; I Bank of Western Australia Ltd v Anchorage Investments Pty Ltd (1992) 10 WAR 59 at 79 per Owen J and Australian Securities Investments Commission; In the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 6) [2006] FCA 814 at para 28 per French J. 
 
 The [Secretary] say [s] the words of the section change whatever the position might be at general law. Mr Belcher argued use of the word aggregate 'requires consideration of what the combined beneficial interest of the beneficiaries would be as if they were collected or united into one'. The only persons who can benefit under the trust are the [Elliotts] , their daughter and other persons who, upon their birth, would be relatives of the [Elliotts] . The beneficiaries at any given time are therefore associates of each other. Between them, they account for the whole of the beneficial interest in the property. I agree with this approach. While the individual respondents do not hold any beneficial interest under the general law, the use of the word aggregate in the statute requires the decision-maker to recognise a kind of group right arising when the beneficiaries between them control the whole of the beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust: cf Gartside at 606 per Lord Reid. The use of the associate concept requires the 'group' interest to be attributed to the [Elliotts] because they are related to the other group members. It follows the [Elliotts] hold in excess of 50% of the beneficial interest in the corpus of the trust assets. They therefore satisfy the control test. 

Hence, the Tribunal held that the trust was a "controlled private trust" within the meaning of s 1207V of the Social Security Act and set aside the SSAT decision to the contrary.

54 As to the form of orders, subs 44(4) of the AAT Act empowers the Court to "hear and determine the appeal and make such orders as it thinks appropriate by reason of its decision". In appropriate circumstances, the court may make a decision in substitution for that under review: see, e.g., Harradine v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1989] FCA 200 ; (1989) 25 FCR 35 and Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health v Theologidis [1991] FCA 628 ; (1991) 33 FCR 186. Pursuant to subs 44(5) the power extends to the making of an order affirming or setting aside the decision of the Tribunal and an order remitting the case. By subs 43(1), the Tribunal itself is empowered to make a decision affirming, varying or setting aside the decision under review and, in the latter event, making a decision in substitution or remitting the case for reconsideration.</text>
