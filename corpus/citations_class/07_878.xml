<tocase>Collier Constructions Pty Ltd v Foskett Pty Ltd (1992) 33 FCR 591</tocase>
<text>11 As French J held in Collier Constructions Pty Ltd v Foskett Pty Ltd (1992) 33 FCR 591 at 592, the purpose of the subsection "is to require prospective applicants in proceedings in this Court, when the money sum or damages claim is likely to be modest, to consider the desirability to proceeding in another jurisdiction ..."</text>

<tocase>Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287</tocase>
<text>12 The damages sought by the applicant in this proceeding were far from modest. They amounted to $1,380,000. This was not a case which, had the applicant's principal submissions been accepted, it was likely that the best that could be hoped for by way of damages would have been less than $100,000. Moreover, the issues were complex as evidenced by the engagement, on both sides, of senior counsel and the length of the submissions made on behalf of both parties: cf Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd (2006) 227 ALR 287 at 293. These considerations warrant, in my view, a departure from the general rule.

13 There should, therefore, be an order that costs not be reduced pursuant to O 62 r 36A(1) of the Rules. Save for the addition of this order and the deletion of the words "reduced by one third" in the first of the two orders proposed by the respondent the orders of the Court should be in accordance with those proposed by the respondent.
