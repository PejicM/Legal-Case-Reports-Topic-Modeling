<text>2 The applicant brought an application for an interlocutory injunction. Upon the respondent giving undertakings that it would not use the name "Oxford" in connection with debt factoring, debt financing or debt collection services or outsourcing services in relation to accounts receivable administration, I dismissed the application and reserved the costs thereof: Oxford Funding Pty Ltd v Oxford Asia Pacific Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1637. An important element was a consideration of the balance of convenience: see [14].

3 Following protracted negotiations the parties have now resolved their differences and executed a deed of settlement. However, the question of the costs of the proceeding remains in issue.

4 The applicant submits that the respondent should pay all of its costs, or alternatively all of its costs up to and including the injunction application. The respondent's case is that the applicant should pay its costs of the injunction application or, alternatively, that each party should bear its own costs of the whole proceeding. All costs orders are sought on a party/party basis.</text>

<text>5 The Court has undoubted jurisdiction to make an order for costs notwithstanding that the proceeding has otherwise settled; see for example Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 (Hill J), Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 at 624-625 (McHugh J), We Two Pty Ltd v Shorrock [2002] FCA 875 (Finkelstein J). While any question of costs always remains a matter of discretion, the approach in the cases is usually that the Court will not try a hypothetical action to decide which party would have won. Rather, the Court will assess the conduct of the parties including, in appropriate cases, the conduct prior to the commencement of proceedings, to see whether that conduct was "reasonable". This rather suggests that an order will only be made where the party seeking costs has acted reasonably and the other party has not. Where both parties have acted reasonably, or unreasonably, the costs should lie where they fall. "Unreasonableness" in this context could include rejecting a reasonable offer or an invitation to engage in discussions which hold out reasonable prospects of a compromise.</text>
