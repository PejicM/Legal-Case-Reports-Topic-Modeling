<tocase>Re Cadd and Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 69</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2008/69.html</AustLII>
<text>8 Shortly thereafter he completed an application to the Repatriation Commission for acceptance of "anxiety/stressed" as war-caused. As the Tribunal noted in its reasons ( Re Cadd and Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 69 at [18] ):
 The application is dated 18 March 2003 and includes comments that Mr Cadd ceased work on 28 February 2003 as a result of his resignation and that his claimed disability had resulted in behavioural problems which in turn had resulted in "finishing work".

9 A witness statement Mr Cadd provided to the Tribunal indicated that, between 2003 and 2006, he applied for employment without success. The statement listed a large number of primarily hotels and clubs which he approached for employment. He did not get a job nor, as he indicated in his evidence to the Tribunal, was he ever given a particular reason for this. In consequence, he accepted in cross-examination that he had not performed remunerative work since March 2003. By 2006 his applications included the advice that he was not able to work more than 8 hours per week because of his then medical condition. That advice to prospective employers reflected the opinion in a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Ewer, of 20 April 2005 that his impairments were such as to make him unfit for paid employment as he could not work eight hours per week. Dr Ewer diagnosed his overall impairment then as being 70 per cent attributable to PTSD and 30 per cent to Major Depressive Disorder. The same report indicated that the PTSD had "just emerged in the last year" and in 2005 should be considered as "temporary".

10 The medical evidence accepted by the Tribunal was that of Dr Ewer who provided some number of reports on Mr Cadd dating from 2003. As the Tribunal noted (at [21] of its reasons) those reports 
 ... record diagnoses of changing conditions. Dr Ewer's report dated 8 April 2003 recorded diagnoses of pathological gambling and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Dr Ewer's report dated 5 August 2003 again records diagnoses of pathological gambling, this time in remission, and alcohol dependence in remission. The same report records some features of PTSD, but states that Mr Cadd does not satisfy the diagnostic criteria necessary for PTSD. Dr Ewer's report of 8 April 2004 stated that Mr Cadd was suffering from a major depressive disorder. It also stated that Mr Cadd did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. It was not until his report of 20 April 2005 that Dr Ewer reported that Mr Cadd had developed a number of additional symptoms so that, as of 20 April 2005, Mr Cadd did satisfy the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. In his most recent report dated 17 July 2007 Dr Ewer addressed the issue of depression and its cause. He commented as follows: 
 
 "The aetiology of his depression is probably multifactorial. His longstanding alcohol misuse probably contributed to him becoming depressed. His gambling losses were another substantial cause of his depression. His marital disharmony was another substantial cause of his depression. It is also probable that the emerging Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms contributed to his depression."</text>

<tocase>Flentjar v Repatriation Commission [1997] FCA 1200 ; (1997) 48 ALD 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1997/1200.html</AustLII>
<text>11 It is not contended by the applicant that the Tribunal misstated the inquiry it was required to undertake in applying s 24(1)(c) an inquiry which the Tribunal acknowledged was encapsulated in the four questions formulated by Branson J in Flentjar v Repatriation Commission [1997] FCA 1200 ; (1997) 48 ALD 1 at 4-5 (which are unnecessary to repeat here). Suffice it to say that for present purposes it is only necessary to note the following: 
 
(i) The Tribunal acknowledged, correctly, that the relevant "remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking" for s 24(1)(c) purposes was a reference to the type of work the veteran had previously undertaken, and not to any particular job: see Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 395 at 402. Further the parties accept the Tribunal in this case correctly characterised that type of work in Mr Cadd's case as "a club manager".
 
(ii) The Repatriation Commission conceded that Mr Cadd was prevented, because of his war-caused conditions, from continuing to undertake work as a club manager. The Tribunal found in accordance with Dr Ewer's evidence that from some stage during the assessment period (ie the period from the application day to the date when the application or claim was determined: VE Act s 19(9)) his PTSD disability alone would prevent employment for more than eight hours per week. 
 
(iii) In considering whether s 24(1)(c) was satisfied the Tribunal indicated the decisive issue was, as it is in this application, whether the exclusionary provisions of s 24(2)(a)(i) applied to Mr Cadd's circumstances. It held that it did.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>15 For my own part, and conscious of the frame of mind to be brought to bear by a reviewing court in judicial review proceedings: see Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272; I am satisfied that on a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision it cannot fairly be said to have misapprehended and thus misapplied the test in s 24(2)(a)(i) of the VE Act. There can be no doubt that the Tribunal understood and asked itself the question required to be asked when considering whether in the circumstances a veteran ceased to engage in remunerative work for reasons other than his war-caused incapacity and disease. As the respondent correctly contends, the Tribunal addressed the evidence both medical and of Mr Cadd that related to that question. In light (i) of the events which occurred since he ceased to have remunerative work in February 2003, ie his persistent inability to get work; (ii) of his medical condition at February 2003 until the onset of PTSD in 2004; and (iii) of his own appreciation, albeit for the most part in retrospect, of his fitness for work (but compare his 18 March 2003 application noted by the Tribunal (at [13] of its reasons)), the conclusion that Mr Cadd ceased to engage in remunerative work for a reason other than incapacity from war-caused condition was one that clearly was open to it.

16 I accept, as I earlier indicated, that the reasons given for this conclusion were economically expressed but they are discernible. At best the appeal seeks a review on the merits of the Tribunal's decision. Such is not permissible.

17 I will order that the application be dismissed with costs.

 I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.
