<tocase>A Solicitor v The Council of the Law Society of NSW [2004] HCA 1 ; (2004) 216 CLR 253</tocase>

<text>12 The other matter to observe is that the relevant time for the assessment of whether a person is the prescribed fit and proper person, is at the time of the relevant determination. This is made clear by the Act itself, for it is in considering the application that the Board needs to be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person. I note the Act specifically uses the present tense. There is no express or implied legislative indication which provides for the assessment of the facts at any other particular date. I refer also to A Solicitor v Council of the Law Society (NSW) [2004] HCA 1 ; (2004) 216 CLR 253 at 268.

13 In view of s 43(1) of the AAT Act, where the matter comes before the Tribunal, the Tribunal must be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person at the time of the Tribunal's determination. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal should consider for itself, as though it was performing the function of the relevant decision-maker, whether the applicant has satisfied the Tribunal he or she was the prescribed fit and proper person.

14 In my view, reading the Tribunal's reasons as a whole and fairly, the Tribunal did not approach the matter by directing itself to the ultimate issue it needed to resolve, namely whether the applicant was the prescribed fit and proper person.</text>

<tocase>Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280</tocase>
<text>3 The approach to be taken on an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal was outlined by the Full Court in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 286-287:
 
 The limitation of the jurisdiction to the resolution of questions of law imposes a significant constraint upon the role of the Court in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal. The appealable error of law must arise on the facts as found by the Tribunal or must vitiate the findings made or must have led the Tribunal to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make. A wrong finding of fact is not sufficient to demonstrate error of law: Waterford v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 25 ; (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 77-78. Where the decision of the Tribunal involves matters of fact and degree, then provided it applies correct principles of law, no appeal will lie: Commissioner of Taxation v Brixius (1987) 16 FCR 359 at 365. 
 
 The limits within which the jurisdiction is conferred require that it be exercised with restraint. Only in exceptional circumstances should the decision of the Tribunal not be the final decision: Blackwood Hodge (Australia) Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1980) 47 FLR 131 at 145 (Fisher J); Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Cainero (1988) 88 ATC 4,427 (Foster J) . As the Full Court said in Repatriation Commission v Thompson (1988) 9 AAR 199 at 204: 
 
 
 
 "...the nature of the task of this Court is clear. It is to leave to the tribunal of fact decisions as to the facts and to interfere only when the identified error is one of law." 
 
 
 
 This translates to a practical as well as principled restraint. The Court will not be concerned with looseness in the language of the Tribunal nor with unhappy phrasing of the Tribunal's thoughts: Lennell v Repatriation Commission (1982) 4 ALN N 54 (Northrop and Sheppard JJ); Freeman v Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority (1985) 5 AAR 156 at 164 (Sheppard J); Repatriation Commissioner v Bushell (1991) 13 AAR 176 at 183 (Morling and Neaves JJ). The reasons for the decision under review are not to be construed minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error: Politis v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 16 ALD 707 at 708 (Lockhart J).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>4 The decision was referred to and approved by the High Court of Australia in Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 (' Wu Shan Liang '). In Tax Agents' Board v Bray (2004) 58 ATR 118 at [22], Hely J said that "Although careful consideration of the AAT's reasons is required, they must be read as a whole and considered fairly".

5 Adopting the approach of the Full Court and Hely J, the Tribunal's reasons in this appeal must be read sensibly, not seeking to perceive error, but concentrating on the task of the Court which is to interfere only when the identified error is one of law. It is permissible to analyse both the language and structure of the reasons of the Tribunal to determine whether a legally erroneous approach has been adopted, or whether the Tribunal has failed to properly appreciate the matter it was bound to consider (see Sinclair v Maryborough Mining Warden [1975] HCA 17 ; (1975) 132 CLR 473 at 479 (Barwick CJ) and Wu Shan Liang at 291 (Kirby J).</text>

<tocase>Re Beadle and Director General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1</tocase>
<text>22 The Tribunal, after considering a number of matters, stated at [74] as follows: 
 
 I am prepared to find that the applicant's health, the circumstances within his practice and the tension within his marriage, most of which were at their peak in the 1990's, occurred during the same periods of time that income tax returns for himself and family entities were outstanding. But on the evidence of the applicant's doctors, and himself at the hearing, all medication ceased at February 2003 and he was regarded then as enjoying improved health. I would have thought that there would have been greater diligence on his part to immediately set about preparing returns and having them lodged. It is noted from other evidence that at or about this time the applicant's accountancy practice stabilized and another employee accountant of considerable expertise was engaged. However the applicant's outstanding personal returns were not lodged until October 2003 and the returns for other entities were not lodged until April, May or June of the following year. That is, some eight months after the applicant's health had been restored and medication had ceased and after his practice had stabilized he first lodged his outstanding personal returns but the other returns were not lodged until a period of between 14 and 16 months later. Set against a background of two prior Magistrates' Court appearances and a suspension from practice it would have been incumbent on the applicant to show a degree of "good fame, integrity and character" if his prior omissions should in the special circumstances that he asserted, be disregarded . (emphasis added) 

The Tribunal then proceeded to state at [77]:
 
 Following the analysis of the concept of special circumstances in both Beadle, Groth and Chamberlain , I cannot find the applicant's circumstances of ill health and vulnerability to an unstable rural economy whilst in regional practice, marriage instability and workplace stress, no less in self employment, are alone, or in combination, to be "unusual, uncommon or exceptional" nor could I find in the application of the relevant legislation that to decide to refuse re-registration would cause an outcome which was "unfair, unintended, unjust" or "inappropriate" . 

Then finally at [78] and [79] the Tribunal decided:
 
 Mr Moore acknowledged that the applicant had not ever been convicted of "a serious taxation offence" or at all (refer s 251BC) and he was not automatically disqualified from registration. It was also submitted that if special circumstances are found not to exist, the only decision open to the Board, upon an application for re-registration is refusal to register. No other option exists, for example, to suspend, or admonish. I agree with those submissions. The Tribunal is required to consider, in the circumstance of the case under review, to determine whether if special circumstances do exist whether to disregard the "omission" of an applicant. If the decision to refuse re-registration is affirmed, it is open to an applicant to apply, without any period of prohibition, to the Board for registration. If that course is followed, the applicant, at the time of such an application will have the opportunity to demonstrate that he is fit and proper. Section 251K appears to apply only where an agent has been suspended or where his registration has been cancelled. In the present case it was the applicant's application for re-registration that was declined. 
 
 The applicant's history, Court appearances, previous suspension, subsequent default and neglect and the magnitude of it and its duration dictates that it would be inappropriate to decide other than to affirm the decision under review.

23 Whilst the references in [79] could be said to relate to the enquiry going to the affirmation of the decision under review, they are not sufficient to show, in light of the previous reasoning of the Tribunal, that the Tribunal considered for itself the ultimate issue.

24 In my view, the Tribunal failed to appreciate the matter it was bound to consider and failed to address the ultimate issue for consideration, and in so doing made an error of law.

27 The term 'special circumstances' is not defined in the Act. It is used according to its ordinary meaning. As was said in Re Beadle and Director-General of Social Security (1984) 6 ALD 1 at 3:
 
 An expression such as "special circumstances" is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition. The qualifying adjective looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur. For it is the context which allows one to say that the circumstances in one case are markedly different from the usual run of cases. This is not to say that the circumstances must be unique but they must have a particular quality of unusualness that permits them to be described as special.

28 Whether there were 'special circumstances' was a question of fact for the Tribunal to decide. The Tribunal's conclusion that there were no special circumstances was a conclusion on a question of fact. It was a conclusion open to it on the facts as found.

29 Another complaint made by the applicant was that the Tribunal incorrectly took into account the charges against the applicant before the Magistrates' Court in 1990 for failing to lodge his 1989 return. I do not accept the Tribunal fell into error in this regard. There was nothing in the Act that bound the Tribunal to not take account of the applicant's appearance in the Magistrates' Court in 1990. In any event, the applicant raised the matter in his witness statement, as follows:
 
 In 1990 I was prosecuted for an offence of failing to file a tax return for the year ended 30 June 1989 contrary to section 8C of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 . At the hearing of that charge before the Magistrates' Court at Ballarat I pleaded guilty and was fined $500.00. Enquiries of the Magistrates' Court confirmed no recording of any conviction in regard to that charge and the imposition of that fine. This is consistent with no conviction being entered in the Court record notwithstanding the plea of guilty and the imposition of a fine. I believe I disclosed a conviction in relation to this matter in error when completing applications for re-registration as a Tax Agent in 1992 and 1995 lodged with the Respondent on 12 February 1992 and 16 March 1995 respectively ( T42 ) ( T45 ). 

He was cross-examined about the matter without objection.</text>
