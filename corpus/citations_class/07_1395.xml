<tocase>Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) (2006) 232 ALR 577</tocase>
<text>2 On 20 April 2006 receivers were appointed to the property of all of those named as defendants with exception of the seventh defendant, Bowesco Ltd which was subject to a private receiver appointed under a security. Freezing orders were made in relation to its property. The reasons for all the orders made were set out in Re Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd; Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) (2006) 232 ALR 577. Those orders commenced a long and winding trail of interlocutory processes involving the ultimate joinder of four additional defendants, orders in respect of each of them, other than the eleventh defendant, and variations to make all of the orders more effective and to deal with practical difficulties encountered in their administration.

3 The protective regime established by these proceedings has been extended from time to time. Orders presently in place in respect of the first, fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants have been further extended to 5pm today, 4 September 2007. Orders in relation to the second, third and fourth defendants, which are not before me for extension at this time, remain in force until 12 September 2007 in relation to the second and third defendants and the 26 September 2007, in relation to the fourth defendant. ASIC now seeks, by consent, to extend and vary the regime by orders which may broadly be described as follows: 
 
 1. Orders in terms of a proposed minute with respect to the first and fifth defendants. 
 2. The discharge of existing orders against the sixth and eighth defendants. 
 3. The extension of existing orders against the seventh, ninth and tenth defendants to 31 January 2008 unless otherwise discharged or varied.

4. The extension of existing orders against the twelfth defendant to 31 January 2008 subject to agreed amendments. 
 
 For the reasons that follow I am satisfied that the orders proposed should be made. 


 The Court's approach to consent orders generally 
 
4 When the Court is presented with a proposed order, agreed between the parties, it must be satisfied, before making it, that it is within the power of the Court to make it and that the proposed order is appropriate. The requirement that the order be "appropriate" does not mean that the Court will refuse to make it simply because it thinks a different order would be preferable. This is particularly the case where the parties are properly advised by competent legal representatives. An appropriate order is one which lies within the range of orders that could reasonably be made on the materials before the Court. The limiting factor is that in making any order the Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth and cannot simply rubber stamp what is proposed without consideration of its substance.</text>
