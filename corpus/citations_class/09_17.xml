<tocase>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396</tocase>
<text>17 At [70] to [72] (pp 83 and 84), their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 and the test articulated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 as follows: 
 
 
 70 When Beecham and American Cyanamid are read with an understanding of the issues for determination and an appreciation of the similarity in outcome, much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force. There is then no objection to the use of the phrase "serious question" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham .
 71 However, a difference between this Court in Beecham and the House of Lords in American Cyanamid lies in the apparent statement by Lord Diplock that, provided the court is satisfied that the plaintiff's claim is not frivolous or vexatious, then there will be a serious question to be tried and this will be sufficient. The critical statement by his Lordship is "[t]he court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried" [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 407]. That was followed by a proposition which appears to reverse matters of onus [1975] UKHL 1 ; [[1975] AC 396 at 408]: 
 
 
 
 
 So unless the material available to the court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction fails to disclose that the plaintiff has any real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial, the court should go on to consider whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought.
 (Emphasis added.) 
 
 
 
 
 Those statements do not accord with the doctrine in this Court as established by Beecham and should not be followed. They obscure the governing consideration that the requisite strength of the probability of ultimate success depends upon the nature of the rights asserted and the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought.
 72 The second of these matters, the reference to practical consequences, is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application [See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535-536 and the article by Sofronoff, " Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect ", Australian Law Journal, vol 61 (1987) 341.95]. The first consideration mentioned in Beecham , the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff, redirects attention to the present appeal.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/63.html</AustLII>
<text>13 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 , a majority of the High Court held that, where an interlocutory injunction is sought (inter alia) in respect of private rights, it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial and in respect of which the final relief is sought. Their Honours who comprised the majority made clear that the final relief sought need not be injunctive in nature. See [8] to [21] (pp 216 220) (per Gleeson CJ); [59] to [61] (pp 231 232) (per Gaudron J); and [86] to [92] (pp 239 242); [98] to [100] (pp 244 246); and [105] (p 248) (per Gummow and Hayne JJ).

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2006/46.html</AustLII>
<text>16 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] (pp 81 82), when referring to the well-known passage in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 622 623, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:
 By using the phrase "prima facie case", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial. That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument [(1968) [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 620]. With reference to the first inquiry, the Court continued, in a statement of central importance for this appeal [1968] HCA 1 ; [(1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622]: 
 
 "How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks."</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435</tocase>
<text>113 There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions:
 
(a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).
 
(b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable, which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment: per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Limited (2000) 22 ATPR 41-741 (p 40,578) at [22] (p 40,585). This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183]-[185] (pp 487-488) and by Sundberg J in ACCC v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [30] (p 264); and
 
(c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act: per Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [185] (p 488).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1968/1.html</AustLII>
<text>15 These remarks of Mason ACJ which were approved by Gleeson CJ echo the observations made by the High Court in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 at 622 623.

16 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 at [65] (pp 81 82), when referring to the well-known passage in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 622 623, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:

That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument [(1968) [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 at 620].

 "How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks."

17 At [70] to [72] (pp 83 and 84), their Honours went on to explain the similarities and differences between the test expounded in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; 118 CLR 618 and the test articulated in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 as follows: 
 
 
 70 When Beecham and American Cyanamid are read with an understanding of the issues for determination and an appreciation of the similarity in outcome, much of the assumed disparity in principle between them loses its force. There is then no objection to the use of the phrase "serious question" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham .

<tocase>Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR</tocase>
<text>14 In his Reasons for Judgment, at [13] (p 218), Gleeson CJ expressly approved the following passage from the Reasons for Judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 at 153:
 In order to secure such an injunction the plaintiff must show (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be an adequate compensation unless an injunction is granted; and (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.

20 The remaining questions identified by Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; 161 CLR 148 when adapted to the present case, require the ACCC to show that the balance of convenience and the balance of justice favour the grant of an injunction.

21 These matters require the Court to exercise a discretion.</text>

<tocase>Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/810.html</AustLII>
<text>32 In 2006, Hoy Mobile Pty Limited ( Hoy Mobile ) commenced proceedings in this Court against Allphones. Those proceedings ( the Hoy Mobile proceedings ) were heard in February and March 2008 by Rares J. His Honour delivered Reasons for Judgment on 30 May 2008 ( Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 810).

33 Hoy Mobile had been a franchisee of Allphones for approximately four years prior to the commencement of those proceedings.

34 The Hoy Mobile proceedings were hard fought. There were many issues requiring determination by his Honour.

35 At the end of his Honour's Reasons for Judgment, his Honour summarised the conclusions which he had reached (see Hoy Mobile Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 810 at [429] [431]). Allphones has appealed from his Honour's decision. That appeal has not yet been heard. It is neither necessary nor desirable for me to comment further on the subject matter of the Hoy Mobile proceedings. At the moment, it is sufficient if I note the date when his Honour delivered judgment (viz 30 May 2008) and the fact that his Honour said that Allphones had to account to its franchisees who were operating under the old franchise agreement for significant sums of money which it had received by way of commissions and rebates.

36 On 25 March 2008, the ACCC commenced proceedings against Allphones, Matthew Donnellan, Ian Harkin and Anthony Baker in this Court (No NSD 408 of 2008) ( the main ACCC proceedings ). The individuals named as respondents in those proceedings are or were employees and directors of Allphones at various times over the period with which the main ACCC proceedings deal. The Statement of Claim in the main ACCC proceedings comprises 89 pages and the Application comprises 25 pages. There are many allegations made in the Statement of Claim concerning Allphones' dealings with its franchisees and its management of the Allphones business of which the franchisees are an integral part.

37 In the main ACCC proceedings, the ACCC makes complaint about a large number of events and actions for which Allphones is alleged to have been responsible and contends that the respondents to those proceedings have contravened ss 51AC , 51AD , 52 and 59 of the Trade Practices Act in the operation of the Allphones franchise system.</text>

<text>113 There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions:

The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).
 
(b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable, which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment: per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Limited (2000) 22 ATPR 41-741 (p 40,578) at [22] (p 40,585). This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183]-[185] (pp 487-488) and by Sundberg J in ACCC v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [30] (p 264); and
 
(c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act: per Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [185] (p 488).</text>

 72 The second of these matters, the reference to practical consequences, is illustrated by the particular considerations which arise where the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction in effect would dispose of the action finally in favour of whichever party succeeded on that application [See the judgment of McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 535-536 and the article by Sofronoff, " Interlocutory Injunctions Having Final Effect ", Australian Law Journal, vol 61 (1987) 341.95]. The first consideration mentioned in Beecham , the nature of the rights asserted by the plaintiff, redirects attention to the present appeal.

27 Furthermore, there are some kinds of case where, for the purpose of assessing where the balance of convenience and the balance of justice lie, it is desirable that the Court:
 "... evaluate the strength of the plaintiff's case for final relief" 
(Per McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 at 536A-D)

28 In Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533, McLelland J observed that one such class of case is where the decision to grant or refuse the interlocutory injunction which is claimed will in a practical sense determine the substance of the matter in issue on a final basis. Another example is where the applicant for relief is seeking to restrain a public authority or officer from performing his statutory duty.

29 The substance of the matter in issue between the ACCC and Allphones in the present case is whether Allphones should be restrained from conducting itself or from threatening to conduct itself in a particular fashion in relation to the allocation of stock being conduct which is said to be intended to bully certain franchisees into complying with Allphones' wishes and demands for the purposes of and during the negotiations and mediation spawned by the Franchising Code Notice of Dispute which it served in August 2008. Those negotiations and that mediation have commenced but have not yet concluded. They are likely to conclude before the Court can determine the ACCC's claims for final relief in the proceedings.

30 In those circumstances, I think that the case is the kind of case which falls within the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback 8 NSWLR 533. Accordingly, I will apply that principle.

31 As I understand that principle, I am required to have a closer look at the applicant's case than I might otherwise be required to do when considering and determining an application for interlocutory injunction in order to come to a view as to whether the applicant's case for final relief is sufficiently strong to justify the granting of the interlocutory relief sought.

116 Senior Counsel for Allphones submitted that his client was the victim of a series of " verbals ". As I understood that submission, it was contended on behalf of Allphones that the entire or a substantial part of the case which the ACCC was putting depended upon evidence of conversations given by disgruntled franchisees, which was, for the most part, denied by Allphones and which could not be properly tested in an interlocutory hearing. The submission was then refined somewhat in order to invoke the principle explained by McLelland J in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533 to which I have referred in [28] to [31] above.

117 As I have already indicated, I propose to apply what McLelland J said in Kolback Securities Ltd v Epoch Mining NL (1987) 8 NSWLR 533.

118 However, I do not think that a correct application of that principle requires me to discount heavily or ignore the evidence given by the deponents of the affidavits which were read by the ACCC at the hearing of the present application.

119 The conversations to which the witnesses deposed took place in a context. To a large extent, that context was governed by the events which had occurred during the course of 2008 to which I have referred above and by the contents of the Baker email. Whilst the conversations have been denied for the most part, they are not of such a character as to lead me to conclude that the ACCC's case for final relief is a weak one.</text>

<tocase>Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268</tocase>
<text>113 There is a body of authority in this Court which establishes the following propositions:
 
(a) The scope of s 51AC is wider than that of s 51AA. The meaning of unconscionable for the purposes of s 51AC is not limited to the meaning of the word according to established principles of common law and equity: per French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 2 ; (2000) 96 FCR 491 at [24] and [25] (p 503); per Sundberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [31] (p 265); per Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Limited (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183] (p 487) and per Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Limited v Queensland Rail (2006) 28 ATPR 46-268 (p 53,515) at [918] (p 53,527).
 
(b) The ordinary or dictionary meaning of unconscionable, which involves notions of serious misconduct or something which is clearly unfair or unreasonable, is picked up by the use of the word in s 51AC. When used in that section, the expression requires that the actions of the alleged contravenor show no regard for conscience, and be irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable. Inevitably the expression imports a pejorative moral judgment: per Heerey, Drummond and Emmett JJ in Hurley v McDonalds Australia Limited (2000) 22 ATPR 41-741 (p 40,578) at [22] (p 40,585). This helpful articulation of the meaning of the word when used in s 51AC was followed by Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [183]-[185] (pp 487-488) and by Sundberg J in ACCC v Simply No-Knead Franchising Pty Limited [2000] FCA 1365 ; (2000) 104 FCR 253 at [30] (p 264); and
 
(c) Normally, some moral fault or moral responsibility would be involved. This would not ordinarily be present if the critical actions are merely negligent. There would ordinarily need to be a deliberate (in the sense of intentional) act or at least a reckless act: per Selway J in ACCC v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd (2003) 59 IPR 435 at [185] (p 488).</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1998/30.html</AustLII>
<text>22 In Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 at [65] and [66] (pp 41 43), Brennan CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, expressly adopted a passage from Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (5th edn, 1997, at pp 402 403), which may be summarised as follows: 
 
(a) In assessing the balance of convenience in an interlocutory injunction application, the interests of the public and third persons are relevant and have more or less weight according to other material circumstances;
 
(b) Whether those interests tend to favour the grant or the refusal of an injunction in any given case depends upon the circumstances of that case; and
 
(c) Hardship visited upon third persons or the public generally by the grant of an interlocutory injunction will rarely be decisive.

23 In the present case, I must assess and compare the prejudice and hardship likely to be suffered by Allphones, any relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if an injunction is granted, with that which is likely to be suffered by Allphones' franchisees who remain on the old franchise agreement, any other relevantly affected third parties and the public generally if no injunction is granted. In determining these matters, I must make an assessment of the likelihood that the final relief (if granted) will adequately compensate and protect those affected by the alleged wrongful conduct for the continuing contraventions which will have occurred between the date of the interlocutory hearing and the date when final relief might be expected to be granted.

24 Section 80(6) of the TPA provides that, in a case such as the present, the Court shall not require the ACCC to give any undertaking as to damages.

25 This provision puts the ACCC in a privileged position when compared with the position of ordinary litigants.

26 In my judgment, in a case where the ACCC seeks interlocutory injunctive relief, it may be necessary to take into account the absence of an undertaking as to damages when the Court comes to determine where the balance of convenience and the balance of justice lie. The extent to which this circumstance will play a role in any particular case will be governed by all of the circumstances of the case including the nature and strength of the ACCC's case as presented at the interlocutory stage.</text>
