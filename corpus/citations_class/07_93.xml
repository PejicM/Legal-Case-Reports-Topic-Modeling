<tocase>Magic Menu Systems Pty Ltd v AFI Facilitation Pty Ltd (1997) 72 FCR 261</tocase>
<text>21 The second and third respondents argued in the alternative that, in any event, the assignment of a cause of action should be struck down as against public policy. It was submitted that the deed purported to sell a cause of action which was against public policy and amounted to champerty: Magic Menu Systems Pty Ltd v AFI Facilitation Pty Ltd (1997) 72 FCR 261.

22 It was submitted that the present situation differs from that of a litigation funder who would provide funds for the action in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds, because in this case the cause of action was being transferred and was being pursued by someone other than the person to whom the cause of action originally accrued. It was alleged that this was a case of buying and selling causes of action.</text>

<tocase>Gore v Justice Corporation [2002] FCA 354 ; (2002) 119 FCR 429</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/354.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The tort of champerty was abolished in this State in 1995. It would therefore be inappropriate to strike out a proceeding because there had been an assignment of a cause of action from one trust to another. It may be, as was suggested in Gore v Justice Corporation [2002] FCA 354 ; (2002) 119 FCR 429, that a particular agreement might be still contrary to public policy, but that would not be decided on an application of this kind and in the absence of evidence.</text>

<tocase>Chapman v Luminis (No 5) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2001/1106.html</AustLII>
<text>24 In relation to their third argument, the second and third respondents submitted, relying on Chapman v Luminis (No 5) [2001] FCA 1106 ; (2001) 123 FCR 62, that as a matter of law it is not permissible to assign a bare cause of action under the Trade Practices Act. That is probably so: Pritchard v Racecage (1997) 72 FCR 203. Further, it was contended, relying on Poulton v The Commonwealth [1952] HCA 70 ; (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, that a right to litigate at common law cannot be assigned. It was contended that the wording of the assignment purported to assign a bare right to sue, which is not an assignable interest. That is less clear and, in my opinion, may not be decided, again without evidence, on an application of this kind.</text>
