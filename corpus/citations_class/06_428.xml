<tocase>BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz [2004] HCA 61 ; (2004) 211 ALR 523</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/61.html</AustLII>
<text>18 It is not in issue that there is a connection with Western Australia in this proceeding. However, the fact that an applicant has selected a registry in which to commence the proceeding that is not wholly inappropriate will not give rise to any presumption against transfer of the proceeding. (cf: BHP Billiton Ltd v Schultz [2004] HCA 61 ; (2004) 211 ALR 523 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Heydon JJ at [25], Gummow J at [72], Kirby J at [167]).

19 Counsel for the applicant conceded, properly, that the case really relates to the manufacture of products in South Australia and that if the question of where the proceeding should be commenced had been decided by weighing all issues, the balance would have fallen in favour of conducting the proceeding in South Australia. However, counsel submitted, transactions of wider geographic import arose out of the events in South Australia and, therefore, this registry was as well placed as any to deal with the litigation.

20 The applicant also contended that a provision in the Heads of Agreement added weight to that submission. In the Heads of Agreement it was provided that in the event of a dispute between the parties under that agreement "the law governing these Heads of Agreement shall be the law of the State of Western Australia and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of that state". The Collaboration Agreement on the other hand provided that that agreement was to "be interpreted in accordance with the law of South Australia".</text>

<tocase>BWK Elders (Australia) Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd (No 6) [2002] FCA 807</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2002/807.html</AustLII>
<text>25 Furthermore, the applicant has recently changed its solicitors and is no longer represented by a small firm that carries on practise only in this State. The applicant has now instructed a firm which holds itself out as having a national presence. In affidavits filed in opposition to the respondents' application it was deposed on behalf of the applicant that "Gadens" represents "a joint venture of independent firms carrying on business under the same name, 'Gadens'". Whatever that may mean it may be concluded that any disadvantage that may have been inflicted upon the applicant if an order had been made for the proceeding to be transferred whilst it continued to be represented by Solomon Brothers is no longer a relevant consideration. (See: BWK Elders (Australia) Pty Ltd v Westgate Wool Company Pty Ltd (No 6) [2002] FCA 807). Circumstances have forced the applicant to change its solicitors and it may be assumed that being able to instruct solicitors who carry on business under the name Gadens in South Australia will be as convenient for the applicant as instructing practitioners who carry on business under that name in Western Australia given that the instructions are to be provided by persons resident in South Australia.

26 In addition to the foregoing another important change in circumstances is the need for another docket judge to be assigned the matter and to take over management of the proceeding. Obviously that may as easily be a judge in the South Australia District Registry of the Court as a judge in this registry.

27 Another recent event in the matter is the resurrection of the respondents' motion for the provision of security for costs by the applicant. As alluded to earlier in these reasons, on the current material provided the applicant offers personal guarantees and indemnities from the directors of the applicant by way of security. The worth of these offers depends upon the net worth of the property of the directors situated in South Australia. If further security is provided by the applicant in that form there will be a continuing prospect that interlocutory proceedings may occur related to the sufficiency of the security. The appropriate place for consideration of that issue would be in the South Australia District Registry of the Court.</text>

<tocase>Moltoni Corporation Pty Ltd v Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd [2004] FCA 482</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2004/482.html</AustLII>
<text>16 In their respective submissions both parties place some emphasis on the domicile of prospective witnesses likely to be called at trial. That, of course, is of some relevance in an application for transfer but it is unlikely to carry great weight when a determination is made as to which is the appropriate registry of the Court to have control of the management of preparation of the matter for trial, particularly if the matter is not advanced and interlocutory applications and mediation proceedings are yet to be considered. (See: Moltoni Corporation Pty Ltd v Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd [2004] FCA 482).</text>

<tocase>National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155</tocase>
<text>17 In an application for transfer of a proceeding to another registry the principal consideration for the Court is what will best serve the interests of justice and fairness to the parties and meet the public interest in the efficient and timeous despatch of litigation. (See: National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155). The application is not resolved by reference to the rules of common law that govern whether a chosen forum is the appropriate forum. This is a national court exercising a single jurisdiction and an application to transfer a proceeding to another registry is an internal matter for the Court for which provision has been made in the Rules. The considerations that are relevant to determining whether such an order should be made are not confined by the Rules and obviously they are broader in scope than those to be applied to decide a "forum non conveniens" application concerning competing jurisdictions. (See: Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538).</text>

<text>3 It may be accepted that in usual circumstances such a belated application for transfer of a proceeding would be unlikely to succeed. In this case, however, events that have occurred justify consideration of the motion. (See: Shin Chin Distributors Pte Ltd v Parmalat Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 1629).

4 After filing the statement of claim the applicant was granted leave on four occasions to amend the pleading. The most recently amended statement of claim was filed on 20 May 2005. An amended defence and cross-claim by the respondents was filed on 23 January 2006.

5 It can be seen that since the commencement of the proceeding the time elapsed has been spent on the pleadings, in particular the statement of claim, and preparation of the matter for trial has not reached an advanced stage.</text>
