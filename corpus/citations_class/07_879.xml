<text>1 On 6 November 2006 I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck out. However, I granted leave to replead on or before 30 November 2006: see [2006] FCA 1441.

33 It is correct, as the respondent submits, that, at an early stage in the proceeding, it put the applicant on notice as to the deficiencies which ultimately led to the striking-out of the first amended statement of claim. The applicant did not ignore or disregard the respondent's submissions. It considered them, accepted some of them and made certain amendments to the statement in August 2006. The respondent again made detailed submissions on why it considered the statement of claim still did not plead a sustainable cause of action. The applicant again considered its position, but, as it was entitled to do, advanced detailed arguments supporting the efficacy of the revised pleading. As is evident from my reasons for decision ([2006] FCA 1441) the arguments were complex and they dealt with the developing case law under the former s 298K of the Act . That case law is not lacking in subtlty and fine distinction. The concepts of injury, prejudicial alteration and threat do not have well settled meanings.

34 As is apparent from my reasons dealing with the first strike-out application, although I harboured doubts to whether a viable case could be pleaded by the applicant under Part XA , I did not regard it as an impossibility. Leave to replead, was therefore, granted.

35 The applicant took advantage of the grant of leave and filed a second further amended statement of claim. This statement of claim alleged contravention of Part XA. It also alleged a contravention of the new Part 16 based, in part, on events which occurred in the course of 2006. This statement of claim was also struck-out. I held that the major deficiencies which I had identified in relation to the case based on Part XA had not been overcome and that the attempt to mount a case under Part 16 failed because various parts of the statement of claim were embarrassing. These conclusions were reached after further detailed argument both written and oral.</text>

<text>2 Pursuant to this grant of leave, the applicant filed a second further amended statement of claim. On 27 April 2007 I ordered that this pleading also be struck out and said that I would hear the parties on costs: see [2007] FCA 581. I did so because, at the end of its submissions on the second strike-out application, the respondent sought an order that its costs be paid on an indemnity basis should it be successful in its application. In its written submissions the applicant reserved its position in relation to costs pending a review of my reasons for judgment. When judgment was delivered I gave directions for the filing of written submissions and indicated that I would hear oral argument on 9 May 2007. On that day senior counsel for the applicant advised the Court that certain discussions were taking place between the parties which may have rendered it unnecessary for any costs questions to be further considered and indicated that, for this reason and in an effort to avoid unnecessary costs, his client had not filed written submissions on the issue. Further directions were given for the filing of written submissions and the hearing was adjourned to 8 June 2007.

3 The respondent seeks an order of costs in its favour in relation to:
 
 &#8226; Its strike-out application notice of which was given on 16 June 2006;
 &#8226; Its strike-out application, dated 18 December 2006 which was filed on 17 January 2007; and
 &#8226; The hearing on 9 May 2006.

4 The costs were sought under s 824(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act "), or, alternatively, under s 347 of that Act as it stood before the March 2006 amendments.</text>

<tocase>Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225</tocase>
<text>39 Where costs are ordered by the Court they will ordinarily be paid on a party and party basis. Any departure from this usual practice, according to the authorities collected by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 230-4, will only occur in a limited range of cases. The "tests" used to identify such cases have been couched in general terms such as "when the justice of the case might so require" or whether there exists "some special or unusual feature on the case to justify the Court in departing from the ordinary practice." These "tests" have, for example, been found to have been met in cases in which unwarranted allegations of fraud have been made, proceedings have been prosecuted for some ulterior motive or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law or where there has been an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise. To my mind the applicant's conduct, in opposing the second strike-out application and in adopting its bona fide but misguided approach to the Court's directions which led to costs being thrown away on 9 May 2007, do not constitute conduct of the character which would warrant a departure from the ordinary rule.

40 The applicant seeks leave to discontinue the proceeding. The applicant could discontinue the proceeding without leave of the Court under O 22 r 2(1)(b) of the Federal Court Rules . However, given the uncertain costs implications of a discontinuance under this rule because of the provisions of O 22 r 3(1) and s 824 of the Act it was, in my opinion, appropriate for the applicant to seek leave to discontinue the proceeding. The respondent did not oppose the granting of such leave. I consider that leave should be granted subject to the orders for costs which I have foreshadowed in relation to the second strike-out application and the hearing on 9 May 2007 being made.

 I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.

<text>12 The applicant was correct to accept that s 347(1) applied to subsidiary applications made in the course of a proceeding. Although there are conflicting authorities, (as to which see the cases collected in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No. 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 at 536-539), the conflict was resolved by the decision of the Full Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. In that case the Full Court (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ) followed the decision of Wilcox CJ (with whom von Doussa J agreed) in the Industrial Relations Court in Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Limited (1996) 141 ALR 736. In Shackley Wilcox CJ said (at 745) that:
 
 "As I have indicated, the word "proceeding" is widely used to refer, not only to a principal action (or "proceeding") between parties, but also to any subsidiary application made during the course of the principal action. There is no reason to believe that the word is used in a different sense in s 347; indeed the word in parenthesis indicates the contrary. If parliament had intended that "proceeding" should be understood, in s 347, as meaning only a principal action that commenced when the Court's jurisdiction was first invoked and concluded with final judgment, it would have been absurd to say that an appeal alone might constitute a "proceeding"".</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1992/20.html</AustLII>
<text>22 There is a further reason for rejecting the applicant's submission that s 8(c) of the Acts Interpretation Act afforded it the protection of s 347(1) after 27 March 2006. In order for s 8(c) to operate it is necessary to identify a right or privilege which was in existence at the time that the amendments to s 347 occurred. Such rights may be inchoate or contingent but they must exist: see Esber v The Commonwealth of Australia [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430 at 440. Section 347 prevented the Court from making a costs order against a party to a proceeding under the Act unless the proceeding (including interlocutory applications) was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. Such "protection" could only avail a party once the relevant procedural step had been taken. In the present case each of the procedural events which give rise to the respondent's application for costs occurred after 27 March 2006. Even if the protective effect of s 347(1) can, contrary to my view, be regarded as a right, the "proceedings" to which s 347(1) are said to apply had yet to be instituted and, therefore, no relevant right or privilege had been acquired or had accrued on 27 March 2006.

23 As already noted the respondent seeks an order for costs in relation to its two strike-out applications and the hearing conducted on 9 May 2006. In order to deal with these applications it is necessary to record, in somewhat greater detail than has thus far been attempted, the circumstances which led to the making of the strike-out applications and the conduct of the hearing on 9 May 2006.

24 The proceeding was commenced by application dated 8 March 2006. A statement of claim was also filed on that day. On 9 June 2006 the applicant filed an amended statement of claim. On 16 June 2006, the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking orders striking-out the proceeding or, in the alternative, striking-out certain paragraphs of the amended statement of claim. The notice of motion was made returnable on 4 August 2006. The notice of motion was supported by a detailed affidavit in which the alleged deficiencies of the pleading were canvassed. Subsequently detailed written submissions were made by the respondent. After argument on the notice of motion had been advanced by counsel for the respondent on 4 August 2006, counsel for the applicant sought leave to file a further amended statement of claim. I granted leave and reserved costs. The revised statement of claim was filed on 28 August 2006. Although some of the alleged deficiencies in earlier versions of the pleaded case appeared to have been rectified in the revised statement, the respondent continued to press its strike-out application. Further written submissions were exchanged, further argument was heard, and, on 6 November 2006, I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck-out and that the applicant have leave to file a further amended statement of claim on or before 30 November 2006. Despite granting leave I noted that I harboured a serious doubt that the applicant could amend its statement of claim to advance a case under s 298K conformably with the reasons which I had given for striking-out the amended statement of claim. No order for costs was sought by the respondent.</text>

<tocase>Freeman v Moyes (1834) 1 Ad &amp; El 338</tocase>
<text>21 The power of the Court to award costs in a proceeding is conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Absent the grant of such a power the Court could not order the payment of costs by or to any party: see Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App Cas 944 at 962. Section 347(1) placed a constraint on the power conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act . It was not the source of the Court's power to award costs. Rather, it regulated the exercise of that power in matters arising under the Act . I can find no support in the authorities for the contention that a statutory power to award costs is to be treated as procedural but that statutory inhibitions on the exercise of that power are to be regarded as conferring substantive rights or privileges. In Shanahan the Full Court was inclined to regard s 347(1) as being "procedural in nature": at [19]. Jackman involved the substitution of one formula for another to guide the calculation of costs. In Galvin there was reference (at 297) to "[t]wo cases of high authority [which decided] that legislation giving or regulating a power to award costs is retrospective, in that it affects not substantive rights but merely procedure." (Emphasis added). Those two cases were Freeman v Moyes (1834) 1 Ad &amp; El 338 and Wright v Hale (1860) 30 LJ (Ex) 40. In Freeman the statutory change which occurred between the commencement of the proceeding and the hearing directed that particular parties be liable to pay costs subject to a contrary order by the Court. In Wright an existing entitlement to recover costs was removed where the plaintiff recovered less than a prescribed sum and if the trial judge certified that the action "was not fit to be brought.". All of these cases were concerned with statutory provisions which regulated the exercise of the Court's power to award costs. In each case the amended provision was held applicable to a proceeding which had commenced before it came into force. Section 347(1) was such a provision.</text>

<text>16 There is, however, another transitional provision which deals directly with s 347 and 824 . Regulation 2.10 in Division 8 of Part 2 of Chapter 7 of the Regulations provides that:
 
 "The amendments of s 347 of the Pre-reform Act made by Schedule 1 to the WorkChoices Act do not apply in relation to an action or omission that occurred before the reform commencement." 

The amendments referred to are the amendments which were made to s 347 before it was renumbered s 824 and include the introduction of what is now s 824(2). It is clearly implicit in this regulation that, had it not been enacted, the amendments had the potential to apply to acts or omissions which occurred in a proceeding commenced before but not concluded on that date. The draftsman of the regulation no doubt had in mind the common law rule that statutory provisions dealing with the power to award costs are procedural in nature and, in the absence of contrary legislative intention, will operate retrospectively at least to the extent of applying to cases commenced before the amendment: see eg Galvin v Forests Commission of Victoria [1939] VR 284 at 297-8 ; Jackman v Dandenong Sewerage Authority (No 2) (1967) 20 LGRA 413 at 415. It is also implicit that the amendments were intended to apply to acts and omissions which occurred in any incomplete proceeding after 27 March 2006.

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1971/4.html</AustLII>
<text>19 The applicant contends that, even if s 824 is applicable to so much of the proceeding as took place after 27 March 2006, it retains the protection of the limitations contained in the old s 347 by reason of the operation of s 8(c) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). That paragraph relevantly provides:
 
 "8. Where an Act repeals in the whole or in part a former Act , then unless the contrary intention appears the repeal shall not: 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 (b) ... 
 
 
 
 
 (c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; 
 
 
 
 
 (d) ... 
 
 
 
 
 (e) ... 
 
 
 
 
 and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced, and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been passed." 

The word "repeals" in s 8 is accorded an extended definition. It includes changes to legislation effected by implication and the abrogation or limitation of the effect of a former provision of an Act : see s 8A of the Acts Interpretation Act . The introduction of the extended definition is, no doubt, attributable in part to the observation of Gibbs J in Mathieson v Burton [1971] HCA 4 ; (1971) 124 CLR 1 at 21 that the addition of words to a section in an Act does not constitute a repeal but rather an amendment of the statute.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/745.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The applicant was correct to accept that s 347(1) applied to subsidiary applications made in the course of a proceeding. Although there are conflicting authorities, (as to which see the cases collected in Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No. 3) [2006] FCA 745 ; (2006) 152 FCR 534 at 536-539), the conflict was resolved by the decision of the Full Court in Commonwealth of Australia v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2003] FCAFC 115 ; (2003) 129 FCR 271. In that case the Full Court (Black CJ, Tamberlin and Sundberg JJ) followed the decision of Wilcox CJ (with whom von Doussa J agreed) in the Industrial Relations Court in Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Limited (1996) 141 ALR 736. In Shackley Wilcox CJ said (at 745) that:
 
 "As I have indicated, the word "proceeding" is widely used to refer, not only to a principal action (or "proceeding") between parties, but also to any subsidiary application made during the course of the principal action. There is no reason to believe that the word is used in a different sense in s 347; indeed the word in parenthesis indicates the contrary. If parliament had intended that "proceeding" should be understood, in s 347, as meaning only a principal action that commenced when the Court's jurisdiction was first invoked and concluded with final judgment, it would have been absurd to say that an appeal alone might constitute a "proceeding"".

28 Section 824(2) is cast more widely. It applies if a party "has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs ...". A party may potentially be liable to pay costs under this sub-section even if it did not institute the proceeding in which the relevant conduct occurred. That conduct may be an act or an omission. The liability may arise, as Young J noted in Paras (at 538 [16]), "irrespective of the outcome of the particular application in question and of the proceeding as a whole."

29 The respondent submits that the applicant acted unreasonably by pressing its amended statement of claim and its further amended statement of claim despite being aware of the respondent's detailed critique which pointed to manifold deficiencies. The first amended statement of claim was struck-out substantially for the reasons advanced by the respondent. The respondent contends that "[p]ressing a major cause of action which has no reasonable prospect of success is unreasonable conduct."

30 The respondent submits that the applicant's conduct in relation to the second further amended statement of claim was also unreasonable. The respondent noted the reservations which I expressed when granting leave, on 6 November 2006, to the applicant to replead its case insofar as it relied on Part XA of the Act . The second further amended statement of claim contained substantially similar allegations as appeared in its predecessor in seeking to plead a case under Part XA. This, it is said "was not a reasonable action". The respondent also contends that the applicant acted unreasonably by failing to have regard to the Court's reasons when it undertook the repleading the exercise. The respondent again places reliance on the alleged failure of the applicant to heed the respondent's written submissions in which the deficiencies in the pleadings were identified.</text>

<tocase>Re Ogston and Repatriation Commission (1998) 52 ALD 392</tocase>
<text>20 I am prepared to assume, in the applicant's favour, that the amendments to s 347 were comprehended by the extended definition of "repeals" which is provided for in s 8A of the Acts Interpretation Act : It is certainly arguable that the provisions of s 824(2) constitute an abrogation of the limiting effect of the former s 347(1): cf Re Ogston and Repatriation Commission (1998) 52 ALD 392 at 400 [21]. The applicant must, nonetheless, establish that it had an accrued right to the benefit of the provisions of s 347 at the time at which the amendment took effect, namely 27 March 2006. It acknowledges that a statutory power to award costs may properly be characterised as procedural in nature but submits that s 347 confers a right or privilege because it affords protection from the power to award costs.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2007/53.html</AustLII>
<text>18 Regulation 2.10, on the other hand, does, in my view, make it clear that s 824 governs the making (or the not making) of costs orders in relation to any part of an incomplete proceeding which occurred after 27 March 2006. The Full Court so held in Shanahan v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 53. In that case the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings seeking to impugn an order of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The proceeding was commenced in the High Court in November 2005. It was remitted to this Court on 1 April 2006 and was determined later that year. The Court referred to reg 2.10 and observed, obiter, that, although the respondent's application for costs fell to be determined under s 347 because the relevant event predated 27 March 2006, this was not to "deny the operation of s 824(2) were it to be the case that by an "unreasonable act or omission" of the applicant occurring on or after 27 March 2006, the second respondent was caused to incur costs in connection with the proceeding." In such circumstances the Court could order the applicant to pay "some or all of those costs": at [19].

21 The power of the Court to award costs in a proceeding is conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Absent the grant of such a power the Court could not order the payment of costs by or to any party: see Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App Cas 944 at 962. Section 347(1) placed a constraint on the power conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act . It was not the source of the Court's power to award costs. Rather, it regulated the exercise of that power in matters arising under the Act . I can find no support in the authorities for the contention that a statutory power to award costs is to be treated as procedural but that statutory inhibitions on the exercise of that power are to be regarded as conferring substantive rights or privileges. In Shanahan the Full Court was inclined to regard s 347(1) as being "procedural in nature": at [19]. Jackman involved the substitution of one formula for another to guide the calculation of costs. In Galvin there was reference (at 297) to "[t]wo cases of high authority [which decided] that legislation giving or regulating a power to award costs is retrospective, in that it affects not substantive rights but merely procedure." (Emphasis added). Those two cases were Freeman v Moyes (1834) 1 Ad &amp; El 338 and Wright v Hale (1860) 30 LJ (Ex) 40. In Freeman the statutory change which occurred between the commencement of the proceeding and the hearing directed that particular parties be liable to pay costs subject to a contrary order by the Court. In Wright an existing entitlement to recover costs was removed where the plaintiff recovered less than a prescribed sum and if the trial judge certified that the action "was not fit to be brought.". All of these cases were concerned with statutory provisions which regulated the exercise of the Court's power to award costs. In each case the amended provision was held applicable to a proceeding which had commenced before it came into force. Section 347(1) was such a provision.</text>

<text>36 In dealing with an application for costs under s 347(1) of the Act , in Standish v University of Tasmania (1989) 28 IR 129, Lockhart J was called on to decide whether the proceeding had been instituted "without reasonable cause". His Honour drew a distinction between the pursuit of an argument which does not succeed and the institution of a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being incompetent: see at 138-9. This distinction may, in my view, assist in determining whether conduct is unreasonable for the purposes of s 824(2). The prosecution of any incompetent or hopeless case can be regarded as "an unreasonable act" within the meaning of s 824(2). Conversely, in my opinion, the pursuit of a contentious, and ultimately unsuccessful, argument is not an unreasonable act. In my view the applicant's defence of its pleadings in the first strike-out application falls into the latter category. I take a different view of the applicant's conduct in relation to the second strike-out application. The second further amended statement of claim contained the same major deficiencies as its predecessor insofar as it dealt with the Part XA claim. The applicant instituted but then withdrew an application for leave to appeal from my decision. It persisted with pleadings which were inconsistent with my reasons for striking-out the first amended statement of claim. In so persisting, I consider that the applicant acted unreasonably for the purposes of s 824(2). The second further amended statement of claim also sought to plead a cause of action under Part 16. That aspect of the pleading failed by reason of embarrassment, not because it was untenable. I do not consider that it was unreasonable for the applicant to pursue the Part 16 aspect of its claim. In my view it is appropriate to order that the applicant pay half the respondent's costs of the second strike-out application.

37 There remains the issue of whether the applicant should pay the respondent's costs thrown away in relation to the hearing on 9 May 2007. In my view such an order should be made. The hearing did not proceed on that day because the applicant had failed to comply with the Court's directions as to the filing and service of submissions relating to the costs issue. This had occurred because of a unilateral decision by the applicant that it wished to pursue settlement discussions with the respondent. Had it wished to be relieved of the obligation to file submissions, the appropriate course was to apply to the Court to vary the directions which had earlier been made. Had it done so costs would not have been thrown away on 9 May 2007, although costs of any motion to vary the orders may have been payable. In omitting to comply with the Court's directions and not seeking, in an appropriate manner, to be relieved of its obligation the applicant acted unreasonably.

38 The respondent seeks to have any costs order in its favour paid on an indemnity basis. I accept that costs might be awarded on such a basis under s 824(2) in appropriate cases. That is because, if the requirements of s 824(2) are satisfied, the fetter imposed by s 824(1) is removed and the Court enjoys the same wide discretionary power which is conferred by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act .</text>
