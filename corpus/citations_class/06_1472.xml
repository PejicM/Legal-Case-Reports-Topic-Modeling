<text>4 The decision to order security for costs is discretionary and it is well accepted that the Court's discretion in this matter is unfettered. There are however, general principles that guide the Court in the exercise of its discretion. These were set out by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 and repeated by French J in Carey-Hazell v Getz Bros and Co (Aust) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1334 at [28] as follows: 
 
 
 "1. Whether the application for security has been brought promptly. 
 2. The strength and bona fides of the applicant's case. 
 3. Whether the applicant's impecuniosity was caused by the respondent's conduct the subject of the claim. 
 4. Whether the respondent's application for security is oppressive in the sense that it is being used merely to deny an impecunious applicant a right to litigate.</text>

<tocase>Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34</tocase>
<text>7. Whether the applicant is in substance a plaintiff or the proceedings are defensive in the sense of directly resisting proceedings already brought or seeking to halt the respondent's self-help procedures." 
 


 The present circumstances 
 
5 It is common ground between the parties that Horizon's liabilities considerably exceed its assets and that it would be unable to meet a costs order in favour of the respondents. The respondents accept that impecuniosity, of itself, is not a sufficient reason to order security ( Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38) however the inability of an applicant to meet the costs of a successful respondent not only "opens the jurisdiction for the giving of security" but is also a significant consideration in the exercise of the Court's discretion: Pearson v Naydler [1977] 1 WLR 899 at 906; Rosenfield Nominees v Bain &amp; Co (1988) 14 ACLR 467 at 470. 
 
6 The respondents submit, however, that there is an additional reason why Horizon's impecuniosity should weigh heavily in the Court's consideration of their application. They allege that it is the result of calculated and deliberate conduct directed towards frustrating the processes of the Court. The respondents submit that statements made by officers of Horizon, indicating an intention to strip the company of its assets so that there would be no assets available to meet claims made by the respondents, invite this conclusion. 
 
7 In support of their application the respondents relied on affidavits made by employees of GlobeCast, namely: Nitish Gawde, Direct to Home Broadcast Manager and Mike Lattin Chief Executive Officer. Both gentlemen gave evidence of comments made by Mr Seymon Pinchuk, a director of Horizon at meetings on 27 April and 19 May 2006, in the course of discussions about the disputed invoices. In response to demands made by GlobeCast for Horizon to pay the amounts in the disputed invoices, Mr Pinchuk is alleged to have threatened to "wind up" or "bankrupt" or "close down" the company so that no one would be paid. They also claimed that Mr Pinchuk referred to Horizon as "just a $2 company" or said that he would "make it" a $2 company.</text>
