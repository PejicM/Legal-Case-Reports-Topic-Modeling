<tocase>McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1933/25.html</AustLII>
<text>23 The Capital companies contend that the payments in this case did not give rise to a preference because there was never any debtor-creditor relationship between LSE and Capital Finance. It is submitted that that when the dealings between the Capital companies, LSE and the NAB are considered as a whole, there was no debtor-creditor relationship between LSE and Capital Finance at the time of the payments. The Capital companies say that the payments represented a "sale" transaction between NAB and Capital Finance, where NAB agreed to buy out and pay for the equipment and rights which were the property of the Capital companies. It is then submitted that because the true characterisation of the transaction was a "sale," a failure to comply with an obligation to acquire goods or property at a specified price can only give rise to an action for damages: see McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457 at 475; Box Valley Pty Limited v Kidd [2006] NSWCA 26. An action for damages is not a "debt": Jelin Pty Ltd v Johnson (1987) 5 ACLC 463 at 464; Molit (No. 55) Pty Ltd v Lam Soon (Australia) Pty Limited (1996) 21 ACSR 157 at 159. The Capital companies say that the payments in question were part of the purchase price and were made by NAB on its own account as purchaser of the leased equipment from Capital Finance.</text>

<tocase>Re Emanuel (No. 14) Pty Ltd (in liq) ; Macks &amp; Anor v Blacklaw &amp; Shadforth Pty Ltd (1997) 147 ALR 281</tocase>
<text>25 The expression "transaction" is defined in s 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to include the disposition of property, payments made and obligations incurred. The case law indicates that the term "transaction" is a word of wide connotations. A transaction in its totality may include a series of events in a course of dealings initiated by a debtor intended to extinguish the debt: Re Emanuel (No. 14) Pty Ltd (in liq) ; Macks &amp; Anor v Blacklaw &amp; Shadforth Pty Ltd (1997) 147 ALR 281 at 288. The events can occur at different points of time and need not occur simultaneously. The Court must consider the transaction in its entirety so that it can determine the ultimate effect of the transaction.</text>

<text>26 In V.R. Dye &amp; Co v Peninsula Hotels Pty Ltd (in liq) [1999] VSCA 60 ; [1999] 3 VR 201, Ormiston J at [39] pointed out that to properly characterise a transaction, it is necessary to look at the totality of the business relationship between the parties in order to see whether there is a true preference in favour of a creditor by the insolvent company. The Court will look at what the parties are intending to effectuate and how that was effectuated in part or in whole by the transactions in question: see also Mann v Sangria Pty Ltd (2001) 38 ACSR 307.</text>

<tocase>Walsh v Natra Pty Limited [2000] VSCA 60 ; (2000) 1 VR 523</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2000/60.html</AustLII>
<text>40 In order for there to be an unfair preference, the statutory language requires that a creditor must receive more from the company in respect of an unsecured debt than that creditor would receive from the company in relation to that debt if the transaction were set aside and the creditor made to prove for the debt in a winding up of the company. The "winding up" as referred to in the statute is the actual winding up, and not a hypothetical winding up or series of windings up as at the date of each payment: see Walsh v Natra Pty Limited [2000] VSCA 60 ; (2000) 1 VR 523.

41 In this case, the unsecured debt owed by LSE to Corporate Finance under the Second Deed was discharged in full as a result of the challenged payments, whereas unsecured debts to other creditors were not reduced.

42 The affidavit of Mr Tolcher of 23 August 2006 shows that Capital would have received substantially less if it had proved in the winding up of LSE as unsecured creditor. He states that the Capital companies will have received as a result of the transactions a net value of $3,751,861.40, whereas if they had proved in the winding up they would have received either $1.345 million or a lesser amount. It is not necessary, having regard to the language of the section, to direct attention to the effect on other creditors: see Walsh at [47] and Sheldrake v Paltoglou [2006] QCA 52 at [9] .</text>

<text>55 Mr Tolcher also relies on the fact that Ms Foreman, who was the addressee of Memoranda from Mr Vendrell, was not called to give evidence. Ms Foreman was a Capital Finance employee who was involved with LSE in relation to the transactions. In my view, the principles in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 and Cook's Construction Pty Limited v Brown [2004] 49 ACSR 62 at [31]-[36] and [41]-[42] are applicable in the present circumstances to reinforce the available inference that officers of Capital Finance had reasonable grounds to suspect insolvency. Cook's Construction is of specific relevance because it considers the operation of s 588FG. Mr Tolcher also points out Mr Joseph, who was the solicitor for the Capital companies as at December 2000, was not called to give evidence in relation to this matter.</text>
