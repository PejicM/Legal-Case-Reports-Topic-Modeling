<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge [2008] VSC 473</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VICSC/2008/473.html</AustLII>
<text>23 Later factual exemplars of the application of the discretion described by Megaw LJ in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha and of the guidelines set out by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould abound. The most recent of these appears to be a judgment delivered last month by Robson J of the Victorian Supreme Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge [2008] VSC 473. That case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it exemplifies that an exercise of the discretion in question in a civil proceeding may be sought even where related criminal proceedings have not been instituted but are instead "on the cards", i.e. a "reasonable possibility". Secondly, it contains a reflective discussion of whether the guidelines stated in McMahon v Gould should continue to be applied in light of later High Court authority. Thirdly, there is to be found in it consideration of observations made by Finkelstein J of this Court concerning the danger of a civil court's making declaratory judgments or granting injunctive relief if a matter is likely to end up before a criminal court.

26 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge , Robson J felt constrained, as had others before him, to suggest that an appellate court may wish to reconsider McMahon v Gould . Insofar as McMahon v Gould recognises the existence of a power which a court has to control proceedings in a civil action by the granting of a stay of those proceedings where the interests of justice so require, I respectfully doubt whether there is any general need for a reconsideration of that case. It is important not to elevate particular factual circumstances calling or not calling for the exercise of that power into statements of principle. It seems to me that Wootten J was not endeavouring to do anything other than to set out guidelines. I do not approach this matter on the basis that the occasions for the exercise of the power are closed. What is required is a balancing of the interests of the applicant and respondent in a civil proceeding having regard to any statutory context relevant to that civil proceeding and to any impending or prospective criminal proceeding. A separate but not unrelated consideration is whether the civil proceeding or at least its then prosecution might be regarded as an abuse of the process of the court. Such considerations will especially loom where the applicant in a civil proceeding is an emanation of the Crown and seeks declaratory relief and the imposition of pecuniary penalties in circumstances where a respondent is or is in jeopardy of facing criminal proceedings in respect of substantially the same conduct. I note that such a prospect particularly influenced Robson J in his suggestion that McMahon v Gould may need to be reconsidered by an appellate court.

38 The present case is nothing like Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge where a conclusion that criminal proceedings against the defendants was a reasonable possibility was readily open having regard to recommendations made in a the report of a recently completed Royal Commission. The audit report does not recommend that a criminal proceeding or even a civil penalty proceeding be instituted.

39 Taking into account all of the considerations which I have mentioned, and balancing all of the public interests at large, it seems to me that, as matters presently stand, the case for even a temporary stay of the proceeding is neither compelling nor even persuasive. That is not to say that the granting of a stay is a remedy forever foreclosed to Burnett Water. Circumstances may change in which case it is at liberty again to bring an application.

40 The application should be dismissed. In the event of that occurrence, the Conservation Council did not seek any order as to costs other than that they be costs in the proceedings.

 I certify that the preceding forty (40) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487</tocase>
<text>27 The judgment of Finkelstein J considered by Robson J was that given by his Honour in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 487. As Robson J (at [63]) noted, the following passage (164 FCR 487 at [58]) summarises the conclusion reached by Finkelstein J in relation to the making of a declaratory judgment by a civil court with respect to criminal conduct:
 The English and Australian authorities that warn of the dangers of a civil court becoming involved in criminal conduct continue to apply in an appropriate company case. The general rule in a company case is that a civil court will usually be the appropriate court to deal with a contravention of the Corporations Act. But the court should be wary of granting relief, including the grant of a declaration or an injunction, if the case is likely to end up before a criminal court. Ordinarily, a civil court should not intervene in those circumstances unless its failure to do so will result in irreparable injury. That strict rule need not be applied if the case involves undisputed facts and the issue raised gives rise to a question of pure law. Then a declaration can be a very useful remedy. As Barwick CJ said in Commonwealth v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd that is the kind of case "which contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction. (Internal footnote references omitted.)

28 I approach this matter conscious of the warning to which Finkelstein J refers.

29 In the present matter Burnett Water has in the end brought its stay application after filing its defence rather than at the first directions hearing. No criminal or even civil penalty proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the Commonwealth are presently pending against it or any "executive officer" in respect of any of the matters alleged in the statement of claim. Prosecution or civil penalty proceedings are two of the options open to the Minister to consider under the EPBC Act, as his Department's policy and correspondence with Burnett Water recognise. So, too, is the seeking of injunctive relief under s 475 of the EPBC Act by the Minister himself. None of these options has yet been abandoned by the Minister or his Department. Yet other options theoretically open to the Minister to consider are the variation of the conditions of the approval, the suspension of the approval or its revocation: ss 143, 144 and 145 respectively.

34 An "interested person" may initiate proceedings for injunctive relief in circumstances where, for one reason or another, the Minister may be unable or unwilling so to do. Further, a condition precedent to the granting of that relief is the proof of a contravention of the EPBC Act. That formal declarations to this effect have not been sought in the application may therefore in substance be a distinction without a difference. However, the present proceeding is of a quite different type to that which provoked the observation made by Finkelstein J in the passage which I have quoted from Australian Securities and Investments Commission v HLP Financial Planning (Aust) Pty Ltd .

35 The EPBC Act is not unique in providing for the granting of injunctive relief in circumstances which may attract either a civil penalty or a criminal prosecution. Section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has, from the very commencement of that Act well over 30 years ago, permitted either an emanation of the Commonwealth in the form of what is now called the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) or any other person to institute proceedings for injunctive relief grounded in a finding of a contravention of Pt IV or Pt V of that Act. That there exists a theoretical contingency that a respondent's conduct may at the behest of the ACCC attract a civil penalty proceeding or a prosecution has not in the past proved to be a fertile source of precedent in relation to the staying of proceedings for injunctive relief under the Trade Practices Act initiated by a private person. An analogous conclusion is open in respect of the proceedings by private persons for injunctions grounded upon a breach of State fair trading statutes.

36 The EPBC Act does, by Subdivision B of Div 15 of Pt 17 of ch 6 (ss 486A to 486D) make some provision with respect to the relationship between criminal and civil penalty proceedings under that Act. I do not though discern in that Subdivision any implication that a proceeding for an injunction initiated by an "interested person" ought to be stayed even temporarily pending the making of a decision by the Minister as to whether civil penalty or criminal proceedings ought to be initiated in respect of the same conduct. Indeed, the absence of any reference in this Subdivision to a proceeding under s 475 of the EPBC Act is noteworthy.</text>

<tocase>Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 74 ; (1992-1993) 178 CLR 477</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1993/74.html</AustLII>
<text>30 Even though it is settled now that the privilege against self incrimination does not apply to corporations: Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 74 ; (1992-1993) 178 CLR 477 , note also s 187 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), it does not follow that Burnett Water is for that reason not entitled to seek a stay of the present proceedings. A prior civil proceeding may still in theory have a potential to embarrass a respondent corporation in relation to its defence of a later civil penalty or criminal proceeding. It is though for that corporation to demonstrate that this is more than an abstract concern.

31 A compliance audit of the dam having regard to the EPBC Act was completed by the Department in January 2008. That identified a "partial non-compliance" with, materially, condition 3 of the Ministerial approval. By October 2008 a revision in respect of the original modelling used to set the parameters of the fishways, a review of the monitoring program in respect of the fishways and the seeking of advice in respect of the possibility of an ameliorating "retrofit" to the fishways were occurring. A report on these subjects was expected to be received within 2 months. It is not yet to hand. After its receipt the Department will give further consideration to the course of action it should take. The prospect of either criminal or civil penalty proceedings is but a bare contingency at the moment.

32 In the meantime, according to preliminary report of 2 December 2008 provided by Professor Jean Ross of Macquarie University who has a research interest in the Australian lungfish, a concern remains about the impact of the dam and the present state of the fishways in relation to the future of that species in the Burnett River. She opines:
 My principal concern in relation to the possible passage for lungfish over the Paradise Dam is that lungfish are faithful to their spawning sites and need to be able to return to their spawning sites following movement away from those sites, primarily for feeding, following each spawning season. Moreover, due to habitat loss associated with the construction of the Paradise Dam and upstream and downstream water infrastructure, there is a potential for overcrowding at the remaining spawning sites.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/116.html</AustLII>
<text>33 The objects of the EPBC Act (s 3) include the protection of the environment and the promotion of biodiversity. Having regard to the very occasion for the imposition of condition 3 in the Ministerial approval, the evidence of Professor Ross and the objects of the EPBC Act, there are public interests at large in the present proceeding other than a potential embarrassment of Burnett Water and the administration of justice in relation to any civil penalty or criminal proceedings.
There is a public interest character in the injunctive relief which may be granted by the Court pursuant to s 475 of the EPBC Act. This was recognised by Black CJ and Finkelstein J in Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd [2006] FCAFC 116 ; (2006) 154 FCR 425 at 431-432, [19] to [21]:

 
 
 19 Parliament has determined that it is in the public interest that the enforcement provisions of the EPBC Act should be unusually comprehensive in scope. Section 475 of the EPBC Act and its related provisions form part of a much larger enforcement scheme contained in the 21 divisions of Pt 17. The provisions include the conferral of powers of seizure and forfeiture, powers to board and detain vessels and authority to continue a pursuit on the high seas.
 
 20 It is an important and distinctive feature of Div 14 of Pt 17 of the EPBC Act that, like s 80(4) of the TP Act, the Federal Court is expressly empowered to grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct whether or not it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again in conduct of that kind and, even, whether or not there is a significant risk of injury or damage to the environment if the person engages or continues to engage in conduct of that kind: see s 479(1)(a) and (c). 
 
 21 The public interest character of the injunction that may be granted under s 475 of the EPBC Act is also emphasised by other elements in Div 14 of Pt 17. Thus, as we have noted, standing is conferred upon 'an interested person' to apply to the Court for an injunction. Likewise, the traditional requirement that an applicant for an interim injunction give an undertaking as to damages as a condition of the grant is negated. Indeed, s 478 provides, expressly, that the Federal Court is not to require such an undertaking. These modifications to the traditional requirements for the grant of injunctions have the evident object of assisting in the enforcement, in the public interest, of the EPBC Act. This does not of course mean that the traditional requirements are irrelevant: see ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v TPC at 256-257.

<tocase>Jefferson Ltd v Bhetca [1979] 1 WLR 898</tocase>
<text>19 That the Court has a general power to control its proceedings and that this includes a power to grant a temporary stay of those proceedings in various circumstances is not in doubt. The authority cited by Burnett Water for this proposition, Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v The Boots Company (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 72 ; (1992) 34 FCR 287 at 290 certainly exemplifies this but in the different context of similar proceedings pending in a foreign jurisdiction. More pertinent is a line of authority with regard to this general power which may be traced to the judgement of Megaw LJ (Brandon LJ agreeing) in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha [1979] 1 WLR 898 in which (at 904H-905B) his Lordship stated:
 I should be prepared to accept that the court which is competent to control the proceedings in the civil action ... would have a discretion, under s 41 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925, to stay the proceedings if it appeared to the court that justice the balancing of justice between the parties so required, having regard to the concurrent criminal proceedings, and taking into account the principle, which applies in the criminal proceeding itself, of what is sometimes referred to as the 'right of silence' and the reason why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in criminal proceedings. But in the civil court it would be a matter of discretion, and not of right. There is, I say again, in my judgement, no principle of law that a plaintiff in a civil action is to be debarred from pursuing that action in accordance with the normal rules for the conduct of civil actions merely because so to do would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, by an affidavit under Order 14, or in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is or may be, in whole or in part, with the result with the result that he might be giving an indication of what his defence was likely to be in the contemporaneous criminal proceedings. The protection which is at present given to one facing a criminal charge the so-called 'right of silence' does not extend to give the defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings.</text>

<tocase>McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202</tocase>
<text>20 Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha , its initial Australian reception and the relationship, if any, between the discretion described by Megaw LJ in the passage quoted and the "felonious tort rule" were considered by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould (1982) 7 ACLR 202 in what has proved to be an influential judgment. In that case Mr McMahon, in his capacity as the liquidator of The Dominion Insurance Company of Australia Limited commenced proceedings against the directors of that company, including Mr Gould, for the recovery of sums of money. He alleged that the sums of money in question had been withdrawn from the company's account and misapplied and as a result the directors were guilty of fraud and breach of duty owed to the company. Mr Gould was, at the time already facing criminal proceedings directly related to the sums in question. He applied to the Supreme Court for a general stay of the liquidator's proceedings pending the termination of those criminal proceedings.

21 Against this background, Wootten J (at 206-207) made the following observations:
 I approach the decision of this matter with the following guidelines: 
 
 (a) Prima facie a plaintiff is entitled to have his action tried in the ordinary course of the procedure and business of the court ( Rochfort v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd at 19);
 (b) It is a grave matter to interfere with this entitlement by a stay of proceedings, which requires justification on proper grounds (ibid);
 (c) The burden is on the defendant in a civil action to show that it is just and convenient that the plaintiff's ordinary rights should be interfered with ( Jefferson v Bhetcha at 905);
 (d) Neither an accused (ibid) nor the Crown ( Rochfort v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd at 21) are entitled as of right to have a civil proceeding stayed because of a pending or possible criminal proceeding;
 (e) The court's task is one of "the balancing of justice between the parties" ( Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha at 904), taking account of all relevant factors (ibid at 905);
 (f) Each case must be judged on its own merits, and it would be wrong and undesirable to attempt to define in the abstract what are the relevant factors (ibid at 905);
 (g) One factor to take into account where there are pending or possible criminal proceedings is what is sometimes referred to as the accused's "right of silence", and the reasons why that right, under the law as it stands, is a right of a defendant in a criminal proceeding (ibid at 904). I return to this subject below;
 (h) However, the so-called "right of silence" does not extend to give such a defendant as a matter of right the same protection in contemporaneous civil proceedings. The plaintiff in a civil action is not debarred from pursuing action in accordance with the normal rules merely because to do so would, or might, result in the defendant, if he wished to defend the action, having to disclose, in resisting an application for summary judgment, in the pleading of his defence, or by way of discovery or otherwise, what his defence is likely to be in the criminal proceeding (ibid at 904 5);
 (i) The court should consider whether there is a real and not merely notional danger of injustice in the criminal proceedings (ibid at 905);
 (j) In this regard factors which may be relevant include: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the possibility of publicity that might reach and influence jurors in the civil proceedings (ibid at 905);
 (ii) the proximity of the criminal hearing (ibid at 905);
 (iii) the possibility of miscarriage of justice eg by disclosure of a defence enabling the fabrication of evidence by prosecution witnesses, or interference with defence witnesses (ibid at 905);
 (iv) the burden on the defendant of preparing for both sets of proceedings concurrently ( Beecee Group v Barton );
 (v) whether the defendant has already disclosed his defence to the allegations ( Caesar v Somner at 932; Re Saltergate Insurance Co Ltd at 736);
 (vi) the conduct of the defendant, including his own prior invocation of civil process when it suited him (cf Re S altergate Insurance Co Ltd at 735 6); 
 
 
 
 
 (k) The effect on the plaintiff must also be considered and weighed against the effect on the defendant. In this connection I suggest below that it may be relevant to consider the nature of the defendant's obligation to the plaintiff;
 (1) In an appropriate case the proceedings may be allowed to proceed to a certain stage, eg, setting down for trial, and then stayed Beecee Group v Barton ). 
 
(Citations of authorities mentioned omitted).

22 The first reported consideration in Queensland of the discretion described by Megaw LJ in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha is the judgment of Connolly J in Black &amp; White Cab Co Limited v Kelk [1984] 2 Qd R 484. That case was a civil proceeding in which Mr Kelk was a defendant to a claim for an injunction to restrain the use of allegedly confidential knowledge and damages for an alleged breach of his duty of trust and confidence. Though he had entered an appearance, he had filed no defence. In the meantime an indictment had been presented against him alleging an offence of making improper use as an employee of corporate information to gain an advantage for himself or another person. His Honour (at 485) described the passage which I have quoted above from the judgment of Megaw LJ in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha as "highly persuasive" and decided (at 487) to follow it. McMahon v Gould does not appear to have been drawn to his Honour's attention although two earlier New South Wales decisions in which Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha had been considered and which were in turn considered by Wootten J were. In the result, Connolly J dismissed the stay application, fixed a time for the filing of a defence and counterclaim and permitted the entry of interlocutory judgement for damages to be assessed in default of the delivery of the same. His Honour allowed (at 488) that, if the criminal trial were imminent, it may well be the proper course to postpone the trial of the civil action until after verdict observing that this was a matter which could be resolved when the civil action was closer to trial.

23 Later factual exemplars of the application of the discretion described by Megaw LJ in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha and of the guidelines set out by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould abound. The most recent of these appears to be a judgment delivered last month by Robson J of the Victorian Supreme Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge [2008] VSC 473. That case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it exemplifies that an exercise of the discretion in question in a civil proceeding may be sought even where related criminal proceedings have not been instituted but are instead "on the cards", i.e. a "reasonable possibility". Secondly, it contains a reflective discussion of whether the guidelines stated in McMahon v Gould should continue to be applied in light of later High Court authority. Thirdly, there is to be found in it consideration of observations made by Finkelstein J of this Court concerning the danger of a civil court's making declaratory judgments or granting injunctive relief if a matter is likely to end up before a criminal court.

24 As to the second of these noteworthy features, the following passage from the reasons for judgment of Robson J (at [30] to [32]) should be set out:
 Authority of McMahon v Gould 
 
 [30] ASIC submits the principles set out above are well established and have been applied in numerous other cases. It submits they should be followed in the present case. There are, however, indications that the principles may require review by an appellate court. In Yuill v Spedley Securities Ltd Kirby P referred to McMahon v Gould as "the existing law." His Honour indicated, however, that one day it may be appropriate for the guidelines referred to by Wootten J in McMahon v Gould to be reconsidered. Kirby P said that the guidelines do not take specifically into account the primacy of the administration of criminal justice in our legal system. In Niven v SS Beazley JA of the New South Wales Court of Appeal said there was force in Kirby's opinion although the case before him was not the case to reconsider McMahon v Gould . In Baker v The Commissioner of Federal Police Gyles J said that in view of Reid v Howard there was some merit in the view that there should be reconsideration of the manner in which the McMahon v Gould line of authorities is now applied so as to decide whether too little weight is given to the practical as well as legal prejudice to the accused and to the primacy of criminal proceedings in our justice system. Gyles J said:
 The applicants rely upon the decision of the High Court in Reid v Howard to suggest that the line of authority commencing with McMahon v Gould has given insufficient weight to, and has not fully appreciated the extent of, the privilege against self-incrimination. There is no doubt that Reid v Howard does re-affirm the importance of the privilege against self-incrimination, and does not give any encouragement to think that any devaluation of the principle which may apply in the United Kingdom will be applied in Australia. 
 
 [31] Gyles J said, however, that any such reconsideration would need to be undertaken either by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia or the High Court. This approach to McMahon v Gould was also adopted by Gray J in Elliot v APRA . Gray J did hold that the line of authority in McMahon v Gould was not constructed by way of any exception to the privilege against self-incrimination or self-exposure to a penalty. He said:
 
 
 
 
 
 Rather, it represents a means which the courts have developed to deal with the possible conflict between actual pending criminal proceedings and civil proceedings or administrative processes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The approach taken by Gyles J was also adopted by Mansfield J in Guglielmin v Trescowthick (No 3). 
 
 [32] Nevertheless, in Trade World Enterprises Pty Ltd v DCT Nettle JA (with whom Redlich JA agreed) said the relevant principles applicable to the exercise of discretion on an application for adjournment or stay were conveniently set out by Young CJ in Philippine Airlines v Goldair (Aust) Pty Ltd where Young CJ cited with approval the guidelines in McMahon v Gould . There was no examination of the reservations referred to by Kirby P.
 
 (Internal footnote references omitted)

25 In the result, Robson J (at [58]) felt that he was bound to follow what he described as the " McMahon v Gould line of authorities". So do I. Locally in Queensland, Daubney J reached a like conclusion last year in Osric Investments v Probst [2007] QSC 293 at [12].

26 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Flugge , Robson J felt constrained, as had others before him, to suggest that an appellate court may wish to reconsider McMahon v Gould . Insofar as McMahon v Gould recognises the existence of a power which a court has to control proceedings in a civil action by the granting of a stay of those proceedings where the interests of justice so require, I respectfully doubt whether there is any general need for a reconsideration of that case. It is important not to elevate particular factual circumstances calling or not calling for the exercise of that power into statements of principle. It seems to me that Wootten J was not endeavouring to do anything other than to set out guidelines. I do not approach this matter on the basis that the occasions for the exercise of the power are closed. What is required is a balancing of the interests of the applicant and respondent in a civil proceeding having regard to any statutory context relevant to that civil proceeding and to any impending or prospective criminal proceeding. A separate but not unrelated consideration is whether the civil proceeding or at least its then prosecution might be regarded as an abuse of the process of the court. Such considerations will especially loom where the applicant in a civil proceeding is an emanation of the Crown and seeks declaratory relief and the imposition of pecuniary penalties in circumstances where a respondent is or is in jeopardy of facing criminal proceedings in respect of substantially the same conduct. I note that such a prospect particularly influenced Robson J in his suggestion that McMahon v Gould may need to be reconsidered by an appellate court.</text>

<text>19 That the Court has a general power to control its proceedings and that this includes a power to grant a temporary stay of those proceedings in various circumstances is not in doubt. The authority cited by Burnett Water for this proposition, Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v The Boots Company (Australia) Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 72 ; (1992) 34 FCR 287 at 290 certainly exemplifies this but in the different context of similar proceedings pending in a foreign jurisdiction. More pertinent is a line of authority with regard to this general power which may be traced to the judgement of Megaw LJ (Brandon LJ agreeing) in Jefferson Ltd v Bhetcha [1979] 1 WLR 898 in which (at 904H-905B) his Lordship stated:
