<tocase>ACS v Anderson [1975] 1 NSWLR 212</tocase>
<text>88 The circumstances of this case are not quite the same as ACS v Anderson [1975] 1 NSWLR 212, to which I was referred in argument. There it was held that the entitlement of both the Crown and the accused to appeal against an evidentiary ruling, thereby providing a means of determining the question raised by an application for declaratory relief, was a ' cogent reason for the jurisdiction being declined ': at 217, per Hutley JA. In the present case, the prosecution does not yet have a means of challenging the Judge Advocate's ruling. But the likelihood is that it will soon have a means of challenging any similar ruling in this Court.

89 The evidence does not establish that there are any pending courts martial that will necessarily give rise to the same legal issue as that presented by the Judge Advocate's ruling in the present case. Even if the same issue does arise, the applicants do not suggest that a later court martial will be bound to follow the Judge Advocate's ruling. If that ruling is as flawed as the applicants suggest, they will be able to challenge it before the court martial when it convenes.

90 Furthermore, the intervention of this Court would sanction significant delay by the applicants, for which no adequate explanation has been given. The court martial process has been fragmented to the detriment of the Accused. Indeed, the making of a declaration will effectively require the court martial to reconsider the admissibility of the Record of Interview in the light of other arguments advanced by the Accused. An alternative procedure, which is sanctioned by Parliament and protects the interests of accused persons, is likely to be available shortly. This procedure will allow any ruling to the same effect as that made by the Judge Advocate, insofar as it has value as a precedent, to be challenged in this Court.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/39.html</AustLII>
<text>52 The expression ' the Commonwealth ' as used in s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act , is not to be construed narrowly. It includes statutory corporations which are agencies or instrumentalities of the Commonwealth: ASIC v Edensor , at 582 [43], per Gleeson, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Austral Pacific Group Ltd (in liq) v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136, at 152-153 [48] (and cases cited there) per McHugh J. However, it is not only a corporation that can be ' the Commonwealth ' for the purposes of s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act . In Commonwealth v Lyon [2003] FCAFC 284 ; (2003) 133 FCR 265, at 271 [21], the Full Federal Court considered it ' likely ' that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police was to be regarded as the Commonwealth for this purpose.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/1.html</AustLII>
<text>34 Paragraph 2.3.4 of the Defence Security Manual provides as follows:
 
 '2.3.4 DSA-SIU [Defence Security Authority Security Investigative Unit] is responsible for: 
 
 
 
 a. liaising with external agencies involved with reportable major security incidents and investigating serious and complex security incidents relating to offences under the: 
 
 
 
 i. Crimes Act 1914 , 
 
 ii. Criminal Code Act 1995 , 
 
 iii. Public Service Act 1999 , and 
 
 iv. Defence Force Discipline Act (DFDA) 1982 (limited), 
 
 
 
 b. referring appropriate incidents to the Service Police, AFP or ASIO, 
 
 c. liaising with other internal and external investigating agencies, 
 
 d. ensuring that security incidents are reported and maintained within the Defence Policing and Security Management System (DPSMS) for statistical purposes, and 
 
 e. linking security investigation outcomes into the development of policy, training and vetting'.

35 The Judge Advocate recorded that he had sat without members of the court martial pursuant to s 141(7) of the DFD Act , to consider the admissibility, inter alia , of the Record of Interview. He also recorded that he had received oral and written submissions from the legal representatives of the parties.

36 The Judge Advocate noted that there were effectively two relevant sources of " legislated evidence law of potential application '. The first was Pt 6 of the DFD Act . The second was the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ( ' Evidence Act '), which could apply to a court martial by virtue of s 146 of the DFD Act . He pointed out that s 8(1) of the Evidence Act provides that, subject to certain irrelevant exceptions, the Evidence Act is not to affect the operation of the provisions of any other Act. He also noted that the Evidence Act does not authorise the conduct of investigative action and does not afford a person conducting an investigation any rights.

50 Section 77(i) of the Constitution empowers the Parliament, with respect to any of the matters mentioned in ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , to make laws defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court. Section 75(iii) confers original jurisdiction on the High Court in all matters in which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth is a party. Section 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act is an exercise of Parliament's power pursuant to s 77(i) of the Constitution . The provision defines the jurisdiction of the Federal Court with respect to a limited class of the matters mentioned in s 75(iii) of the Constitution : Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 1 ; (2001) 204 CLR 559, at 581 [40], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ (with whom Hayne and Callinan JJ agreed generally).

61 The precise character of the power exercised by a court martial may be debatable. In White v DPP at [10], Gleeson CJ cited Professor Harrison Moore's description of courts martial as tribunals which exercise a ' judicial function but which stand outside Chapter III '. The Chief Justice later adopted (at [14]) the view of Brennan and Toohey JJ in Re Tracey; Ex parte Ryan (1989) 166 CLR 578, at 574, that service tribunals exercise a:
 
 'power sui generis which is supported solely by s 51(vi) [the defence power] for the purpose of maintaining or enforcing service discipline'.

62 Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ seemed to think that a court martial exercises judicial power, but not the judicial power of the Commonwealth for the purposes of Chapter III of the Constitution : White v DPP , at [50]-[51]. Callinan J, with whom Heydon J agreed, considered that courts martial ' undoubtedly exercise a form of judicial power ', but that the exercise of that power is outside Chapter III: White v DPP at [214], [235]-[236].</text>

<tocase>Bacon v Rose [1972] 2 NSWLR 793</tocase>
<text>91 The present case is quite different, for example, from Bacon v Rose [1972] 2 NSWLR 793, to which reference was also made in argument. In Bacon v Rose , Street CJ indicated that he would have been prepared to grant a declaration of right, had he concluded that committal proceedings had been improperly instituted against the plaintiff. His Honour said that (at 797):
 
 'If an administrative or ministerial process is wrongly invoked against a person, then there is in my view just as much basis for recognizing and declaring a right in that person to be rid of the invalid administrative or ministerial yoke as there is in the case where a person's property is invalidly affected'.

92 The issue of law presented in the present case does not involve a threshold question as to the constitution of the court martial. Indeed the challenge to the Judge Advocate's ruling, if successful, will not terminate the court martial. On the contrary, it will require the court martial to reconvene and to consider further arguments relating to the Record of Interview.

93 Having reached the conclusion that the circumstances of the present case are not exceptional, it is perhaps not necessary to consider the exercise of discretion as a separate matter. If, however, there is a residual discretion to grant the declaration relief sought by the applicants notwithstanding the conclusion I have reached, I would not exercise it in favour of the applicants. In addition to the matters to which I have referred, declaratory relief would involve the potential for significant prejudice to the Accused. On the information I have been given, if the present application were to succeed the Accused would be the only member of the Armed Forces charged with an offence before a court martial ever to be denied the benefit of a favourable evidentiary ruling made by the court martial. And if the amending legislation is passed, he would presumably be the last such person.

94 For the reasons I have given, I do not think that it would be appropriate for the Court to grant the applicants the declaration they seek. Even if they establish that the reasoning of the Judge Advocate in support of his evidentiary ruling was flawed, this is not one of the most exceptional cases that would justify the grant of declaratory relief. In any event, I would not be prepared to exercise any discretion available to me in favour of granting the declaration sought by the applicants.

95 The application will be dismissed. Since the Accused does not seek a costs order if he is successful in the proceedings, there will be no order as to costs.

 I certify that the preceding ninety-five (95) numbered Paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Sackville.

<tocase>Commonwealth v Lyon [2003] FCAFC 284 ; (2003) 133 FCR 265</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2003/284.html</AustLII>
<text>52 The expression ' the Commonwealth ' as used in s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act , is not to be construed narrowly. It includes statutory corporations which are agencies or instrumentalities of the Commonwealth: ASIC v Edensor , at 582 [43], per Gleeson, Gaudron and Gummow JJ; Austral Pacific Group Ltd (in liq) v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39 ; (2000) 203 CLR 136, at 152-153 [48] (and cases cited there) per McHugh J. However, it is not only a corporation that can be ' the Commonwealth ' for the purposes of s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act . In Commonwealth v Lyon [2003] FCAFC 284 ; (2003) 133 FCR 265, at 271 [21], the Full Federal Court considered it ' likely ' that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police was to be regarded as the Commonwealth for this purpose.

54 Mr Levet does not suggest that there is no ' matter ' before the Court within the meaning of s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act . This presumably reflects his acceptance of the view that there is a real controversy between the Director and the Accused as to the proper construction of the DFD Act : see Commonwealth v Lyon , at 272 [24] ff.

55 At one stage, Mr Levet argued that the DFD Act and the Defence Force Discipline Appeals Act 1955 (Cth) (' DFDA Act ') constitute a code and that, together, they have the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief in respect of a court martial. Mr Levet did not, however, persist with this argument.

56 I therefore conclude the Court has jurisdiction to entertain the application for a declaration. It is not necessary to consider whether the Commonwealth was properly joined as a party to the proceedings.

57 There is no dispute that, if the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for a declaration, it has the power to grant such a declaration: Commonwealth v Lyon , at 271-272 [22].

58 Mr Levet submits ' with some diffidence ' that the Commonwealth Crown is one and indivisible and cannot appear on both sides of the record. He acknowledges that the Commonwealth often appears on both sides of the record, for example where one Commonwealth agency takes proceedings against another or where a Commonwealth official prosecutes a Commonwealth agency. He also acknowledges that he can point to no authority which has upheld the submission.

59 I do not think that there is any substance in the submission.</text>

<tocase>Mellifont v. Attorney-General (Qld) [1991] HCA 53 ; (1991) 173 CLR 289</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/53.html</AustLII>
<text>73 The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the 2007 Bill records that the proposed amendments are designed:
 
 'to enable the [Director] to seek a determination from the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal on a question of law that arises in an [Australian Military Court] trial, at the conclusion of that trial. This amendment gives the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal the jurisdiction to hear and determine the question of law. These items also make the necessary consequential amendments to provisions in the [ DFD Act ] to give effect to this amendment. 
 
 The rationale for this proposal has been explained by the High Court in Mellifont v. Attorney-General (Qld) [1991] HCA 53 ; (1991) 173 CLR 289 the emphasis being that there should be a procedure to obtain a correct statement of the law for future cases (that is, precedent) 
 
 
 
 "... the purpose of seeking and obtaining a review of the trial judge's ruling was to secure a correct statement of the law so that it would be applied correctly in future cases. ... The statutory procedure, which has counterparts in other Australian jurisdictions, is a standard procedure for correcting an error of law in criminal proceedings ..." 
 
 
 
 The ability of the [Director] to obtain such rulings will serve to improve the efficiency and accuracy of future trials under the [ DFD Act ]'. (Emphasis added.)

74 The applicants do not suggest in their supplementary written submissions that it is inappropriate for me to take into account the terms of a Bill that is currently before Parliament (as distinct from taking into account legislation that has been passed by Parliament but is not yet in force). No doubt the applicants have adopted this stance because they recognise that it is likely that the 2007 Bill , insofar as it provides for the prosecution to refer a question of law to the Tribunal, will be enacted by Parliament in due course. In any event, I consider the applicants' stance to be a proper one for them to take, particularly having regard to the difficult position in which the Accused finds himself.

75 The applicants do point out, however, that the Bill, if passed, will apply only to future rulings of the proposed Australian Military Court. It will therefore not apply to rulings made by a court martial before the amending legislation comes into force. They also rely on the fact that the Bill makes no provision for appeals by the prosecution in respect of interlocutory rulings. Thus the proposed legislation will not incorporate provisions equivalent to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), which allows interlocutory appeals in criminal prosecutions in certain circumstances.</text>

<tocase>Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1978/43.html</AustLII>
<text>63 Whatever the precise characterisation of the powers of a court martial, the parties in the present case, in substance, agree that the observations of Brennan J in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1, govern the applicants' claim for declaratory relief. His Honour said this (at 25-26):
 
 'In any case in which a declaration can be and is sought on a question of evidence or procedure, the circumstances must be most exceptional to warrant the grant of relief. The power to make declaratory orders has proved to be a valuable addition to the armoury of the law. The procedure involved is simple and free from technicalities; properly used in an appropriate case the use of the power enables the salient issue to be determined with the least possible delay and expense. But the procedure is open to abuse, particularly in criminal cases, and if wrongly used can cause the very evils it is designed to avoid. Applications for declarations as to the admissibility of evidence may in some cases be made by an accused person for purposes of delay, or by a prosecutor to impose an additional burden on the accused, but even when such an application is made without any improper motive it is likely to be dilatory in effect, to fragment the proceedings and to detract from the efficiency of the criminal process. ... [A] court will be reluctant to make declarations in a matter which impinges directly upon the course of proceedings in a criminal matter. Once criminal proceedings have begun they should be allowed to follow their ordinary course unless it appears that for some special reason it is necessary in the interests of justice to make a declaratory order'. (Emphasis added.)

64 Dr Renwick relies on four matters to support the contention that the circumstances of this case fall into the ' most exceptional ' class:
 
 
 &#8226; the institution of the present proceedings caused no significant delay in the resolution of the court martial;
 &#8226; the applicants have no alternative avenue by which to test the ruling of the Judge Advocate;
 &#8226; the legal issue presented for resolution is of ' some wider significance '; and
 &#8226; the issue presented to the Court is straightforward, in the sense that the facts are not in dispute and the issue is one of law.

65 It is necessary to say something about each of the matters on which Dr Renwick relies before reaching a conclusion as to whether the principles laid down in Sankey v Whitlam are satisfied in the present case and whether, in any event, I should exercise any discretion that I have in favour of making a declaration (assuming the applicants' substantive argument is accepted).

66 In my opinion, it is not correct to say that there has been no significant delay in this case. The Judge Advocate gave his ruling on evidence on 11 April 2007. On that day, the prosecutor informed the Judge Advocate that he (the prosecutor) had instructions to seek judicial review of ' the decision ' (presumably the ruling) and to proceed expeditiously in the Federal Court. On this basis, the matter was adjourned. Despite the assurance given to the Judge Advocate, the proceedings in this Court were not commenced until 3 July 2007. When invited to give an explanation for the delay of nearly three months, Dr Renwick replied that it had taken that length of time to obtain instructions for the proceedings to be brought in the name of the Commonwealth.

67 There are, however, two difficulties with the proffered explanation. The first is that there is no evidence as to why obtaining instructions for the Commonwealth to be named as a party should take nearly three months. The second and more important difficulty is that, on the applicants' jurisdictional case (which I have accepted), the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for declaratory relief regardless of whether the Commonwealth is joined as an applicant in the proceedings. As I have explained, the Court acquired jurisdiction pursuant to s 39B(1A)(a) of the Judiciary Act , by virtue of the Director being named as an applicant for declaratory relief.

68 It seems to me that the applicants did not commence the proceedings in this Court expeditiously. In consequence the Accused, who has the benefit of a favourable ruling that would effectively entitle him to an acquittal at the court martial (as Dr Renwick accepted), has been subjected to a significant delay and (I am prepared to infer) the attendant stress and anxiety associated with the delay. Indeed, but for the Court offering a very early hearing date, the delay occasioned by the application would have been even greater. Moreover, in my view, it is undeniable that the court martial process has been fragmented, one of the evils to which Brennan J referred in Sankey v Whitlam . This is so notwithstanding that the Judge Advocate acceded to the prosecution's request to adjourn the court martial to enable the evidentiary ruling to be challenged in this Court.

69 Dr Renwick suggests that some time would have been required to conclude the court martial, even if no application had been made to the Court. But in the absence of a challenge to the Judge Advocate's ruling, there is nothing to suggest that the court martial could not have been reconvened within a very short time. Given Dr Renwick's concession that rejection of the Record of Interview was fatal to the prosecution's case, a reconvened court martial would had had no option but to dismiss the charges against the Accused.

70 It is true that the current statutory regime makes no provision for the prosecutor to appeal against unfavourable evidentiary rulings made by a judge advocate in the course of a court martial. However, during the hearing, I was informed by Dr Renwick that his understanding was that legislation had been enacted by the Parliament which would alter this situation, although his information was that the legislation would not come into force until October 2007.

86 In determining whether I should entertain the application for declaratory relief in respect of an evidentiary ruling made in the course of an incomplete court martial, there are two closely related questions. The first is whether the present application involves ' most exceptional ' circumstances, as Sankey v Whitlam suggests and the applicants accept is necessary for the grant of declaratory relief. The second is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of granting the declaration sought by the applicants (assuming they make out their contentions on the question of law).

87 In my view, the applicants have not established that the circumstances of this case are most exceptional. I am prepared to accept that the issue of law that the applicants wish to ventilate is of some importance in relation to the organisational arrangements within the ADO and the Department of Defence for the investigation of alleged security breaches by defence personnel. However, the legislation before Parliament proposing to amend the DFDA Act , if passed (as seems likely), will provide a mechanism for testing the correctness of the Judge Advocate's reasoning in the present case (should that reasoning be followed by a subsequent court martial or by the Australian Military Court, once it is established). The new statutory procedure, unlike the procedure invoked by the applicants in the present case, will not deny the accused person the benefit of a favourable evidentiary ruling by reason of the presiding officer erring in law. Nor will it involve delay and fragmentation of the court martial or military court process, as do the current proceedings.</text>

<tocase>White v Director of Military Prosecutions [2007] HCA 29</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2007/29.html</AustLII>
<text>12 The second applicant, the Director of Military Prosecutions (' Director ') holds an office established by s 188G of the DFD Act . The Director is appointed by the Minister and holds office for a term not exceeding five years: ss 188GF(1), 188GH(1). The Minister may terminate the Director's appointment on certain grounds (s 188GN(1)) and must terminate the appointment in specified circumstances: s 188GN(2). The Director must be a full-time member of the armed forces: s 188GN(3). The functions of the Director include the following (s 188GA(1)):
 
 
 '(a) to carry on prosecutions for service offences in proceedings before ... a court martial, whether or not instituted by the Director of Military Prosecutions; 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (e) to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of any of the preceding functions.'

13 The Registrar holds an office established by s 188F of the DFD Act . The functions of the Registrar include assisting the Judge Advocate General and the Chief Judge Advocate, by providing administrative and management services in connection with charges and trials under the DFD Act : s 188FA(1).

14 A court martial is either a general court martial or a restricted court martial: s 114(1). A restricted court martial consists of a President and not less than two other members: s 114(3). A restricted court martial cannot impose a term of imprisonment or detention exceeding six months: sch 2, cl 2. As has been noted, the present case involves a ruling made by the Judge Advocate in the course of a restricted court martial.

15 Subject to certain exceptions, a court martial has jurisdiction to try any charge of a service offence against any person: ss 3(1) (definition of ' charge '), 115(1). In general, the hearing of a matter before a court martial is to be in public: s 140(1). All service tribunals, including a court martial, must apply the criminal onus and standard of proof: s 10 (applying Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code to service offences).

16 Subject to the Constitution , a civil court does not have jurisdiction to try a charge of a service offence: s 190(1). The expression ' civil court ' is defined in s 3(1) to mean ' a federal court or a court of a State or Territory '.

48 Although not asking for the Commonwealth to be removed as a party, the Accused submits that the Commonwealth is not a proper party to the proceedings and that it has been joined as an applicant only in order to enliven the Court's jurisdiction. Mr Levet further contends on behalf of the Accused that the declaratory relief sought by the applicants, if granted, would have no direct legal effect upon the rights of the Commonwealth and that, insofar as the Commonwealth has an interest in the outcome of the proceedings, its interest is no different from that of the Director. According to Mr Levet, the Commonwealth is seeking to intervene in what is in substance a criminal prosecution, even though the prosecution does not involve the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth for the purposes of Chapter III of the Constitution : White v Director of Military Prosecutions [2007] HCA 29.

49 Perhaps because the applicants did not advance their alternative jurisdictional argument until the oral submissions, Mr Levet said very little about it. He did not, however, concede the correctness of the alternative argument advanced by Dr Renwick.</text>
