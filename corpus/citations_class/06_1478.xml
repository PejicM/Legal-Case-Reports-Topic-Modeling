<text>20 In that regard his Honour referred to the Full Court of this Court's discussion of the effect of the provisions in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193 ; (2005) 88 ALD 90 (at [17]-[26]). His Honour also referred to the judgment of Cooper J in Zhou v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1078 ; (2004) 139 FCR 60 (at [42]-[45]), and the Full Court judgment of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115 (at [39]-[44]). That judgment in turn accepted and applied the reasoning in Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448; and Gerhard v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 495.</text>

<text>20 In that regard his Honour referred to the Full Court of this Court's discussion of the effect of the provisions in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193 ; (2005) 88 ALD 90 (at [17]-[26]). His Honour also referred to the judgment of Cooper J in Zhou v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1078 ; (2004) 139 FCR 60 (at [42]-[45]), and the Full Court judgment of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115 (at [39]-[44]). That judgment in turn accepted and applied the reasoning in Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448; and Gerhard v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 495.

33 Counsel for the appellant conceded that, on the basis of the Full Court authorities in Zhou , Yu , Humayun and Tian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 238 , I am bound to determine this point against his client. He contended that the above line of authority is "plainly wrong". He said that the appellant seeks an opportunity to make that submission to a Full Court. After the filing of this appeal a judge of the Court in Melbourne with responsibility in relation to migration appeals made a decision that this appeal should be dealt with by a single judge. No contrary view was expressed on behalf of the appellant until this morning. It is not appropriate for me in those circumstances to refer this issue to a Full Court. It is more appropriate for the appellant to seek special leave in the High Court to test the correctness of the above mentioned Full Court judgments. However, the utility of doing so may be questionable given the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph above concerning an alternative basis for the relevant findings of the delegate and the Tribunal.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>

<text>23 In considering whether the Tribunal had applied the correct test in determining whether the appellant had "not complied" with condition 8202 rather than whether he had "breached" the condition, the Federal Magistrate found that there was no difference in meaning that was of any relevant significance. His Honour found that it was the type of distinction that was well covered by the comments of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.

24 Having found that no jurisdictional error had been established on any of the contended grounds, His Honour dismissed the appellant's applications with costs.

25 The appellant now appeals the Federal Magistrate's decision. I am empowered to hear that appeal pursuant to s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

26 The grounds relied on by the appellant in this appeal are in almost identical terms to those relied upon by him before the Federal Magistrate. The only material difference is that the errors are now said to have been made by both the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal.

27 The judgments referred to by the Federal Magistrate, and by the Full Court in Zhou , authoritatively deal with the appellant's contention that s 116 is limited by Pt 2 , Div 3, Subdiv GB of the Migration Act , and by s 20 of the ESOS Act.</text>

<tocase>Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 841</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2005/841.html</AustLII>
<text>18 The Federal Magistrate observed that the appellant sought review of the Tribunal's decision on the following grounds: 
 
 
 &#8226; that s 20 of the ESOS Act and Subdiv GB of Div 3, of Pt 2 of the Migration Act limit the operation of s 116 of the Migration Act ;
 &#8226; that the notice sent to the appellant purportedly under s 20 of the ESOS Act was invalid on the grounds set out in Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 841 , so that there was no power in the Tribunal to cancel the visa, or alternatively, it was not open to it to be satisfied that the appellant had not complied with condition 8202 as the sending of a valid notice was a condition of non-compliance; and
 &#8226; that the Tribunal erred by considering whether the appellant had breached condition 8202 rather than inquiring whether or not he had complied with that condition.

19 The Federal Magistrate reviewed the relevant legislation and found that the combined effect of s 116(3) and reg 2.43(2) was to remove any discretion and make visa cancellation mandatory in the case of a breach of any of the conditions referred to in reg 2.43(2).</text>
