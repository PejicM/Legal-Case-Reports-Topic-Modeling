<tocase>Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407</tocase>
<text>19 Scarlett FM found that the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's credibility was based upon his evidence to the Tribunal, independent country information, inconsistencies within the appellant's own evidence and inconsistencies between his evidence and the independent country information. His Honour relied upon the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 , which held that the assessment of the credibility of an applicant is a matter of fact and is a matter solely for the administrative decision maker. Scarlett FM observed that there is no basis for conducting a judicial review and interfering with the Tribunal's findings provided there is evidence upon which a credibility finding may be made.

20 Scarlett FM satisfied himself that the appellant's own evidence and the independent country information were sufficient to allow the Tribunal to make its findings concerning the appellant's credibility. The Court finds that his Honour did not err in making such finding.</text>

<tocase>SZBYR and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2007/26.html</AustLII>
<text>26 The Tribunal found that there were inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence. Scarlett FM noted that it was well established that inconsistencies in evidence do not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the [2007] FCA 26 ; Act (see SZBYR and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ) and accordingly do not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA. His Honour also observed that the Tribunal offered the appellant an opportunity to comment on certain aspects of the evidence, although before his Honour the appellant denied that he was given such opportunity.

27 The Court observes that s 424AA of the Act does not contain an equivalent provision to s 424A(3). Section 424A(3) identifies material which is not 'information' for the purposes of the application of that section. However, as s 424AA is merely an alternative form of notification available to the Tribunal (see s 424A(2A)) , the Court considers that the exclusions contained in s 424A(3) apply with equal force to s 424AA. Such inference is supported by the collective use of the term 'information' in s 424A(2A) of the Act (a subsection which applies to both ss 424A and 424AA ), as such use implies uniformity of meaning. Section 424A(2A) provides:
 
 
 (2A) The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant, nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under section 424AA. 
 

Accordingly, the Court considers that what is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act is also not 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA.

28 It follows from the above that no error is apparent in the Federal Magistrate's finding in relation to the Tribunal's compliance with s 424AA of the Act. The appellant's second ground of appeal is accordingly rejected.</text>

<tocase>SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor [2008] FMCA 759</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FMCA/2008/759.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The appellant appeals from the decision of Federal Magistrate Scarlett delivered on 26 May 2008 which dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') handed down on 20 December 2007 (see SZLXI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Anor [2008] FMCA 759). The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ('the Minister') to refuse to grant a Protection (Class XA) visa ('the protection visa') to the appellant.

2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('the PRC'). The appellant arrived in Australia on 7 July 2007 and lodged an application for the protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on 20 August 2007. A delegate of the Minister refused the application for the protection visa on 31 August 2007. On 28 September 2007 the appellant made an application to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.

3 Before the Tribunal the appellant claimed to have been recruited by the People's Liberation Army ('the army') in October 1982 as an engineer. The appellant claimed that after being demobilised he became a goldsmith and in 1999 established his own business in Wuxi City. The appellant claimed that as he was not a local in Wuxi City he became a victim of corruption at the hands of the local officials.</text>
