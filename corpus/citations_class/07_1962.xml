<tocase>Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v CS &amp; GJ Handby Pty Ltd (1989) 21 FCR 19</tocase>
<text>18 Under s 556 of the Code, and under the former s 592 of the Corporations Law (which is relevantly in the same terms as s 556 of the Code), it is clear that the liability of a director for insolvent trading could be proved by a creditor as a debt in the bankruptcy of the director: see e.g. Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v CS &amp; GJ Handby Pty Ltd (1989) 21 FCR 19; Vale v TMH Haulage Pty Ltd (1993) 31 NSWLR 702; CCA Systems Pty Ltd v Communications &amp; Peripherals (Australia) Pty Ltd (1989) 15 ACLR 720 at 728 729. In Handby 21 FCR 19, the Full Court (Morling Beaumont and Burchett JJ) concluded that s 556(1) of the Code rendered the company and the director (in the circumstances prescribed) jointly and severally liable for the debt. Their Honours observed at 24 25 that s 82(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and its precursors have been generously construed, and that there was no reason why it should not encompass debts or liabilities arising under statute. They then concluded at 26 27 that the statutory liability created by s 556(1) of the Code is for "the payment of the debt incurred by the company" (the Full Court's emphasis), and is a liability for a nominated debt which was not a demand in the nature of a demand for unliquidated damages but a claim for money under a statute.</text>

<tocase>Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (in liq) (1986) 4 NSWLR 722</tocase>
<text>23 The Harmer Report and the Discussion Paper of The Law Reform Commission (Discussion Paper 32, August 1987) explain generally the rationale of what became Pt 5.7B of the Corporations Law. It was to impose a positive duty upon a director owed to the company to prevent the company from engaging in insolvent trading. Thus, it was intended to produce a legislative structure which enables all creditors to share equally in the sums recovered, so as to promote the principle of equality. The reason for the change from a focus upon a creditor recovering a debt to the liquidator recovering loss and damage suffered by a creditor in relation to a debt is set out in pars 200 and 201 of the Discussion Paper and in the legislative proposals then put forward. It is relevantly summarised in par 202 of the Discussion Paper as being that the amount of the liability is to be determined by the Court and measured by reference to the loss and damage sustained by the creditors, and the sum recovered should then be applied for the benefit of all the unsecured creditors. Paragraph 213 then provides that the Court has
 
 ... a very broad power to give judgment in favour of the company in such amount as is just having regard to the interests of the creditors. This is to ensure that the damages recovered do not simply reflect some nominal damage to the company. The damage suffered by creditors is the relevant measure. This is consistent with Kinsela's case . It is not sufficient simply to provide that the measure of damages should be an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid debts which were incurred during the period of insolvent trading. Where debts are incurred, the company usually obtains some benefit.
 
 ...
 
 The amount for which a director who is found to have breached the duty should be liable is a matter requiring careful quantification on the facts of each case. A broad discretion to be exercised by the court is appropriate.
 

Paragraph 317 of the Harmer Report restates those views, and gives some examples of the need for a broad judicial discretion. The reference to Kinsela's case is a reference to Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (in liq) (1986) 4 NSWLR 722, where Street CJ (with whom Hope and McHugh JJA agreed) at 732 733 said that the damage suffered by creditors from insolvent trading supports the view that the directors of a corporation must owe a duty to consider, in certain circumstances, the interests of the creditors.

24 
 
Paragraphs 1103 to 1106 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporate Law Reform Bill specifically address the proposed s 588M. The text appears to assume that the liquidator will effect recovery of the loss and damage suffered by a creditor to whom a debt is owed by "action", and explains why such "proceedings" should generally be permitted only through the liquidator, so the creditor's right to bring proceedings under s 588M(3) is curtailed: see s 588R 588U. That was said to ensure the principle of equal sharing.

25 Nothing is said in the Explanatory Memorandum as to why the expression "loss and damage in relation to a debt" was introduced, rather than the form of expression in the earlier legislation.</text>

<tocase>Coventry v Charter Pacific Corp Ltd (2005) 227 CLR 234</tocase>
<text>27 Section 82(1) of the Bankruptcy Act adopts the use of wide language in expressing what are to be considered admissible debts and liabilities in bankruptcy. See for example the discussion of its history and of its terms in the joint judgment of the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corp Ltd (2005) 227 CLR 234 at [20] [29]; Re Hide; Ex parte Llynvi Coal and Iron Co (1871) 7 Ch App 28 at 31 32 per James LJ.

The trustee, in my judgment, is not entitled to reject the proof of debt lodged by the Liquidator because it falls within s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act . For the reasons given, I consider that the trustee erred in doing so. It is not therefore necessary to address the qualification in s 82(2) excluding claims for unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract promise or breach of trust. That qualification in s 82(2) was considered by the High Court in Coventry 227 CLR 234. If it had been necessary to address that qualification, there may have been some difference between the Liquidator's claim based upon unpaid trade creditors of the Company and the statutory imposts also included in his proofs of debt.</text>

<tocase>Fryer v Powell (2001) 159 FLR 433</tocase>
<text>30 The wording of s 588M(2) also, in my view, tends to confirm that no such dramatic change was contemplated by the introduction of Div 4 of Pt 5.7B. Section 588M(2) empowers the liquidator to recover from the director "as a debt due to the company" an amount equal to the amount of loss or damage. That is the loss or damage suffered by the creditor or creditors in relation to the debt because of the company's insolvency. The use of the word "debt" in s 588M(2) and in s 588M(3) in the case of a creditor's action must be given some work. In Fryer v Powell (2001) 159 FLR 433, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia (Olsson, Duggan and Williams JJ) addressed the use of that word "debt" in s 588G and s 588M. In that case the liquidators of a company in liquidation sued the directors for recovery of a sum of money equivalent to the sum of the debts incurred at the time when the company was insolvent or when grounds existed for a reasonable suspicion that it was insolvent, to the knowledge of the directors. Judgment was given against the directors and they appealed. The relevant issue on that appeal was whether statutory imposts under the ITAA could constitute a debt for the purposes of s 588G of the Corporations Law, so the precise issue in this matter did not directly arise. The claim against the directors included a range of categories of debt including debts due to trade creditors (which do not appear to have been contentious), accrued leave entitlements, unpaid sales tax liabilities, penalties for non-payment of sales tax, unpaid group tax and assessed penalties for non-payment of group tax, and unpaid WorkCover levies and penalties for non-payment of WorkCover levies. Olsson J (with whom Duggan and Williams JJ agreed) concluded at 442, at [62] [63] that the ordinary English meaning of the word "debt" should be adopted, there being nothing in the Corporations Law to suggest any other special meaning, and because that meaning had been attributed to that word in s 556 of the Companies Code: see eg per Gleeson CJ in Hawkins v Bank of China (1992) 26 NSWLR 562 at 572. In respect of the statutory imposts, his Honour said at [72], at 444:
 
 ... if, by reason of the normal, ongoing operations of a company (including the mere passive retention of existing staff or premises), it is liable to pay a statutory impost, then it may properly be said that such an impost has been "incurred", as a debt, by the entity in question.
 

In a complementary submission, counsel for the directors in that case (as here) placed emphasis upon the expression "loss or damage" in s 588M. It, too, is not defined either in the Corporations Law or in the Corporations Act . The argument was that the expression "loss or damage" indicated that the quantification of the liability was not the amount of the unpaid trade debt in each instance, and it was necessary for the Court to examine each individual debt and to make various potential abatements of it. His Honour said at [88] [89], at 447 that:
 
 I entertain no doubt that, read in context, the loss and damage adverted to is the amount of the unpaid debt due to the creditor in question. This is the view which was obviously taken by Austin J in Tourprint International Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Bott (1999) 32 ACSR 201 at 217 and, in my experience, has always been applied to the practical administration of the statute. Whilst the provisions of the Corporations Law , so applied, may give rise to some practical consequences which could be said to be somewhat arbitrary and possibly inequitable in some respects, the insolvency law has always, as a matter of practicality and commercial expediency, had to adopt certain parameters which are arbitrary. There is nothing particularly novel in the approach here in question. By way of contrast, the adoption of the approach espoused by Mr Randle would render administration in insolvency virtually unworkable. The legislature could not possibly have envisaged creating the inevitable complexity and requirement for detailed examination of collateral issues which Mr Randle propounds.
 
 I therefore reject his submissions and conclude that the "loss or damage" in question will normally be the quantum of relevant unpaid debts.
 

Austin J in Tourprint International Pty Ltd (in liq) v Bott (1999) 32 ACSR 201 at 217 at [78] does not appear to have given the matter considerable attention because it did not arise in that case. See at [78]. His Honour's observations are certainly consistent with that conclusion, but they do not contain any consideration specifically of the point.

31 On the other hand, Mandie J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 1) recognised, correctly in my view, that Fryer v Powell 159 FLR 433 laid down only a general rule capable of variation according to particular circumstances: see at [2003] VSC 123 ; (2003) 175 FLR 124 at 255, at [535]. In that case, the loss and damage suffered by the creditors of a company in their claim against the directors needed to be adjusted beyond the amount of the unpaid debt because of an interim dividend distributed by the administrator under a scheme of arrangement of the company and for a further dividend which those creditors were likely to receive. His Honour added at 256 [535]:
 
 To the extent that any allowance for actual unexpected dividends is contrary to what was decided concerning the meaning of "loss and damage" in Powell v Fryer (2001) 37 ACSR 589, 602-3 (sic), I understand the plaintiff to have conceded that such allowance should be made and I tend, with respect, to think that the concession was correct in principle.

32 There is some apparent inconsistency in expression in the observations of Olsson J in Fryer v Powell 159 FLR 433, between an absolute assertion that loss and damage is the amount of unpaid debt due to the creditor, and that it is normally the quantum of the relevant unpaid debts. Those two things are not necessarily the same. The difference may not have been significant to the resolution of that case.

33 In my view, the difference in expression is also not of significance to the issue which presently arises in this matter. That is because the question is as to the nature of the entitlement in the liquidator established by s 588M(2) so far as it applies in the bankruptcy of the directors, having regard to s 82(1) and (2) of the Bankruptcy Act .</text>

<text>31 On the other hand, Mandie J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin (No 1) recognised, correctly in my view, that Fryer v Powell 159 FLR 433 laid down only a general rule capable of variation according to particular circumstances: see at [2003] VSC 123 ; (2003) 175 FLR 124 at 255, at [535]. In that case, the loss and damage suffered by the creditors of a company in their claim against the directors needed to be adjusted beyond the amount of the unpaid debt because of an interim dividend distributed by the administrator under a scheme of arrangement of the company and for a further dividend which those creditors were likely to receive. His Honour added at 256 [535]:
 
 To the extent that any allowance for actual unexpected dividends is contrary to what was decided concerning the meaning of "loss and damage" in Powell v Fryer (2001) 37 ACSR 589, 602-3 (sic), I understand the plaintiff to have conceded that such allowance should be made and I tend, with respect, to think that the concession was correct in principle.

34 I do not consider it is useful to import into the words of s 588M(2) a requirement that the loss and damage referred to in s 588M(1)(b) and s 588M(2) be characterised as liquidated or unliquidated. Clearly, s 588M(2) entitles the liquidator to recover the loss and damage, whatever its character, from the directors as a debt due to the company. It is the debt due to the company which entitles the liquidator to prove in the bankruptcy of the directors. Although the wording of s 588M(1)(b) and (c) indicate that the loss and damage of the creditor or creditors need not equate to the amount of the debt or debts (eg as Mandie J identified in Plymin [2003] VSC 123 ; 175 FLR 124), if there has been a distribution in the liquidation of the company to reduce that debt as at the date of the claim made in the bankruptcy by realisation of other assets of the company), s 588M(2) states that the loss and damage for the purposes of the claim against the directors be recoverable as a debt. I note that Hammerschlag J in Buzzle Operations Pty Ltd (in liq) v Apple Computer Australia Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 930 at [24] [25] adopted that position, albeit that the question was not apparently in contention before his Honour.</text>

<tocase>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Paola [2005] FCA 855</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2005/855.html</AustLII>
<text>37 In reaching that conclusion, I have not overlooked the observation of Hill J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Paola [2005] FCA 855 at [25] upon which senior counsel for the Trustee relied. That case concerned the opposition of a bankruptcy petition based upon an act of bankruptcy the failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice founded upon a judgment debt. The debtor disputed his insolvency, and claimed that he would receive funds to pay the judgment debt from the liquidator of another company in liquidation who had accepted a proof of debt from the debtor for a significant sum. Alternatively, the debtor sought the bankruptcy petition be adjourned until the liquidator paid a dividend to the creditors of the company in liquidation. The payment of the anticipated dividend was held up pending the hearing of certain proceedings involving that company.

38 His Honour rejected the debtor's claim of solvency. He observed that the outstanding proceedings included a contested claim against the debtor for insolvent trading in his capacity as a director of the company, but declined to adjourn the bankruptcy petition pending the outcome of that proceeding in the exercise of his discretion because its resolution was a considerable time off, and because its outcome was uncertain. In the course of considering the exercise of the discretion, his Honour said at [25] that, even if a sequestration order were made, the proceedings against the debtor for insolvent trading would be stayed under s 58(3)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act because that claim fell under s 82(2) of that Act.

39 Although his Honour's remarks suggest that he held the view that a claim under s 588M(2) of the Corporations Act is not a claim provable in the bankruptcy of a director, that view was not expressed after the benefit of argument on the matter. It does not form part of the ratio decidendi of the decision. It is not a view which his Honour reached after the opportunity of considering the decisions to which I have referred or the analysis of the precise wording of s 588M. I accordingly do not think that the decision obliges me to reach a conclusion different from that I have reached; nor that I should do so.</text>

<tocase>Macks (trustee of the estate of Weber), Re Weber (bankrupt) [2006] FCA 636 ; (2006) 233 ALR 50</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/636.html</AustLII>
<text>18 Under s 556 of the Code, and under the former s 592 of the Corporations Law (which is relevantly in the same terms as s 556 of the Code), it is clear that the liability of a director for insolvent trading could be proved by a creditor as a debt in the bankruptcy of the director: see e.g. Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v CS &amp; GJ Handby Pty Ltd (1989) 21 FCR 19; Vale v TMH Haulage Pty Ltd (1993) 31 NSWLR 702; CCA Systems Pty Ltd v Communications &amp; Peripherals (Australia) Pty Ltd (1989) 15 ACLR 720 at 728 729. In Handby 21 FCR 19, the Full Court (Morling Beaumont and Burchett JJ) concluded that s 556(1) of the Code rendered the company and the director (in the circumstances prescribed) jointly and severally liable for the debt. Their Honours observed at 24 25 that s 82(1) of the Bankruptcy Act and its precursors have been generously construed, and that there was no reason why it should not encompass debts or liabilities arising under statute. They then concluded at 26 27 that the statutory liability created by s 556(1) of the Code is for "the payment of the debt incurred by the company" (the Full Court's emphasis), and is a liability for a nominated debt which was not a demand in the nature of a demand for unliquidated damages but a claim for money under a statute.

42 The liquidator also relied upon Macks (trustee of the estate of Weber), Re Weber (bankrupt) [2006] FCA 636 ; (2006) 233 ALR 50. I do not think that decision is of particular significance. Relevantly, it concerned the entitlement of creditors under certain contracts to prove in the joint and several estates of the bankrupts by reason of s 95 of the Bankruptcy Act : see per Finn J at [13] [16].

43 At present, I see no reason why the fact that s 588M does not use the words "joint and several" should preclude the Liquidator from proving his debt under s 588M(2) in both the joint and several estates of the directors.

44 In my judgment, there is nothing in s 588M which supports the conclusion that the recovery of a debt under s 588M must be confined to the several estates of the delictual directors, provided at least that the conduct giving rise to their liability is in substance the same.</text>

<text>46 On the limited material before me, the directors' respective liability to the Liquidator is the same debt arising out of the same conduct incurred by them in the same capacity. The rule against double proof discussed by Mandie J in Re Master Painters Association of Victoria Ltd (subject to deed of company arrangement) (2004) 211 ALR 316 at 319 324 at [29] is not shown to have been enlivened. The rule preventing double dividends to the detriment of other creditors can be addressed by the Trustee as discussed below.</text>
