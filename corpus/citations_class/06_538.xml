<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/AATA/2005/758.html</AustLII>
<text>1 The applicant Mr David Patterson claims that his condition of hypertension arose out of, or was attributable to, his eligible war service in Vietnam, within the meaning of s 9(1)(b) of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 (Cth) (the Act). The rejection of his claim by the respondent Repatriation Commission and the Veterans' Review Board was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal: Patterson and Repatriation Commission [2005] AATA 758. Mr Patterson now appeals to this Court.

2 The relevant Statement of Principles (SoP) concerning hypertension for the purposes of s 120A(3) of the Act, No 35 of 2003, provides by cl 4 that at least one of the factors in cl 5 "must be related to any relevant service rendered". The factors in cl 5 include:
 
 "(a) being obese at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension; or 
 
 (b) consuming an average of at least 200 g per week of alcohol which cannot be decreased to less than an average of 200 g per week at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension; or 
 
 (c) ingesting at least 12 g of salt supplements per day on average for a continuous period of at least six months immediately before the clinical onset of hypertension."

3 Mr Patterson served as a gunner in the Australian Army in Vietnam from 4 February until 30 October 1971. His clinical onset of hypertension occurred in 1978.</text>

<tocase>Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 97</tocase>
<text>29 The Tribunal then quoted the four-step process from the judgment of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 97 as follows (emphasis added):
 
 "1. The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. No question of fact finding arises at this stage . If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail. 
 
 2. If the material does raise such a hypothesis, the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s 196B(2) or (11). If no such SoP is in force, the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and, in consequence, the application must fail. 
 
 3. If an SoP is in force, the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one. It will do so if the hypothesis fits, that is to say, is consistent with the 'template' to be found in the SoP. The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist, and be related to the person's service (as required by ss 196B(2)(d) and (e)). If the hypothesis does contain these factors, it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts, nor otherwise fanciful. If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template, it will be deemed not to be 'reasonable' and the claim will fail. 
 
 4. The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s 120(1) whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war-caused, or in the case of a claim for incapacity, that the incapacity did not arise from a war-caused injury. If not so satisfied, the claim must succeed. If the Tribunal is so satisfied, the claim must fail. It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it . In so doing, no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved."

30 The Tribunal found in respect of the first Deledio step that the material "point(ed) to a hypothesis connecting the hypertension to the circumstances of the particular service rendered by (Mr Patterson)". Although not explicitly stated at this stage, it would seem that the Tribunal had in mind the obesity hypothesis.

31 In relation to the second step the Tribunal noted there was no dispute that the SoP concerning hypertension was in force.</text>

<tocase>Deledio v Repatriation Commission (1997) 47 ALD 261 at 275</tocase>
<text>38 The third Deledio step does not require or permit fact finding, an exercise which is confined to the fourth step. Yet it is clear this is what the Tribunal did at [43] and [44]. The reference to Dr English's criticism of "lack of dietary intake data" suggests not only fact finding but the imposition of an onus of proof on Mr Patterson, something excluded by s 120(6). The Tribunal reached a conclusion as to what in fact Mr Patterson's alcohol consumption was rather than enquiring whether his hypothesis was consistent with the SoP. I said at first instance in Deledio v Repatriation Commission (1997) 47 ALD 261 at 275, in a passage approved by the Full Court at 83 FCR 96, 
 
 "...the SoP has no function in relation to the proof or disproof (under s 120(1) of the particular facts of a veteran's case. The SoP's function is limited to prescribing a medical-scientific standard with which a hypothesis must be consistent so that the SoP can 'uphold' the hypothesis... 
 ... 
 The particular claim then has to fit the template laid down in the SoP. The Byrnes [ v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564] methodology is applied. Do the facts raised by the claimant give rise to a reasonable hypothesis? Proof of facts is not in issue at this point. The hypothesis will not be reasonable if it is: 
 
 
 
 (i) contrary to proved or known scientific facts, 
 (ii) obviously fanciful, impossible, incredible, absurd, ridiculous, not tenable, too remote or too tenuous; or 
 (iii) (since 1994) inconsistent with (not upheld by) an applicable SoP. 
 
 
 
 If the hypothesis is reasonable the claim will succeed unless: 
 
 
 
 (iv) one or more facts necessary to support it are disproved beyond reasonable doubt; or 
 (v) the truth of a fact inconsistent with the hypothesis is proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
 
 
 
 At no stage is there an onus of proof on the claimant. If one of the disputed facts happens to be a component of an SoP then the Commission must disprove that fact beyond reasonable doubt, just like any other relevant fact."

39 The Tribunal failed to follow the process mandated by the Act. The Tribunal in the present case has made essentially the same error as the Tribunal in Deledio when it said (quoted in 47 ALD at 272):
 
 "If a particular fact is not found to exist, or is not found to be related to the veteran's service, on the balance of probabilities, then the SoP does not uphold the hypothesis and, according to s 120A(3) of the Act, the hypothesis cannot be reasonable." 
 

At 275 I said:
 
 "... the SoP system does not have the effect that some of the facts relevant to a claim, viz those facts which coincide with factors set out in an SoP, have to be proved by the claimant."

40 Much the same thing happened with the salt hypothesis. The Tribunal made a qualitative assessment of Mr Patterson's evidence and accepted criticism of it as "speculative", "unreliable" and "inaccurate". This is the discourse of fact finding.</text>

<tocase>East v Repatriation Commission (1987) 16 FCR 517</tocase>
<text>41 If the Act, like most statutes conferring pensions and similar benefits, simply required Mr Patterson to establish that his hypertension was due to war service, then the Tribunal's approach would disclose no error of law. However, for the historical and political reasons which underlie repatriation legislation in Australia, as discussed in Deledio and East v Repatriation Commission (1987) 16 FCR 517, the Act mandates a unique decision-making process. The Tribunal failed to apply that process.

42 The Commission filed a notice of contention which in substance argued that the material before the Tribunal was incapable of raising the required reasonable hypothesis connecting Mr Patterson's hypertension with the circumstances of his war service. In an appeal limited to questions of law ( Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth ) s 44(1)) it would not be appropriate to conduct in effect a rehearing of the case before the Tribunal. Mr Patterson was entitled to have his claim considered on its merits by the Tribunal in accordance with the Act.

43 The appeal will be allowed. The determination of the Tribunal made on 9 August 2005 is set aside. Mr Patterson's claim is remitted for consideration by the Tribunal differently constituted. The Commission is to pay Mr Patterson's costs of the appeal, including reserved costs.
 

 I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey .
