<tocase>Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 45 ; (1990) 170 CLR 306</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1990/45.html</AustLII>
<text>93 In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 45 ; (1990) 170 CLR 306 (" Bond "), Mason CJ noted that there was no definition in the ADJR Act of the central term "decision". The Chief Justice (with whom Brennan and Deane JJ agreed) said (at 337):
 
 That answer is that a reviewable "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute. That will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration. A conclusion reached as a step along the way in the course of reasoning leading to an ultimate decision would not ordinarily amount to a reviewable decision, unless the statute provided for the making of a finding or ruling on that point so that the decision, though an intermediate decision, might accurately be described as a decision under an enactment.
 
 Another essential quality of a reviewable decision is that it be a substantive determination.

94 It is clear from what follows in the reasons of the Chief Justice that he used the term "substantive determination" to distinguish such a determination from a procedural determination. The Chief Justice also said that, having regard to the context, the reference in s 3(2)(g) to "doing or refusing to do any other act or thing" should be read as a reference to the exercise or refusal to exercise a substantive power.

95 In Edelsten v Health Insurance Commission (1990) 27 FCR 56, Northrop and Lockhart JJ referred to the reasons of Mason CJ in Bond and said (at 68):
 
 Bond is authority for the principle that generally, for a decision to be reviewable under the Judicial Review Act it must have a quality of finality, not being merely a step taken on the way to the possible making of an ultimate decision; it must have the essential quality of being substantive as distinct from a procedural determination.
 
 The rationale underlying Bond is that Parliament could not have intended the Judicial Review Act to be a vehicle for judicial review of every decision of a decision-maker under a Commonwealth enactment. Some decisions will have a real impact upon a person's rights, privileges or obligations; some will have no such impact, while others are mere stepping stones which may lead ultimately to the making of a decision which does affect the person's position.

108 The relationship between s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) has been the subject of a good deal of debate in the authorities: Bond at 355-358 per Mason CJ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 (" Rajamanikkam "); SGFB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 422 (" SGFB ") at [17]-[21] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Selway JJ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2002) 211 CLR 441 at 458 [35] - [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Rajamanikkam and SGFB dealt with provisions in the then Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which were in similar terms to s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) of the ADJR Act and, in Rajamanikkam , the Justices made it clear that their analysis also applied to the ADJR Act provisions: at 226 [1], 234 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ at 240 [54] per Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 244 [74] and 255 [110] per Kirby J. An important question debated in those authorities is whether the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out if one of the matters in s 5(3) is established, or the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out only if there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision and one of the matters in s 5(3) is established.</text>

<tocase>BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202</tocase>
<text>145 For the purposes of subsection (2), the applicant must establish that the client "knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made [in one of the four specified circumstances]". None of the specified circumstances obtain. Moreover, it is clear that there was disclosure "to another person" (the applicant himself) of the entirety of the evidence, such that no question as to what amounts to "the substance of the evidence" arises. The point turned upon whether the disclosure was made "knowingly and voluntarily". The relationship between mistaken or inadvertent disclosure and voluntary disclosure cannot be expressed definitively. It has been held that disclosure by mistake is not, for that reason alone, involuntary, at least where the disclosure is made in the course of formal discovery: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 406 per Goldberg J. The relevant disclosure in the present case occurred when written submissions were served upon the applicant by the respondents. In fact, in the formal discovery process, that is, when the respondents' list of documents was filed, privilege was claimed over those parts of the memorandum dealing with the legal advice from the AGS. Even if some mistaken disclosures can nonetheless be made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning of subsection (2), I was not satisfied that there was such a disclosure in this case. This is a case "where everything indicates an intention to claim privilege in respect of the document and what has gone wrong is attributable to sheer inadvertence or carelessness": Sovereign at [23] per Austin J; see also BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 208-209 per Sackville J. In Sovereign , Austin J placed weight upon the fact that the solicitor in receipt of the privileged letter mistakenly disclosed must have realised that it was privileged. That is equally true in the present case in light of the respondents' solicitors' letter to the applicant of 7 February 2007 which asserted the privilege. Moreover, the written submissions (to which the unedited copy of the memorandum was attached) referred to the memorandum as "document 49 in the List of Documents", in respect of which privilege was claimed, and claimed to the knowledge of the applicant. This fact militates against the view that the respondents intended to change their position in respect of the privilege and that it was voluntarily waived when the written submissions were served.</text>

<tocase>Bennett v Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/237.html</AustLII>
<text>138 The starting point is the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ("Evidence Act"), the provisions of which, at least insofar as legal professional privilege (or, more accurately, "client legal privilege") is concerned, apply where, as here, evidence is sought to be adduced. The respondents did not address directly the operation of the Evidence Act and I was taken, in argument, to cases where the common law was the applicable law either because of the jurisdiction or because of the pre-trial (discovery and production) context in which the issue of privilege arose ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1; Bennett v Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101; Secretary to the Department of Justice v Osland [2007] VSCA 96 ; GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123). Whatever assistance I may derive from those cases, it is clear that my starting point must be the provisions of the Evidence Act . Equally, the applicant did not articulate precisely the legal basis for his submission that the privilege had been waived, although I understood his submission to be based upon the disclosure to him of the unedited copy of the memorandum by the respondents' solicitors.</text>

<tocase>Buonopane v Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Youth Affairs (1998) 87 FCR 173</tocase>
<text>97 Secondly, counsel for the respondents referred to Buonopane v Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Youth Affairs (1998) 87 FCR 173 and submitted that this case was authority for the proposition that a decision to charge an officer under s 61(2) of the PSA is not subject to the rules of natural justice. The respondents referred to the remarks of Sundberg J (at 184-185):
 
 The scheme established by the subdivision discloses that Parliament has adverted to the procedural fairness required at each stage of the disciplinary process. At the appeal stage there is to be a formal hearing. At the suspension stage the officer is to be given an opportunity to be heard unless particular circumstances exist which make it inappropriate. At the inquiry stage, a formal hearing is not required, but the officer has to be told of the misconduct the subject of the charges and given an opportunity to make a statement in relation to the misconduct. The contrast between this stage (s 62(3) and (4)) and the s 61(2) stage is eloquent. The limited right conferred on the officer under s 61 is to have a copy of the charge furnished to the person specified in subs (3). To import into s 61(2) one of the procedural steps required at the s 62 stage would be to alter the carefully crafted scheme devised by Parliament. This is not a case where Parliament is silent on procedural fairness. It has specified the stages at which fairness is required and the content of that fairness. The intention is manifest that at the earliest stage the officer is not to have the opportunity to make representations as to why charges should not be made against him. ...
 
 I will return to the question whether the Court should supplement the statutory scheme after considering the complaint that the applicant had not been afforded procedural fairness at the inquiry stage.

98 His Honour later concluded that it would not be appropriate to supplement the statutory scheme (at 186).

99 In my respectful opinion, his Honour's conclusions are correct and should be followed.

100 In my opinion, the first decision identified by the applicant was not a decision to which the ADJR Act applied. The third respondent formed an opinion that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer and conveyed that opinion to the first respondent. That is not the making of a decision within s 3(2) or (3) of the ADJR Act . Nor is it a decision as that concept has been explained in the authorities. It is not final or operative and determinative. It is a matter the relevant Secretary or his delegate takes into account in deciding whether to take one or other of the courses of action referred to in s 63B(c) or (d).

101 In my opinion, although the matter is not entirely clear, the second decision identified by the applicant was a decision to which the ADJR Act applied. Suspension has an immediate impact in that an officer is precluded from performing his ordinary duties. Parliament has seen fit to confer an opportunity to be heard, albeit, one capable of being defeated in certain circumstances, before a decision to suspend is made. Furthermore, in the case of an officer who has been charged previously with misconduct, suspension operates to bring the payment of the officer's salary to an end. All these considerations suggest an act in relation to a substantive matter and one which is final or operative and determinative and therefore a decision. It is true that s 63B also applied where an officer is first suspended and later charged (in fact that was the case here) and that in such a case, it is the act of charging that brings the payment of the officer's salary to an end. In that case it might be said that both the act of suspension and charging are decisions or at least the act of charging is a decision. I incline to the view that whatever the sequence of events, as a matter of substance the act of suspension is a decision within the ADJR Act and the act of charging is not. The act of charging involves no final conclusions of fact and an inquiry at which the officer concerned has a right to be heard as defined in s 62(3), must be held without undue delay. However, I do not need to decide the point because even treating both the act of suspension and the act of charging as decisions there is simply no ground upon which to impugn either decision.

102 In order to deal with all the issues canvassed before me I will assume (contrary to my earlier conclusion) that the third respondent's forming of an opinion and the conveying of that opinion to the first respondent was a decision to which the ADJR Act applied.

103 The first ground of challenge to the first decision is that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice in that the applicant was not given notice of the allegations against him, he was not given a reasonable opportunity to respond to them, he was not given an opportunity to be represented at the meeting held on 4 June 1997 and he was not given prior warning that his use of the ATO computer facility was, or may be, inappropriate. It is also alleged that the third respondent should have disqualified himself.

104 In my opinion, the answer to this ground of challenge is that the rules of natural justice did not apply to the first decision. They did apply to the second decision to the extent provided by s 63(1C) of the PSA. In my opinion, Parliament has made clear the extent to which the rules of natural justice apply to the decision to suspend. The first decision is no more than one element or aspect of that decision. For reasons I will give, the challenge to the second decision on the ground of a breach of the rules of natural justice fails. I reject the submission that the third respondent was bound to disqualify himself because of the legal proceedings issued against him.

105 The second ground of challenge to the first decision is that it involved an improper exercise of the power conferred by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made. The particulars of this ground of challenge are that (so it was said by the applicant) the third respondent took into account irrelevant considerations, namely, that the applicant had commenced criminal and civil proceedings against him, that he wished to remove the applicant from his place of employment and that he wished the applicant to have no entitlement to salary payments while conducting legal proceedings against him. This ground of challenge fails. For reasons I have already given, I am not satisfied that the fact that the applicant had commenced criminal and civil proceedings against the third respondent played any part in the opinion formed by the third respondent under s 63B of the PSA. I am not satisfied on the evidence that the third respondent wished to remove the applicant from his place of employment or that he wished the applicant to have no entitlement to salary payments while conducting legal proceedings against him.

106 The third ground of challenge to the first decision is that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision. The particulars of this ground are as follows:
 
 
 A. The evidence relied upon by the third respondent was such that he could not have been reasonably satisfied that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the applicant's use of the ATO computer facilities was at all times consistent with the manner in which the applicant had been performing his duty since he commenced work with the ATO in 1987 and was in accordance with the requirements of his duties. That use was also consistent with the manner in which other officers of the Service working in the ATO performed their duties.

107 The relevant ground is s 5(1)(h) of the ADJR Act and it provides a ground of review that:
 
 
 there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision. 
 
 
 

 Section 5(3) of the ADJR Act provides as follows:
 
 
 The ground specified in paragraph 1(h) shall not be taken to be made out unless: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the person who made the decision was required by law to reach that decision only if a particular matter was established, and there was no evidence or other material (including facts of which he or she was entitled to take notice) from which he or she could reasonably be satisfied that the matter was established; or
 (b) the person who made the decision based the decision on the existence of a particular fact, and that fact did not exist.</text>

<tocase>Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247</tocase>
<text>144 It is unclear on the authorities whether subsections (2) and (4) have exclusive spheres of operation, or whether they overlap to some degree. On one view, subsection (2) applies when the disclosure is made by the client (including the client's solicitor: s 117(1)(b)) and subsection (4) applies when the disclosure is made by some other person. This interpretation has its genesis in Telstra Corp Ltd v Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 41 NSWLR 346 at 350-351 per McClelland CJ in Eq and was described by the Full Court of this Court as "cogent and persuasive": Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247 at 261 per Higgins, Lehane and Weinberg JJ. Carnell v Mann was overruled by the High Court (on a different point) ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1) so the Full Court's decision is not binding on me, although it is a persuasive authority (see also J D Heydon Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) [25300] 838-839). An alternative view is that the subsections operate together, the relevant distinction between the two being knowing and voluntary disclosure (subsection (2)) as opposed to express or implied consent to the disclosure (subsection (4)): see S Odgers Uniform Evidence Law (6 th ed, 2004) [1.3.11100] 474-475. In Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 , Austin J expressly doubted the interpretation according each subsection an exclusive sphere of operation, but left open the question because his Honour had not had the benefit of argument on the point. I am in a similar position in the present case. Given the doubt attending the question, it would not be appropriate to attempt to resolve the conflicting views without the benefit of full argument where the resolution is unnecessary to the decision. In my opinion, the applicant was unable to establish waiver under either subsection and I was content to proceed on the assumption, without deciding the point, that the applicant may rely prima facie on either subsection.</text>

<tocase>Dunstan v Farr (1999) 60 ALD 192</tocase>
<text>4 The applicant's dispute with the ATO, its officers and others has a long history. A good deal of the history is summarised in other judgments of this Court and I refer in particular to Dunstan v Farr (1999) 60 ALD 192; Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885.

96 These are the general principles to which I was referred. Counsel for the respondents also referred to two authorities which discussed the provisions in the PSA which provisions I must consider. First, he referred to an earlier case involving the applicant, Dunstan v Farr (1999) 60 ALD 192, and a decision said to have been made on 7 July 1999 and submitted that it was authority for the proposition that a decision to suspend an officer under s 63B of the PSA was not a decision to which the ADJR Act applied. He referred to the reasons of Weinberg J and particularly what his Honour said at 199 [41]. It is true that a decision in issue in that case was a decision to suspend from duty and an invitation to make submissions as to a hardship payment. However, the focus of the case was the hardship payment of salary and the decision to suspend from duty does not appear so far as I can tell from the report to have been an issue. Weinberg J did not elaborate on his conclusion that the decision "plainly" lacked the characteristics of a decision which may be the subject of a review under the ADJR Act . In the circumstances, I would not treat the decision as authority for the proposition that a decision to suspend from duty under s 63B of the PSA is not a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act .</text>

144 It is unclear on the authorities whether subsections (2) and (4) have exclusive spheres of operation, or whether they overlap to some degree. On one view, subsection (2) applies when the disclosure is made by the client (including the client's solicitor: s 117(1)(b)) and subsection (4) applies when the disclosure is made by some other person. This interpretation has its genesis in Telstra Corp Ltd v Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 41 NSWLR 346 at 350-351 per McClelland CJ in Eq and was described by the Full Court of this Court as "cogent and persuasive": Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247 at 261 per Higgins, Lehane and Weinberg JJ.

In Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 , Austin J expressly doubted the interpretation according each subsection an exclusive sphere of operation, but left open the question because his Honour had not had the benefit of argument on the point. I am in a similar position in the present case. Given the doubt attending the question, it would not be appropriate to attempt to resolve the conflicting views without the benefit of full argument where the resolution is unnecessary to the decision. In my opinion, the applicant was unable to establish waiver under either subsection and I was content to proceed on the assumption, without deciding the point, that the applicant may rely prima facie on either subsection.

147 Waiver of privilege at common law, which is brought about by "the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality" ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) is described as an "imputed waiver" because it does not depend upon the subjective intentions of the client. Subsection (4) is not satisfied by imputed consent of this species: Sovereign at [28] per Austin J. It is not necessary for the purpose of subsection (4) to consider the common law test and I conclude that subsection (4) is not made out. The common law test is, however, relevant to a consideration of subsection (1) to which I now turn.</text>

<tocase>Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391</tocase>
<text>143 Since the applicant based his submission that privilege had been waived upon the disclosure of an unedited copy of the memorandum, it is convenient to begin with subsections (2) and (4), which deal expressly with disclosure. It will be necessary subsequently to consider what, if any, application subsection (1) may have to the present case. Before turning to those operative provisions, however, I observe that the exceptions to the operation of those provisions provided in subsections (3) and (5) were not enlivened by the facts of this case. Subsection (3) relieves the effect of subsection (2) where the disclosure is made by an agent, unless the agent was authorised to make the disclosure. The disclosure in the present case was made by the respondents' solicitors, who are agents of the client. There was no suggestion that the disclosure was unauthorised, but in any event I am satisfied that the waiver of a client's privilege over documents lies within the ostensible authority of the client's solicitor and that ostensible authority is sufficient for the purposes of the proviso in subsection (3). That view is supported in the authorities: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 403 per Goldberg J; Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 (" Sovereign ") at [24] per Austin J. Therefore, subsection (3) does not operate in this case. Subsection (5), which deals with disclosures between persons with common legal representation or a common interest in a proceeding, is plainly inapplicable.

145 For the purposes of subsection (2), the applicant must establish that the client "knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made [in one of the four specified circumstances]". None of the specified circumstances obtain. Moreover, it is clear that there was disclosure "to another person" (the applicant himself) of the entirety of the evidence, such that no question as to what amounts to "the substance of the evidence" arises. The point turned upon whether the disclosure was made "knowingly and voluntarily". The relationship between mistaken or inadvertent disclosure and voluntary disclosure cannot be expressed definitively. It has been held that disclosure by mistake is not, for that reason alone, involuntary, at least where the disclosure is made in the course of formal discovery: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 406 per Goldberg J. The relevant disclosure in the present case occurred when written submissions were served upon the applicant by the respondents. In fact, in the formal discovery process, that is, when the respondents' list of documents was filed, privilege was claimed over those parts of the memorandum dealing with the legal advice from the AGS. Even if some mistaken disclosures can nonetheless be made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning of subsection (2), I was not satisfied that there was such a disclosure in this case. This is a case "where everything indicates an intention to claim privilege in respect of the document and what has gone wrong is attributable to sheer inadvertence or carelessness": Sovereign at [23] per Austin J; see also BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 208-209 per Sackville J. In Sovereign , Austin J placed weight upon the fact that the solicitor in receipt of the privileged letter mistakenly disclosed must have realised that it was privileged. That is equally true in the present case in light of the respondents' solicitors' letter to the applicant of 7 February 2007 which asserted the privilege. Moreover, the written submissions (to which the unedited copy of the memorandum was attached) referred to the memorandum as "document 49 in the List of Documents", in respect of which privilege was claimed, and claimed to the knowledge of the applicant. This fact militates against the view that the respondents intended to change their position in respect of the privilege and that it was voluntarily waived when the written submissions were served.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1986/40.html</AustLII>
<text>129 Particular A of the third and fourth grounds of challenge is that the second respondent failed to take into account four matters. First, it is alleged he failed to take into account "the full requirements of the applicant's duties". It was certainly relevant for the second respondent to take into account the nature of the applicant's duties and, in my opinion, he clearly did that. The applicant did not identify the duties he alleges he was required to carry out which were not taken into account by the second respondent and even if the applicant went beyond his duties the evidence went nowhere near establishing that this would explain all of the system violations. Secondly, it is alleged that the second respondent failed to take into account the fact that the applicant reported to the ATO's Director of Computer Security that a serious weakness existed in the security of ATO taxpayer data. I refer to my findings in [62] above. I do not think it is a relevant consideration or, if it is, in my opinion it is "so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision": Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 46 per Mason J (as he then was). Furthermore, the second respondent said in his reasons that he could not make a finding as to the applicant's motive. Thirdly, it is alleged that the second respondent failed to take into account the fact that at no time did the applicant breach ATO security. The second respondent took into account the fact that the system violations were attempted breaches of security. Having regard to the decision he was required to make, he was not required to go any further. Fourthly, it is alleged that the second respondent failed to take into account that the applicant's use of the ATO computer facilities during the period December 1996 to April 1997 was not qualitatively different from the use made of those computer facilities by other ATO officers during that period. As I said earlier, the asserted fact was not established and, indeed, the contrary was established.

130 Particulars B, C and D can be dealt with together. Particular B is an allegation that the second respondent improperly took into account the assertion that taxpayer data could have been improperly accessed if the applicant succeeded in accessing the computer facilities when the computer facilities accessed did not contain any taxpayer data. This seems to me to contain two allegations: first, that there was an error of fact and the computer facilities to which access was attempted did not contain taxpayer data and, secondly, assuming that fact it would be irrelevant. Particular C is an allegation that the second respondent improperly took into account that "with further work" the applicant could have gained the ability to gain access to production taxpayer data, sensitive ATO staff record data and access to computer systems which would put at risk the ability of ATO core business systems to continue to function. Particular D is an allegation that the second respondent improperly took into account the assertion that the applicant was seeking to access production taxpayer data or sensitive ATO staff record data without verifying the assertion. I have already referred to the second respondent's reasons (at [56] above). There was ample evidence in support of the second respondent's conclusions and they were proper matters for him to take into account.

131 Particular E is an allegation that the second respondent improperly took into account the assertion that the applicant had comprehensively responded to the allegations put to the applicant by the third respondent and the assertion that the applicant did not wish to discuss the matter with him when the applicant had in fact requested that a meeting be arranged. As I read the second respondent's reasons he did not take this into account as a consideration and it is no more than a statement of what had happened. Insofar as it is an allegation of a breach of the rules of natural justice, I reject it for the reasons previously given.</text>

<text>108 The relationship between s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) has been the subject of a good deal of debate in the authorities: Bond at 355-358 per Mason CJ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 (" Rajamanikkam "); SGFB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 422 (" SGFB ") at [17]-[21] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Selway JJ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2002) 211 CLR 441 at 458 [35] - [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Rajamanikkam and SGFB dealt with provisions in the then Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which were in similar terms to s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) of the ADJR Act and, in Rajamanikkam , the Justices made it clear that their analysis also applied to the ADJR Act provisions: at 226 [1], 234 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ at 240 [54] per Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 244 [74] and 255 [110] per Kirby J. An important question debated in those authorities is whether the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out if one of the matters in s 5(3) is established, or the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out only if there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision and one of the matters in s 5(3) is established.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//vic/VSCA/2007/96.html</AustLII>
<text>138 The starting point is the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ("Evidence Act"), the provisions of which, at least insofar as legal professional privilege (or, more accurately, "client legal privilege") is concerned, apply where, as here, evidence is sought to be adduced. The respondents did not address directly the operation of the Evidence Act and I was taken, in argument, to cases where the common law was the applicable law either because of the jurisdiction or because of the pre-trial (discovery and production) context in which the issue of privilege arose ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1; Bennett v Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101; Secretary to the Department of Justice v Osland [2007] VSCA 96 ; GT Corporation Pty Ltd v Amare Safety Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 123). Whatever assistance I may derive from those cases, it is clear that my starting point must be the provisions of the Evidence Act . Equally, the applicant did not articulate precisely the legal basis for his submission that the privilege had been waived, although I understood his submission to be based upon the disclosure to him of the unedited copy of the memorandum by the respondents' solicitors.</text>

<text>108 The relationship between s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) has been the subject of a good deal of debate in the authorities: Bond at 355-358 per Mason CJ; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 (" Rajamanikkam "); SGFB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 422 (" SGFB ") at [17]-[21] per von Doussa, O'Loughlin and Selway JJ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex Parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2002) 211 CLR 441 at 458 [35] - [36] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Rajamanikkam and SGFB dealt with provisions in the then Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which were in similar terms to s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3) of the ADJR Act and, in Rajamanikkam , the Justices made it clear that their analysis also applied to the ADJR Act provisions: at 226 [1], 234 [32]-[34] per Gleeson CJ at 240 [54] per Gaudron and McHugh JJ and at 244 [74] and 255 [110] per Kirby J. An important question debated in those authorities is whether the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out if one of the matters in s 5(3) is established, or the ground in s 5(1)(h) is made out only if there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision and one of the matters in s 5(3) is established.

109 Sitting as a single Judge of the Court, I think the issue I have identified has, as far as the relationship between s 5(1)(h) and s 5(3)(b) is concerned, been resolved by the Full Court of this Court in SGFB . A party seeking to make out the ground in s 5(1)(h) by establishing that the decision-maker based his decision on the existence of a particular fact and that fact did not exist must also establish that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision.

110 The allegations in this case suggest that the applicant seeks to make out the ground in s 5(1)(h) by reference to s 5(3)(a). The question whether he does so only if he establishes the matter in s 5(3)(a) and that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision or whether he does so simply by establishing the matter in s 5(3)(a) has not been authoritatively determined. I did not have the benefit of submissions on the point and, indeed, the applicant was not legally represented. I do not need to resolve the difficult question raised because even on the assumption most favourable to the applicant, that is to say, that all he need do is establish the matter in s 5(3)(a) , the ground in s 5(1)(h) is not made out.

111 One of the matters which must be satisfied in order to make out the ground in s 5(3)(a) is that the particular matter was one the decision-maker was required by law to find established before reaching the decision in question. In considering that matter, it may be noted that there is some artificiality in the assumption upon which I am proceeding, namely, that the act of the third respondent in forming the opinion that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer and informing the first respondent of that opinion is a decision to which the ADJR Act applies. However, proceeding on that assumption, it might be said that the particular matter the third respondent was required by law to find established before reaching his decision was that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer. If that is so, it cannot be said that there was no evidence or other material from which the third respondent could reasonably be satisfied of that matter. There was ample evidence upon which the third respondent could form the opinion that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer.

112 The alternative is that the applicant contends that the particulars are "particular matters" within s 5(3). The particulars are expressed in positive terms and I think to make sense of the allegation it is necessary to construe the particulars as in effect allegations that there was no evidence or other material from which the third respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the applicant's use of the ATO computer facilities was inconsistent with the manner in which he had been performing his duties since he commenced work with the ATO and not in accordance with the requirements of his duties and inconsistent with the manner in which other officers of the Service working in the ATO performed their duties. The immediate difficulty with this submission is that these are not particular matters required by law to be established before the third respondent formed his opinion and conveyed that opinion to the first respondent. Alternatively, for reasons I have already given, it cannot be said that there is no evidence or other material from which the third respondent could reasonably be satisfied that these matters were established. There was ample evidence that the applicant's computer usage was outside the scope of his duties and inconsistent with computer usage by other employees within the ATO.

113 The applicant has failed to establish the matters in s 5(3)(a).

114 Because the applicant was unrepresented, I have considered whether he might have been able to bring his particulars within s 5(3)(b). I have concluded that he could not. The applicant has failed to show the non-existence of any fact relied upon by the third respondent, let alone any "particular fact". Moreover, there was evidence justifying the decision of the third respondent and, as I have already said, showing that there was no evidence is an additional hurdle to review under s 5(1)(h): SGFB .

115 The first ground of challenge to the second decision is that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice. Putting to one side the allegation in relation to the first decision that the third respondent should have disqualified himself, the particulars of breach are in similar terms to the particulars of breach given in relation to the first decision. The first respondent considered whether the applicant should be given notice of the matters of concern before the meeting on 4 June 1997 and decided that because of security concerns he should not be given such notice. On the evidence before me that was a conclusion which was reasonably open to her. The applicant was given notice of the matters of concern at the meeting on 4 June 1997 and to that extent he was given the opportunity to respond. If an opportunity to be heard within s 63B(1C) is satisfied by the notice he was given at the meeting, then the obligation in the subsection was satisfied. To the extent that it was not satisfied by that action, the subsection was nevertheless satisfied because in that event the case fell within s 63B(1C)(b).

116 The second ground of challenge in relation to the second decision is that s 63B(1C) (incorrectly referred to in the statement of claim as s 63B(1A)) was not complied with. This ground of challenge fails for the reasons given in relation to the first ground of challenge.</text>

<tocase>Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/521.html</AustLII>
<text>143 Since the applicant based his submission that privilege had been waived upon the disclosure of an unedited copy of the memorandum, it is convenient to begin with subsections (2) and (4), which deal expressly with disclosure. It will be necessary subsequently to consider what, if any, application subsection (1) may have to the present case. Before turning to those operative provisions, however, I observe that the exceptions to the operation of those provisions provided in subsections (3) and (5) were not enlivened by the facts of this case. Subsection (3) relieves the effect of subsection (2) where the disclosure is made by an agent, unless the agent was authorised to make the disclosure. The disclosure in the present case was made by the respondents' solicitors, who are agents of the client. There was no suggestion that the disclosure was unauthorised, but in any event I am satisfied that the waiver of a client's privilege over documents lies within the ostensible authority of the client's solicitor and that ostensible authority is sufficient for the purposes of the proviso in subsection (3). That view is supported in the authorities: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 403 per Goldberg J; Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 (" Sovereign ") at [24] per Austin J. Therefore, subsection (3) does not operate in this case. Subsection (5), which deals with disclosures between persons with common legal representation or a common interest in a proceeding, is plainly inapplicable.

144 It is unclear on the authorities whether subsections (2) and (4) have exclusive spheres of operation, or whether they overlap to some degree. On one view, subsection (2) applies when the disclosure is made by the client (including the client's solicitor: s 117(1)(b)) and subsection (4) applies when the disclosure is made by some other person. This interpretation has its genesis in Telstra Corp Ltd v Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 41 NSWLR 346 at 350-351 per McClelland CJ in Eq and was described by the Full Court of this Court as "cogent and persuasive": Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247 at 261 per Higgins, Lehane and Weinberg JJ. Carnell v Mann was overruled by the High Court (on a different point) ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1) so the Full Court's decision is not binding on me, although it is a persuasive authority (see also J D Heydon Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) [25300] 838-839). An alternative view is that the subsections operate together, the relevant distinction between the two being knowing and voluntary disclosure (subsection (2)) as opposed to express or implied consent to the disclosure (subsection (4)): see S Odgers Uniform Evidence Law (6 th ed, 2004) [1.3.11100] 474-475. In Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 , Austin J expressly doubted the interpretation according each subsection an exclusive sphere of operation, but left open the question because his Honour had not had the benefit of argument on the point. I am in a similar position in the present case. Given the doubt attending the question, it would not be appropriate to attempt to resolve the conflicting views without the benefit of full argument where the resolution is unnecessary to the decision. In my opinion, the applicant was unable to establish waiver under either subsection and I was content to proceed on the assumption, without deciding the point, that the applicant may rely prima facie on either subsection.

145 For the purposes of subsection (2), the applicant must establish that the client "knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made [in one of the four specified circumstances]". None of the specified circumstances obtain. Moreover, it is clear that there was disclosure "to another person" (the applicant himself) of the entirety of the evidence, such that no question as to what amounts to "the substance of the evidence" arises. The point turned upon whether the disclosure was made "knowingly and voluntarily". The relationship between mistaken or inadvertent disclosure and voluntary disclosure cannot be expressed definitively. It has been held that disclosure by mistake is not, for that reason alone, involuntary, at least where the disclosure is made in the course of formal discovery: Meltend Pty Ltd v Restoration Clinics of Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 145 ALR 391 at 406 per Goldberg J. The relevant disclosure in the present case occurred when written submissions were served upon the applicant by the respondents. In fact, in the formal discovery process, that is, when the respondents' list of documents was filed, privilege was claimed over those parts of the memorandum dealing with the legal advice from the AGS. Even if some mistaken disclosures can nonetheless be made knowingly and voluntarily within the meaning of subsection (2), I was not satisfied that there was such a disclosure in this case. This is a case "where everything indicates an intention to claim privilege in respect of the document and what has gone wrong is attributable to sheer inadvertence or carelessness": Sovereign at [23] per Austin J; see also BT Australasia Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 8) (1998) 154 ALR 202 at 208-209 per Sackville J. In Sovereign , Austin J placed weight upon the fact that the solicitor in receipt of the privileged letter mistakenly disclosed must have realised that it was privileged. That is equally true in the present case in light of the respondents' solicitors' letter to the applicant of 7 February 2007 which asserted the privilege. Moreover, the written submissions (to which the unedited copy of the memorandum was attached) referred to the memorandum as "document 49 in the List of Documents", in respect of which privilege was claimed, and claimed to the knowledge of the applicant. This fact militates against the view that the respondents intended to change their position in respect of the privilege and that it was voluntarily waived when the written submissions were served.

146 For the purposes of subsection (4), the applicant must establish that the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client to another person (with two exceptions, neither presently relevant). Again, no issue regarding "the substance of the evidence" arises and the point turned upon whether there was express or implied consent. Where, as is the case here, the disclosure was made by the client (within the statutory definition, which encompasses agents and hence solicitors: s 117) and not by a third party, it follows from my finding that the disclosure was not voluntary, that the disclosure was not made with express or implied consent. The factors relevant to a determination of whether the solicitors (who, it is to be recalled, had ostensible authority to waive the privilege) consented to the disclosure include the conduct and intentions of the solicitors: Sovereign at [27] per Austin J. As I have said, I accept, based on the evidence before me, that the disclosure was entirely inadvertent and, in such circumstances, it cannot be said that the disclosure was consensual, expressly or impliedly.

147 Waiver of privilege at common law, which is brought about by "the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality" ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) is described as an "imputed waiver" because it does not depend upon the subjective intentions of the client. Subsection (4) is not satisfied by imputed consent of this species: Sovereign at [28] per Austin J. It is not necessary for the purpose of subsection (4) to consider the common law test and I conclude that subsection (4) is not made out. The common law test is, however, relevant to a consideration of subsection (1) to which I now turn.</text>

<tocase>Talbot v NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 602</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2000/602.html</AustLII>
<text>141 Section 121 provides three ways in which client legal privilege does not prevent the adducing of evidence. Clearly, neither subsection (1) (which applies where the client or party has died) nor subsection (2) (which applies where the court would be prevented from enforcing an order of an Australian court were the evidence not adduced) apply. Subsection (3) provides:
 
 
 (3) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a communication or document that affects a right of a person.
 
 

The subsection has been interpreted narrowly and requires that the communication affect a right directly, and not merely be relevant to a right or be evidence of a right otherwise created or affected. In Talbot v NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 602 , Hodgson CJ in Eq observed (at [3]):
 
 [the words] cannot mean a communication or document that is relevant to a right of a person because that would virtually eliminate the legal professional privilege as a ground for non-admission of evidence. In my opinion, that must mean a communication or document that affects in some fairly direct way what are the actual rights and perhaps also duties of a person.
 

I respectfully agree and in my opinion it was clear that the subsection had no application to the present case.

142 Section 122 , which deals with loss of client legal privilege by consent, required close examination on the facts of the present case. The section provides:
 
 122 Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters 
 
 
 
 (1) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the consent of the client or party concerned.
 
 (2) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if a client or party has knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) in the course of making a confidential communication or preparing a confidential document; or
 (b) as a result of duress or deception; or 
 
 
 
 
 (c) under compulsion of law; or 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding office under, an Australian law to the Minister, or the Minister of the State or Territory, administering the law, or the part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to a disclosure by a person who was, at the time, an employee or agent of a client or party or of a lawyer unless the employee or agent was authorised to make the disclosure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (4) Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client or party to another person other than:
 (a) a lawyer acting for the client or party; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding office under, an Australian law to the Minister, or the Minister of the State or Territory, administering the law, or the part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held. 
 
 
 
 
 (5) Subsections (2) and (4) do not apply to: 
 
 
 
 (a) a disclosure by a client to another person if the disclosure concerns a matter in relation to which the same lawyer is providing, or is to provide, professional legal services to both the client and the other person; or
 (b) a disclosure to a person with whom the client or party had, at the time of disclosure, a common interest relating to a proceeding or an anticipated or pending proceeding in an Australian court or a foreign court. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (6) This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a document that a witness has used to try to revive the witness's memory about a fact or opinion or has used as mentioned in section 32 (attempts to revive memory in court) or 33 (evidence given by police officers).</text>

<tocase>Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 152</tocase>
<text>148 Subsection (1) provides for the loss of client legal privilege where the evidence adduced is "given with the consent of the client or party concerned". The Full Court of this Court has held that consent in this context is not limited to express consent but reaches cases where the client is deemed to have consented to the disclosure of otherwise privileged material: Telstra Corporation Ltd v BT Australasia Pty Ltd (1998) 85 FCR 152 at 168 per Branson and Lehane JJ. But this decision was limited to cases where the waiver is based upon conduct other than disclosure. Their Honours said (at 168): 
 
 Of course, as [ Adelaide Steamship Pty Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360] demonstrates, the position may be different where the conduct relied upon is some disclosure of legal advice, but that need not be further considered here.
 

As a matter of statutory construction, because subsections (2) and (4) deal specifically with waiver by disclosure, it is unlikely that the legislature intended subsection (1) to provide some wider basis for finding there to have been waiver by disclosure. In my view, subsection (1) applies where consent is given to the adducing of evidence in court (rather than disclosure out of court) or where a client engages in conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege, such as where the substance of legal advice received is relied upon in order to raise an issue in the proceeding. Insofar as the applicant's submission on the waiver of privilege relies upon the inadvertent disclosure of the memorandum in the respondents' written submissions, subsection (1) is of no assistance.

149 Subsection (1), in the applicable sense described above, may have been raised by the applicant in another way and I considered whether privilege may have been waived by some reason other than the disclosure. In particular, in the letter from the AGS dated 28 July 1998 to the applicant the second respondent's reasons are set out and it is said that the second respondent "also took into account the advice". I considered whether the maintenance of legal professional privilege was inconsistent with that assertion and, as such, whether consent to the adducing of the evidence could be imputed and the privilege lost by operation of subsection (1). I was not prepared to conclude that the assertion and maintenance of the privilege were inconsistent because there was nothing before me to indicate that the legal advice said to have been taken into account by the second respondent was the legal advice received from the AGS.

150 It remains only briefly to observe that the common law relating to legal professional privilege, and its reliance to some extent upon notions of fairness, may be relevant to my discretion to exclude evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act . But this would arise only if I had concluded that privilege was lost under s 122 and the respondent made an application to exclude the evidence for reasons of fairness, notwithstanding its unprivileged status.</text>

<text>144 It is unclear on the authorities whether subsections (2) and (4) have exclusive spheres of operation, or whether they overlap to some degree. On one view, subsection (2) applies when the disclosure is made by the client (including the client's solicitor: s 117(1)(b)) and subsection (4) applies when the disclosure is made by some other person. This interpretation has its genesis in Telstra Corp Ltd v Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 41 NSWLR 346 at 350-351 per McClelland CJ in Eq and was described by the Full Court of this Court as "cogent and persuasive": Carnell v Mann (1998) 89 FCR 247 at 261 per Higgins, Lehane and Weinberg JJ. Carnell v Mann was overruled by the High Court (on a different point) ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1) so the Full Court's decision is not binding on me, although it is a persuasive authority (see also J D Heydon Cross on Evidence (7 th Australian ed, 2004) [25300] 838-839). An alternative view is that the subsections operate together, the relevant distinction between the two being knowing and voluntary disclosure (subsection (2)) as opposed to express or implied consent to the disclosure (subsection (4)): see S Odgers Uniform Evidence Law (6 th ed, 2004) [1.3.11100] 474-475. In Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta [2000] NSWSC 521 , Austin J expressly doubted the interpretation according each subsection an exclusive sphere of operation, but left open the question because his Honour had not had the benefit of argument on the point. I am in a similar position in the present case. Given the doubt attending the question, it would not be appropriate to attempt to resolve the conflicting views without the benefit of full argument where the resolution is unnecessary to the decision. In my opinion, the applicant was unable to establish waiver under either subsection and I was content to proceed on the assumption, without deciding the point, that the applicant may rely prima facie on either subsection.</text>

<text>14 In considering the application for leave to amend, I had regard to the well-known principles referred to in the decision of the High Court in The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146.

15 The applicant sought to put forward new and quite different claims at a very late stage of the trial. It was clear, at least from the respondents' point of view, that it was likely that if the amendments were allowed, witnesses would have to be recalled and new witnesses may need to have been called. If the amendments were allowed, the trial would have had to be adjourned and it was likely that another pre-trial set of procedural orders would need to have been made. The applicant asserted, but did not establish to my satisfaction, that his application to amend had come forward only because of late discovery or disclosure of material by the respondents. He certainly did not establish that the application to amend could not have been made well before the commencement of the trial. In the circumstances, I did not think that it was appropriate to allow the amendments and I refused leave to amend. In those circumstances I did not need to consider some of the other grounds advanced (but not developed) by the respondents in opposing the application for leave to amend. Those grounds included an assertion that the proposed new causes of action were out of time and statute-barred and that some of the proposed new claims were unarguable as a matter of law.

16 The applicant gave evidence. The bulk of his evidence-in-chief was given by way of affidavit and he was cross-examined by counsel for the respondents. He was in 1997 and remains obsessed by what he perceives to be the injustice involved in the way in which he was treated by the ATO, officers of the ATO and others. He tended to focus on matters which were not directly relevant to the issues in the proceeding. He is convinced that there was a conspiracy against him led by the third respondent. A good deal of his evidence was irrelevant to the issues raised in this proceeding and other "evidence" in his affidavits was in reality submissions about why I should find that the third respondent was motivated by improper considerations. I approach the applicant's evidence with considerable caution and I accept the evidence of the respondents where there is a conflict. For reasons I will give, I reject the applicant's evidence that he was given an access privilege to the ATO computer system in May 1997. Further, some of the evidence he gave directed to establishing possible innocent explanations for certain system violations was confusing, but even if accepted, did not rise anywhere near a level sufficient to establish an error of the type identified in s 5 of the ADJR Act .</text>
