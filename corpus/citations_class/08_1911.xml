<tocase>Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854</tocase>
<text>62 Whether a question of law is raised by an appeal from the Tribunal is itself a question of law. The leading authority is the judgment of Mason J, with whom Gibbs, Stephen and Aickin JJ agreed, in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7. His Honour there stated the rule in these terms:
 the question whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law. 
However, Mason J went on to qualify that statement by pointing out that when a statute uses words according to their "common understanding", and the question is whether the facts as found fall within such words, the question is one of fact. The example his Honour cited was the decision of the House of Lords in Brutus v Cozens [1972] UKHL 6 ; [1973] AC 854 where the question raised by the applicable statute was whether the appellant's behaviour was "insulting". As it was not unreasonable to hold that the behaviour was insulting the question was one of fact.</text>

<tocase>Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/27.html</AustLII>
<text>63 The principle was applied in the context of s 44(1) by Branson J, with whom Spender and Nicholson JJ agreed, in Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522. The issue was whether an employee had suffered an "injury" within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Her Honour at [26], having pointed out that it was not suggested that the word "injury" was used in other than its ordinary or common meaning, concluded that the question was one of fact. In the present case it was accepted that the term "mental injury" was used in the same way.

64 Branson J went on to point out that a finding of the Tribunal that a particular condition of an employee's body was not an "injury" may be unlawful, and therefore subject to judicial review, because of a failure by the Tribunal to comply with the law, as for example by failing to take into account a relevant consideration: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Limited [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 at 39; Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), s 5.

65 But such a situation does not mean, or at any rate necessarily mean, that an appeal under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act from such a decision of the Tribunal is " on a question of law" so as to satisfy the requirement of s 44(1). In such a case there is no question of law. The law is clear. The Tribunal must take relevant considerations into account.

66 Returning to the present case, the alleged questions in Mr Farnaby's amended notice of appeal do not show that the appeal is on questions of law. There is no doubt that, as a matter of law, the relevant time for assessing whether Mr Farnaby suffered "mental injury" was as at the lodging of his claim and that it is sufficient that his employment in the Navy was a cause of his injury (if any) even if it was not the only cause. The Tribunal's decision did not suggest the law was otherwise.

67 Strictly speaking these jurisdictional points should have been resolved at the outset of these reasons, with the result that the appeal would be dismissed without further consideration of its merits. However, given the Tribunal's factual findings, there can be no doubt that Mr Farnaby as a vulnerable young lad was badly treated by the Navy. It seemed only fair to him to affirm that, in the light of the arguments before me, the Tribunal's further finding that he did not suffer mental injury as a result, was a proper one made after a careful review of the evidence.

68 The appeal will be dismissed with costs, including reserved costs.
 I certify that the preceding sixty-eight (68) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey.

<tocase>Farnaby and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2008] AATA 603</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/aat/2008/603.html</AustLII>
<text>2 On 24 January 2002 Mr Farnaby made a claim for compensation under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth). He alleged that while at HMAS Leeuwin he suffered physical and sexual abuse which resulted in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). His claim was disallowed. That decision was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by the Hon R J Groom (Deputy President) and Dr J Campbell (Member): Farnaby and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2008] AATA 603. Mr Farnaby now appeals to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).

3 The transitional provisions of the 1988 Act required Mr Farnaby to show that, within the meaning of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act 1930 (Cth), he had suffered a "personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of his employment": s 9(1). "Injury" means "any physical or mental injury" (s 4(1)) or "disease ... due to the nature of (his) employment" (s 10(1)).

4 For the purposes of this appeal we are only concerned with Mr Farnaby's claim based on "mental injury". PTSD is a mental injury.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/85.html</AustLII>
<text>57 There is no doubt that in most areas of the law, where rights or liabilities depend on something having been caused by a particular event or circumstance, it is sufficient if the latter is a cause of the former, notwithstanding that there may be other, perhaps more important, causes. The case cited by Mr Read, Shorey v PT Limited [2003] HCA 27 ; (2003) 197 ALR 410 , a common law negligence case, is one example of this. Other examples are I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 (damages under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)) and Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 85 ; (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 236 (fraudulent misrepresentation). It may safely be assumed that the same rule would apply to compensation claims under the 1930 Act.</text>

<tocase>Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1996/6.html</AustLII>
<text>49 The arguments must be considered in the light of a long line of cases, endorsed by the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 271-272, which make it clear that the reasons of an administrative decision-maker such as the Tribunal in the present case are
 meant to inform and not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed.

50 Mr Read argued, with particular reference to the passage in the Tribunal's reasons at [175] commencing "any continuing symptoms...", that the Tribunal only considered Mr Farnaby's symptoms at the time of the hearing and failed to consider his symptoms, and whether or not those symptoms indicated he suffered the mental injury PTSD, as at the time of his claim in January 2002.

51 The Tribunal plainly adverted to the fact that Mr Farnaby lodged his claim on or about 24 January 2002; see reasons at [25]. There is no ground for thinking that thereafter the Tribunal somehow overlooked or forgot that fact. The circumstances in which Mr Farnaby came to lodge his claim assumed some importance in the narrative of events. Shortly before the lodgement he meets Ms Nalder by chance and it is then that he "first gained knowledge that he may be suffering an injury or disease as a result of his employment": at [24]. This also prompts his first medical consultation about the matter, with Dr Welch.</text>
