<text>The Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine native title applications is specifically provided for by the Act in s 81. This jurisdiction expressly includes the power to make orders by consent pursuant to s 87A. These statutory provisions make it clear that the Court's jurisdiction is enlivened. It should, however, be noted that the agreement in this case relates to part of the land and waters the subject of the Ngurrara application. The making of a determination of native title in respect of part of an application is a matter that falls within both s 87(3) and s 87A of the Act. It follows that the Court may make orders determining that native title exists in relation to Determination Area A while leaving the issues outstanding in relation to Determination Area B for resolution at a later date (Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v State of Queensland [2001] FCA 1229 ; (2001) 115 FCR 109 at [6] ). This approach has been taken in a number of cases in Western Australia under s 87 (Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 660 ; (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; Nangkiriny v Western Australia [2004] FCA 1156 ; James on behalf of the Martu People v State of Western Australia [2002] FCA 1208 ; Hughes (on behalf of the Eastern Guruma People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 365) and under alternatively s 87 and s 87A ( Brown (on behalf of the Ngarla People) v State of Western Australia [2007] FCA 1025).

It therefore remains only to consider whether it would be "appropriate" to make the orders sought. The discretion conferred by s 87A is in substance the same as that which applies in the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 87 and must, of course, be exercised judicially and within the broad boundaries ascertained by reference to the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act (see Brown at [22]). The matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion, and the weight to be given to those matters, may vary according to the particular circumstances of each case.

Justice North observed in Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848 at [6] [9] that the Act is designed to encourage parties to take responsibility for the resolution of native title proceedings, without the need for litigation. The Court's power must be exercised flexibly and with this purpose in mind. Orders may be made where the Court is not provided with all of the evidence or the primary facts substantiating native title where the Court is satisfied that the parties have freely and on an informed basis come to an agreement ( Brown at [23] in respect of s 87A and Hughes at [9] in respect of s 87).</text>

If, of course, an agreement were reached where there was nothing to support the claimed connection of the applicants to their country, or the determination appeared to be unfair or unjust, the Court might conclude that a determination would be inappropriate and decline to make the orders sought ( James at [4]). That is not the case here.

In the present case, the applicants, the State and the Martu People have had independent legal advice and although the Shire of Derby/West Kimberley has not been legally represented, the Shire Planner has requested that access rights for the Shire's employees and agents to the Determination Area be recognised, particularly as regards access to upgrade the roads and infrastructure of the Kurlku and Purlawarla communities. These rights have been specifically recognised as "other interests" in Schedule 4 to the Minute.</text>

<text>The preference of settling matters as opposed to litigating them has been recognised as a desirable public objective by the High Court and this Court on numerous occasions and its is always heartening when native title claims are settled by agreement rather than through litigation. As the Chief Justice said in Mark Anderson on behalf of the Spinifex People v State of Western Australia [2000] FCA 1717 , at [8]: 'The courts have always encouraged parties to settle their claims amicably'. Agreement is especially desirable in native title cases due to the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved. Agreement between the parties minimises cost and distress and establishes goodwill between the parties for future dealings: North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland [1996] HCA 2 ; (1996) 185 CLR 595.</text>

The State has taken an active and significant part in the negotiation of the consent determination. This was said by Emmett J to be an important factor: Munn at [29]. The State has had regard to the requirements of the Act and applied a rigorous and detailed assessment process. It has satisfied itself that the consent determination is justified in all the circumstance.

There is no suggestion that the agreement was not freely made. The agreed terms of the proposed orders are unambiguous and are appropriate in the circumstances.

The continuous connection of the Ngurrara people with Determination Area A is acknowledged by all parties. There is also evidence to support that connection. The Ngurrara Native Title Claim WC96/32 Supplementary Consent Determination Report dated January 2006 by Daniel Aime Vachon (amended in October 2007) ("the Report") describes the enduring connection of the native title claimant group to their country within the claim area and, on the basis of the material contained in the Report, supports their claim to a native title right to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of Determination Area A to the exclusion of all others.</text>
