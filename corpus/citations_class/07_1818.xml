<text>37 Secondly, the relationship between the management fee and Riddell's income earning activities is direct. Riddell submitted that the services to which the management fee related were, as the invoice stated, for management fees. A label is never determinative: Commissioner of Taxation v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) ATC 4659 at 4668; Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1953] HCA 68 ; (1953) 89 CLR 428; Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 and Sun Newspapers Ltd &amp; Associated Newspapers Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1938] HCA 72 ; (1938) 61 CLR 337.

56 An examination of the character of the advantage sought is assisted by asking two questions: (1) what was the management fee really paid for? and (2) is what it was really paid for, in truth and in substance, a capital asset?: Colonial Mutual at 454 and Sun Newspapers Ltd at 359-360. The advantage must be identified and characterised. The answer to those questions is not assisted by an analysis of the contractual right or rights secured under the contract, as distinct from the activity itself: see Commissioner of Taxation v Raymor (NSW) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 193 ; (1990) 24 FCR 90 at 99 (per Davies, Gummow and Hill JJ) citing Dixon J in Hallstroms at 648. As Dixon J said in Hallstroms , the answer:
 
 
 "...depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view, rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured, employed or exhausted in the process."

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2005/21.html</AustLII>
<text>14 This proceeding was heard on the same day and immediately before Spriggs v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (VID 314 of 2007). To avoid unnecessary repetition in these reasons for decision, I incorporate and adopt in these reasons paras [32] to [41] of the reasons for decision in Spriggs. Those paragraphs set out the relevant legislation, the relevant principles and some general considerations concerning sport and professional sport examined by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Stone [2005] HCA 21 ; (2005) 222 CLR 289 at [11] to [15].

15 Riddell played rugby league as a child. When he was approximately 15 or 16 years of age, he was first represented by a player agent. That relationship ended towards the end of 1997 when Riddell was approached by Darryl Mather ("Mather") of International Sports Management Pty Ltd ("ISM").

16 On 29 May 1998, Riddell entered into a management agreement with ISM ("the ISM Agreement"). It provided:
 
 
 
 "RECITALS:
 
 1. [Riddell] competes professionally in the sport of (sic)
 
 2. [Riddell] desires to engage [ISM] to manage his affairs as hereinafter set out.
 
 The Parties Agree as follows:
 
 1. [ISM] agrees to provide the following services to [Riddell]:
 
 a) Advise [Riddell] in respect of his sporting career.
 
 b) Negotiate playing contracts on behalf of [Riddell]. 
 
 
 
 
 c) Negotiate product endorsements and sponsorship so far as is reasonably possible.
 
 d) Access and arrange legal, financial, superannuation, taxation, insurance and other appropriate advices and services at the request and cost of [Riddell].
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2. [ISM] will keep [Riddell] informed in relation to any dealings or negotiations undertaken on [Riddell's] behalf. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3. The term of this Agreement shall be for five (5) years and shall continue thereafter until terminated in writing by either party, provided that no less than three months notice shall be given. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. ISM shall be entitled to charge [Riddell] fees in respect of its services as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 a) Twenty per cent (20%) of all gross monies or other considerations paid to [Riddell] for sponsorship, media contracts, endorsement for goods and services, advertising or any form of promotional work and any subsequent income earned from the above monies. The said payments shall continue for a period of three years after termination of the contract in respect of any of the arrangements set out above which commence during the period of the agency. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b) In respect of sporting events in which [Riddell] participates: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) Eight per cent (8%) of all contract monies paid to [Riddell] including bonuses/ incentives negotiated by [ISM]. 
 
 (ii) Match payments shall not be included for the purpose of this clause. 
 
 c) The amount payable to [ISM] shall be paid within 14 days of receipt of monies by [Riddell]. 
 
 
 ...
 
 
 
 
 
 10. Outside Australia, [ISM] may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any company with which it is affiliated, including ProServ USA, ProServ UK, ProServ Europe, ProServ Italy and ProServ Japan.
 
 11. During the first twenty four (24) months of the Period of Service [ISM] agrees to provide [Riddell] with a scholarship period. During this time, [ISM] agrees to waiver (sic) any remuneration which would otherwise be due and payable during this portion of the Period of Service as outlined in Clause 4b). This is in no way prejudices the remuneration which may become subsequently due and payable during the remainder of the Period of Service."

42 As with Spriggs , the Commissioner did not contend that it was not possible for a professional sportsperson to be carrying on a business of exploiting his or her sporting talent. It is worth restating what the High Court said in Stone (at 307):
 
 
 "The conclusion that the taxpayer was engaged in a business during the 1998-1999 year proceeds from an acceptance of the proposition that, showing that both before and during that year, the taxpayer was paid to endorse a company or its products as an athlete demonstrated that she has turned her athletic talent to account for money."

43 Riddell's position is not distinguishable. In the 2005 income year, Riddell was carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing his assessable income. He turned his rugby league talent to account for money both before and during the 2005 income year: see [30] [31] above. For the reasons outlined above, the management fee was incurred by Riddell in carrying on that business.

44 The Commissioner contended that because "business" " includes any profession, trade, employment, vocation or calling, but does not include occupation as an employee" (s 995-1 of the 1997 Act ), an outgoing incurred in the course of employment, or to obtain an employment, is not an outgoing incurred "in carrying on a business". Accordingly, the Commissioner contended that the management fee was not deductible because:
 
 (1) Riddell was an employee of Parramatta; and
 
 
 (2) the management fee was incurred in the course of his employment with Parramatta or to obtain employment with Parramatta.</text>

<text>55 The classic test for resolving the distinction between capital and revenue is that stated by Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd at 363:
 
 
 "There are, I think, three matters to be considered, (a) the character of the advantage sought, and in this its lasting qualities may play a part, (b) the manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed, and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part, and (c) the means adopted to obtain it; that is, by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment."

56 An examination of the character of the advantage sought is assisted by asking two questions: (1) what was the management fee really paid for? and (2) is what it was really paid for, in truth and in substance, a capital asset?: Colonial Mutual at 454 and Sun Newspapers Ltd at 359-360. The advantage must be identified and characterised. The answer to those questions is not assisted by an analysis of the contractual right or rights secured under the contract, as distinct from the activity itself: see Commissioner of Taxation v Raymor (NSW) Pty Ltd [1990] FCA 193 ; (1990) 24 FCR 90 at 99 (per Davies, Gummow and Hill JJ) citing Dixon J in Hallstroms at 648. As Dixon J said in Hallstroms , the answer:
 
 
 "...depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view, rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured, employed or exhausted in the process."

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426</tocase>
<text>52 As I said in Spriggs, argument by analogy must never be allowed to obscure the particularity of the arrangements in question. The Commissioner's reliance upon Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426 does just that. Maddalena concerned an era of professional sportsmen and women which bears little or no resemblance to professional sport in the twenty first century. One only has to point to the absence of the electronic media, let alone the internet, in the 1930's to make good that proposition. Secondly, as with Spriggs, the factual matrix in Maddalena is very different to the factual matrix of Riddell.

53 Riddell was and remains a full time professional rugby league player. Maddalena was not. Riddell seeks to claim the management fee as a deduction. That fee was incurred after the playing contract was signed, not before, and could not be charged if no playing contract was negotiated. Maddalena sought to claim travelling expenses and legal expenses, expenses which were incurred before the playing contract and which were incurred regardless of whether or not a playing contract was secured. The management fee incurred by Riddell did not "come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income".

54 In relation to the "negative limb" of s 8-1 of the 1997 Act , the Commissioner submitted that even if the management fee was an outgoing incurred by Riddell in gaining or producing assessable income, it was on capital, not revenue, account and therefore not deductible under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act . This argument also fails.</text>
