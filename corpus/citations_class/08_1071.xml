<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699</tocase>
<text>1 Western Retirement Village Management Pty Ltd ("WRVM") was formerly the registered proprietor of "the Mews" situated at Lot 4, 285 Railway Parade, Upper Swan, Western Australia, being the whole of the land in Certificate of Title Vol 1950 Folio 469 ("the Land"). The Land was the subject of an unregistered investment scheme referred to as "the Mews Village" or "the Mews Retirement Village Scheme" ("the Scheme"), which is in the process of being wound up. Messrs Brian McMaster and Mark Mentha of KordaMentha were appointed receivers of the Scheme to oversee its winding up and were appointed as liquidators of WRVM upon the winding up of WRVM: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699.

2 The Scheme and its participants were described by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [4] to [10] in the following terms:
 
 
 4. By way of background, the promoters of the [Scheme] described their purpose as being to establish and operate a top-quality resort style retirement village with facilities for respite care. The idea was to develop and sell self-contained and fully serviced units and townhouses to people over the age of 55 years. The village was to be located on land purchased from another company associated with the promoters. Investors would put up the deposit with the balance to be raised by loans from the vendor. A management company controlled by the promoters would operate the village. After payment of a management fee, the profit would go to the investors. The key attraction to investors was the expectation that they would be entitled to deduct from their assessable income not only the amount of their investment but also their proportionate share of the loan taken to pay the balance of the purchase price. 
 
 
 
 5 The Mews Village was to be established on [the Land]. The [L]and was registered in the name of [WRVM]. By a contract dated 18 April 2000, WRVM agreed to sell the [L]and to the fourth defendant, The Mews Village Nominees Pty Limited, for $93,425,000. Other agreements to which Mews Village Nominees is a party show that it entered into the contract as "bare nominee" for a group of investors described as "Investor Partners". The contract of sale provided for the payment of a deposit of $18,048,000 with the balance to be paid by a loan from the vendor secured by a mortgage over the [L]and. The purchase price was not the exchange value of the [L]and. The price far exceeded that value. This came about because under the contract the vendor was required to construct the village. The building work was to take place in two stages over several years. Most of the deposit was raised from the investors who were grouped into several partnerships. The balance was provided by the vendor under a non-recourse loan agreement. The agreement required the loan to be repaid out of the fees payable by residents of the village. In the event of default the vendor could only look to the [L]and for payment. 
 
 
 
 6 I indicated that the investors were grouped into several partnerships. The principal partnership is styled The Mews Village Partnership and has 14 "Investor Partners". It was established by a partnership agreement dated 18 April 2000. The parties to this agreement appear to be the Investor Partners (although no provision is made for them to execute the agreement) and two companies associated with the promoters, Mews Retirement Nominees Pty Ltd and the first defendant, GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd. The partnership business is described as "the development and operation of retirement village facilities at [the Land]". GDK was appointed to manage the partnership's business. Mews Retirement Nominees was appointed to hold the partnership property as "bare trustee for the partnership". 
 
 ... 
 
 8 The Mews Retirement Village was to be managed by WRVM. To this end a Marketing Management and Profit Share Agreement was entered into between Mews Village Nominees (the purchaser of the [Land]) and WRVM. Only an unsigned copy of the agreement is in evidence. The copy does not indicate clearly the identity of the contracting parties. The front page suggests that the agreement is between WRVM and The Mews Retirement Nominees Pty Ltd which, it will be remembered, is the "bare nominee" of The Mews Village Partnership. A schedule records that the agreement is between WRVM and the Mews Retirement Village Nominees Pty Ltd. Notwithstanding those references, the body of the agreement shows that the agreement was between WRVM and Mews Village Nominees. The sealing clause is the latter company's name. A recital describes it as the purchaser of the [Land]. Moving on, the only substantive provision of the agreement to which reference should be made is the management fee which is set at 40 per cent of the profit derived by the village plus a commission of 1 per cent of the fees received from residents. This suggests that not much was to go to the investors, although one should not lose sight of the substantial tax advantage they derived from entering into the scheme. 
 
 
 
 9 Notwithstanding the complex series of agreements, and the subscription by investors of capital in the order of $8 million, The Mews Retirement Village did not get off the ground. All that has happened is that The Mews Retirement Nominees paid the purchase price for the [Land] using the investors' capital and loan funds obtained from the vendor. Despite receiving the purchase price, WRVM has not transferred the [L]and to the purchaser: [it] remains registered as the proprietor of the [L]and. Nor has WRVM carried out the building works which by the contract of sale it had promised to do. I assume it did not have the funds to undertake the work. There has been no accounting to investors for any of the money they contributed, despite many requests for information. The investors have simply been left in the dark. 
 
 
 
 10 There is no hope of the development going ahead, at least while it remains in the hands of its present controllers. GDK has been wound up. There is an unresolved dispute over the control of Mews Village Nominees. ... To be blunt, things are in a mess and it will take a good deal of time and great expense to sort them out.

3 What Finkelstein J referred to as a "mess" is made more complicated by a series of transactions that is an immediate cause of the present proceedings. At the risk of undue abbreviation (with consequent inaccuracy) that series of transactions was made by interests associated with a principal of WRVM (Mr Michael Brereton) and interests associated with one Mr Salvo (an investor in the Scheme both as an individual and through a number of related entities). Whether because the Scheme was not being implemented, or for some other reason (and it may not matter which), the Brereton interests agreed that the Salvo interests would advance money to WRVM, it is said secured against the Land, for the purpose of developing the Land in a manner contrary to that intended under the Scheme. Again at the risk of undue abbreviation, these proceedings are intended to decide whether these transactions created debts of WRVM that are secured by the Land.

4 On 12 March 2008, WRVM filed an interlocutory process. AVS Property Pty Ltd (ACN 094 311 645) ("AVS") and Rental Fleets Australia Proprietary Limited ("RFA"), members of the First Delta Group of Companies and entities associated with Mr Salvo, are the respondents. AVS and RFA were formerly the holders of a second ranking registered mortgage over the Land ("the AVS mortgage") and are presently the holders of a registered charge over the assets of WRVM ("the AVS charge"). National Australia Bank Limited ("NAB") was the holder of the first registered mortgage over the Land.

5 Pursuant to a contract of sale dated 6 December 2007, the Land was sold. The sale proceeded pursuant to orders made by Finkelstein J on 28 November 2006 and 6 December 2007. In substance, the orders required the mortgagees (NAB, AVS and RFA) to produce discharges of their respective mortgages so that the sale of the Land could proceed. The discharges occurred on the basis that NAB was paid the amount that it claimed was secured by its mortgage and a sum of approximately $400,000 was set aside in a separate bank account to cover certain contingencies. AVS and RFA were not paid out. Their discharges were ordered to be produced on the basis that there would be proceedings for the taking of accounts of what is secured by the AVS mortgage and the AVS charge and that, to assist that taking of accounts, interlocutory proceedings of the kind now under consideration would be instituted.

6 It is common ground that RFA does not have any claim against WRVM which is secured by either the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge. Accordingly, there is no need for an account to be taken in relation to what amount, if any, WRVM owes RFA.

7 The position of AVS is quite different. It contends that it has a claim against WRVM and that the amount claimed is secured by both the AVS mortgage and the AVS charge. The total amount claimed, about $14 million, exceeds the balance of the proceeds of sale of the Land after payment to NAB and of GST. That balance is about $13 million.

15 Against that statement of general position, it is necessary to set out the principal facts. Much of what is set out constitutes facts as found by Finkelstein J. No party in the present proceeding disputed those findings. Nor did any party in the present proceeding dispute the other facts set out below, though there was a lively dispute about the legal consequences that follow from those findings.

16 On 16 March 2000, WRVM contracted to purchase the Land for $2.85 million. It became the registered proprietor of the Land on 11 July 2000. Mr Michael Brereton was the sole director of WRVM.

17 Approximately one month later, on 18 April 2000, WRVM entered into a contract to sell the Land to The Mews Village Nominees Pty Ltd ("Mews") for $93,425,000 ("the Mews Sale Contract"). On 2 November 2006, Finkelstein J concluded, as a finding of fact, that although WRVM remained the registered proprietor of the Land, it held the Land as bare trustee for Mews: see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699 at [4] to [9]. In fact, it was not until 6 December 2007, when the Land was sold pursuant to the orders of Finkelstein J, that WRVM ceased to be the registered proprietor of the Land.

18 The Mews Sale Contract contained Special Conditions. By cl 6.1 of the Special Conditions, WRVM agreed that "Stage 1" would be constructed by WRVM in an expeditious manner. In general terms, WRVM was obliged to construct a number of three bedroom duplex and freestanding units, four bedroom duplex and freestanding units, and serviced apartments, including the necessary infrastructure.

19 Nothing of significance transpired between 2000 and September 2003. That was the problem. Significantly, the Land was not developed in accordance with the terms of the Mews Sale Contract.

49 On 28 November 2006, for the reasons dated 2 November 2006, Finkelstein J ordered the Scheme to be wound up: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 699. By paragraph 16 of those orders, his Honour directed the receivers of the Scheme to call for any person claiming any right, title or interest in Land to prove his or her claim by affidavit to be served by 22 December 2006. AVS responded to that direction. The substance of its response was relied upon by WRVM as providing a factual foundation for an estoppel claim in the event that I found each of the components as owing by WRVM to AVS and secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge. In general terms, WRVM submitted that even if the debts were secured, the liquidators and receivers of WRVM had priority because of their reliance on representations made by, or attributable to, AVS.

50 AVS's response to the call for proofs was provided by way of affidavit sworn by Mario Salvo on 22 December 2006. Paragraph 2 confirmed that it was an "affidavit in support of the claims made by RFA, AVS and Statewide ... of their interests in the Land". Mr Salvo described himself as the director of RFA and the general manager of AVS. He went on to say that the sole director and secretary of AVS was a Mr Andrew Vito Salvo, but that nonetheless he was authorised to make the affidavit on behalf of RFA, Statewide and AVS. Significantly, the affidavit explained the background to and circumstances surrounding the events in and after early 2005. Mr Salvo deposed to the fact that in or about early 2005, he became concerned for "his investment". In the context, "his investment" could only refer to RFA's investment in the Scheme. (Strictly speaking, however, the documents record investment in the Scheme by Mario Salvo as an individual and by some of his related entities including DFX and CLA Holdings.) As a result of these concerns, Mr Salvo held discussions with Mr Brereton regarding whether RFA might assign its rights in the Scheme to WRVM for $2,696,296. A draft agreement was prepared, signed by WRVM but not signed by RFA. Salvo said that he chose not to sign the agreement for the sale of RFA's interests because he was not entirely sure he wanted RFA to assign its rights as an investor. In substance, he decided to hold the signed sale agreement and see how things in relation to the Land developed.

51 As at May 2005, the Land was subject to the Westpac mortgage. The Westpac facility had in fact expired on 29 October 2004 and penalty interest was being charged on an outstanding loan of $3.1 million. At this time two events crystallised. Mr Salvo spoke to Mr Brereton and was told by him that he was going to pay out the investors and intended winding up the Scheme. At the same time, Mr Salvo said he believed the Land had development potential with his property development expertise and capital base which provided him with an opportunity to recoup RFA's investment and make a profit from the development of the Land.

59 On 6 December 2007, Finkelstein J made orders that the court appointed receivers do all things necessary to progress and complete the sale of the Land in accordance with the Sale Agreement between WRVM and Clarendon Residential Group Pty Ltd. The sale of the Land was at arm's length. On 20 February 2008, Goldberg J made orders authorising the receivers to commence proceedings to prevent payment out of the proceeds of sale of the Land to AVS and RFA. On 13 March 2008, Finkelstein J noted the undertaking of WRVM to commence this interlocutory process and, on that undertaking, ordered the joinder of NAB to those proceedings, and effectively the discharge of the relevant mortgages so that completion of the sale of the Land could proceed. Completion of the sale took place on 17 March 2008. On completion, the NAB mortgage was discharged. The entitlement of AVS to the balance of the sale proceeds is the issue to be resolved in these proceedings.

60 Finally, on 3 March 2008, AVS's solicitors wrote to WRVM's solicitors. AVS asserted that the amount then due by WRVM to AVS under the AVS Facility Agreement was $5,857,286.36. WRVM submitted this was the first time that the AVS claim had included the five components identified earlier (see [8]). Although the profit share and management fee were said to be secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge, the precise amounts owing were said to be incalculable.

61 On 17 March 2008, WRVM as guarantor paid to NAB the sum of $9,410,063.13 thereby discharging Salrest's liability to NAB.</text>

<tocase>Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 ; (2005) 216 ALR 320</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//nsw/supreme_ct/2005/417.html</AustLII>
<text>69 The first issue is whether each of the general ledgers and journal entries identified earlier (see [36] above) is a book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of the Corporations Act . They clearly are: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 ; (2005) 216 ALR 320 at [223] [321]. The documents, on their face, purport to be documents kept by a body corporate. They are printouts of electronic records which identify the relevant body corporate by name, the nature of the document by name and, in many cases, the time and date on which the printout was printed. It was not submitted by WRVM, and there are no bases for contending, that the presumption arising under s 1305(2) has been rebutted. On the contrary. The evidence of the contents of the documents together with the unchallenged evidence of Mr Wunsch that the documents were sourced from the relevant body corporate reinforces the conclusion that each document is a book kept by a body corporate under a requirement of the Corporations Act .

70 The second issue is what facts those documents record. As noted earlier (see [33]-[37]), so far as is presently relevant, the documents record:
 
1. a loan by NAB to Salvern of $4 million;
 
2. a loan by Salvern to AVS of $2,953,067.22 with the notation "AVS Loan to [WRVM]";
 
3. that $33,528.64 of the Deacons bill of $36,881.50 was on-charged to AVS;
 
4. a loan by AVS to WRVM of three amounts - $2,953,067.22 (with the notation "Re Salvern Loan"), $33,528.64 (being payment of legal fees) and $16,959.35;
 
5. a credit by AVS to WRVM of $3,328.57 with the notation "Tranche-2-La".

71 WRVM did not challenge the admissibility of these records or the facts recorded in them. Moreover, WRVM did not seek to cross-examine Mr Wunsch who identified the documents and the source of them. In the circumstances, the only conclusion to be drawn from those financial records is that AVS did advance the Tranche 2 Loan to WRVM under the AVS Facility Agreement. In this context, AVS also referred to cl 24 of the AVS Facility Agreement. It provided that AVS (described as the Financier) was entitled to maintain records specifying the payments made by AVS for the account of WRVM, any payments made by WRVM for the account of AVS under, inter alia , the AVS Facility Agreement and the interest, fees, charges, costs and expenses payable and that those records would, as against AVS, constitute conclusive evidence (in the absence of manifest error) of the matters set out in them. The documentation described earlier records the advance of the Tranche 2 Loan by AVS to WRVM. Whether other amounts were paid or incurred in relation to the Tranche 2 Loan was not disclosed. Those issues, if relevant, would be considered at the time of the taking of any account.</text>

<tocase>ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/448.html</AustLII>
<text>107 Finkelstein J considered and rejected the AVS profit share claim in his reasons for judgment in ASIC v GDK Financial Solutions Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 3) [2008] FCA 448 at [27] - [31] . Although the claim at that time was merely foreshadowed rather than actual, it turns out the actual claim is on precisely the same basis and in precisely the same terms as the foreshadowed claim rejected by Finkelstein J. While it is true that his Honour's comments on the profit share issue are non-binding dicta, I nevertheless consider them to be clearly correct and adopt them. Although I do not propose to repeat all of his Honour's reasons here, a simple restatement of the fundamental premise is that, in the absence of any definition of "profit" in the agreement, there is no reasonable, or even rational, implied definition or formula for profit under which it could be said that a profit was made.

108 Again, any implied definition must be reasonable and equitable. The definition must be in keeping with the purpose and other provisions of the agreement. Here, the purpose of the Development Agreement was the development of the Land. Again, cl 2 states that AVS is entitled to 50% of the profits from the "development of the land." On that basis, I consider that a reasonable and equitable definition of profit could only be one involving profit resulting from improvements made to the land (whether by construction of a housing development or otherwise). Because no development was undertaken, there can be no profit.

109 I should emphasise one other point made by Finkelstein J, which goes to answer a claim that profit that should be defined more broadly (a claim which I reject) to include profit derived from appreciation of the Land's value over the years due to a general rise in the real estate market. As noted by his Honour, the problem with this argument is that because WRVM was only the bare legal owner of the Land, and not the beneficial owner, it is not entitled to any proceeds from the sale. It goes without saying that AVS, apart from its mortgage interest (which as a secured legal interest superseded the equitable interests of the Mews investors), was neither a beneficial nor a legal owner of the Land. Neither WRVM nor AVS is entitled to the sale proceeds as an item of profit to which the joint venture agreement could attach.

110 With respect to the remaining items claimed by AVS (development costs incurred before 18 May 2005 of approximately $40,000 or $50,000, development costs incurred after 18 May 2005 of $1.4 million, and a management fee of $660,000), the fact that some amounts may be owing follows from the conclusion that the Development Agreements are valid and enforceable. Whether the particular amounts claimed are supportable is another story. For example, although a project management fee of approximately $660,000 is claimed, it cannot stand. Clause 3 of the Development Agreement states that AVS is entitled to a project management fee "equal to 5% of the before tax profits of the Joint Venture, with a minimum of $500,000 plus GST." Given that I have already concluded that there was no profit, it follows that the maximum amount that could be claimed is only $500,000 ex GST. Clause 3 further provides that any $10,000 monthly retainer fee charged is to be offset against the management fee, which might further diminish the amount allowable as a management fee.

111 I need not consider the accuracy of the fees and costs claims any further, however, because I conclude that those amounts are not secured by the AVS mortgage or charge. As noted earlier (at [77]-[78]) the all-moneys clause in the mortgage will not be held to secure debts of a fundamentally different character from those contemplated at the time at which the contract was entered into. Here, I consider that while the mortgage explicitly considered the two tranches of loans (the $1 million and $3 million advances) at the time of contracting in May 2005, the mortgage did not consider the development costs and management fees. As noted earlier, cl 3 of the AVS Facility Agreement states that the purpose of the mortgage loan agreement was to discharge encumbrances on the Land. In effect, it was a refinancing agreement of the distressed Westpac loan. I consider that the amounts now claimed to be secured as development costs and management fees are costs related to development, not costs relating to encumbrances, and are thus of a fundamentally different character from the debts contemplated at the time of the mortgage's execution. Further, I consider that this analysis applies equally to the all-moneys clause in the AVS charge.</text>

<tocase>Bahr v Nicolay (No 2) [1988] HCA 16 ; (1988) 164 CLR 604</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1988/16.html</AustLII>
<text>63 Indefeasibility is the foundation of the Torrens system: Bahr v Nicolay (No 2) [1988] HCA 16 ; (1988) 164 CLR 604 , 613. In Western Australia, the principle of indefeasibility of title is "give[n] expression to, and at the same time, qualif[ied] by" ss 68 and 134 of the TLA ( Bahr at 613). Each section refers to the concept in the context of the registered "proprietor". "Proprietor" is defined in s 4 of the TLA to include "in relation to freehold land, the owner, whether in possession, remainder, reversion or otherwise, of land or of a lease, mortgage or charge over land". As a result ss 68 and 134 of the TLA confer indefeasibility of title not only on the holder of the fee simple but also on the registered holder of an interest in the land including a mortgagee. The qualifications to or limits of indefeasibility for present purposes may be put to one side. It was not submitted that any exception arose for consideration.

64 In the circumstances that then existed: 
 
1. WRVM was and remained the registered proprietor of the Land;
 
2. NAB was a registered mortgagee with priority over the other mortgagees, AVS and RFA; 
 
3. NAB's mortgage and liability has been discharged;
 
4. The AVS/RFA mortgage had also been discharged but with the issue of WRVM's liability to AVS remaining unresolved together with the issue of whether any such liability was secured by the AVS mortgage.

65 In ascertaining whether WRVM is indebted to AVS and, if so, whether the whole or part of that debt is secured by the AVS mortgage necessarily involves questions of fact, and no less significantly, the proper construction of the terms of the AVS mortgage itself. It is therefore necessary to turn to consider the five components of the "debt".</text>

<tocase>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 226</tocase>
<text>96 Another way of putting it is that there was an implied obligation on both parties to nominate the relevant related entities or representatives and an implied obligation on the part of AVS to generate a development proposal in return for its management and retainer fees. I consider such terms to be reasonable, equitable, obvious, and necessary within the meaning of the test for the implication of contractual terms set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 226 , 283 and the subsequent cases that have adopted that test. In the absence of any development efforts by AVS, WRVM could have asserted breach of contract based on complete failure to perform; similarly, AVS could have asserted breach of contract if WRVM had failed to allocate the $10,000 per month. Accordingly, I consider that the lack of a specified development proposal did not render the agreements unenforceable.

97 WRVM's further contention was that even if the agreements were enforceable contracts, then properly construed they were subject to a condition precedent that the Scheme would be wound up and, in particular, WRVM would be discharged from its obligations under the Mews Sale Contract (see [50]-[56] above), but that condition precedent had not been satisfied. That contention proceeded on an assumption that it was not possible for WRVM to enter into the Mews Sale Contract and yet at the same time contract with Mario Salvo under the Heads of Agreement. That assumption is incorrect. It may be reasonable to conclude that WRVM was not going to be in a position to complete both agreements but that does not mean that one or both of the agreements is subject to a condition precedent.</text>

<text>62 Before turning to consider the five components identified earlier (see [8]), it is necessary to restate some important principles about Torrens land and the securities registered against it. The Torrens system implemented in Western Australia by the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA) ("the TLA") is a system of "title by registration" ( Breskvar v Wall [1971] HCA 70 ; (1971) 126 CLR 376 , 385) and not a system of "registration of title". Registration has two consequences: it not only confers title but it also determines priority. Priority is governed by order of registration and not by date of execution.</text>

<text>73 It is well established that what was said and done by parties to an agreement is part of the relevant context in which an agreement is construed: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 , 348-53 (per Mason J) and Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2001] FCA 760 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 ; see also Chacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg [2005] FCAFC 40 ; (2005) 215 ALR 748 at [32] (per Tamberlin J) and [68]-[77]; Chitty on Contracts, 27th ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1994 at [12057]; and McVeigh, In the Matter of Piccolo v National Bank of Australia [2000] FCA 187 at [30] (per Finkelstein J) and at [68] (per Kenny J) and Manks v Whiteley [1912] 1 Ch 735, 754 (per Fletcher-Moulton LJ).

92 Furthermore, even if the preamble's identification of the parties was uncertain or ambiguous, cl 1 of the Heads of Agreement clearly states that "WRVM and MS" will form the joint venture, and cl 2 identifies AVS as the Salvo entity that will discharge the Westpac debt, loan money to WRVM, etc. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the recitals and the operative portion of the contract, the operative portion controls: Harpur v Levy (2007) 16 VR 587 at [63] and Chacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg (as administrator of Australian Risk Analysis Pty Ltd) [2005] FCAFC 40 ; (2005) 215 ALR 748 at [39] - [50] , [105] and [106]. The same analysis applies equally to the Development Agreements. Clause 2 of the Development Agreement states that "WRVM and MS have formed a joint venture" and the same is true of cl 2 of the Second Development Agreement.</text>

<text>73 It is well established that what was said and done by parties to an agreement is part of the relevant context in which an agreement is construed: Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 , 348-53 (per Mason J) and Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2001] FCA 760 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 ; see also Chacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg [2005] FCAFC 40 ; (2005) 215 ALR 748 at [32] (per Tamberlin J) and [68]-[77]; Chitty on Contracts, 27th ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1994 at [12057]; and McVeigh, In the Matter of Piccolo v National Bank of Australia [2000] FCA 187 at [30] (per Finkelstein J) and at [68] (per Kenny J) and Manks v Whiteley [1912] 1 Ch 735, 754 (per Fletcher-Moulton LJ).</text>

<tocase>Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2004/55.html</AustLII>
<text>74 However, in the present case, that conduct does not assist either party. The longstanding rule is that parties are bound by the unambiguous terms of their written agreement unless it is affected by fraud, mistake or misrepresentation: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471 , 483-84 [33] and [35]. The terms of the AVS Facility Agreement are not ambiguous. In the absence of such ambiguity, the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it.

75 The question which then arises is whether the Tranche 2 Loan is secured by the AVS mortgage. That requires consideration of the proper construction of the terms of the AVS mortgage itself.

76 As noted earlier (see [28]), the AVS mortgage secured the "Secured Money", which was defined to mean "all amounts now or at any time in the future" falling within identified categories: see cl 1.1(27). The categories included:
 
 
 (a) all money now or in future owing or payable to the Mortgagee [(AVS)] ... by [WRVM], either alone or on joint or partnership account and whether as principal debtor, guarantor or indemnifier on any account;
 ... 
 

(i) all costs and expenses that the Mortgagee incurs or becomes liable for in connection with this Mortgage or any Security Document.
 
"Security Document" was defined to mean the mortgage and every other agreement between WRVM and the mortgagee: cl 1.1(1) and (28).</text>

<tocase>Fountain v Bank of America Trust &amp; Savings Association (1992) 5 BPR 11,817</tocase>
<text>77 These provisions, read together, are commonly described as an "all-moneys" clause. Provisions such as these are not at large: Fountain v Bank of America Trust &amp; Savings Association (1992) 5 BPR 11,817 at 11,819. The clause is confined in its operation " by reference to the context in which [it] appear[s] and by reference to the commercial purpose for which [it was] intended to serve ": Fountain at 11,819-11,820. Those matters are ascertained by having regard to the language of the clause construed in the context of the security instrument as a whole, the apparent purpose and object of the transaction and any admissible evidence as to the surrounding circumstances: Olympic Holdings Pty Ltd v Windslow Corporation Pty Ltd (in liq) [2008] WASCA 80 at [43] . Consistent with that approach, an all-moneys clause will not secure a debt of a fundamentally different character from the debt specifically contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the contract: McVeigh, in the matter of Piccolo v National Australia Bank Limited [2000] FCA 187 at [84] . As Gleeson CJ said in Fountain (at 11,820), "The critical question ... is whether, on the true construction of the document and in the events that have occurred, the transaction [the Tranche 2 Loan was] within the purview of [cll 1.1(27) and (28) of the AVS mortgage]."</text>

<tocase>Hadley v Hazian Proprietary Limited (Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, unreported, 13 July 1995)</tocase>
<text>91 WRVM's primary complaint was as to the identity of the contracting parties. As noted earlier (see [21]), the preamble referred to the fact that " Mario Salvo or his nominee (defined as "MS") and WRVM and or its nominee "wish[ed] to establish a joint venture for the development of [the Land] ". The meaning of that provision is unambiguous and certain. Mr Salvo and WRVM were the parties to establish "a joint venture for the development of the Land." However, each was given a power to nominate an alternative. If no alternative party was nominated, Mr Salvo and WRVM alone were bound to establish a joint venture. The clause unambiguously records that the parties intended to create a binding agreement which created a joint venture and then governed the relationship between them. WRVM's contention that the parties were insufficiently defined or uncertain to constitute a binding agreement is without foundation. Moreover, contrary to the submissions of WRVM, the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Hadley v Hazian Proprietary Limited (Unreported, 13 July 1995) does not support its contention. As the unanimous Full Court in Hadley made clear, a clause in the form of that found in the preamble to the Heads of Agreement is unambiguous and certain. What was unambiguous but uncertain was a clause which required a sale to be implemented by any one of A, B or C or some or all of them or their respective nominees. The uncertainty arose because the clause did not identify who was bound to purchase. That criticism cannot apply to the preamble. The preamble provides with certainty that Mario Salvo and WRVM wish to establish a joint venture and that each of them is entitled to nominate an alternative. Moreover, cl 1 of Heads of Agreement provides that each of the WRVM and "MS" is to be entitled to 50% of the profits of the joint venture subject to certain variations. If in the future WRVM wished to nominate an alternative or sell down part of its 50% interest in the joint venture then it was entitled to do so. That might never occur. And until it did, the parties and their obligations were unambiguous and certain.</text>

<tocase>Harpur v Levy (2007) 16 VR 587</tocase>
<text>92 Furthermore, even if the preamble's identification of the parties was uncertain or ambiguous, cl 1 of the Heads of Agreement clearly states that "WRVM and MS" will form the joint venture, and cl 2 identifies AVS as the Salvo entity that will discharge the Westpac debt, loan money to WRVM, etc. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the recitals and the operative portion of the contract, the operative portion controls: Harpur v Levy (2007) 16 VR 587 at [63] and Chacmol Holdings Pty Ltd v Handberg (as administrator of Australian Risk Analysis Pty Ltd) [2005] FCAFC 40 ; (2005) 215 ALR 748 at [39] - [50] , [105] and [106]. The same analysis applies equally to the Development Agreements. Clause 2 of the Development Agreement states that "WRVM and MS have formed a joint venture" and the same is true of cl 2 of the Second Development Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1040.html</AustLII>
<text>98 There is no general rule that parties having knowledge of a prior contract between different parties may not subsequently enter into a contract with fundamentally inconsistent terms (which is really the result of the "implied condition precedent" argument put by WRVM). The lack of any such rule is the inevitable consequence of the efficient breach theory of contract, which, although it has occasionally been criticised, remains the controlling theory of contract damages under Australian law: Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd [2001] FCA 1040 ; (2001) 110 FCR 157 at [159] .

99 To understand both the theory and its rationale, a simple hypothetical may assist. Suppose A agrees on Day 1 to sell his bicycle to B for $25 (which happens to be fair market value at the time of contract but $5 more than A himself paid) with delivery to take place on Day 10. Now suppose that on Day 5, C approaches A and offers to buy the bicycle for the above-market price of $50 on the spot (maybe he happens to have an urgent need for a bicycle for which he is willing to pay a premium). It is perfectly rational in those circumstances, and completely open under the law of contract, for A to sell the bicycle to C, breach his contract with B, pay damages, and pocket the difference, if any. Assuming there is nothing special about A's bicycle and equivalent bicycles are readily available in the market, the damages for breach are likely to be only the replacement costs (i.e. fair market value) of a like bicycle on Day 10, the date of delivery. There is of course a risk to A that the market price of bicycles will rise. Provided that the price does not rise above $45 by Day 10, however, A will make more money by breaching his contract with B and selling to C even after he pays B damages. The law encourages (or at least allows) this eventuality on the basis that everyone is better off (or at least no worse off). A makes a bigger profit, B gets a substantially identical replacement bicycle (or strictly speaking, the cost of cover), and C gets the bicycle he wanted.

100 In short, which of the contractual arrangements WRVM decided to complete (if any) was ultimately a matter for it to decide in the future in light of its own enlightened self-interest. And even if WRVM entered into the Heads of Agreement or Development Agreements on the basis of an ill-informed judgment on its part either that ultimately it could or would extricate itself from the Mews Sale Contract or that it could make a greater profit by simply breaching that contract and paying damages, it does not assist WRVM. The consequence or consequences that flowed as a result of WRVM failing to complete one or more of those arrangements was ultimately to be determined depending on the way in which the facts resolved themselves and the remedial step or steps (if any) the disappointed contracting party took against WRVM. As in the bicycle hypothetical where A runs the risk that the cost of bicycles on Day 10 may exceed $45 (i.e. he will incur a loss rather than a profit by breaching the first contract), WRVM ran the risk that it would not be able to get out of the Mews Sale Contract and Scheme at a cost that would justify breach of that agreement. That, however, is a commercial rather than a legal consideration. As such, WRVM's contention that the Heads of Agreement or the later agreements never came into effect due to the non-fulfilment of a condition precedent is rejected.</text>

<tocase>Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1954/72.html</AustLII>
<text>24 WRVM contends that the Heads of Agreement is not enforceable as a contract for want of intention to create legal relations. WRVM contends that it is a document by which the parties have done no more than record a stage in their negotiations with no intention to be bound by it: Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360-361. Alternatively, WRVM contends that if the document is not wanting for intention, it is insufficiently certain in its terms to be enforceable as a contract. In support of the latter submission, WRVM identified a number of respects in which it submitted the document was insufficiently certain in its terms. WRVM's primary complaint was that there was no indication as to who were the parties to the joint venture.

25 For the sake of completeness, it is appropriate to record at this stage that WRVM contends that even if the Heads of Agreement is enforceable as a contract:
 
(1) it was replaced by two later agreements a Development Agreement (see [43] below) and a Second Development Agreement (see [47] below); and
 
(2) even if the amounts identified in [8] are payable under the Heads of Agreement or Development Agreements, none of the amounts is secured by the AVS mortgage or the AVS charge.

26 Notwithstanding WRVM's contentions in this litigation that it was not contractually bound by the Heads of Agreement, WRVM took steps to satisfy the obligations stipulated in the Heads of Agreement. On 24 or 25 May 2005 (after execution of the Heads of Agreement), WRVM entered into the AVS Facility Agreement. Under the AVS Facility Agreement, AVS agreed to provide to WRVM what was described as the "Tranche 1 Loan" ($1 million) and the "Tranche 2 Loan" ($3 million): cl 2.1. The Facility Limit was $4 million: sched 1. Clause 3 of the AVS Facility Agreement provided that:
 (1) [WRVM] must use part of the Tranche 1 Advance to repay [the] principal owing to Westpac under the Westpac Facility ... (2) [WRVM] must use all of the Tranche 2 Advance to repay the then remaining proportion of moneys owing to Westpac under the Westpac Facility and / or to fully discharge any existing encumbrances over the Land.

87 As noted previously, WRVM contends that the Heads of Agreement is not enforceable as a contract for want of intention to create legal relations. WRVM contends that it is a document by which the parties did no more than record a stage in their negotiations with no intention to be bound by it: Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360-361. Alternatively, WRVM contends that if the document is not wanting for intention, it is insufficiently certain in its terms to be enforceable as a contract.

88 The simplest answer to any questions about the validity or enforceability of the Heads of Agreement is that those questions need not be answered because cl 1 of the Development Agreement terminated that agreement. Accordingly, the parties agree that no money can be owing under the Heads of Agreement. However, because the same arguments are put by WRVM against each of the three agreements, it is convenient to address them together.

89 WRVM identified a number of respects in which it submitted that the agreements were insufficiently certain in their terms including:
 
1) the identity of the contracting parties was not known but a matter for further negotiation;
 
2) although the agreement was in relation to the development of land, there was no agreement as to what the proposed development would be;
 
3) the identity of the party on whom obligations were imposed was not certain;
 
4) although each agreement provided for the appointment of a manager who was entitled to substantial benefits, no corresponding obligations were imposed on the manager.
 
WRVM identified a number of matters which it will be necessary to consider in further detail below.</text>

<tocase>Uranium Equities Ltd v Fewster [2008] WASCA 33</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//wa/WASCA/2008/33.html</AustLII>
<text>94 As the Western Australian Court of Appeal recently noted, it is trite to say that a contract can fail for uncertainty if it is missing an essential term (a typical example being price): Uranium Equities Ltd v Fewster [2008] WASCA 33 at [257] . More useful is what the Court in Uranium Equities went on to say about essential terms in the uncertainty context (at [257]):
 We have said what is meant by the word "essential" in this context. When dealing with the question of contractual intention, we have expressed opinions on the question whether or not terms left over for future negotiation were essential. We have concluded that, although some of the matters left over were indicative of a lack of intention to be bound, they were not such as to lead to a finding that, if the requisite intention was present, the contract failed for lack of certainty. As Lloyd LJ said in Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 601, 619 there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. He went on to say that it "happens every day where parties enter into so-called 'heads of agreement'". While many of the matters left over in this case were important, none seems to us to have been essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement, in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it.

95 I consider this case to be of the kind referred to by Lloyd LJ. Here we have a heads of agreement in which many matters of import, including the precise nature of the development, were left to be agreed later. In my view, however, the lack of a project definition is not essential to the efficacy of the agreement in the sense of its enforceability. Regardless of the precise nature of the development project, it is clear that the agreements contemplate at least some effort or work toward development however defined. That is to say, the development work contemplated in the agreements, at least initially, is the work required to put together a proper development proposal, including financing, whether for the building of a golf course, a residential development, or otherwise. That AVS or its nominee was to undertake such work (with the aid of WRVM's representative) is evident from the project management and project representative provisions in cl 3, including the retainer provision requiring a payment of $10,000 per month to AVS or its nominee.</text>
