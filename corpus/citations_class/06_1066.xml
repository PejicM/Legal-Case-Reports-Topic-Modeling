<tocase>Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1993) 43 FCR 1 </tocase>
<text>313 On general agency principles, Mr Somerset's knowledge of the falsity of the proposed confessional advertisement is attributable to his principal, AMI. Mr Somerset became party to the arrangement to deceive the public in the course of acting in AMI's interests, and the case is not one of a fraud perpetrated by Mr Somerset exclusively against AMI; cf Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1993) 43 FCR 1 at [22.31] [22.35] and cases there cited. Another way of expressing the matter is to say that because Mr Somerset was AMI's agent, AMI cannot claim, as against Mr Turpie, to have relied on what Mr Turpie said and wrote, devoid of the accompanying context that Mr Somerset and Mr Turpie were proposing a lie to the public. Mr Turpie did not mislead or deceive Mr Somerset, and if Mr Somerset misled and deceived Dr Vaisman into believing that Mr Turpie suffered from impotence or erectile dysfunction (as noted below, I do not accept that Dr Vaisman had any belief one way or the other on that matter), it was Mr Somerset, not Mr Turpie, who caused AMI's loss; cf Dalton v Lawson Hill Estate Pty Ltd (2005) 66 IPR 525 at [121] [130].</text>
