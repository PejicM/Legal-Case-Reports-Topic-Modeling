<text>10 The judgment that the appellant seeks to appeal was apparently made under O 13.03A of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules. Order 13.03A(c) permits the Court to dismiss an application if a party fails to appear at a hearing. The judgment is in the nature of an interlocutory judgment: see recently, for example, MZXMD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 769 at [7] per Weinberg J and the cases there cited. Accordingly, pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the appellant requires leave to appeal. The appellant has not sought leave, notwithstanding that the defect is apparent from the first respondent's notice of objection to competency. I note too that leave must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision or an extension of time sought in which to seek such leave. The appeal is incompetent in the absence of a grant of leave.</text>

<text>11 Even if leave were sought, I would not be disposed to grant it. The present is a hopeless case. This is the second occasion in which the appellant has instituted proceedings for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in March 2004. There is no suggestion that the appellant seeks to challenge the decision on any new ground. Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see, for example, MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 466 at [11] referring to Wong v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 722 at [71]; and MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 507 at [15] . Even if the circumstances did not give rise to res judicata, these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel: see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589. Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding. Furthermore, there is nothing to support the appellant's contention that the course taken by the Federal Magistrate on this occasion was so unfair or otherwise affected by error that it ought be set aside on appeal.</text>
