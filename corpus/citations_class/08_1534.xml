<tocase>Creevey v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456</tocase>
<text>26 There is no evidence as to how the defendant could continue to trade without the plaintiff's support. Indeed, the inference must be that it could not. There is no evidence that the defendant could pay for any of the stock in advance or at all. I am not therefore persuaded that the creditors would receive a better or earlier dividend by the administration continuing, rather than the company being liquidated: Creevey v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456. At the very highest, from the defendant's point of view, the defendant's case is one of speculation rather than of possibilities which is not sufficient to engage section 440A: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Yates Security Services Pty Limited (1997) 26 ACSR 629.</text>
