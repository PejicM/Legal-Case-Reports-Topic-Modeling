<text>12 A more difficult question is whether or not the applicant has established a prima facie case in this matter. Mr Philp directed my attention to Caterpillar Inc v John Deere Limited and Others [1999] FCA 1503 ; (1999) 48 IPR 1 , where the Full Court considered the meaning of " prima facie case" in the context of O 8 r 3(2). It is clear from such decisions as Caterpillar [1999] FCA 1503 ; (1999) 48 IPR 1 and earlier decisions of the Full Court (including Sydbank Soenderjylland (A/S) v Bannerton Holdings Proprietary Limited (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549) that in order to establish a prima facie case for the purposes of O 8 r 3(2), the court does not call for a substantial inquiry. The court requires only that there be material before the court, from which inferences are open and which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed.</text>
