<text>26 Eden refers to Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia (1997) 76 FCR 151 ( Hughes ) and Cubic Transportation Systems Inc v State of New South Wales [2002] NSWSC 656 ( Cubic Transportation ). The facts of Hughes were vastly different from those of the present case. In Hughes , there were two competing tenderers, the applicant in the proceeding being the unsuccessful one. Finn J held that in the circumstances of the case, there was an implied contract that might be called a "process contract", according to which Airservices Australia incurred implied contractual obligations in favour of the tenderers, including an implied obligation to conduct its evaluation fairly and in a manner that would ensure equal opportunity as between them. Cubic Transportation also concerned competing tenderers.</text>
