<tocase>FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1981/27.html</AustLII>
<text>Section 175 provides: 
 
 
 " 175 The validity of any assessment shall not be affected by reason that any of the provisions of this Act have not been complied with." 
 
 

This section requires there to be an actual assessment as a condition of its operation: FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360. It does not create a valid assessment where none has been made at all.

A taxpayer dissatisfied with an assessment may object against it in the manner set out in Part IVC of the TAA.

Section 177(1) in turn provides: 
 
 
 
 " 177(1) The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, shall be conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct."

At [61]ff Kenny J rejected the submission that the assessment was provisional or tentative. In so doing she reviewed the decisions of the High Court in Hoffnung, Bloemen and Richard Walter . Her Honour noted (at [63]) that in Bloemen : 
 
 "Mason and Wilson JJ, with whom Stephen J agreed, said (at 378): 
 
 The Bloemen notice of assessment is in form an assessment. It sets out the ascertainment of the taxpayer's taxable income and the tax payable thereon. It is therefore appropriate to bring s 177(1) into operation. Its production will put beyond contention the due making of the assessment so that the Court cannot find that no assessment was made or that, if made, it was made for an inadmissible purpose. 
 
 The Simons notice, if read with the adjustment sheet, is more debatable. However, we read it as a definitive assessment by the Commissioner intended to create a legal liability to pay the tax specified, coupled with an intimation that the Commissioner will review the taxpayer's liability in a certain event. If it be assumed that the Commissioner lacks power to amend the assessment in the circumstances contemplated this does not affect our conclusion. It merely means that the Commissioner is mistaken in supposing that he has power to review. Accordingly, the notice of assessment will, on production, bring s 177(1) into play."

I equally am satisfied that the assessment was intended to, and did, create a definitive liability notwithstanding that the Commissioner has acknowledged that Futuris' liability could be reviewed at a future date after the Division 19A Part IVC proceedings were complete: cf Bloemen , above at 377-378; ANZ Banking Group , at [70].

As I earlier indicated, notwithstanding the different factual settings of this matter and ANZ Banking Group , I consider there is no operative distinction in principle between the two cases. For this reason I have not analysed the relevant case law in a way that I would otherwise have done. I respectfully agree with Kenny J's analysis. Its application to the facts of this case leads necessarily to the conclusion that the Second Amended Assessment attracts the protection of s 175 and s 177(1) of the ITAA. Accordingly, such relief as Futuris is entitled to in respect of that assessment is in Part IVC proceedings and not by way of judicial review under s 39B of the Judiciary Act .

Having dealt with the application on its merits, I will make no order on the Commissioner's notice of motion but will order that the application be dismissed with costs. 


 I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn.

<tocase>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1410 ; (2003) 137 FCR 1</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/1410.html</AustLII>
<text>(iii) An internal ATO email of 6 May 2004 responding to a Part IVA paper relating to Futuris commented of a paragraph in the position paper: 
 
 "4. PARAGRAPH 4.2 
 
 
 
 In my opinion, this is one of the two matters covered in the response which is truly relevant to the argument of whether $82,950,088 should be included, under Part IVA , in Futuris' assessable income for the 1998 year of income in respect of the scheme defined in the Position Paper. 
 
 At the Part IVA Panel meeting of 3 December 2003, the matter covered by this paragraph was raised with the Panel. The Panel advised the assessment should be made on the full amount of $82,950,088 and, depending on the outcome of the Division 19A issue, a compensating adjustment can be made at a later stage if necessary. No doubt the Panel came to this view in order to 'protect the Revenue'. 
 
 In my opinion, a recent Federal Court case, Australian &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1410 , is relevant here. In that case, pursuant to section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 , the taxpayer contended that amended assessments that issued as a result of the application of Part IVA were invalid assessments because each of the amended assessments included an amount that had already been returned by the taxpayer as assessable income. The Court found against the taxpayer. I must point out that this decision is subject to appeal."

(iv) A document entitled "Reasons for Decision" of 20 August 2004 noted: 
 
 
 "9. Thus, in the absence of the First Scheme, immediately after the Bristile shares were transferred from Vockbay to Walshville, the indexed cost base of the Walshville shares to Futuris would probably have been $2. Consequently, I consider that as a result of the First Scheme being carried out, the indexed cost base of the Walshville shares to Futuris was increased by $82,950,088 (following the Division 19A adjustment) from $2 to $82,950,090 (for the purpose of this and the following paragraph, I am ignoring the $19,950,088 possible error in regard to the capital gain returned by Futuris on the float of Walshville that is now subject to appeal. This is in line with the recommendation made by the Part IVA Panel at its meeting of 3 December 2003 refer to para. 34 below)." 
 
 
 

The par 34 referred to reflects the email comment in (iii) above though with the additional observation:
 
 "Obviously, we will not pursue recovery for both amounts of tax, penalty and 170AA interest/general interest charge involved with the two $19,950,088 adjustments." 
 

The "Reasons" went on to consider the making of a compensating adjustment under s 177F(3) if a Part IVA assessment was issued for the full amount of $82,950,088 even though the First Amended Assessment included the $19,950,088. It noted: 
 
 "The Panel recommended that the Part IVA assessment should be made on the full amount of $82,950,088 and, depending on the ultimate outcome of the Division 19A issue, a compensating adjustment can be made if necessary. No doubt, the Panel came to this decision to protect the Revenue. 
 
 If, as I recommend, an amended assessment issues including an amount under Part IVA of $82,950,088, then obviously we would only pursue payment of the tax, penalty and 170AA interest/general interest charge involved with one of the two $19,950,088 adjustments. Futuris has already paid half of the tax, penalty and 170AA interest/general interest charge involved with the $19,950,088 Division 19A adjustment. The Division 19A amended assessment is currently subject to appeal..."

(v) Comments reflecting those in the above "Reasons" were repeated in a document entitled "ATO Final Audit Report" with the following recommendations being made that the Commissioner: 
 
 
 "(a) determine under subsection 177F(1) that $82,950,090 be included in the assessable income of Futuris for the 1998 year of income; 
 
 (b) determine under subsection 177F(2) that $82,950,090 be deemed to be included in the assessable income of Futuris for the 1998 year of income under subsection 160ZO(1); and 
 
 (c) at this stage does not determine under subsection 177F(3) that any compensating adjustments be made to the assessable income of Futuris for the 1998 year of income any such determination/s should be made when the Part IVA and Division 19A matters have been finalised."

I would note in passing that the making of a s 177F(1) determination forms part of the "making of an assessment" for the purposes of s 177(1) of the Act: see Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 1410 ; (2003) 137 FCR 1 at [32] (" ANZ Banking Group ").

I would also note that the Notices of the First Amended Assessment and of the Second Amended Assessment have been produced in this proceeding.</text>

<tocase>Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) ACT 4247</tocase>
<text>There is a voluminous body of case law on the interpretation and effect of s 175 and s 177. For present purposes it is sufficient to say that the protection of s 177(1) and s 175 will be lost (a) if the Commissioner has not made a bona fide attempt to exercise the power of assessment; or (ii) if the alleged "assessment" is tentative or provisional in that it does not create a definitive liability: see e.g. Briglia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2000) ACT 4247 at 4249 where many of the cases relied upon in the present proceeding are referred to; see also ANZ Banking Group , at [33]-[37].

It is unnecessary here to repeat what has earlier been said about Div 19A of Pt IIIA of the ITAA other than to reiterate that it provides for the working out of capital gains and losses where assets have been transferred between companies under common ownership.

Part IVA of the ITAA is an anti-avoidance regime introduced into the Act in 1981. It is brought into operation upon the making of a determination by the Commissioner pursuant to s 177F of the Act. That section provides the Commissioner with a discretion to cancel a tax benefit where such a benefit has been, or would but for the section be, obtained in connection with a scheme to which the Part applies. It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the scheme that the Commissioner was satisfied existed relating to the Walshville float, although I would note that, in the Commissioner's view, it involved both declarations of dividends by Bristile and Vockbay and the capitalisation of debts owed to Vockbay and Futuris respectively following those declarations of dividend.</text>

<tocase>Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2003/2.html</AustLII>
<text>Futuris' contentions are premised on the uncontroversial proposition in Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [57] that: 
 
 "... a privative clause cannot protect against a failure to make a decision required by the legislation in which that clause is found or against a decision which, on its face, exceeds jurisdiction."

From the Commissioner's discovered documents set out in part earlier it is contended that it is clear that the Commissioner incorrectly formed the view: 
 
 (a) that he was entitled to calculate the taxable income by aggregating the amounts of $19,950,088 and $82,950,090 and thus by purporting in effect to reduce the cost base by the aggregate amount of $102,900,178, whereas Futuris had only ever treated the provisions of Division 19A as increasing cost base by the amount of $82,950,090; 
 (b) that he was entitled to calculate the taxable income of Futuris in an amount which was $102,900,178 greater than the taxable income as calculated under the Original Assessment notwithstanding that such taxable income was $19,950,088 greater than the highest amount of the taxable income which the Commissioner contended to be the taxable income on which tax should be paid for the 1998 year; 
 (c) that he would, if his views in relation to the operation of Division 19A proved to be correct, at some future time make a compensating adjustment pursuant to s 177F(3) presumably for the purpose of reducing the taxable income by an amount of $19,950,088 (although the amount of any future contemplated compensating adjustment was not identified).

The Commissioner therefore took the view that he was entitled to overstate the taxable income in making the Second Amended Assessment because it could subsequently be reduced pursuant to a compensating adjustment under s 177F(3) when such was not the case. In this, it is said, the ANZ Banking Group case (outlined below) was distinguishable.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/94.html</AustLII>
<text>The case against the Commissioner, it is said, is (at its absolute highest) that the Commissioner misconstrued the terms of s 177F(1). Futuris maintains, presumably, that the Commissioner could have given effect to the inclusion of the whole of the $82,950,090 tax benefit sought to be cancelled by adding only $63,000,002 to the first amended assessment. To this the Commissioner says: 

(a) an erroneous view of the terms of s 177F(1) does not amount to bad faith; 
 
 (b) the fact that he might have achieved his result through an alternative means does not mean that the construction acted upon was not open to him. The Commissioner has a discretion either to include only part of a tax benefit under s 177F(1) or to include the whole of the amount and, at some time thereafter, to make a compensating adjustment under s 177F(3): Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211 at [114] and [115]; ANZ Banking Group at [48], [49], [57], [73]; Asiamet (No 1) Resources Pty Ltd v Commissioner [2003] FCA 35 ; (2003) 126 FCR 304 at 340.</text>

Her Honour rejected the view that in every case the Commissioner was obliged to make a determination under s 177F(3) at the same time as he made a s 177F(1) determination or, in any case, prior to issuing any assessment to give effect to the s 177F(1) determination.

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1</tocase>
<text>Her Honour rejected the view that in every case the Commissioner was obliged to make a determination under s 177F(3) at the same time as he made a s 177F(1) determination or, in any case, prior to issuing any assessment to give effect to the s 177F(1) determination. She rejected the submission that Hill J had held to the contrary in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 at 16-18. That submission would furthermore, in her Honour's view, be at odds with the Full Court decision in Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 19 FCR 442. In any event, Kenny J accepted the view of Emmett J in Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1999) 43 ATR 375 at [40] and in Asiamet (No 1) Resources, above, that the Commissioner may defer exercising his discretion until the outcome of a Part IVC decision is known.

Kenny J concluded on this issue at [69]-[70]: 
 
 "In this case, the Commissioner apparently considers that, depending upon the outcome of the Pt IVC proceeding and the objection process, it may well be appropriate for him to issue a further amended assessment, in consequence of the need to make a compensatory adjustment or otherwise to give effect to the decision of the Court. It does not follow from this, however, that the amended assessment is tentative or provisional in the Hoffnung sense. To adopt what Hill J said in McCleary at 322: 
 
 
 
 In summary, it can be said that the conclusion that an assessment is tentative will ordinarily emerge from an examination of the assessment itself, as in Hoffnung . The mere indication that an assessment will be reviewed later does not require the conclusion that the assessment is tentative ... Nor will an assessment be regarded as tentative in the relevant sense, even if two assessments have been issued to different taxpayers concerning the same income with the consequence that one of them must necessarily be reduced to nil: Richard Walter . Provided the notice of assessment purports to create a definitive liability and at least there is no evidence to the contrary, the assessment will not be tentative . 
 (Emphasis in original) 
 
 
 
 In the present case, the evidence falls short of demonstrating that the amended assessment in question was tentative or provisional. It is not to be treated as tentative, simply because officers of the Commissioner contemplated that it might be the subject of a compensatory adjustment in the future, or may not entirely survive a proceeding under Pt IVC."

Finally, her Honour acquitted the Commissioner of bad faith, no concession having been made that he assessed the Bank on facts known to be wrong. She went on to observe (at [73]): 
 
 "But even on the assumption that the Commissioner knew that he might have proceeded in error and that ANZ might succeed in the Pt IVC proceeding in showing the amended assessment is excessive, I would not infer bad faith on the Commissioner's part. Even if the Commissioner's approach is erroneous, I accept that, for the reasons given by his counsel, it would be open to the Commissioner to take the view that his approach is necessary to protect the revenue and that any unfairness to ANZ can be remedied at the end of the objection, review and appeal processes." (Emphasis in original)

As I earlier indicated, Futuris has submitted that ANZ Banking Group is distinguishable; s 177F(3) cannot be relied upon by the Commissioner in the present matter to correct the figures stated in the Second Amended Assessment; and that the Commissioner deliberately stated amounts in that assessment which he knew to be incorrect.

Futuris accepts that in ANZ Banking Group , s 177F(3)(a) clearly authorised the making of a compensation adjustment for the reason that it was the implementation of the scheme in that case which led to the inclusion in the Bank's assessable income of the amount of $29 million pursuant to s 25(1).

The Commissioner's contention, it is said, is that for s 177F(3) purposes the amount of $19,950,088 which was included in the First Amended Assessment would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Part IVA scheme had not been carried out. Of this, Futuris submits that: 
 
 
 "53. The difficulty which the Commissioner's view encounters is that he contends that the Pt IVA 'scheme' comprised those events which increased the cost base of the Walshville shares by the amount of $82,950,088 by a transaction which attracted the operation of the anti-avoidance provisions of Division 19A. In essence, the Commissioner characterises the Pt IVA scheme as a scheme to obtain a cost base transfer in the amount of $82,950,088, thus increasing the cost base of the Walshville shares by that amount, and reducing the net capital gain by the same amount. 
 
 54. Consequently the effect of the two amended assessments may be summarised as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) by the First Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends that the 'scheme' had the consequence that Division 19A operated to increase the cost base of the Bristile shares by an amount of only $63M that is, $19,950,088 less than Futuris contends; and 
 
 (b) by the Second Amended Assessment the Commissioner contends, in the alternative, that Pt IVA operated effectively to eliminate the entire cost base transfer of $82,950,088 contended for by Futuris. 
 
 
 
 
 
 55. Thus it can be seen that the Commissioner's contentions are truly alternative in respect of the amount of $19,950,088. With respect to that amount, the Commissioner relies on one or other of Division 19A or Pt IVA but not both. 
 
 56. Returning to address the potential application of s 177F(3)(a), the Commissioner was incorrect on the view that it would supply a basis for making a ' compensating adjustment '. Paragraph 177F(3)(a) could only apply if 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the First Amended Assessment reflects the inclusion of a net capital gain in the assessable income of Futuris; and 
 
 (b) that net capital gain would not have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the Pt IVA scheme had not been carried out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 57. However, the Commissioner's contention is in fact to the opposite effect. The Commissioner contends that the amount of $19,950,088 would have been included in the assessable income of Futuris if the scheme had not been carried out. He has assessed under Pt IVA on the contention that, but for the scheme, the amount of $82,950,088 would have been included in the assessable income of Futuris."

The Commissioner's response to this is that the present matter is relevantly indistinguishable from ANZ Banking Group . In that case, by virtue of the scheme, $29 million was included in the taxpayers' assessable income irrespective of Part IVA , in consequence of s 25(1) of the ITAA. Here, by virtue of the scheme, approximately $19 million was included in Futuris' assessable income, irrespective of Part IVA , in consequence of Division 19A. In ANZ Banking Group the tax benefit for s 177F(1) and s 177C(1)(a) purposes was the $65 million; here, it was $82 million. If the scheme in ANZ Banking Group had not been carried out, the $29 million would not have been included in the Bank's assessable income; here if the Walshville float scheme had not been carried out, $19 million as assessed would not have been included in Futuris' assessable income. There is simply no reason, it is said, to give s 177F(3) the construction contended for by Futuris. In the Commissioner's view, both ANZ Banking Group and the present matter have alternative bases for including the erroneously described double sums in the respective taxpayer's assessable income. However, the Commissioner goes on to say that, given the present uncertainty as to how the $19 million was calculated, it may be that the two bases may in fact be found in this case to be cumulative. The Part IVC proceedings in relation to the First Amended Assessment will clarify that situation.

For my own part, I agree with the Commissioner's submission. The present matter is one which falls naturally within both the language and the evident purpose of s 177F(3). But even if I am wrong in this, I equally am satisfied that at best all that Futuris has shown is that in making a definitive assessment (i.e. the Second Amended Assessment) see below the Commissioner proceeded upon a mistaken view of the applicability of s 177F(3). That mistake did not invalidate the assessment or evidence bad faith on the Commissioner's part in the exercise of the power to assess. The effect of the mistake could, and should properly, be addressed in Part IVC proceedings.

On the material before the Court I am not satisfied that the Commissioner deliberately engaged in what the applicant calls double counting. When the Part IVA determinations were made the Commissioner could then have made a s 177F(1) determination to include only part of the tax benefit in Futuris' assessable income (i.e. $82 million - $19 million). Rather, in view of the facts as he then understood them to be, he chose to include the totality of the benefit in the knowledge that there was some likelihood of the need later to make a compensating adjustment. This was a course he was entitled to take in the circumstances given that (a) the Division 19A proceedings in respect of the First Amended Assessment had not been determined; (b) there was uncertainty about how the $19 million was calculated in any event; and (c) his view that there was a need to protect the revenue by making the Second Amended Assessment as he did. The Commissioner was, in the circumstances, entitled to defer making a compensation adjustment: see ANZ Banking Group .</text>

<tocase>Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 19 FCR 442</tocase>
<text>Her Honour rejected the view that in every case the Commissioner was obliged to make a determination under s 177F(3) at the same time as he made a s 177F(1) determination or, in any case, prior to issuing any assessment to give effect to the s 177F(1) determination. She rejected the submission that Hill J had held to the contrary in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Jackson (1990) 27 FCR 1 at 16-18. That submission would furthermore, in her Honour's view, be at odds with the Full Court decision in Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1988) 19 FCR 442. In any event, Kenny J accepted the view of Emmett J in Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1999) 43 ATR 375 at [40] and in Asiamet (No 1) Resources, above, that the Commissioner may defer exercising his discretion until the outcome of a Part IVC decision is known.</text>
