<tocase>Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1981) 159 CLR 550</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1985/81.html</AustLII>
<text>23 Mr Rivera relies upon the well-known statement of principle of Mason J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1981) 159 CLR 550 at 587. His Honour there stated that if a decision-maker intends to reject the application by reference to some consideration personal to the applicant on the basis of information obtained from another source which has not been dealt with by an applicant, there may be a case for saying that procedural fairness requires he be given an opportunity to respond.

24 However, the substance of Mr Rivera's complaint under this ground is that there were matters passing between the Department of Corrective Services ("the DCS") and the Commission of which Mr Rivera was not on notice. He submitted that it is to be inferred from the fax of 30 August 2007 that there must have been other communications between the DCS and the Commission, possibly oral communications of which Mr Rivera was not aware.

25 The short answer to this ground is that Mr Rivera was well on notice of the critical issue or factor on which the decision of 13 September 2007 turned. He was informed in the letter of 30 May 2007 that the President may decline to continue the inquiry if the President were to form the opinion that a more appropriate remedy was available in civil litigation seeking damages.</text>
