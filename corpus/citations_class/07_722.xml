<text>331 The statutory duties owed by the first respondent are in addition to the common law and fiduciary duties which rest upon a company's officers. The first respondent owed corresponding fiduciary duties to those of his statutory duties. He also owed fiduciary duties: (a) not to prefer his own interests to those of the applicant; (b) to act with reasonable care in the discharge of his duties as a company secretary; and (c) not to place himself in a position where his duty to the applicant conflicted with his own self-interest or where there was a possibility of such a conflict arising: Bordman v Phipps [1966] UKHL 2 ; [1967] 2 AC 46 at 123; Chan v Zacharia [1984] HCA 36 ; (1984) 154 CLR 178 at 198.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1977/40.html</AustLII>
<text>393 However, in case I am wrong, I should address the contention. In BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings [1977] HCA 40 ; (1977) 180 CLR 266, a majority of their Lordships in the Privy Council said in their view, for a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied:
 
 '(1) it must be reasonable and equitable; 
 
 
 
 (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; 
 
 (3) it must be so obvious that "it goes without saying"; 
 
 (4) it must be capable of clear expression; 
 
 (5) it must not contradict any express terms of the contract.'

<tocase>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company Limited v New Garage and Motor Company Limited [1915] AC 79</tocase>
<text>439 In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company Limited v New Garage and Motor Company Limited [1915] AC 79 at 86-87, Lord Dunedin said:
 
 '3. The question whether a sum stipulated is penalty or liquidated damages is a question of construction to be decided upon the terms and inherent circumstances of each particular contract, judged of as at the time of the making of the contract, not as at the time of the breach ...'

440 Lord Dunedin said in relation to the task of construction (at 87):
 
 ' 4. To assist this task of construction various tests have been suggested, which if applicable to the case under consideration may prove helpful, or even conclusive. Such are: 
 
 (a) It will be held to be penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach. ... 
 
 (b) It will be held to be a penalty if the breach consists only in not paying a sum of money, and the sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum which ought to have been paid ... 
 
 (c) There is a presumption (but no more) that it is penalty when "a single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which may occasion serious and others but trifling damage" ...'</text>

<tocase>HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Company [2001] 2 Lloyd's Report 161 </tocase>
<text>387 The Heads of Agreement entered into on 13 October provided that the 'Free Carry Shares' were only to be issued so long as the respondents 'continue to be employed by (the applicant)': clause 5(g). The shareholders agreement also contemplated that the respondents had to achieve the performance criteria themselves so as to be entitled to the issue of the shares under that agreement. In my opinion, regard can be had to those two previous transactions to discern the objective intention of the parties in relation to the circular resolution: HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Company [2001] 2 Lloyd's Report 161 at [83].

388 The very purpose of performance shares, in my opinion, is to induce the person to whom the shares are given to perform. That was the purpose for their issue in this case because it was important for the applicant to have those who had the responsibility of managing the applicant achieve the performance criteria. The performance shares were issued with the objective intention that the performance criteria in the performance shares would be met by the holders of the performance shares themselves. That means that the respondents had to cause the applicant to achieve the performance milestones.

389 It was contended by the applicant that the respondents had to raise capital with ANZIS in accordance with ANZIS' offer of 29 November 2004 because that transaction was later embodied in the subscription agreement. Because that particular capital raising did not occur, then that criteria was not achieved. I do not think that the circular resolution necessarily obliged the respondents to raise capital only in accordance with ANZIS' offer of 29 November 2004. I think the criterion that needed to be met was to raise sufficient capital so as to allow the second criterion also to be met. It did not need to be with ANZIS or, if it was with ANZIS, it did not need to be only in the terms of the offer made on 29 November 2004. It was only necessary that the respondents raised sufficient capital to allow the second criterion to be met. In any event, that does not weaken the applicant's case because, whatever the criterion was, it was not met by either or both the respondents.

390 In my opinion, the first respondent is not entitled to claim that the performance shares converted to B Class shares after the applicant satisfied the performance criteria in the circular resolution under its new management.

391 It follows that if I am wrong about my conclusion that the resolution contained in the circular resolution should be rescinded and the issue of the performance shares set aside and the first respondent is entitled to the performance shares, the first respondent will never be entitled to have those shares convert to B Class shares because he and the second respondent did not satisfy the performance criteria.</text>

<tocase>Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 702</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2003/581.html</AustLII>
<text>359 Section 1322 is a remedial provision and should be given a liberal interpretation: Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 702. The power to validate given in s 1322 and s 254E must be exercised by reference to the purposes of the sections in the Corporations Act .

360 The purpose of s 1322 is to empower the Court to relieve a company of the consequences of non-compliance with a proceeding under the Corporations Act . It allows the Court to make orders to validate procedures or transactions where there has been non-compliance with a provision of the Corporations Act . The power is to be exercised in favour of the company unless, in the case of s 1322(2) , the irregularity which is the subject matter of the application has caused or may cause substantial injustice but cannot be remedied by any order of the Court.</text>

<tocase>Re Wave Capital (2004) 47 ACSR 418</tocase>
<text>369 Whilst s 254E is silent on the question of substantial injustice, in my opinion, no order would be made under s 254E unless the applicant could show that no injustice would be caused to any other party. In Re Wave Capital (2004) 47 ACSR 418 at [29], French J said:
 
 'Like the discretion to validate invalid share issues under s 254E , the power conferred by s 1322 must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act and any other relevant statutes whose application may be in issue. It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions. Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief: Re Onslow Salt Pty Ltd (2003) 198 ALR 344; 45 ACSR 322 and cases there cited.'</text>

<tocase>Re Westpac Banking Corporation (ACN 33 007 457 141) and Others (2004) 53 ACSR 288</tocase>
<text>370 No order can be made under s 1322(4)(a) unless the party applying can satisfy paragraphs (a) and (c) of s 1322(6). The matters in s 1322(6)(a) are disjunctive: Re Westpac Banking Corporation (ACN 33 007 457 141) and Others (2004) 53 ACSR 288. It was contended by the applicant that such an order would not be made because the first respondent has not discharged his obligation of establishing that a validation order would be unlikely to result in a substantial injustice to any person.

371 It was contended that the applicant had given as its particular in its plea in paragraph 4E.2 and paragraph 4EE that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person; that the applicant had approved the issue of performance shares on terms no more favourable in the shareholders agreement; and that thereafter any person who had acquired shares did so with knowledge of the agreement to issue those shares. For the reasons already given, that particular has not been made out. The performance shares in the circular resolution were to issue on more favourable terms to the respondents than the performance shares contemplated in the shareholders agreement.

372 The applicant pleaded in reply to the first respondent's defence that the failure to comply with s 246B of the Corporations Act has resulted in substantial injustice in that the applicant's shareholders would have or may have refused to approve the issue of the performance shares. No other particular of any substantial injustice is given by the applicant in that pleading.</text>

<text>441 Lord Dunedin's speech was recently followed in the High Court in Ring Row Pty Ltd v BP Australia Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 71 ; (2005) 222 ALR 306, subject to the caveat at 309.

442 At the time that the Executive Service Agreement was entered into the first respondent was a chartered accountant in full-time employment which was apparently available to him for the foreseeable future.

443 The applicant was liable under clause 13.1(b) of the Executive Service Agreement to pay the full amount of the first respondent's remuneration package unless the contract of employment was terminated for illness, poor performance, including summary termination, or if the company ceased to trade.</text>
