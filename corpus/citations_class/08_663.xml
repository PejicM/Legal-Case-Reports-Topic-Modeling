<text>14 If only out of an abundance of caution, I have also expressly considered the pre-hearing steps that were taken by the Tribunal. The following passage from the joint judgment of Sundberg and Hely JJ in VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407 , with which Gyles J relevantly agreed, is apt. I am reading from paras 15 and 16:
 The Tribunal invited the appellants to appear to give evidence and present arguments. The invitation and the notice of the time and place of the hearing were embodied in the one document, as ss 425 and 425A contemplate. . . . They were sent to the appellants' address for service at their last residential address appearing on their application for review. By force of s 441C(4) they are taken to have received the document seven working days after the date it bears. As the primary judge said, the fact that they did not become aware of the invitation does not displace the effect of s 441C. . . . s 426A empowered the Tribunal to decide the review in the absence of the appellants and without taking any further action to allow or enable them to appear before it.

15 Their Honours continued, speaking of s 420 of the Migration Act :
 That section requires the Tribunal to pursue the objectives of providing a fair and just mechanism of review, and to act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. Part 7 of the Act (in which ss 420 , 425A , 426A , 441A and 441C appear) must be read as a whole. Sections 425A , 426A , 441A and 441C are specific provisions qualifying the general provisions of s 420. The scheme they involve expressly contemplates that, in particular circumstances, an applicant will not attend a hearing, including cases involving no fault of the applicant. Notwithstanding that, the Tribunal is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant's absence.

16 That is what occurred in this instance. I am satisfied that the invitation to comment letter sent by the Tribunal met the requirements of s 424A of the Migration Act . I am also satisfied that the Tribunal sent, in good time, and in the form and manner required by the Migration Act , an invitation to attend a hearing.

17 As to the merits of the appeal itself, they amount, in essence, to a contention that the appeal should be allowed because the Federal Magistrate failed to find jurisdictional error on one or more of the grounds of appeal specified.

18 In respect of the first ground it is abundantly clear from the reasons of the Tribunal that the Tribunal expressly considered the risk which the Appellant might face were she to be returned to China. It just so happens that the Tribunal was not satisfied that such a risk was presented. The Tribunal was not obliged to act just upon the statement which the Appellant had annexed to her review application, or to accept it uncritically. The same applies to the appeal ground which alleges that the Tribunal failed to accept that the Appellant is a Falun Gong practitioner.</text>
