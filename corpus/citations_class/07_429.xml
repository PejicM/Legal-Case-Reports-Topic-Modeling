<text>21 It is well understood that the discretion given by O 9 r 1 imposes no threshold requirement, for example, the demonstration of special or exceptional circumstances. Nonetheless the discretion must be exercised in accordance with judicial principle in light of the evident expectation of the rule that ordinarily a corporation will be required to be represented by a solicitor: see Termi-Mesh Australia Pty Ltd v Josu Manufacturing Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1241. In the present matter Mr Jorgensen was informed of what was expected of Dynacast before consideration would be given to his representation of it. It, or he, I know not which, chose not to take the course indicated. Hence I refused his application.

22 These now relate only to the Phoneflasher Co and can be dealt with compositely. They provide respectively:
 
 " First Charge 
 
 
 
 14. Order 3 of the orders required the First Respondent to provide a corrective notice and letter, in the terms specified by the order, to all retail outlets to which the First Respondent had distributed the Phoneflasher , within 30 days of the date of the orders. 
 
 15. The date by which the First Respondent was to have complied with order 3 of the orders was 2 December 2004. 
 
 16. The First Respondent has not to the date of this Statement of Charge, supplied the corrective notice and letters in the terms specified by order 3 of the orders, to all the retail outlets to which it had distributed the Phoneflasher.
 
 17. The First Respondent has committed a contempt of court as it has failed or refused to comply with order 3 of the orders to provide by 2 December 2004 all retail outlets to which it distributed the Phoneflasher a corrective notice and letter in the terms specified by order 3.
 
 ...
 
 Second Charge 
 
 21. Order 4 of the orders required the First Respondent to provide to the Applicant within 35 days of 2 November 2004 a list of names and addresses of retail outlets to which it had provided the corrective notice and letter in accordance with order 3 of the orders.
 
 22. The date by which the First Respondent was to have complied with order 4 of the orders was 7 December 2004.

23. The First respondent did not supply to the Applicant a list of names and addresses of the retail outlets to which it had provided the corrective notice and letter by 7 December 2004.</text>

<text>25 It is well accepted that strict compliance with the terms of mandatory orders, such as Order 3 and 4 of the consent orders in this matter, is required of the party to whom they are addressed.

26 In the quotation above of the first charge I have highlighted the words "all retail outlets to which [Phoneflasher Co] had distributed the Phoneflasher". I have done so because there is an issue as to the proper construction of the order: on construction see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd, at [19] ff. The ACCC has tendered evidence taken from the phoneflasher website which indicated that (i) on 6 January 2003, the number of retail outlets in Australia listed as having Phoneflashers available for sale, was 157; and (ii) on 3 March 2005, the website listed more than 350 such retail suppliers. Order 4 of the consent orders required the company to provide the ACCC with the required names and address of the retail outlets to which it had provided corrective signs and letters on or before 7 December 2004. No such names were by then provided. Letters informing the respondent of the breach were sent to Phoneflasher Co's solicitors and to Mr Jorgensen.

27 An ACCC officer in late December 2004 observed a Phoneflasher display stand in an Adelaide retail centre. On speaking to the manager she was informed that the manager had not received the notice required to be sent in the order.

28 On 27 January 2005, a letter from the company's lawyers was received by the lawyer for the ACCC. It enclosed a letter from Mr Kerville of 23 January 2005 which stated that (i) "the company ceased trading over 18 months ago and there are few customers on the books"; (ii) the person "who took over the distribution at that time has also since ceased trading"; and (iii) the ACCC notices had been sent "to prior Phoneflasher customers shown on the attached list". That list contained eight names and addresses.</text>

72 For all practical purposes relating to the principal proceedings (the only known matter of continuing significance to the company), Mr Jorgensen presumed, without apparent let or hindrance of Mr Kerville, to act as the company's mind and will notwithstanding that he was not at the time a person who had been appointed to the position of director. I emphasize in this the importance of the matter to the company: cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Austin (1998) 28 ACSR 565 at 570; the strategic nature of the intervention being made by Mr Jorgensen in the company's affairs; cf Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd , at 52-53; and his apparent real influence in the affairs of the company. I should add that, while Mr Jorgensen is referred to in a website extract of 28 August 2005 a "Director" in China, I do not consider that this advances the matter. That reference could well be to a position he held in Shanghai Connexion.com Co Ltd.</text>

<text>83 As to the first and second of the charges, the company made no apparent attempts to comply with the orders in the times respectively prescribed for compliance. It was only in response to communications from the ACCC that steps were taken in purported compliance with the order. These steps as I have found did not remedy the non-compliance. I am satisfied that the company was indifferent to the obligation imposed on it by the orders and acted, and has continued to act, accordingly up until the time of these proceedings. There has been nothing "casual, accidental or unintentional" about its non-compliance with Orders 3 and 4, rather there has been "wilful disobedience": Australian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 112-113. The company has offered no explanation for its conduct. Indeed its indifference to the matter has been reflected in the approach it has taken to the present proceedings. It needs to be made aware of the seriousness of its conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at [139] , [144].

84 The only penalty sought by the ACCC is the imposition of a fine. There is no doubting the Court's power to impose such a penalty: see Info4PC.com Pty Ltd at [138]. In deciding an appropriate amount for a fine, the Court ordinarily will take into account the contemnor's financial means: Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1. I am unable to do so in this case as no proper evidence has been put before me on this matter. However I have no reason to believe that the company has significant assets.</text>

<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/federal_ct/2006/695.html</AustLII>
<text>87 It is said commonly that the power to impose penalties in cases of civil contempt is to be exercised so as both to ensure that orders are complied with and to deter conduct in contravention of court orders: see e.g. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 2) [2006] FCA 695 at [57] . In the present matter it is the second of these purposes that is of present significance: on this duality in cases of civil contempt see generally Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt 3-6 ff. It in turn must be viewed in a context in which the principal proceedings brought by the ACCC was to protect the public interest: see generally Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd [2000] HCA 11 ; (1999) 200 CLR 591.

89 The ACCC has sought an award of costs on an indemnity basis. Costs can be awarded on such a basis where it is warranted by the interests of justice. This is commonly found to be so in contempt cases where such proceedings have had to be brought after judgment to vindicate the authority of the Court and to uphold the public interest in the administration of justice: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Business Reports Pty Ltd (1997) 19 ATPR 41-577 at 44,010; Contact Plus Group Pty Ltd (in liq) at [67] ff. Such is particularly the case where the proceedings have been brought by the ACCC in prosecution of its charter to act in the public interest: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Globex Systems Pty Ltd (2005) 27 ATPR 42-069 at 43,105.</text>
