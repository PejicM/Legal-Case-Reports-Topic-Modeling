<text>First, a full search of Westport's records has been undertaken. Westport has no means of compelling brokers/agents to conduct searches on its behalf. Westport has done all that is within its power, and is confident that it has identified every policyholder contained within its own records. The diligence of the search that has been undertaken is a consideration relevant to the decision whether or not to grant a dispensation: Calliden Group Limited in the matter of Calliden Group Limited [2007] FCA 2019 ( Calliden Group Limited ) at [62].

Second, the evidence is that the direct policyholders who have not been identified are unlikely ever to make a claim. The policies that they hold are short-tail in nature, and it can be assumed that any claim would have been notified by now. The chance of the unidentified policyholders being affected by the scheme in reality, as distinct from theoretically, is therefore low.

Re Insurance Australia Ltd involved the transfer of a portfolio of 72,500 compulsory third party motor accident insurance policies. I noted that, given the length of time since the expiration of the last period of insurance, it was unlikely that many further claims would be made. I considered that it would be "excessive" to require notice to be given to all 72,500 policyholders, and required that notice only be given to those policyholders in respect of whose policies there was a notified claim that was unsettled or was otherwise outstanding: see [26]-[27]. See also Calliden Group Limited at [62].

The fact that additional steps will be taken to draw the scheme to the attention of the affected policyholders (see [33]-[36] above) has been held to be a factor favouring the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or the equivalent provision of the Life Insurance Act 1995 ) in several cases, including GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd at [18], Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5], and Calliden Group Limited at [62].

Fourth, the proposed scheme is an "intra-group" scheme, that is to say, the policies are being transferred not from one corporate group to another, but within the Swiss Re group. Because the transfer will not involve any real change in the practices and "culture" of the insurer, there seems to be a reduced imperative for notification. This consideration has been relied upon as supporting the granting of a dispensation: MMIA Pty Limited and QBE Insurance (Australia) Limited [2008] FCA 1239 at [24] ; Calliden Group Limited at [62].

Fifth, APRA does not oppose the making of the order. The fact that APRA, which is charged with the responsibility of protecting the interests of policyholders, has raised no objection has been said to be a matter in favour of a dispensation: see, eg Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5]; Calliden Group Limited at [62].</text>

<text>The Court has said that the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or its analogue in the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth), s 191(5)) is a "matter of considerable importance and should not be regarded as a matter of course": Munich Reinsurance Company of Australasia Limited [2004] FCA 1391 at [4] , per Tamberlin J. See also Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618 ( Challenger Life Limited ) at [2]-[3], per Gyles J. This is because, as Sackville J stated in The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd &amp; Anor [2003] FCA 501 ( Commonwealth Life Ltd ) at [8]: 
 
 Clearly enough, the policy underlying the statutory requirement ... is to give every affected policyholder a summary of the scheme and, an opportunity, if he or she so desires, to make submissions to the Court in respect of any application for confirmation of the scheme. A right to be heard in relation to a proposed scheme may be of little value if a person does not know of the proposal.

The fact that additional steps will be taken to draw the scheme to the attention of the affected policyholders (see [33]-[36] above) has been held to be a factor favouring the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or the equivalent provision of the Life Insurance Act 1995 ) in several cases, including GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd at [18], Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5], and Calliden Group Limited at [62].

<text>In In the matter of GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd and AMP Life Ltd [2000] FCA 1871 ( GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd ), Emmett J noted (at [16]-[18]) that, despite certain steps being taken to keep track of policyholders, the company did not have a current address for all its policyholders. His Honour observed that a notice of intention to make the application had been published in newspapers in all States and Territories, and that the notice included a telephone number by which policyholders could make enquiries and request copies of the scheme summary documents free of charge. Given the steps that the company had taken to locate its policyholders, and the alternative steps that the company had taken to draw the scheme to their attention, his Honour considered it appropriate to dispense with compliance with s 191(2)(c) of the Life Insurance Act 1995 : see [19].</text>

<tocase>Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2004/524.html</AustLII>
<text>The term "affected policyholder" is defined in s 17C(1) of the Act as "the holder of a policy affected by the scheme". In Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 ( Re Insurance Australia Ltd ) at [19]-[20], I held: that the expression "affected policyholder" referred to a policy that was affected by the scheme, not to a holder who was affected by the scheme; and that the holders of policies that had been issued by the transferee company, or that had been issued by the transferor company but were not to be transferred under the scheme 
were not "affected policyholders".

In the present case, all of the direct insurance policies and all of the reinsurance policies of Westport are sought to be transferred to either SRI or SRCAU. It follows that all of Westport's policyholders are "affected policyholders". The policyholders of SRI and SRCAU, however, are not, and are therefore not required by s 17C(2)(c) to be provided with an approved summary of either scheme. The need for the dispensation

Westport seeks a dispensation because it is not able to identify all of its policyholders, and is therefore unable to comply with s 17C(2)(c).

There is an additional reason why a dispensation is sought. This additional reason applies to certain policyholders that Westport has been able to identify.

Section 17C(2)(c) requires that the approved summary be "given" to affected policyholders. Section 121 of the Act provides various ways in which a document may be "given" to a person for the purposes of the Act. In the case of a body corporate other than Lloyd's (being the society of that name incorporated by Lloyd's Act 1871 (UK)) that is not incorporated in Australia, s 121 provides that the document may be given by being left at, or by being sent by registered post to, the body corporate at its address for service notified to APRA. Where no such address has been notified to APRA, the Act appears to require that the document simply be "given" to the body corporate, as distinct from being posted to it at its last known address, without explanation as to how it is to be "given" to the foreign body corporate.

Re Insurance Australia Ltd involved the transfer of a portfolio of 72,500 compulsory third party motor accident insurance policies. I noted that, given the length of time since the expiration of the last period of insurance, it was unlikely that many further claims would be made. I considered that it would be "excessive" to require notice to be given to all 72,500 policyholders, and required that notice only be given to those policyholders in respect of whose policies there was a notified claim that was unsettled or was otherwise outstanding: see [26]-[27].
