<text>5 Since the delay in filing the application is short and the applicant was not assisted by a lawyer before the Federal Magistrates Court, the failure to file the application within the time limited by the Rules is sufficiently explained. The real questions are whether the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant reconsideration by an Appeal Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused ( D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc. [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 ; Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd v Williams [2003] FCAFC 217 ; (2003) 130 FCR 435 at 440 [19] ; and MZWRW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1665). In a case where the question of substantial injustice is to be assessed in the context of contended error by the primary court in addressing whether the Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error in relation to a claim of well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason (1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: see ss 65(1) and 36 (2)(a) of the Act ), error on the part of the primary court on the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is likely to give rise to injustice which satisfies the test. Although the two issues are separate, they are necessarily related and must be carefully balanced. The gravity of the consequences of error in the case of a refugee claim may prove to be very significant. The primary question in this application is whether the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court that the applicant's application for a show cause order was to be dismissed as disclosing no arguable case for the relief claimed, is attended with sufficient doubt so as to warrant consideration by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.</text>
