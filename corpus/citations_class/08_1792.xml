<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 564</tocase>
<text>2 The context in which I need to consider this matter is somewhat unusual. In September 2004 the ACCC accepted an undertaking of indefinite duration from Harbin under s 87B of the Act which amongst other things obliged Harbin to establish, maintain and have independently audited annually a compliance program which was to have specific regard to conduct that might breach Part V of the TP Act. The undertaking is, in several respects, more expansive in its terms than would be acceptable to a Court making orders under s 86C of the Act: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Paper Pty Ltd (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 564 at [55]-[56]. It has not been alleged that this undertaking has been breached. Nonetheless, a further probation order is being sought under s 86C.

3 My own view of the relief that is appropriate to be ordered is less burdensome than what is now sought by the ACCC (the amended application filed at the hearing responded to objections raised in Harbin's written submissions), but is more demanding than Harbin would concede.

4 I begin with an abbreviated version of the parties' Statement of Agreed Facts.</text>

<tocase>BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 167 ; (2004) 207 ALR 452</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/167.html</AustLII>
<text>18 I note in passing that there is a body of opinion in decisions of this Court which questions both whether there is legislative authority for the Court acting under s 86C of the TP Act to order a respondent to instruct an expert to audit a compliance program and to deliver to the ACCC audit reports: see BMW Australia Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 167 ; (2004) 207 ALR 452 at [42] - [52] ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 693 ; (2004) 207 ALR 329 at [50] ; or, if there be some other source of power so to do: see BMW Australia at [51]; whether it would ordinarily be appropriate to make such orders: see Visy Paper (No 2) at [56]. I share these doubts.

25 It is well accepted that an injunction is a discretionary remedy and will not be awarded as of course on proof of a contravention of the TP Act: BMW Australia at [35]-[36]. As the Full Court observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (2007) 161 FCR 513 at [111]:
 Many contraventions simply will not justify injunctive relief. We doubt whether unintentional misconduct in contravention of s 52 would lead to such relief. 
It is necessary for a claimant "to demonstrate that the injunction will serve a purpose": ibid; though it is unnecessary to that end to show that commission, continuance, or repetition of contravening conduct is threatened or apprehended: see s 80(4) and BMW Australia at [36].</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) ATPR 42-230</tocase>
<text>26 In the present matter the ACCC seeks to find justification for the grant of an injunction (albeit in appropriately limited terms that can be clearly understood and practically complied with: cf Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd (No 2) (2008) ATPR 42-230) in the following considerations (i) there is a need to prevent recurrence of contraventions given the inadequate procedures Harbin had in place at the time; (ii) inadequate investigations of the circumstances were made; (iii) Harbin has indicated it intends to continue to engage in two price advertising; (iv) Harbin has not provided documentary reassurance to the ACCC; and (v) the contravention occurred while Harbin had a compliance program in place.

27 For my own part, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate in the circumstances to sanction Harbin's single and unintentional contravention of the Act with the imposition of an injunction. If it be the case that Harbin needs further to be sensitised to the seriousness of breaching the TP Act and to be made more attentive to the purposes of its compliance program, this can be achieved by other more appropriate means which can be adapted to Harbin's particular circumstances, as I will indicate. Harbin has already demonstrated preparedness to change its procedures. I should add, I do not accept that its conduct after the contravention reflects so adversely upon it as to provide some justification for the award of injunctive relief.</text>

<text>28 Section 86C of the Act empowers the Court to make an order for corrective advertising: on which see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Telstra Corporation Ltd (2007) ATPR 42-207 at 48,428 where the purposes informing such an order are helpfully collected. One such purpose, I would note, is to "aid in the enforcement of the primary orders and the prevention of repetition of the contravening conduct": Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 1387 ; (1999) 95 FCR 114 at 133.</text>

<tocase>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840</tocase>
<text>29 It has been recognised on a number of occasions that this remedy can be a peculiarly apt one where the contravening conduct occurred in the course of a company's routine business advertising: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840 at 43,382. In such cases, particularly where no injunction is to be granted, a corrective advertising order can assist in making an advertiser "more assiduous in ensuring that it does not repeat the contravening conduct": Prouds Jewellers (No 2) at [13]. The making of such an order would, in my view, be salutary in the present matter.

30 I acknowledge that a considerable period has passed since the offending publication was made. While this may in a given instance be a factor telling against ordering corrective advertising, here it is not. Such an order, coupled with declaratory relief rather than an injunction, provides an appropriate coercive incentive to Harbin.

31 The form of corrective advertisement I will order to be published will be in the terms of that annexed to these reasons. With one necessary modification to reflect my refusal to award injunctive relief, it follows the form proposed by the ACCC.</text>
