<tocase>Cawthorn v Keira Constructions Pty Ltd (1994) 33 NSWLR 607</tocase>
<text>36 The power conferred on the Court by s 447A is broad. Its scope was foreshadowed in the Report of the Law Reform Commission of Australia on the General Insolvency Inquiry (ALRC) which led to the enactment of Pt 5.3A in July 1993. The ALRC recommended that the Court should have: 
 
 '... a broad power to make orders for the effective operation of the (voluntary administration) procedure.' 
 

See Cawthhorn v Keira Constructions Pty Ltd (1994) 33 NSWLR 607; Milankov Pty Ltd v Roycol Ltd (1994) 124 ALR 391; Re I &amp; J Foods Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 92 at 94; Hamilton v National Australia Bank Ltd (1996) 66 FCR 12.

38 In Cawthorn, Young J extended the life of a deed which had been terminated. In Re Madden (1996) 26 ACSR 10 at 15 his Honour said that the section was wide enough to allow the Court, in an appropriate case, to disregard the fact that an administration may have ceased because of a mistake in carrying out steps under Pt 5.3A. The court could extend the period for convening a meeting as though the administration were still in force.</text>

<tocase>Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2000/30.html</AustLII>
<text>39 In Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270, the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ acknowledged the width of the powers conferred by s 447A. Their Honours made the following general propositions about its operation: 
 
 1. Section 447A is not properly described as a general power standing apart from Pt 5.3A. It is an integral part of the legislative scheme for which that Part provides. In particular it can apply to alter timetables prescribed by other provisions of Pt 5.3A (at 281 [24]).
 2. The words of s 447A do not suggest that it cannot be used if, by operation of the provisions of Pt 5.3A , the administration of the relevant company has come to an end. The section deals with a 'particular company' and the operation of Pt 5.3A in relation to it (at 282 [26]).
 3. The words of the section 'how this Part is to operate' look to the future but do not preclude the making of orders with future effect but in respect of past matters or events ( at 282 [26]).
 4. In connection with the effect of an order under s 447A on accrued or vested rights, two types of case may arise following termination of an administration: 
 
 
 (i) Steps are taken by members or officers of the company or by third parties predicated upon termination of the administration other than by entering a deed of company arrangement or going into liquidation eg shares in the company are traded; directors resume the management of the company and deal with its assets or take other like steps on the assumption that the administration is at an end and there is neither a deed of company arrangement nor a winding up.
 (ii) Steps are taken that are predicated upon the company having validly entered a deed of company arrangement or gone into liquidation (at 283 [30]).
 
 

To the extent that any steps have been taken following the termination of the Deed in this case and the winding up resolution, they fall into the second category of case identified by the High Court. The court left open the question whether there is power to make an order under s 447A in the first case where the administration has ended (at 284 [32]). In the second kind of case however: 
 
 
 '... there would be no inconsistency between the varied operation of Pt 5.3A and the rights that have accrued in the intervening period, if the order gave legal validity to the premise for the parties' conduct.' 
 

It may be accepted that in this case there is a possibility, however small, that accrued rights may be affected by an order terminating the winding up, setting aside the termination of the Deed and giving effect to the proposed variation. Under that variation however, the Deed is to be terminated in any event after its conditions have been fulfilled. There is no suggestion of any third party dealings which could be adversely affected by the orders proposed. In any event, they can be accommodated by liberty to apply, limited in time, to vary the orders made to ensure the protection of any accrued right.

40 I am satisfied that I can set aside the termination of the Deed on the basis that the order operates prospectively. The order setting aside the termination will take effect so that the rights and obligations of all parties will be determined as though the Deed continued in effect from the meeting of creditors and had not been terminated. To the extent that there may be any particular direction necessary to take account of any rights or obligations that have accrued since the Deed was terminated, there will be liberty to apply within the next 28 days for a suitable qualifying order. Given that all creditors have been given notice and none has expressed an objection, I regard the probability of such an application as small, but nevertheless will allow such an application within that time.</text>

<tocase>Re Pasminco Ltd (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 470</tocase>
<text>41 As to the variation of the Deed there is no doubt that the Court has power to order a variation. The power of the Court to make such an order was considered by Finkelstein J in Re: Pasminco Ltd (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 470. In that case his Honour said (at [35]):
 
 'The Corporations Act contemplates that a deed of company arrangement may be varied by creditors at a meeting convened under s 445F. The administrators, however, wish to short cut this procedure and have the deed varied by an order made under s 447A. In Milankov Nominees Pty Ltd v Roycol Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 378, 388 Lee J suggested that this could be done. In two decisions in the following year Branson J expressly found the power to exist. The decisions are Re Giga Investments Pty Ltd (Admin Apptd) (No 2) (1995) 13 ACLC 1,185, 1,187 and Mulvaney v Rob Wintulich Pty Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 81, 83. Many cases have followed these decisions. On the basis of these authorities I am satisfied that the power to make variation exists.'

42 In my opinion in this case the variation order sought ought to be made. It appears on the face of it to offer some benefit to creditors. None object, and there is the possibility, although it does not seem great, that Messrs. Forrest and Richardson may be able to revive the company's fortunes. I will therefore make the variation order but in prospective terms rather than the apparently retrospective terms sought by the applicants.

43 For the preceding reasons I will terminate the winding up of Euco, set aside the termination of the Deed and direct that it be varied in accordance with the proposal submitted to the creditors' meeting of 24 March 2006. I will require notice to be given to all creditors of these orders and allow liberty to apply within 28 days for any variation of the order setting aside the termination of the Deed to the extent that it may impinge upon accrued rights.
 

 I certify that the preceding forty-three (43) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
