<tocase>Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947</tocase>
<text>47 The degree of annexation test looks to the manner in which the object is attached to the land. If the object is attached to the land, other than by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it forms part of the land. The greater the degree of annexation, the stronger the presumption. If on the other hand, the object is attached only by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is not part of the land, even if it has become embedded in the soil. In such a case the onus lies upon the person claiming that the object forms part of the land to prove that it was erected with the intention that it should become part of the land: Reid v Smith [1905] HCA 54 ; (1905) 3 CLR 656 at 668, 673-4, 675-6; Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 950-1. The courts will infer the degree of annexation from the surrounding circumstances including the nature of the object and the nature of the interest held in the land by the owner of the object. The test is objective, namely, what a reasonable person would consider to be the reason for attaching the object to the land.

70 Further the proper formulation of the test is not whether damages are an adequate remedy but whether it is just in all the circumstances that the plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in damages. The courts have recognised there may be cases in which it is unjust to confine a plaintiff to its remedy in damages because of, for example, the difficulty in estimating damages and damages which cannot be taken into monetary account such as loss of goodwill and trade reputation: Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 954-5, citing Evans Marshall &amp; Co Ltd v Bertola SA and Sherry Imports Ltd [1973] 1 WLR 349.</text>

<tocase>ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 527 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1991/527.html</AustLII>
<text>60 Section 39(3) is in the same terms as s 80(4) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1991] FCA 527 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248 Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) said at 256-7:
 Subsections (4) and (5) of s 80 are novel because they empower the court to grant injunctive relief notwithstanding that the defendant has not previously engaged in the prohibited conduct or does not intend to engage in it again or to continue to engage in it or there is no imminent danger of substantial damage. Yet these are the traditional requirements for equitable injunctive relief. . . . In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pts IV or V of the Act), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly. . . . This does not mean that the traditional equitable doctrines are irrelevant. For example, it must be relevant to consider questions of repetition of conduct or whether it has ever occurred before or whether imminent substantial damage is likely: but the absence of any one or more of these elements is not fatal to the grant of an injunction under s 80. That is the effect of subss (4) and (5) (subs (4) in relation to the prevention of conduct and subs (5) in relation to a mandatory injunction). Their presence is not an indication of a new statutory house, rather an old house with some modern extensions. 
Gummow J at 267 came to essentially the same conclusion.

61 Section 49(1) and (3) of the BCII Act empower the Court to grant injunctions (including interim injunctions) in relation to a person who has contravened a civil penalty provision. Subsection 49(6) defines an eligible person to make an application under s 49(1) and (3) to include a person affected by the contravention. The applicant is a person affected by the alleged contraventions. Section 38 is a civil penalty provision as defined in s 4. Thus, s 49(1) and s 49(3)(a) empower this Court on the present application, to make an interim injunction in relation to a person who has contravened s 38.</text>

<tocase>John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 144 IR 418</tocase>
<text>77 In John Holland Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (2005) 144 IR 418 the defendant submitted that because the industrial action had stopped the plaintiff needed to show that there was a "strong probability" that the defendants' conduct would be the cause of serious damage, the threat of injury was immediate and substantial, and damages would not be a sufficient or adequate remedy if the damage did occur. In rejecting that submission and granting an interlocutory injunction, Le Miere J said at [77]:
 The degree of probability of future injury is not an absolute standard. What is to be aimed at is justice between the parties, having regard to all the relevant circumstances: Hooper v Rogers at 50 per Russell LJ followed by the Full Federal Court in Magic Menu Systems Pty Ltd v AFA Facilitation Pty Ltd at 269-270. Provided that there is a real risk of wrongful conduct which would cause injury which is more than trivial, there may be no good reason to refuse quia timet relief . . .</text>

<tocase>Johns v R [1980] HCA 3 ; (1980) 143 CLR 108</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1980/3.html</AustLII>
<text>55 In Johns v R [1980] HCA 3 ; (1980) 143 CLR 108 Stephen J said at 121:
 "Probable" may bear a variety of meanings. As Lord Reid observed in delivering the judgement of the Board in The Wagon Mound (No. 2) (1967) 1 AC 617, at pp 634-635: 
 
 "It is used with various shades of meaning. Sometimes it appears to mean more probable than not, sometimes it appears to include events likely but not very likely to occur, sometimes it has a still wider meaning and refers to events the chance of which is anything more than a bare possibility."

56 In R v Thomson [1997] 1 Qd R 623 Fitzgerald P said at 627-8:
 "probable" is another word of variable import which takes its meaning from the context in which it is used . . . In Johns v. R [1980] HCA 3 ; (1980) 143 CLR 108 , Stephen J seemed to accept at 121 that "probable" might sometimes be satisfied by "anything more than a bare possibility"; while, as will be seen below, sometimes the degree of probability required must be "overwhelming"; however, the more usual debate is whether "probable" requires more than a "real or substantial possibility" . . . . To complete the circle, just as the meaning of "likely" is sometimes expressed by reference to what is "probable", the meaning of "probable" is sometimes related to whether an event or consequence is "more likely than not" . . . Sometimes "probable" and "likely" are treated as synonymous; sometimes "probable" is regarded as a stronger word than "likely"; and sometimes "likely" is regarded as a stronger word than "probable".

<tocase>Kestrel Coal Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] 1 Qd R 634</tocase>
<text>78 Similarly in United Group Infrastructure the Court granted interim injunctions notwithstanding that the employees had returned to work. Nicholson J said at [44] that he was particularly influenced by the judgment in Kestrel Coal Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] 1 Qd R 634 at [22] [30] particularly at [22], [28] and [30].

79 In Kestrel Coal Chesterman J said at [30]:
 This is not a case of idle threats. The defendants have in the past acted unlawfully in violation of the plaintiffs' rights. This factor makes the case different from those in which an injunction is sought because of conduct which is only apprehended. The principles applicable to quia timet injunctions are not entirely applicable. The fact that unlawful conduct has occurred makes the court more disposed towards ordering relief. See Dean and Chapter of Chester v Smelting Corporation Limited (1901) 85 LT 67 at 69 and Attorney-General v Beck [1980] 2 NSWLR 77 at 94 95.

80 This also is not a case of idle threats. The respondents have made good their threat to engage in a week of industrial action and, on 13 October, threatened further industrial action if the Demand is not met. Further, the respondents have shown a preparedness to engage in industrial action in contravention of the AIRC Order. In all the circumstances, and having regard to the main object of the BCII Act, it is just that the respondents should be restrained from engaging in further industrial action until the application can be heard or further order.
 

 I certify that the preceding eighty (80) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.

<tocase>United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399</tocase>
<text>22 Consideration of the main object is a relevant consideration to the construction and application of the provisions of the BCII Act: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25]; Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 at [50] - [51] .

66 While the power to grant an interim injunction under s 49(3) should be exercised having regard to the principles applied by a court of equity, the main object of the BCII Act is also relevant consideration in applying its provisions: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25].

67 In my view, the applicant has a strong prima facie case and the balance of convenience is all one way.

68 The effect on the applicant if there is further industrial action will be significant. The estimated wasted costs alone exceed $600,000 a week. There are further potential consequences of industrial action such as damage to the applicant's reputation and loss of production.

78 Similarly in United Group Infrastructure the Court granted interim injunctions notwithstanding that the employees had returned to work. Nicholson J said at [44] that he was particularly influenced by the judgment in Kestrel Coal Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2001] 1 Qd R 634 at [22] [30] particularly at [22], [28] and [30].</text>
