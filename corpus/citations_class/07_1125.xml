<text>1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the grant of a protection visa. Details of the appellant's application, the decision of the Tribunal, and the reasons of the Federal Magistrate are contained in the decision of the Federal Magistrate , SZJFL v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 421 , which is available on the internet.

2 The appellant is a 43 year old female citizen of the People's Republic of China. Her claim for a protection visa was based on what was said to be a well founded fear of persecution as a member of the Falun Gong.

3 The Tribunal asked her a number of questions probing her account of involvement with Falun Gong and her travels to and from China. After the hearing and before making its decision the Tribunal wrote to the appellant in accordance with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). In its letter the Tribunal outlined inconsistencies between the original protection visa application and the evidence provided at the hearing. There was no response from the appellant.</text>
