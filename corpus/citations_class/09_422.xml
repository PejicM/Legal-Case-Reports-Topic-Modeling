<text>Telstra opposed the tender of those paragraphs of the Lee Outline and the attachments, the subject of the grant of leave to use referred to in [41] above, on the ground that they were privileged, but fairly conceded that the weight of authority, in particular authority binding on me, was against its submission. The prevailing authority in this Court is in favour of the filing and service of an outline of evidence being a full waiver of privilege, such that the outline is then protected only by the implied undertaking to the Court not to use the document other than for the purpose of the proceeding without the leave of the Court: Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Limited (2005) 218 ALR 283 at [20] [23]; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [15] [19] per Gordon J; ACCC v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 678 at [122] [130] per Finn J; Australian Medi-Care Co Ltd v Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2008] FCA 976 at [15] per Lander J. Once leave is granted to use the document, the party seeking to do so is released from the implied undertaking and may use it accordingly.</text>

<tocase>Bennett v Chief Executive of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2004/237.html</AustLII>
<text>Senior counsel for Telstra submitted that there was no voluntary disclosure because the Rules (O 16 r 2(2)(b)) mandated the verification of the answers by affidavit; indeed, he submitted that the disclosure was made under compulsion of law and so fell within the exception specifically referred to in [63] above. He further submitted that he was not seeking to read Ms Paatsch's affidavit and that contrary to Optus' submission, he was not deploying an answer, based on privileged communications, 'for forensic or commercial purposes'; Bennett v Chief Executive of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at [68] per Gyles J.

On the other hand, I think there is a more fundamental response to Optus' submission that there has been a waiver of any privilege in the documents referred to in [62] above.

First, para 3 of Ms Paatsch's affidavit says no more than that Telstra's answers to the interrogatories are based on her review of relevant documents and enquiries of current and former employees of Telstra.</text>

<tocase>Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCAFC/2006/86.html</AustLII>
<text>Second, it may be accepted that implied waiver at common law will occur where: 
 [T]he privilege holder's conduct is inconsistent with the continued confidentiality of the communication because he or she has put in issue the character or contents of the communication in pursuing a right or claim, or has created a situation where another party must reasonably do so by way of a defence. 

 
 ( Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 at [54] )

Earlier, the same Full Court said at [52]: 
 These authorities show that, where issue or implied waiver is made out, the privilege holder has expressly or impliedly made an assertion about the contents of an otherwise privileged communication for the purpose of mounting a case or substantiating a defence. Where the privilege holder has put the contents of the otherwise privileged communication in issue, such an act can be regarded as inconsistent with the confidentiality that would otherwise pertain to the communication.

Third, nothing in Ms Paatsch's affidavit put the contents of an otherwise privileged communication in issue, in the sense of mounting a case or substantiating a defence. The contrast with Rio Tinto is exemplified by what the Full Court said at [71] and [72]: 
 [71] By his answers to Rio's requests, the Commissioner disclosed that the eight privileged scheduled documents were relevant to reaching his state of satisfaction and exercising his discretions. Although the validity of his state of satisfaction and the exercises of his discretion are key issues in the substantive proceeding, as indicated earlier, the mere acknowledgement of the relevance of privileged documents to the key issues does not amount to an act inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege. As we have seen, so far as the Commissioner was concerned the relevant inquiry was whether, having regard to the material before the decision-maker, the contested decisions were vitiated on Avon Downs grounds. If the particulars merely disclosed that the Commissioner took into account legal advice in reaching his state of satisfaction and exercising his discretions, then that disclosure would not be inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege. 

 
 [72] The Commissioner has not, however, simply said that the eight privileged scheduled communications were relevant to reaching his state of satisfaction or exercising his discretions. Nor has he said that he took them into account in so doing. We interpolate that a document may be relevant to a decision without evidencing any matter taken into consideration in the making of it (as, eg, an instrument conferring authority to make the decision). The Commissioner could have identified his bases for satisfaction and exercises of discretion by listing the matters he took into account in each case, but he did not do so. Instead, he identified his bases for satisfaction and exercises of discretion as the matters evidenced in the scheduled documents. In so doing, the Commissioner did more than make an assertion about the relevance of these communications . In his particulars, the Commissioner has said that he took into account the matters evidenced by numerous documents, including the eight privileged scheduled documents. In so doing, the Commissioner has made an assertion that puts the contents of these eight documents in issue, or necessarily lays them open to scrutiny, with the consequence that there is an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege.
 (Emphasis added.)

For these reasons, I am of the view that there was no waiver of any privilege in any documents of the kind referred to in [62] above. ISSUES 1 AND 2 
 Issue 1: What Information did Telstra use in the Preparation of the Market Share Reports?

The difficulty with determining this particular issue is that the only party which knew what information had been used in the preparation of the market share reports, Telstra, led no evidence on the matter. There was some 'evidence from the bar table' in the form of submissions but, apart from its answers to the interrogatories I gave Optus leave to administer, there is no direct evidence. There are documents in evidence which, arguably, enable one to draw inferences and conclusions as to what information might have been used, in particular, the market share reports and internal Telstra communications, but the element of uncertainty that attends that task, makes it a less than satisfactory course to take.</text>

<tocase>Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch 341</tocase>
<text>At the end of the day, senior counsel for Optus conceded that if there was no breach of contract, specifically cl 15 of the Access Agreement (as to which see [26] [31] below), neither of the alternative causes of action pleaded breach of confidence under general law principles and unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 51AA of the TPA had any 'legs'. I think this concession was correctly made. On the other hand, he said that if breach of contract is established, the equitable cause is still relevant to Optus' claim for an account of profits and that damages under s 82 of the TPA may be not the same as the claim for ' Hadley v Baxendale ' ((1854) 9 Exch 341) damages in contract, although it is difficult to see how Optus could do better in damages under s 82 of the TPA for contravention of s 51AA, than it could do on the contract claim.

So articulated and confined, the ultimate issue as pleaded has the following underlying issues, the answers to which will determine the answer to the ultimate issue: 
(1) What information did Telstra use in the preparation of the market share reports?
 
(2) If Telstra used Optus' traffic information in the preparation of the market share reports, was that the use of Confidential Information of Optus for the purposes of the Access Agreement?
 
(3) If the answer to issue 2. is 'yes', is Telstra's use of Optus' traffic information a permissible use of such information under the Access Agreement?
 
(4) If the answer to issue 2. is 'no', is Telstra's use of Optus' traffic information a permissible use of such information under the Access Agreement?
 
(5) Did the market share reports themselves contain Confidential Information of Optus for the purposes of the Access Agreement?
 
(6) If the answer to issue 5. is 'yes', is the use to which the market share reports are proven to be put a permissible use of such information under the Access Agreement?
 
(7) If the answer to issue 5. is 'no', is the use to which the market share reports are proven to be put a permissible use of such information under the Access Agreement?

In respect of all but the first underlying issue, there are two collateral issues to be addressed: 
(1) The proper construction of the relevant provisions of the Access Agreement; and
 
(2) the proper application of these provisions to the facts.</text>

<tocase>Lansing Linde Ltd v Kerr (1990) 21 IPR 529</tocase>
<text>Such information is 'of a confidential nature'. The law recognises the information of a business concerning its customers as an established category of confidential information which attracts the protection of the Courts at general law: see, e.g., Lansing Linde Ltd v Kerr (1990) 21 IPR 529 at 536 per Staughton LJ.

Second, provisions of the Access Agreement expressly provide that traffic information is subject to confidentiality restrictions on use and disclosure imposed by cl 15. Clauses 10.1 (obligations to provide information under the agreement are subject to the requirements of confidentiality imposed by cl 15), 10.4 (the parties must provide each other with certain traffic information), 10.7 (the information provided under the agreement may only be used for the purpose for which it was given) and 10.10 (establishing a limitation on the obligation to provide certain traffic information), as well as cl 15.1 itself; all make express provision.

Third, the evidence to be given by the witnesses would confirm that such traffic information is of a confidential nature, and was intended by the parties to be subject to the restrictions imposed by cl 15. Optus referred to the nature and context of the negotiations that led up to the entry into the Access Agreement, which was dealt with in evidence by Mr Petts. Optus also relied upon the fact that the traffic information is not released or disclosed by Optus other than pursuant to the provisions of the Access Agreement.</text>

<tocase>Lyall v Kennedy (1884) 27 CLD 1 </tocase>
<text>However, on the question of the sufficiency of an answer to an interrogatory, it was established 125 years ago that the whole of the affidavit in answer had to be referred to, not just the answer to a particular interrogatory: Lyall v Kennedy (1884) 27 CLD 1 at 15 per Cotton LJ.

In the present case, the interrogatory in para 1(e) relevantly read: 
 1A. Look at paragraphs 12(b), 16(a), 18(a), 22(a), 25(a), 28(a), 30(a) and 33(a) of the Defence to the Third Consolidated Amended Statement of Claim filed 5 March 2007 (' Defence' ) and answer the following in respect of each such paragraph: 

 
 ... 

 
(e) Were any of the Market Share Reports referred to in that paragraph used:
 
 
(i) for the purpose of marketing, including considering or developing strategy for marketing, products or services of Telstra to existing or prospective customers? Or
 
 
(ii) for the purpose of promotion, including considering or developing strategy for promotion, of products or services of Telstra to existing or prospective customers? Or
 
 
(iii) for the purpose of selling, including considering or developing strategy for selling, products or services of Telstra to existing or prospective customers?

The answer relevantly read: 
 1B. Having made enquiries of: 
 
 
 for the purposes of paragraphs 1B(a) to 1B(d) of the Interrogatories, current and former employees and contractors of the Respondent including those who have knowledge of Telstra's systems and processes; and
 
 
 for the purposes of paragraph 1B(e) of the Interrogatories, current and former employees of the Respondent including those who received Market Share Reports as defined in paragraph 10 of the Defence,
 
 
the Respondent, in respect of each of paragraphs 12(b), 16(a), 18(a), 22(a), 25(a), 28(a), 30(a) and 33(a) of the Defence, answer as follows:
 
 
...
 
 
(e) Yes.

The sufficiency of the answer to the interrogatory in para 3(e) has to be read in this context, that is, in the context of the answer to the interrogatory in para 1(e) and so read, there cannot be any doubt, in my mind, as to its sufficiency.

In determining whether a party should be required to make further answer to interrogatories the court considers whether the existing answer is sufficient and not whether it is truthful: Lyall v Kennedy at 21; McBride v Sandland [1917] SALR 249 at 262. The requirement of sufficiency is now embodied in O 16 r 8 of the Rules.</text>

<tocase>Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1959/23.html</AustLII>
<text>Interrogatories are a form of discovery. An affidavit verifying answers to interrogatories has the same status as an affidavit as to documents verifying discovery. The general rule in relation to such an affidavit is that it is conclusive unless it is self-evident that the discovery is insufficient: see Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341 at 343 per Menzies J.

That is not this case. I agree with Telstra's submission that the issue of the notice to produce was a 'backdoor' attempt to overcome the conclusiveness of Ms Paatsch's affidavit; in substance, an abuse of process and on that ground alone I set it aside, para 2 of the notice no longer being in issue.

While it was not material to my conclusion, I would add that contrary to the submission that was pressed on me by senior counsel for Optus, I am not persuaded that Ms Paatsch's verification of the answers to the interrogatories by affidavit in accordance with O 16 r 2(2)(b) of the Rules works some waiver, under s 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), of the privilege attaching to documents regarding or being the enquiries referred to by Ms Paatsch in paras 3(c) and (d) of her affidavit and communications between Ms Paatsch and any other person made for the purposes of responding to the interrogatories.

Under s 122 of the Evidence Act , privilege will be waived where the party concerned consented to the document being adduced, or if the party 'knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another the substance of the evidence'. Certain exceptions apply to the latter, including (but not limited to) if the disclosure was under compulsion of law (s 122(5)(a)(iii)).</text>
