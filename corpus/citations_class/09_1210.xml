<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255</tocase>
<text>Section 177C(1)(b) tells the taxpayer (and others) that a tax benefit in the form of a deduction has been obtained in connection with schematic arrangements if a deduction allowable to the taxpayer under the scheme, would not have been allowable (in whole or in part) if the scheme had not been struck or carried out, or on the second limb, might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable to the taxpayer, in the circumstances of the scheme as struck or carried out. Section 177C(1) thus requires the entire set of schematic arrangements to be set aside so that the postulate contemplated by s 177C(1)(b) might be considered. In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255, Sackville J at 278 made these observations concerning the operation of s 177C(1)(b): ... In determining whether Mr Lenzo obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme for the purposes of s 177C(1)(b), three things should be noted about the statutory formulation. First, the question posed by s 177C(1)(b) has to be answered on the assumption that the scheme had not been entered into or carried out. Section 177C, unlike for example s 177D, does not refer to "any part of the scheme". Thus the question, in order to be answered as s 177C(1)(b) requires, must be approached by assuming that the entire scheme found by the Court was not entered into or carried out: cf Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383-384, per curiam . It is not open to the taxpayer to point to what might reasonably be expected to have been done if only part of the scheme had not been entered into or carried out. In this case, for example, it is not open to Mr Lenzo to point to what could reasonably be expected to occur if the Loan Deed is ignored, by the remainder of the scheme is assumed to have continued in tact. 
 Secondly, s 177C(1)(b) applies where the deduction would not have been allowable or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. As the High Court observed in FCT v Peabody 181 CLR at 385: 
 
 
 [a] reasonable expectation requires more than a possibility. It involves a prediction as to events which would have taken place if the relevant scheme had not been entered into or carried out and the prediction must be sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable. 
 

 
 
 Thirdly, s 177C(1)(b) presents what might be described, perhaps loosely, as a question of characterisation. For the Court to conclude that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit in connection with a scheme, it must find that a deduction is allowable to a taxpayer in relation to a year of income in circumstances where the whole or part of "that deduction" would or might not have been allowable in the absence of the scheme. What does the expression "that deduction" mean? 
 

 If the expression means the very deduction claimed by the taxpayer, in the sense of a deduction for the precise liability incurred by reason of the taxpayer's participation in the impugned scheme, the Commissioner would have little difficulty in persuading the Court that the taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme. By hypothesis, if there were no scheme (assuming the incurring of the liability was a consequence of the scheme) the taxpayer simply could not have claimed the identical deduction. 
 If the expression "that deduction" has a wider meaning, it may be open to a taxpayer to satisfy the onus of showing the Commissioner's assessment is excessive by demonstrating that, had the scheme not been entered into or carried out, he or she would have or might reasonably be expected to have incurred a liability of the kind actually claimed as a deduction. For example, in WD &amp; HO Wills (Australia) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 65 FCR 298, the taxpayer argued that had it not entered into the scheme (involving payment of insurance premiums by it to a "captive" insurer), the taxpayer would have paid an equivalent sum in premiums to another insurer. On that hypothesis, even without the scheme, the whole of the deduction claimed by the taxpayer would have been an allowable deduction. The argument failed on the facts, but was accepted in principle: WD &amp; HO Wills (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 65 FCR at 329.

In that sense, the Tribunal did not formulate an incorrect test to be applied in deciding whether the kind of deduction claimed under the scheme would not have been allowable or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable to the taxpayer, absent the scheme. That test however necessarily involves an examination of the particular activity the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken in lieu of the scheme and whether the activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as that claimed by the taxpayer in the two tax years, under the scheme: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo per Sackville J at [128] and Heerey J at [38] to [41].

There was however no evidence before the Tribunal of that activity. What would or might the taxpayer have reasonably done absent the scheme? Would the taxpayer have paid all the amounts due under the contracts to the two brothers by making the contributions to the superannuation fund? The Tribunal thought not, because the characterisation of the payments involved fully deductible employment contributions by the taxpayer and the taxpayer had implemented the scheme, together with the Trail brothers, so as to enable the contractual payments to be varied and paid to the new Employee Welfare Fund to preserve the fully deductible character of those payments. It followed, in the Tribunal's view, that it was contrary to the interests of the taxpayer and each brother to engage in any activity that "did not allow for complete deductibility of all payments". It necessarily follows, having regard to that finding, that the taxpayer would not have made the pre-scheme contractual payments to the Employee Superannuation Scheme except to the extent of the age-limited deductible contributions.

What would the taxpayer have otherwise done or might reasonably be expected to have done in the circumstances absent the scheme? Might it have varied the agreements to negotiate new employment contracts containing particular terms which might have given rise to an allowable deduction of the kind claimed in the full amount claimed, and, if so, on what basis or by reference to what steps? The Commissioner says that it is not part of the s 177C(1)(b) test nor is it therefore relevant to consider the tax implications of the alternate postulate as this simply invites the substitution of a new "scheme" for the one required to be stripped away. The Commissioner also says that since the variation of the agreements is part of the scheme that must be stripped away in its entirety, it is not part of the test under s 177C(1)(b) nor is it relevant, to bring within any formulation of an alternate postulate, any variation of the agreements.

The matter is to be remitted to the Tribunal to determine the questions before it by applying the test so as to determine whether there is evidence which supports an hypothesis that the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme and whether that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the scheme consistently with the methodology identified in the authorities and in particular, Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255 at 278 [121] to [125] and [128]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404.</text>

The argument failed on the facts, but was accepted in principle: WD &amp; HO Wills (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 65 FCR at 329.

At [26], the Tribunal noted that in the absence of any variation to the contracts, the amounts that would have been deductible under s 82AAC of the Act as superannuation contributions were in 1997 $27,170.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $9,782.00 (Mr Allan Trail) and in 1998, $28,620.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $10,232.00 (Mr Allan Trail). At [27], the Tribunal noted that s 177C(1)(b) requires the making of an hypothesis as to what might reasonably be expected to have happened had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. The Tribunal noted the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 243 [66] that the enquiry directed by Part IVA requires comparison between the scheme in question and an alternative postulate. The Tribunal also noted that the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 determined that a reasonable expectation requires more than a possibility with the result that the prediction must be sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable.

<text>Sackville J concluded that s 177C(1)(b) should be given the wider interpretation that he discussed otherwise the words, "or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable", would seem to have no role to play. Sackville J noted that the wider view seems to be implicit in the approach adopted in FCT v Peabody ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 235 at 261-262 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404. In FCT v Spotless , the High Court in considering the obtaining of a tax benefit for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a), considered that the section identified an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer "more generally" than the taxpayer had contended for on the narrow basis.</text>

The first step is to isolate with clarity the particular activity that would or might reasonably be expected to have occurred. In undertaking that step it is relevant to have regard to the evidence of the taxpayer as to the steps it says it would have undertaken or would have been likely to undertake in the absence of the scheme: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404 at pp 423 and 424 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ. That subjective evidence of the individuals informing the guiding mind of the taxpayer is, of course, not in any sense determinative of the alternate postulate. However, that evidence, against the background of all the evidence, might assist in framing the nature of the activity the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken. Ultimately, the hypothesis is a prediction as to future events that would or might reasonably be expected to have been undertaken, and the Court, or the administrative decision-maker, must form its own objective view of that hypothesis and whether, against the background of all the evidence, a sufficiently reliable counterfactual can be identified for it to be regarded as reasonable.

The matter is to be remitted to the Tribunal to determine the questions before it by applying the test so as to determine whether there is evidence which supports an hypothesis that the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme and whether that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the scheme consistently with the methodology identified in the authorities and in particular, Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255 at 278 [121] to [125] and [128]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404.</text>

<tocase>Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154</tocase>
<text>Findings of fact are generally not susceptible of challenge unless the manner of their making gives rise to a question of law: Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCAFC 154. The question of whether the Tribunal has isolated the relevant legal test is plainly a question of law. The question of whether the Tribunal has applied a correctly identified test or in applying the test so identified, has in fact applied a different test, is a question of law. The question of whether facts found fall within the statute properly construed is generally regarded as a question of law: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi 65 ALD 141, Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ said this: 
 
 [34] The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law. Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. That is because, before the inference is drawn, there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a different conclusion. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the makings of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Even if the reasoning whereby the court reached its conclusions of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law. A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.</text>

The question of whether facts found fall within the statute properly construed is generally regarded as a question of law: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280. In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Miahi 65 ALD 141, Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ said this: 
 
 [34] The question whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law. Likewise, the question whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. That is because, before the inference is drawn, there is a preliminary question as to whether the evidence reasonably admits a different conclusion. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the makings of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, there is no error of law simply in making a wrong finding of fact. Even if the reasoning whereby the court reached its conclusions of fact were demonstrably unsound, that would not amount to an error of law. A party does not establish an error of law by showing that the decision-maker inferred the existence of a particular fact by a faulty process, for example by engaging in an illogical course of reasoning. Thus, at common law, want of logic is not synonymous with error of law. So long as the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.</text>

<tocase>Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163</tocase>
<text>In identifying whether the administrative decision-maker (in this case the Tribunal) has engaged in an error of law giving rise to a question of law , it is necessary to precisely identify the "nature and quality" of the error and the legal principle that attracts a particular legal consequence, that is, the "legal rubric under which a decision is challenged": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 per Gleeson CJ at [9]. The scope of that legal rubric is conventionally understood in terms of the well known passage from Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, adopted and applied in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 351 [82] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. As to misconceptions which might suggest an unsupportable supposition on the part of the decision-maker, see Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1949) 78 CLR 353 at 360 per Dixon J and R v Australian Stevedoring Industry Board; Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co. Pty Ltd (1953) 88 CLR 100 at 120 per Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ. As to the constraints upon a court interfering with a decision-maker's assessment of the evidence in exercising supervisory review of administrative decision-making, see Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35-36 per Brennan J. At common law, want of logic, is not synonymous with error of law: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 per Mason CJ at 356 with whom Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed. As to inferences, Mason CJ said this at 356 in Bond : 
 
 So long as there is some basis for an inference in other words, the particular inference is reasonably open, even if that inference appears to have been drawn as a result of illogical reasoning, there is no place for judicial review because no error of law has taken place.

<tocase>Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762</tocase>
<text>As to these questions and the broader framework of whether an administrative decision-maker has fallen into error of law see Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762, per Greenwood J at [96] to [99], per French J agreeing, at [3] and Weinberg J agreeing at [41].

It follows therefore that if the Tribunal takes an irrelevant consideration into account in reaching its decision, it has engaged in an error of law and the question of whether the Tribunal has taken an irrelevant consideration into account raises a question of law. It also follows that a question of whether the Tribunal has reached a finding unsupported by any evidence, raises a question of law. A contention that inferences have been drawn from facts in circumstances where those inferences are not reasonably open, also raises a question of law. Considerations

The position in relation to the resolution of the present application seems to me to be this.</text>

<tocase>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404</tocase>
<text>Sackville J concluded that s 177C(1)(b) should be given the wider interpretation that he discussed otherwise the words, "or might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable", would seem to have no role to play. Sackville J noted that the wider view seems to be implicit in the approach adopted in FCT v Peabody ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd (2001) 207 CLR 235 at 261-262 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404. In FCT v Spotless , the High Court in considering the obtaining of a tax benefit for the purposes of s 177C(1)(a), considered that the section identified an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer "more generally" than the taxpayer had contended for on the narrow basis.

The first step is to isolate with clarity the particular activity that would or might reasonably be expected to have occurred. In undertaking that step it is relevant to have regard to the evidence of the taxpayer as to the steps it says it would have undertaken or would have been likely to undertake in the absence of the scheme: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404 at pp 423 and 424 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ. That subjective evidence of the individuals informing the guiding mind of the taxpayer is, of course, not in any sense determinative of the alternate postulate. However, that evidence, against the background of all the evidence, might assist in framing the nature of the activity the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken. Ultimately, the hypothesis is a prediction as to future events that would or might reasonably be expected to have been undertaken, and the Court, or the administrative decision-maker, must form its own objective view of that hypothesis and whether, against the background of all the evidence, a sufficiently reliable counterfactual can be identified for it to be regarded as reasonable.

The matter is to be remitted to the Tribunal to determine the questions before it by applying the test so as to determine whether there is evidence which supports an hypothesis that the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme and whether that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the scheme consistently with the methodology identified in the authorities and in particular, Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255 at 278 [121] to [125] and [128]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404.</text>
