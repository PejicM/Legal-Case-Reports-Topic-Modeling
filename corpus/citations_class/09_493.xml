<tocase>Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/728.html</AustLII>
<text>Weinberg J in Ace Contractors &amp; Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 at [44] summarised the authorities governing the operation of s 459C of the Act. The summary included these propositions: The respondent is presumed to be insolvent and as such bears the onus of proving its solvency: s 459C(2) and (3); Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 235 ; Commissioner of Taxation v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477. 
 In order to discharge that onus the Court should ordinarily be presented with the "fullest and best" evidence of the financial position of the respondent: Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia (1993) 11 ACLC 1075 at 1081.
 Unaudited accounts and unverified claims of ownership or valuation are not ordinarily probative of solvency. Nor are bald assertions of solvency arising from a general review of the accounts, even if made by qualified accountants who have detailed knowledge of how those accounts were prepared: Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (supra); Re Citic Commodity Trading Pty Ltd v JBL Enterprises (WA) Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 232 ; Leslie v Howship Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 459 at 463.</text>

<tocase>ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 </tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2006/1702.html</AustLII>
<text>Lanepoint was subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to a floating charge: s 459C(2)(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"). Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") has applied to wind up Lanepoint on the basis of this presumption. This discharges ASIC's obligation to demonstrate a prima facie case that Lanepoint is insolvent and therefore meets the condition for the grant of leave under s 459P(3) of the Act: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3 ) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] .</text>

<tocase>Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 86 ; (1993) 10 ACSR 483</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1993/86.html</AustLII>
<text>Accordingly, Lanepoint submits that there is a genuine dispute as to the amount of its indebtedness to WIF. In an appropriate case the Court may exercise its discretion to determine such a dispute rather than to stay the winding-up application to await the curial resolution of the dispute: Ocean City Ltd v Southern Oceanic Hotels Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 86 ; (1993) 10 ACSR 483 at 486-487.

A great deal of evidence was adduced in this respect including detailed cross-examination of, amongst others, Mr Carey, Ms Karen Carey and Mr Gregory Nairn, a former senior Lanepoint executive. No suggestion was made that there was other relevant evidence available going to the resolution of this question. If such an alleged dispute is raised and can be resolved during such an application then in my opinion it ought to be. It would only add to the costs of the parties as well as to the public to put it off.

Lanepoint submits that the affidavit of ASIC's expert, Mr Honey, sworn on 27 October 2006 confirms the following: 
 (i) The work in progress on the Regency Motel redevelopment was, as at 31 January 2006, about $7 million. That work in progress is also estimated by Ernst &amp; Young at $6,544,235 according to the affidavit of Mr Fraser, one of Lanepoint's receivers, sworn on 11 March 2008, based on information provided but that the Receiver and Managers were not able to determine the final quantum of renovation costs." 

 
 (ii) In relation to liabilities as at 31 January 2006, the Suncorp Metway loan stood at $4,855,000 and WIF at $2,267,000. 

 
 (iii) There were intercompany loans to Westpoint, Keypoint and Keyworld at $864,000 but there were other sources of finance of some $700,000</text>

<tocase>Powell v Fryer (2000) 18 ACLC 480 </tocase>
<text>The commercial solvency of a company is not proved by merely looking at its accounts and making a mechanical comparison of its assets and liabilities. Insolvency is a question of fact falling to be decided as a matter of commercial reality in light of all the circumstances with things being viewed as it would be by someone operating in a practical business environment: Powell v Fryer (2000) 18 ACLC 480 at [9].

The background is uncontroversial and the following is taken substantially from ASIC's closing submissions. Lanepoint redeveloped the Regency Motel site on Great Eastern Highway, Rivervale in Western Australia. This was financed, in part, by secured funds obtained from Suncorp Metway Limited and Westpoint Management Pty Ltd as responsible entity for the Westpoint Income Fund ("WIF"). Westpoint Management was a related or associated company within the Westpoint Group and WIF was a managed investment scheme, which raised funds from the public for use in relation to Westpoint Group projects.

The first stage of the Regency Motel redevelopment was undertaken for Lanepoint by Westpoint Constructions Pty Ltd. As a result of the redevelopment 40 strata title lots were almost completed for sale and one lot was left vacant for the second stage. Adjacent to the redeveloped property are three lots, which were proposed for the third stage.</text>
